All Democrats on the committee, along with Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and gang of eight Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), voted in favor of the bill, which will now go to the Senate floor. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who voted against the bill out of committee, said he would support allowing it to move forward for debate -- rather than joining a filibuster -- once on the Senate floor. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who was also a ""no"" vote, said if it had been between his vote and moving the bill to the Senate floor, he would have voted in favor. The crowd in the room erupted into applause when the final vote tally was read, rising to their feet and chanting ""Yes we can!"" then ""Si se puede!"" Democrats seemed equally pleased to vote the bill out of committee. ""The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform,"" Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said before the bill's passage. ""I hope that our history, our values, and our decency can inspire us finally to take action. We need an immigration system that lives up to American values and helps write the next great chapter in American history by reinvigorating our economy and enriching our communities.""Of 300 amendments offered to the gang of eight immigration bill, the committee debated more than 200.The bill came out of months of work from the gang of eight, which in addition to Graham and Flake includes Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.). It includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a streamlined legal immigration process, tougher interior enforcement and increased border security. One of the final issues to settle was over high-skilled worker visas called H1-Bs. An amendment that simplifies the process for companies to bring in workers in science, technology, engineering and math eventually passed on a voice vote. Hatch and Schumer came to a compromise that led Hatch to agree to vote the full bill out of committee, although he did not commit to supporting its eventual passage. It was a tough vote for Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who has previously been wary of expanding H1-B visas. He voted in favor, however, citing the need for compromise and to get the bill through. ""We've made concessions I never thought we'd have to make ... but we've made those concessions to win your support,"" Durbin said to Hatch. ""We need your support, and we want to pass this bill.""The amendment came under fire from the AFL-CIO labor federation, which said the measure would hurt American workers.""There is no reason why this strong coalition should accept anti-worker amendments,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ""And let's be clear: Senator Orrin Hatch's H-1B amendments are unambiguous attacks on American workers."" Some measures praised highly by immigrant rights advocates never went to a vote. Leahy brought up his amendment to allow LGBT couples equal protection under immigration law, but withdrew it ""with a heavy heart"" when it became clear Democrats were willing to drop it so the bill would pass.A number of provisions lauded by advocates did make it in. The committee voted on Monday to approve Blumenthal's amendment that would block immigration raids in sensitive areas such as schools, hospitals and places of worship, except in extreme circumstances. A separate Blumenthal measure to restrict the use of solitary confinement in immigrant detention also passed on Monday, also on a voice vote. Although many Republican amendments failed, some GOP senators, such as Hatch, were more successful than others. The committee voted on Monday to require a mandatory biometric exit system at airports with the highest volume of international air travel -- something Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) wanted to do nationwide but without success. Amendments deemed poison pills failed, unsurprisingly. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) attempted to add a change that would strip the bill of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which is considered absolutely necessary to the bill by President Barack Obama, Democrats and some Republicans. Five Republicans voted for that amendment, while three -- Hatch, Graham and Flake -- joined Democrats in opposing it. Leahy said the amendment would gut the bill, while Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said ""it goes against everything America stands for."" Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) similarly disparaged another failed Cruz amendment, this one to bar currently undocumented immigrants from ever being eligible for welfare benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps, saying he doesn't think such an America is one he'd want to live in. Sessions was also unsuccessful in his efforts to amend the bill, offering 49 amendments and seeing nearly every one that went for a vote fail. On one amendment last week Sessions was the sole ""yes"" vote, with all of his Republican colleagues abandoning him in his effort to limit legal immigration. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) was one of the rare Democrats to offer an amendment that the gang of eight took down. Schumer and Durbin told her they had to reluctantly oppose her attempt on Tuesday to add a change that would expand family visas so that people in extreme hardship could petition for green cards for their adult children or siblings. It failed with 7 votes in support and 11 against, including Democrats Schumer, Durbin, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), all of whom said it was a good amendment but would upset the delicate balance of the gang of eight bill. ""Your heart's in the right place, your amendment's in the wrong place,"" Durbin said to Hirono.President Barack Obama applauded the committee for passing the bill.""None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I, but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line,"" he said in a statement. ""I encourage the full Senate to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor at the earliest possible opportunity and remain hopeful that the amendment process will lead to further improvements.""Now that the bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee, it has to go to the Senate floor, where gang of eight members are hopeful it will pass. Schumer and McCain, who is not on the Judiciary Committee, have said they would like to win over a majority of both parties -- around 70 votes in total."

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back Tuesday against calls to put out more information on the committee's investigation into the controversy, sparked after a Treasury Department Inspector General report revealed the IRS had singled out tea party groups applying for nonprofit status for extra scrutiny. Responding specifically to criticism from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democratic member of the committee, Issa said that releasing full interviews conducted with IRS employees would hurt the ongoing investigation. ""Your decision to publicly announce that the investigation should wrap up was irresponsible, but not surprising,"" said Issa, in a letter to Cummings. ""However, your push to release entire transcripts from witness interviews while the investigation remains active was reckless and threatened to undermine the integrity of the Committee’s investigation.""The position is a tenuous one for Issa, who during an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" just over a week ago promised that the full transcripts would be released. On that same program, Issa revealed several partial transcripts that suggested the directive to screen tea party groups came from officials in Washington. Since then, The Huffington Post has sent four emails asking Issa's office when the full transcripts would be made public. Not one was returned. When asked why Issa's release of a partial transcript was fine but he opposed releasing the transcripts in full, a spokesman for the congressman referred HuffPost to another statement.“Limited releases of testimony may also serve to empower other witnesses to become whistleblowers and serve to vindicate individuals who have been subjected to criticism or retaliation at the hands of their managers,"" said Issa, in that statement. ""On the other hand, if a full transcript were released, it would serve as a roadmap of the Committee’s investigation.""It could take weeks, if not months, to see the full transcripts should the committee wait to release them until the investigation is completed. According to a Democratic aide on the committee, investigators have interviewed five IRS employees so far and have 18 more to go. In addition, investigators are hoping to look through hundred of thousands of documents that could shed light on the tax agency's controversial screening practices.Unwilling to allow the partial transcripts Issa released to be the only evidence in the public record, Cummings this week also released segments of interviews. In a Sunday memo to his colleagues on the oversight committee, the congressman said that a manager in the IRS Cincinnati office who oversaw the nonprofit screening said that no one in Washington ordered him to employ the practice of targeting tea party groups.""Although the Committee interviewed a self-identified ‘conservative Republican’ who denied any White House involvement or any political motivation for screening Tea Party cases, Chairman Issa now appears to be going back on his promise to release the full interview transcripts of IRS employees,"" said Cummings, in a statement. ""Chairman Issa changes his mind so fast that even when I agree with him, we’re not on the same page. I fully support responsible oversight, but cherry picking transcript excerpts to fuel partisan and unsubstantiated claims is not a credible or effective way to investigate.""On Tuesday, an aide to Cummings said the congressman would release the full transcripts of the already completed interviews by the end of the week, if Issa did not do so himself -- though the aide also cautioned that those plans could change. The squabbling between the chairman and ranking member of the oversight committee has made the conversation surrounding the scandal far more contentious. When news first broke that the IRS had targeted conservative groups, there was near bipartisan condemnation of the agency.Over time, however, politics has entered the debate, and Issa's handling of the committee's investigation has been criticized as a poorly disguised attempt to tie the issue to the president. When Issa called White House Press Secretary Jay Carney a ""paid liar"" earlier this month, he was criticized publicly by Democrats and privately by his own party. More recently, Republicans have been more open in their concerns about where the investigation is heading. As Politico reported on Tuesday:Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana, a senior Ways and Means Republican who chairs the panel’s Oversight subcommittee, criticized Issa’s tactics, saying the release of partial transcripts could “adversely alter our ability to get future information from other IRS employees.”“Just simply from a process standpoint, you don’t want to do that and alter what others might say,” Boustany told POLITICO. “I really am concerned that it could tip this into the political realm rather than a true detailed investigation to get the facts out.”He added: “A lot of this has to be done quietly, obviously, as we piece together what has happened, and once we piece it together and get the firm proof, then you can come out” and say what happened.DISCLOSURE: This reporter's spouse works for the White House Counsel's Office on congressional oversight, but not on matters pertaining to the IRS."

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) suggested Sunday that the IRS' targeting of conservative groups during the 2012 presidential campaign undermines the election's credibility, accusing President Barack Obama's administration of ""blatantly lying to the American people"" and questioning whether the agency would ""deny"" health care coverage for conservatives.“We learned that during an election, [Obama] interfered with the First Amendment rights of conservatives and tea party members by intimidating and harassing these organizations,” Bachmann, who unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, said in an interview with conservative website World Net Daily. “Once again, it appears the Obama administration is blatantly lying to the American people... People can right ask questions [about] the credibility of the elections.""On Friday, the IRS admitted to engaging in ""inappropriate"" targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election. Agents singled out groups with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status, as well as organizations that took issue with ""how the country is being run."" Bachmann said agency claims that no high-level officials were involved with developing the criteria for extra scrutiny are ""laughable."" “The Obama administration wants us to believe low-level functionaries are the ones responsible for making this decision,” she said. “That is impossible, laughable. I can tell you within the IRS, the agency is very sensitive of jurisdictional authority."" The Republican congresswoman pointed to the IRS' role in the implementation of Obama's signature health care reform law as another potential area for concern, claiming that it is ""reasonable"" to ask whether the agency will ""will deny or delay access to health care"" for conservatives. ""We learned to our horror in Benghazi it appears that every move that was made was based on politics,"" she said. “Now it appears the president was willing to use the most feared agency in the U.S. for his own political purposes."" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) also tied the IRS scandal to the Affordable Care Act. ""[Obama] has a huge problem, because Obamacare relies very heavily on the IRS,"" Gingrich said during a Monday appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

""[W]e are frustrated that there was not a bipartisan immigration reform bill introduced prior to the August recess,"" reads the letter from 39 members of the New Democrat Coalition, a 53-member group, including co-chairmen Reps. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.).""Therefore, we write to inform you that if a bipartisan immigration reform package is not introduced in the House of Representatives -- one that includes a pathway to citizenship, helps grow American jobs, and fixes our immigration system once and for all -- by September 30th, we as New Democrats will consider introducing a comprehensive immigration reform bill,"" the letter continues. Read the letter here.Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has said he will not bring up any immigration bill -- particularly the one that passed the Senate in June -- unless a majority of House Republicans support it. Democrats and pro-reform activists think they could get the 218 votes needed for passage of comprehensive immigration reform, if Boehner would allow for a vote, by keeping most Democrats and winning over some Republicans. Members of Congress leave town Friday for the August recess, a month-long break during which they will hear from constituents. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking closer to primaries and the 2014 election year. Democrats have said immigration reform should include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but many Republicans have said it's a no-go. Instead, House Republicans are pursuing a number of smaller bills, such as border security legislation. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) are working on a bill to legalize undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children, but there aren't GOP-led efforts to deal with their parents. A seven-member bipartisan group in the House is working on comprehensive legislation with a path to citizenship, though it has not yet come to a final agreement on legislative language.The New Democrat Coalition letter says Boehner ""can rely on"" its members for support if he brings up a bill with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.“We have the support of the American people,"" it concludes. ""We hope we can count on your support."""

""You have to spend a majority of your money on social welfare and a minority of your resources on political activity.""Rove, a career political strategist, raised hundreds of millions of dollars during the 2012 election and spent them on political advertisements designed to influence the presidential and congressional races. Rove's Crossroads GPS is one of hundreds of essentially political organizations that receive tax-exempt status designed for ""social welfare"" groups.While many have called for reforms to the law allowing such groups to receive tax breaks, Rove insisted that the exemption is justified, and that organizations that support the Democratic Party have been working the statute longer.""What happened is the Democrats had this for decades, for literally decades, and no criticism at all. Then Republicans began in 2010 to say, wait a minute, if it's good enough for them, we'll duplicate that structure as well. Then suddenly we get what we get, which is a huge bunch of activity aimed at conservative groups.""The Bush administration probed the NAACP's tax-exempt status between 2004 and 2006, and ultimately allowed the group to maintain its classification.Rove's organizations do not provide the counseling, legal assistance and other support functions that the NAACP provides on civil rights.Federal agencies frequently target smaller players who may be abusing the system to avoid lengthy legal battles with more prominent companies or organizations. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) on Sunday criticized the IRS for targeting small Tea Party groups while allowing bigger fish, like Rove's Crossroads GPS, to pass through with little scrutiny.  ""It's outrageous that the IRS went after these small tea party groups when Karl Rove is out there saying that he wants to use these groups to change the outcome of the election,"" Sen.

Whatever value there is in judging a politician's standings in late December, it's limited. In today's hyper-kinetic Washington politics, conventional wisdom changes -- and quickly. And yet, in talking with operatives, Capitol Hill aides, Washington observers, and others, one impression is more permanent than any other: President Barack Obama had a really bad, tough-to-spin 2013.It was, as conceded by David Axelrod, the president's longtime adviser, a ""crappy year.""It's not just the poor rollout of the Affordable Care Act. To review: Obama worked Congress hard on gun control measures. It failed. He was hands-off with Congress on immigration reform. It failed. He pushed to avert sequestration cuts. They were enacted. He argued for unemployment benefits to be extended. They weren't. Revelations of aggressive investigations into national security leaks led to a review of Justice Department activities. Revelations that the IRS had screened tea party groups led to a reworking of the tax agency's practices. Revelations of the National Security Agency's broad surveillance programs, endorsed by Obama, led to popular revulsion, a court rebuke, another review, and likely reforms. That a government shutdown gave the president one of his better moments says something about the year. Shortly after the October standoff was resolved, with polls showing a majority blamed Republicans, the anti-Obama dam broke. The ACA rollout was a disaster, and a signature promise of the program that Obama made himself was proven hollow. At his year-end press conference Friday, Obama declined to call it the worst year of his presidency.""I have now been in office five years, close to five years, was running for president for two years before that, and for those who've covered me during that time, we have had ups and we have had downs,"" he said. ""I think this room has probably recorded at least 15 near-death experiences.""  As proof that his rumored demise may be premature, Obama noted recent legislative activity and the prospect of a continued thaw. Obama's defenders, meanwhile, argued that some 2013 setbacks should be placed in context. The IRS ""scandal"" lost fizz when it became clear that the agency had screened progressive groups, too. Sequestration relief was passed during the year-end budget deal. Even the stalled immigration reform effort has an upside. ""We actually aren’t quite as gloomy about this year,"" said Matt Bennett, senior vice president for public affairs and a co-founder of the centrist-Democratic group Third Way. ""Yes, the ACA rollout was very rocky. But if they get their act fully together on that, he may be in for a more productive year in 2014 than many expect. He got a really good immigration bill out of the Senate, and there is hope in the House once the primary filing deadlines pass. ... We actually made some headway on gun safety -- getting a vote on final passage and a handful of Republicans is nothing to sneeze at. So we see a few green shoots. Of course, we don’t yet know if they are flowers or weeds.""But even when taking those green shoots into account, it's impossible to argue that Obama has been on a course he's enjoyed. The charts don't lie. The more pertinent question (one whose answer has implications for the years ahead) is whether to blame personal missteps and mismanagement, or unforeseen events and structural problems with the political system? For Axelrod, the president and his team aren't entirely blameless. Part of the damage was ""self-inflicted,"" including the ""atrocious rollout of the health care website,"" he said. But broader issues outside of Obama's control were more determinative. ""The fact is you start out wanting to talk about and work on one set of issues and then events drag you to other places,"" Axelrod said, pointing to the Newtown shootings and Syrian civil war as examples. ""That is really the story of this year. ... A lot of it has to do with random events and orchestrated subversion on the part of the opposition.""Certainly, there were moments during the year when the president was forced off of his agenda. White House officials had planned a big jobs-related legislative push in January, for example, before the docket was overwhelmed by gun control. Other Democrats argued that the kinks of the political system did Obama in, with Republicans rewarded above all else for obstinacy. ""No White House is perfect and everyone makes mistakes, but I do think the structural problems overwhelmed everything else because it just became apparent that nothing could happen,"" said Bennett. ""The degree of dysfunction was historic. ... He could have been Lincoln in 1863 and he wouldn't have been able to do anything."" But Republican obstruction isn't exactly new. Nor is the notion that the news cycle is unwieldy and difficult to control. Other Democrats were sympathetic to the president, but more inclined to say that Obama and his team were responsible for the mess. Mike Lux, who served as Obama's liaison to the progressive community during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the administration since, argued that self-assuredness played a damaging role, preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon. When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination, the advice was heard, but not necessarily heeded. ""I feel like the White House goes it alone too much,"" said Lux. ""In advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem, it doesn't seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion in the party and with progressive allies."" A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: ""These guys are stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn't smell, that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt them.""As for policy, insularity has become the enemy of originality, Lux argued. That's led to an administration too comfortable with conventional wisdom. The president didn't challenge the intelligence community over the surveillance programs, and he made back room deals that complicated the health care law unnecessarily. What's ironic, others said, is that Obama is more comfortable as president now than at any point since he was elected. Drew Westen, a professor at Emory University, famously criticized Obama in 2011 on the op-ed pages of The New York Times for acquiescing too much to his opponents and for uninspiring oratory. Today, Westen praises Obama for increasingly relying on executive actions. If he were to grade Obama, he said he'd give him higher marks than ""in all his prior years."" Where Obama's administration has been tripped up, he argued, has been in a failure to elevate issues and messages that matter. ""There were people like me who at the end of 2009 were saying, 'You have got to start messaging in a coherent way about not only health care, but about what you are going to do about jobs and reigning in the power of banks, protecting consumers against predatory lending and credit practices that the average person was furious about,'"" said Westen ""That stuff was all clearly predictable by the end of 2009. Where I would fault him now is that I think he is doing the same thing again before this midterm election.""A request for comment from the White House was not returned. But it seems clear already that Obama and his team see value in Westen's point. In recent weeks, the administration has begun focusing on income inequality, wage stagnation and the need to spur job growth. Aides stressed that one of the first orders of business in 2014 will be getting unemployment insurance renewed. ""The core issue of the 2012 campaign was strengthening economic security for the middle class,"" said one former White House official. ""The question is whether putting every other issue on the back burner and focusing on that out of the gate would have changed the outcomes. My answer: maybe not significantly, but somewhat."" And then there is the Occam's razor view of what went wrong. Had the Affordable Care Act's rollout not been so badly botched, the year-end retrospective would have been kinder. Howard Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Vermont governor, argued as much when asked for his assessment. Every president who wins a second term suffers setbacks during his fifth year in office, Dean noted. And in all cases, the problems confronting Obama had to do either with a policy that he pushed or a personal decision that he made. ""It wasn't a policy issue, it was a digital problem,"" Dean said. ""He is in trouble because of the website.""And for that reason, there is hope for a bounce in 2014. ""I would argue that if he didn't have the website collapse, he wouldn't be subjected to the five-year curse as much,"" said Dean. ""All the other five-year curses were of the sitting president's own making. This one you may argue that three people down the line screwed up the website, not Obama. ... I do not think that he has been personally stained the way the other presidents were.""  "

Why is there more anger, vituperation, and political polarization now than even during Joe McCarthy's anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s, the tempestuous struggle for civil rights in the 1960s, the divisive Vietnam war, or the Watergate scandal?If anything, you'd think this would be an era of relative calm. The Soviet Union has disappeared and the Cold War is over. The Civil Rights struggle continues, but at least we now have a black middle class and even a black president. While the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been controversial, the all-volunteer army means young Americans aren't being dragged off to war against their will. And although politicians continue to generate scandals, the transgressions don't threaten the integrity of our government as did Watergate. And yet, by almost every measure, Americans are angrier today. They're more contemptuous of almost every major institution -- government, business, the media. They're more convinced the nation is on the wrong track. And they are far more polarized.Political scientists say the gap between the median Republican voter and the median Democrat is wider today on a whole host of issues than it's been since the 1920s.Undoubedly, social media play a part -- allowing people to pop off without bearing much responsibility for what they say. And most of us can cocoon within virtual or real communities whose members confirm all our biases and assumptions. Meanwhile, cable news and yell radio compete for viewers and listeners by being ever more strident. Not long ago I debated a Republican economic advisor on a cable TV program. During the brief station-break, the show's producer told me to ""be angrier."" I told her I didn't want to be angrier. ""You have to,"" she said. ""Viewers are surfing through hundreds of channels and will stop for a gladiator contest.""Within this cacophony, we've lost trusted arbiters of truth -- the Edward Murrows and Walter Cronkites who could explain what was happening in ways most Americans found convincing.We've also lost most living memory of an era in which we were all in it together -- the Great Depression and World War II -- when we succeeded or failed together. In those years we were palpably dependent on one another, and understood how much we owed each other as members of the same society.But I think the deeper explanation for what has happened has economic roots. From the end of World War II through the late 1970s, the economy doubled in size -- as did almost everyone's income. Almost all Americans grew together. In fact, those in the bottom fifth of the income ladder saw their incomes more than double. Americans experienced upward mobility on a grand scale.Yet for the last three and a half decades, the middle class has been losing ground. The median wage of male workers is now lower than it was in 1980, adjusted for inflation.In addition, all the mechanisms we've used over the last three decades to minimize the effects of this descent -- young mothers streaming into paid work in the late 1970s and 1980s, everyone working longer hours in the 1990s, and then borrowing against the rising values of our homes -- are now exhausted. And wages are still dropping -- the median is now 4 percent below what it was at the start of the so-called recovery.Meanwhile, income, wealth, and power have become more concentrated at the top than they've been in ninety years.As a result, many have come to believe that the deck is stacked against them. Importantly, both the Tea Party and the Occupier movements began with the bailouts of Wall Street -- when both groups concluded that big government and big finance had plotted against the rest of us. The former blamed government; the latter blamed Wall Street.Political scientists have also discovered a high correlationbetween inequality and political divisiveness.The last time America was this bitterly divided was in the 1920s, which was the last time income, wealth, and power were this concentrated.When average people feel the game is rigged, they get angry. And that anger can easily find its way into deep resentments -- of the poor, of blacks, of immigrants, of unions, of the well-educated, of government. This shouldn't be surprising. Demagogues throughout history have used anger to target scapegoats -- thereby dividing and conquering, and distracting people from the real sources of their frustrations.Make no mistake: The savage inequality America is experiencing today is deeply dangerous.ROBERT B. REICH, Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley, was Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. Time Magazine named him one of the ten most effective cabinet secretaries of the last century. He has written thirteen books, including the best sellers ""Aftershock"" and ""The Work of Nations.""

The sex education amendment to the budget bill, introduced by Rep. Lynn Wachtmann (R), encourages schools to teach abstinence-only education and bans sexual education that condones ""any gateway sexual activity or health message that encourages students to experiment with sexual activity."" The amendment also prohibits teachers from distributing contraceptive materials and bans public schools from using the services of any individual or organization who “endorses student nonabstinence from sexual activity as an appropriate or acceptable behavior, or if that individual or organization promotes, endorses, advocates, or condones gateway sexual activity.”Instructors who violate the law could be sued in court for up to $5,000. State Democratic Chairman Chris Redfern told the Toledo Blade that Republicans are “bent on outlawing sexuality and reverting to the Dark Ages."" ""If this legislature focused on what really mattered, we could get a lot done. Instead, too many of my colleagues have this bizarre attraction to these extreme issues,"" he said. Wachtmann did not immediately return HuffPost's calls for comment. Another provision of the House budget bill would redirect about $1.4 million in state family planning funds from Planned Parenthood to other local health providers and crisis pregnancy centers, which are Christian-owned organizations whose mission is to convince women not to have abortions. Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio provides health and family planning services to about 100,000 women each year at 27 clinics across the state. If the bill passes, all of the Planned Parenthood clinics would be moved to the bottom of the priority list for state funding because three of them provide abortions.All abortions provided at Planned Parenthood clinics are paid for privately by the patient, because the Hyde Amendment prohibits any federal dollars from being used to fund the procedure. But Republicans have long argued that Planned Parenthood indirectly uses public grants to pay for all of its services, including abortions.State Rep. Ron Maag (R-Lebanon) said at a hearing on the bill last week that if Planned Parenthood wants to receive more federal funds, it should stop providing abortions at all of its clinics. “If the hang-up is abortion, and you only have three clinics that are doing it, and there are other places women could go, why do you persist in having those clinics when it is putting your good work in jeopardy?” he asked Stephanie Kight, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.Kight said the thousands of Ohio women who use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider can attest to the fact that it is not a bottom-tier provider. “It’s interesting that they would introduce a bill that would require us to be something that we’re not, while we’re the most-trusted provider for women’s health care"" in the state, she said.

The ruling dealt a blow to supporters of the suspended classes, who had hoped the courts would overturn a 2010 law championed by Arizona conservatives determined to shut down the unconventional courses. “I was really surprised at the decision,” Jose Gonzalez, a former teacher of Tucson's suspended Mexican-American Studies classes, told The Huffington Post. “But as a student and teacher of history, I know in civil rights cases like this there’s always setbacks.”The experimental Tucson curriculum was offered to students in different forms in some of the local elementary, middle and high schools. It emphasized critical thinking and focused on Mexican-American literature and perspectives. Supporters lauded the program, pointing to increased graduation rates, high student achievement and a state-commissioned independent audit that recommended expanding the classes. But conservative opponents accused the teachers of encouraging students to adopt left-wing ideas and resent white people, a charge the teachers deny. Aiming squarely at Tucson’s Mexican-American Studies program, the Arizona legislature passed HB 2281 -- a law banning courses that promote the overthrow of the U.S. government, foster racial resentment, are designed for students of a particular ethnic group or that advocate ethnic solidarity. Federal Judge Wallace Tashima said the plaintiffs failed to show the law was too vague, broad or discriminatory, or that it violated students’ first amendment rights. The news wasn’t all bad for supporters of the suspended classes. Tashima ruled that the section of the law prohibiting courses tailored to serve students of a particular ethnicity was unconstitutional. Originally filed in October of 2010 on behalf of the program's former teachers, who lost standing because they are public employees, the case is currently brought by former Mexican-American Studies student Nicholas Dominguez and his mother Margarita Dominguez. They will likely appeal the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals within the next 30 days, their lawyer Richard Martinez told The Huffington Post. “This case is not over,” Martinez said. “It’s not only important to Arizona, but to the country as a whole that this statute be addressed.” Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne began a campaign to eliminate the Mexican-American Studies program from Tucson Unified School District in 2006, when he was serving as the state’s Superintendent of Public Education. Angered that Mexican-American civil rights leader Dolores Huerta had said that “Republicans hate Latinos” in a speech to Tucson students, Horne sent Deputy Superintendent Margaret Dugan, a Latina Republican, to give an alternate view. But the intellectual exercise turned confrontational when students, who said they were not allowed to ask Dugan questions, sealed their mouths with tape and walked out of the assembly room. “As superintendent of schools, I have visited over 1,000 schools and I’ve never seen students be disrespectful to a teacher in that way,” Horne said in an interview last year. The final product of his efforts was House Bill 2281, which then-State Sen. John Huppenthal (R) helped pilot through the Arizona legislature. Huppenthal, who succeeded Horne as state superintendent of schools, then found Tucson out of compliance with the new law and ordered the district to shut Mexican-American Studies down or lose 10 percent of its annual funding -- some $14 million over the fiscal year. In January of 2012, the school board complied, voting 4 to 1 to discontinue the classes. The decision drew national attention as administrators plucked Latino literature that once belonged to the curriculum from classrooms, explicitly banning seven titles from instruction.Tashima wrote in Friday’s ruling that Horne’s anti-Mexican-American Studies zeal bordered on discrimination. “This single-minded focus on terminating the MAS (Mexican-American Studies) program, along with Horne’s decision not to issue findings against other ethnic studies programs, is at least suggestive of discriminatory intent,” Tashima wrote.But the federal judge stopped short of invalidating the law on those grounds. ""Although some aspects of the record may be viewed to spark suspicion that the Latino population has been improperly targeted, on the whole, the evidence indicates that Defendants targeted the MAS program, not Latino students, teachers or community members who participated in the program,"" the judge wrote in the ruling.Not everyone agrees.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to the city to open the party's African-American Engagement Office. But if anything, the launch event put into stark relief just how much work the GOP has to do, when a largely white audience turned out to hear the senator speak.Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus has said that attracting more minorities to the GOP is crucial for the party's future. He visited Michigan last month, hired radio personality Wayne Bradley to head the African-American Engagement effort in the state and launched the Michigan Black Advisory Council. In the 2012 election, President Barack Obama earned the support of 90 percent of the black voters who turned out at the polls.Paul initially spoke at the new African-American Engagement Office on Livernois Avenue in Detroit for about four minutes on Friday. According to the progressive site Eclectablog, ""The seats in the tiny space were filled with well-dressed supporters, most of whom were African-American."" “Today’s opening of this office is the beginning of a new Republican Party,” Paul said. “This is going to be a Republican Party that is in big cities and small cities, in the countryside, in the city. It’s going to be about bringing a message that is popular no matter where you’re from, whether you're rich or poor, whether you’re black, white or brown.”Paul then went to a larger grassroots event at the Grace Bible Chapel, where there were protesters from the civil rights group National Action Network outside. The online invitation said the event was intended to ""celebrate the opening of our African-American Engagement Office in Detroit.""Tracking footage from the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, however, shows an overwhelmingly white audience ended up turning out: Detroit is approximately 83 percent African-American.Paul also spoke Friday at the Detroit Economic Club, where he proposed a plan to revitalize U.S. cities through the creation of ""economic freedom zones,"" which would cut federal taxes in communities that have an unemployment rate of 12 percent or higher. The Michigan Democratic Party rejected Paul's advice for Detroit.""Sen. Paul was a vocal opponent of the auto rescue, which saved over a million jobs, and led the Republican effort to shut down the government, costing Michigan's economy hundreds of millions,"" said party spokesman Joshua Pugh. ""His special interest tax handout plan is nothing new. Here in Michigan, Rick Snyder gave $1.8 billion to wealthy special interests, and paid for it with billions in devastating cuts to our local communities and public schools. It's time for our elected leaders to stop the tax giveaways, invest in communities and improve education.""Paul has been trying to do more minority outreach in recent months. In April, Paul spoke at the historically black Howard University, becoming the first Republican elected official to speak on campus in years. Still, he continues to generate skepticism, in part due to his criticism of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 2010, he said, ""I think it’s a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant, but, at the same time, I do believe in private ownership.""On Sunday, Paul said he opposed extending long-term unemployment benefits, because doing so would be a ""disservice"" to workers. African-Americans have consistently had a significantly higher unemployment rate than whites.Neither Paul nor the Michigan GOP returned a request for comment."

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Arizona's law allowing proof of citizenship requirements on state forms unconstitutional since federal forms did not require it. But the court also said that states with proof of citizenship requirements could ask the federal government to note those requirements on federal registration forms distributed in their states. The recent lawsuit comes days after the American Civil Liberties Union told Kobach that it intended to sue him over the state requirement, citing 15,000 voter registrations being held up due to lack of proof. But Kobach said his suit could preempt the ACLU suit since it addresses the ACLU's concerns, the Topeka Capitol-Journal reports. Doug Bonney, the legal director for the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri, told The Huffington Post that Kobach and Bennett's lawsuit was expected. At the same time, Bonney said he disagrees with Kobach's analysis that this will end his group's lawsuit to overturn the Kansas law.Bonney said that citizens are not able to register to vote because they cannot display proof of citizenship or because of bureaucratic issues. He said laws requiring people to attest to being citizens when registering to vote have worked well to prevent fraud.""There is no proof of people fraudulently registering to vote,"" Bonney said. ""For scores of years, the attestation requirement has been perfectly find. This law makes it difficult for those who are citizens to vote because they cannot get properly registered.""Kobach, a tea party favorite who has written controversial immigration laws in Arizona and Alabama, said that the citizenship proof is needed. ""Every time an alien votes, it effectively cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen,"" Kobach said at the press conference on Wednesday.Opponents of the citizenship requirement told The Huffington Post that the suit is ""fear mongering"" and unnecessary. Former Kansas state Rep. Ann Mah (D-Topeka), Kobach's most vocal critic, said that she is not surprised by the suit. At the same time she stressed that every voter fraud investigation in Kansas has turned up minimal cases in the last decade. She said the real problem is the 15,000 voter registrations being held up.""There is no evidence out there at all,"" Mah told HuffPost. ""Why do we have 15,000 Americans who can't vote because of the hoops they have to jump through?""She said that since most voters register at state motor vehicle offices, which are not equipped to process birth certificates to meet the state law, voters would need to also visit an election office to complete the process. Arizona state House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told HuffPost that he believes this is a way for Bennett to draw tea party votes for his 2014 Republican gubernatorial primary. Campbell, who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, agreed with Mah that there is no voter fraud in the state.""We've gone down this road time and time again, we hear about all this supposed fraud from the tea party all the time,"" he said. ""Every analysis shows there is no voter fraud taking place. It is political grandstanding and fear mongering from the tea party movement."""

Two Democrats were absent for the vote.Governor Neil Abercrombie has indicated he would swiftly sign the measure into law, making Hawaii the 15th or 16th U.S. state to extend marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples, depending on when the governor of Illinois signs that state's bill.As currently drafted, the Hawaii bill would take effect on Dec. 2.""This is about a move toward acceptance, tolerance and compassion,"" Representative Sylvia Luke, chairwoman of the House Finance Committee, said as the House floor debate began hours before the vote.The vote in Hawaii comes at a time of increasing momentum for gay marriage in the courts, at the ballot box and statehouses across the country.Hawaii's Supreme Court ruled two decades ago that banning same-sex marriage was discriminatory, helping to advance gay rights nationwide but also sparking a backlash that kept the legislature passing a bill on the issue.With public opinion shifting, Abercrombie, a first-term Democrat, called the state legislature into special session late last month to consider a bill that rolls back a 1994 statute defining marriage as between a man and a woman only.The Senate overwhelmingly approved the measure last Wednesday, with a 20-4 vote. Three Democrats joined the state's only Republican senator in voting against the bill.Because the measure was amended in the House, it must return to the Senate for final adoption. The Senate is precluded by legislative rules from acting before next Tuesday, aides say.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Clayton Hee was quoted in the Honolulu Star Advertiser as saying he expected the Senate would accept the House version quickly. GAY RIGHTS VS. RELIGIOUS FREEDOMAbercrombie, who served more than two decades in the U.S. House of Representatives before running for governor in 2010, signed a same-sex civil unions bill into law two years ago. His predecessor, Republican Linda Lingle, vetoed a civil unions bill in 2010.The governor has said the proposal was crafted to address opponents' concerns that legalizing gay marriage would infringe on religious freedoms. The proposal exempts clergy and churches from having to perform same-sex marriages.Only six states and the District of Columbia recognized same-sex marriage a year ago, but the number has since more than doubled, due in most cases to litigation over the issue.Three states - Maine, Maryland and Washington - became the first to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples by popular vote with passage of ballot initiatives last November.Last month, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie dropped his legal opposition to gay marriage, making his state the 14th to legalize same-sex weddings.Illinois, whose legislature gave final approval to a same-sex marriage bill on Tuesday, would become the 15th state, unless Abercrombie manages to beat Illinois Governor Pat Quinn to the punch.

However, that has not stopped conservatives from pledging to defy marriage equality, if the high court makes a pro-LGBT decision.In a letter released Thursday, more than 200 conservative activists -- ranging from the Catholic League’s Bill Donohue to Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kern (R) -- vowed to ignore any ruling in favor of same-sex couples. The group of endorsers, signing under the moniker of Freedom Federation, is composed of anti-LGBT Christian conservatives, many of whom have fallen from prominence in recent years.""We stand together as Christians in defense of marriage and the family and society founded upon them,"" the letter reads. Liberty Counsel head Mat Staver and Deacon Keith Fournier, the editor-in-chief of Catholic Online, drafted the ""Marriage Solidarity Statement"" that attacks marriage equality by invoking ""Natural Moral Law"" and questioning the authority of the Supreme Court.""This Natural Moral Law gives us the norms we need to build truly human and humane societies and govern ourselves. It should also inform our positive law or we will become lawless and devolve into anarchy,"" the statement warns. ""Redefining the very institution of marriage is improper and outside the authority of the State. The Supreme Court has no authority to redefine marriage.""While the letter ends with a vague threat that the signers must draw a line on the definition of marriage and will not cross it, the statement does not specify what the Freedom Federation intends to do if the Supreme Court rules in favor of marriage equality.Raw Story makes a good point, writing: ""What, exactly, they intend to do is unclear, since their churches presumably do not perform same sex unions, and because they themselves do not work in the wedding business or grant marriage licenses.""The Supreme Court is expected to release its decision on the two marriage equality cases, Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor, sometime next week. The former questions whether California's Proposition 8 violated the constitution, while the later challenges the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage.Though an online HuffPost/YouGov survey conducted earlier this month indicated that Americans are sharply divided on whether the court should overturn DOMA, another poll released by Pew Research revealed that 72 percent of Americans say the recognition of same-sex marriage is ""inevitable.""Click over to Liberty Counsel to read the full letter."

A majority of the group of 30 or so sign-holders were in their 50s and much older -- and they called themselves Catholics. Linda Karle-Nelson, 72, and her husband Tom Nelson, 83, organized Thursday's event in response to recent remarks made by Detroit Archbishop Allen H. Vigneron asserting that those who support gay marriage and take Communion are contradicting themselves. ""This sort of behavior would result in publicly renouncing one's integrity and logically bring shame for a double-dealing that is not unlike perjury,"" Vigneron said last month. The archbishop thinks gay marriage supporters should, instead, abstain from receiving the sacrament of the Eucharist.But Nelson and his wife couldn't reconcile Vigneron's statements with their own understanding of their faith, nor with their experience as parents of gay children. ""The trauma that exists in families today over this issue is virtually unrecognized, except by folks like us,"" Nelson said. ""When we hear rhetoric from the church that demeans our children, we just can't be silent.""The Archdiocese of Detroit declined to comment on the protest earlier on Thursday.Nelson and Karle-Nelson are members of the national organization Fortunate Families, a group that represents Catholics with LGBT children and sponsored Thursday's event. They were both widowed and had fully grown children from those previous marriages before they wed six years ago. Nelson recalled ""pontificating religious doctrine"" in his household when his kids were younger. His view of the church changed when he learned that his gay son attempted suicide while he was in college. ""That was the beginning of my journey and completely changed my attitude,"" Nelson said. ""His struggles, what he was going through -- he was so closeted, he kept it so veiled. I had no clue.""""The greatest blessing of my life was having a gay son, because of what it's taught me,"" he added.Nelson's son continued to worship as a practicing Catholic after coming out, until the LGBTQ Catholic group he practiced with was asked to leave the church they attended. He, and four of his five siblings, have since left the church. Karle-Nelson's son, who is also gay, had a different experience. He left the church shortly after he left home to attend college. But several years ago, he returned to services when he found a Jesuit parish that was welcoming and diverse.""It shows you that where there is acceptance and a welcoming [environment], people flower,"" Karle-Nelson said.Mary Ellen Lopata, who is the co-founder and on the board of directors of Fortunate Families, said it's a ""sad situation"" that many children have left the Catholic church over its lack of acceptance of gays and lesbians.""We encourage people to speak up, because the bishops don't know our children and they need to hear our children, and understand that our children are every bit as whole and holy,"" Lopata said.Fortunate Families is part of Equally Blessed, a coalition of groups that support full equality in the church and society for LGBT people. The organization does not have local chapters, instead representing constituents from its base in Rochester, N.Y., and supporting actions like the Nelsons' and drawing attention to injustices within the church. ""We're starting to see tiny glimmers of hope that pastors and members of the hierarchy might be willing to talk,"" Lopata said. ""We do believe that if they would just talk to us and talk to children and listen to what they would have to say, their hearts would be changed.""Nelson and Karle-Nelson attend St. Alexanders Parish in Farmington Hills, a suburb of Detroit. ""I think ... many of the clergy [there] are sympathetic to our cause,"" Nelson said. ""But because of the leadership and the Archdiocese, they have to fly under the radar and be careful how they respond to issues like this.""""There have been many instances in the history of the church where they have made statements [that they withdrew],"" Nelson said, rattling off a list that included child labor laws, women's suffrage and democracy.

281	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-raushenbush/cardinal-dolan-gay-marriage-_b_4364273.html	Opinion	1	Gay Rights	Civil Rights	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Cardinal Dolan  laments gay marriage in an interview with David Gregory on ""Meet the Press"" that will air on Sunday and blamed being 'outmarketed' around the issue of marriage equality. From what has been reported in the Associated Press, Dolan also said that the Catholic Church has been ""caricatured as being anti-gay.""No Cardinal Dolan, the Catholic Church hierarchy hasn't been 'outmarketed' on gay marriage, nor have you been 'caricatured' as anti-gay. The hard truth is that, while right on so many of the most important issues of our time, the Catholic Church leadership in America is wrong on the question of gay marriage and someday (probably centuries from now) you will have to own up to it. First of all, marketing isn't the problem. We know where the Catholic Church bishops stand on the issue as they have been engaged in a full on anti-gay marriage campaign including a recent exorcism against gay marriage in Illinois and using communion as a hostage against same sex marriage in New Jersey, not to mention the firing of a lesbian teacher from a Catholic school in Arkansas after her same sex marriage. The logic of the Catholic position against gay marriage seems to go something like this -- marriage is ultimately, and most importantly about procreation, if you can't naturally procreate, you shouldn't get married. This, of course, doesn't sit that well with heterosexuals who don't want, or are unable, to have children. And of course it is an intentional non-starter with homosexuals who have the wrong body parts. Stability, life long commitment, fidelity and love are not as crucial to the idea of marriage as procreation which is elevated above all else. For instance, the love between Edie Windsor and Thea Spyer that lasted over 40 years and including a final 30 years of Windsor caring for Spyer through her debilitating multiple sclerosis is demoted and diminished in the 'procreation' argument. Their life together, and love for each other doesn't rise to the level of marriage. What is happening with increasing speed is that Americans do understand the Catholic Church's position but that people just don't agree with its conclusions. In fact, even Catholics themselves don't agree with the Bishops position as polls show a majority of them are for gay marriage. In fact Catholics in the pews are more in favor of gay marriage than the national average.The other Cardinal Dolan comment that requires a response is that the church has been ""caricatured as being anti-gay."" The hard reality that Cardinal Dolan and all Christians need to face up to is that the Catholic Church along with every other church whether Orthodox, Protestant or Catholic has been horrifically, persistently and vehemently anti-gay for almost all of its history. This is a fact. There is no 'caricature' needed. The Church has inspired deep hatred of the LGBT community, and the fact that many of us who are LGBT still feel called to participate in the Church is perhaps the most powerful testimony to the presence of Christ that one can find in the world today. But for one to deny that the Church is anti-gay in one sentence and then to maintain a stance against gay marriage in the next adds injury to insult. Let's just be very clear here -- if you are against marriage equality you are anti-gay. Done. You can not say you are supportive of me as a gay man, and then say but you are against my marriage to my partner Brad. It just doesn't work that way. If you are against gay marriage you are against gay married people. In the future, if you want to know if your actions or words are anti-gay -- try asking a gay person. We'll be glad to let you know. The truth is, the Catholic Church, along with most religious traditions will eventually have to change their positions on LGBT people. It will take a long, long time. I certainly don't expect to live to see the Catholic Church hierarchy change official dogma on the issue. But I have faith that they will. And then a simple 'we're sorry' would be appreciated."

Mefferd posted a link to a Fox News piece referencing Gross Pointe South High School's cancellation of a planned speech by Rick Santorum. It remains unclear why exactly the speech was canceled, though some speculate it was because of the politician's stance against gay marriage. (The appearance has since been rescheduled.)On Facebook, Mefferd wrote that she could see America moving ""toward a day when every Christian who supports real marriage might be made to wear a yellow patch on the sleeve, a ""badge of shame"" to identify us as 'anti-gay haters.' Kind of like the Jews in Nazi Germany.""While the post had several supportive comments, it also drew criticism, prompting a response from Mefferd several hours later:How much tolerance is there for Christians who are constantly being marginalized for standing for biblical marriage when they're constantly being called ""extremists"" and ""haters"" ... when even an Army officer is sending emails that call the AFA and the FRC ""domestic hate groups"" ... when the SPLC's hate map led a homosexual activist to shoot a man at the FRC, leading to his being chharged with domestic terrorism ... ? We're not the haters. We're the HATED.""We're deleting all the nasty comments that gay activists are making,"" Mefferd added.Right Wing Watch's Brian Tashman notes that ""the comparison of anti-gay activists to the Jews who suffered and died under the genocidal Nazi regime is deeply offensive and absurd on its face,"" adding that Nazis singled out homosexuals for brutal persecution as well. Although not in these same terms, conservatives and same-sex marriage opponents have been issuing dire warnings of coming persecution.In March, Fox News commentator Todd Starnes said social conservatives were being treated like ""second-class citizens.""""There seems to be this opinion on the other side that says, you know what, you and I don’t deserve the same rights,"" Starnes told Sandy Rios on American Family Radio.And five years ago, before years before President Barack Obama publicly endorsed gay marriage, conservative columnist Chuck Colson wrote that ""If same-sex “marriage” becomes the law of the land, we can expect massive persecution of the Church."""

However, this has yet to happen.Jamaica Anti-Homophobia Stand reportedly wants Jamaica to legalize homosexuality.Protestors shouted “Gay rights are human rights!” and “Portia, shame on you!” as the Prime Minister came out of the building, blew a kiss at the group, and returned inside.Since its branding as the ""most homophobic place on earth"" in 2006 by Time magazine, Jamaica has gained international media attention surrounding its treatment of LGBT citizens. The country still operates under an ""abominable crime"" law of buggery that punishes sex between two men or two women with up to ten years of hard labor. As a result, LGBT Jamaicans live enshrouded within a culture of fear and violence, largely driven by the homophobic attitudes their friends and neighbors are raised to embody.Earlier this summer, five gay men were trapped and barricaded in their home by members of their village after an ""alleged homosexual man... made statements that made them gravely concerned."" Additionally, a mob attempted to attack two men following a minor car accident because they perceived them to be gay, forcing the men to take refuge in a police station.Increasingly violent instances of anti-LGBT sentiment have also plagued Jamaica, with an openly gay man having allegedly been stabbed to death and his house burned with his body inside late one evening. The anti-LGBT violence pervading the country has sparked not only international outrage, put protests against Jamaica's homophobic climate. Though coverage of anti-LGBT violence in the country is sparse and limited, smaller news outlets have sprung up, enabling those outside of the nation to gain a perspective surrounding the lives of LGBT Jamaicans.For updates on anti-LGBT violence in Jamaica, follow Jamaica LGBT News and Jamaica Anti-Homophobia Stand on Facebook.Jamaica Anti-Homophobia Stand is reportedly planning another protest on Saturday, Sept. 28 at the United Nations Plaza.(h/t JMG)Check out photos of the protest, courtesy of Clayton Carr, below: "

Of those, at least 74 percent, or 905 licenses, were issued to gay and lesbian couples.Marriage licenses in Utah cost between $30 and $50, depending on the county.With an average marriage license costing $40, counties in Utah made a grand total of more than $49,000 in the three-and-a-half days most county clerk’s offices were open this week.About three-quarters of that money came from gay and lesbian couples seeking marriage licenses in the immediate aftermath of U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling that overturned a statewide ban on same-sex marriages.Salt Lake County shattered a previously held record of 85 marriages in a given day, by handing out 353 on Monday (Dec. 23) — the first full day of issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.On the other hand, Piute, a small county of about 1,500 people in the center of the state, was of several counties with no takers. Had any Piute couples requested a license, they would have been denied anyway.County Clerk Valeen Brown is on vacation until Monday (Dec. 30), officials said. So, Piute officials suspended all marriage license activity until Brown returns.Utah County — which made national news this week when Shelly Eyre and her partner Cheryl Haws declared that they would sue its clerk for denying gay and lesbian couples — was doling out certificates Thursday to all.“Moving forward, we probably won’t keep track of how many same-sex couples versus opposite-sex couples we issue licenses to,” said Bryan Thompson, the county’s clerk and auditor. “I don’t see any reason to differentiate between them.”(Marissa Lang writes for The Salt Lake Tribune.)

The article examines a new book by Stephen Jimenez, The Book of Matt, which suggests Shepard's murder was drug-related.In Rios' retelling, however, Shepard's murder was part of a long-term plan by liberals and the LGBT community to create a society that is accepting of gay people.It is up to Christian conservatives, Rios argued, to stop that acceptance. ""We can't let [gay people] keep breaking hearts and taking lives,"" she said, one of a number of references Rios made to her theory that gay men are responsible for the AIDS epidemic.""You think youth is worshipped in heterosexual sex? It is top of the line [for gay men]. And they like young men, young virile men,"" Rios told a crowd of hundreds in the ballroom of the Omni Shoreham Hotel. ""You get old and you're a gay man? There's so much rejection.""Rios also railed against the nonprofit civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks and catalogues extremist and hate groups in the United States. Rios said the SPLC ""cares more about attacking American Christians than it does about protecting"" the civil rights of African-Americans, which the group has done for more than three decades.SPLC and a coalition of other human rights groups encouraged members of Congress not to speak at the Values Voter Summit because a number of the sponsoring groups, including the American Family Association and the Family Research Council, hold extremist anti-gay views.President Barack Obama in 2009 passed anti-hate crimes legislation named after Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., who was also killed in a hate crime."

(AP) — Residents in a small Rhode Island town are voting Saturday on whether four town council members should be recalled for proposing a change in the way the town issues gun permits.The rare recall election was prompted by gun rights supporters who said the four Exeter council members ignored their objections to a failed proposal to allow the attorney general to oversee the town's concealed weapons permits.Both sides were concerned about low-turnout with snow in the forecast.The four council members supported a resolution asking the state's General Assembly to allow the state attorney general to process concealed weapons permits. Under current law, those seeking a permit may apply to either the attorney general or their local police. Since Exeter doesn't have a police department — just a single town sergeant — the job now falls to the town clerk, who the council members said lacks the resources to conduct proper background checks.Even though the council's request never got a vote in the Assembly, gun rights supporters began petitioning for a recall, saying the town's leaders had ignored the concerns of hundreds of people who turned out for a meeting on the proposal.Debates about gun policy have sparked similar ouster efforts elsewhere. In September, two Democratic Colorado state senators were recalled over their support for changes to gun laws following the theater massacre outside Denver in 2012.The recall vote coincidentally comes on the anniversary of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting.The four officials being targeted by the recall effort are Council President Arlene Hicks and Councilmen Cal Ellis, Robert Johnson and William Monahan. All are Democrats. A fifth member is not up for recall: independent Councilman Raymond Morrissey Jr., who voted against the resolution.Should one or more of the council members be recalled, their council seats will go to the losing candidates from the last election. Daniel W. Patterson would get the first seat, Edward F. Nataly the second and Lincoln P. Picillo the third.The fourth seat would be filled by a council appointment.Polls close at 8 p.m.

Mark Obenshain (R) won the Republican nomination for attorney general this weekend, Think Progress dug up a bill he introduced in 2009 that would have required a woman to report her miscarriage to the police within 24 hours of it happening or risk jail time. A spokesperson for Obenshain told HuffPost on Monday that the senator introduced the bill in response to a news story about a 20-year-old college student who allegedly disposed of her dead newborn in the trash in Rockingham County, Virginia. Jared Walczak, Obenshain's deputy campaign manager for policy, said Obenshain was trying to pass a law to enable law enforcement to prosecute a woman in that circumstance, but he ended up with a bill that threatened all pregnant women with prosecution in the event that they miscarry. ""As sometimes happens, the legislation that emerged was far too broad, and would have had ramifications that neither he nor the Commonwealth's attorney's office ever intended,"" Walczak said. ""Sen. Obenshain is strongly against imposing any added burden for women who suffer a miscarriage, and that was never the intent of the legislation.""Walczak said Obenshain met with representatives of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia in an attempt to resolve the problem, but he was unable to come up with a solution, so he withdrew the bill. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia confirmed that Obenshain reached out to them about the bill in 2009, and they told him they did not support it. Tarina Keene, the group's executive director, told HuffPost, ""In 2009 we made it clear to Sen. Obenshain that NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia vehemently opposed his bill to criminalize tragic pregnancy complications and intimidate grieving Virginian women with the threat of law enforcement -- not to mention jail time. Although Sen. Obenshain did reach out to us amidst public backlash for a 'solution,' we clearly told him we would support nothing but immediate defeat of the legislation. While I'm relieved that he eventually decided to pull his bill, it is deeply troubling that an elected official would even consider such a callous and insulting effort.""Obenshain joins a wave of far-right social conservatives running for office in Virginia, including gubernatorial candidate and current attorney general Ken Cuccinelli and his running mate, Bishop E.W. Jackson. As a state senator, Cuccinelli co-sponsored personhood legislation that would have granted legal rights to embryos, and Jackson made a YouTube video last year in which he compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan."

The sex education amendment to the budget bill, introduced by Rep. Lynn Wachtmann (R), encourages schools to teach abstinence-only education and bans sexual education that condones ""any gateway sexual activity or health message that encourages students to experiment with sexual activity."" The amendment also prohibits teachers from distributing contraceptive materials and bans public schools from using the services of any individual or organization who “endorses student nonabstinence from sexual activity as an appropriate or acceptable behavior, or if that individual or organization promotes, endorses, advocates, or condones gateway sexual activity.”Instructors who violate the law could be sued in court for up to $5,000. State Democratic Chairman Chris Redfern told the Toledo Blade that Republicans are “bent on outlawing sexuality and reverting to the Dark Ages."" ""If this legislature focused on what really mattered, we could get a lot done. Instead, too many of my colleagues have this bizarre attraction to these extreme issues,"" he said. Wachtmann did not immediately return HuffPost's calls for comment. Another provision of the House budget bill would redirect about $1.4 million in state family planning funds from Planned Parenthood to other local health providers and crisis pregnancy centers, which are Christian-owned organizations whose mission is to convince women not to have abortions. Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio provides health and family planning services to about 100,000 women each year at 27 clinics across the state. If the bill passes, all of the Planned Parenthood clinics would be moved to the bottom of the priority list for state funding because three of them provide abortions.All abortions provided at Planned Parenthood clinics are paid for privately by the patient, because the Hyde Amendment prohibits any federal dollars from being used to fund the procedure. But Republicans have long argued that Planned Parenthood indirectly uses public grants to pay for all of its services, including abortions.State Rep. Ron Maag (R-Lebanon) said at a hearing on the bill last week that if Planned Parenthood wants to receive more federal funds, it should stop providing abortions at all of its clinics. “If the hang-up is abortion, and you only have three clinics that are doing it, and there are other places women could go, why do you persist in having those clinics when it is putting your good work in jeopardy?” he asked Stephanie Kight, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.Kight said the thousands of Ohio women who use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider can attest to the fact that it is not a bottom-tier provider. “It’s interesting that they would introduce a bill that would require us to be something that we’re not, while we’re the most-trusted provider for women’s health care"" in the state, she said.

Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia estimates that the ban on abortion coverage in Virginia will affect about 50,000 women in Virginia -- the estimated number who will be using state-based health benefits exchange. NARAL, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights advocacy groups condemned the amendment because it could prevent many low-income women from being able to access abortion care. “With this amendment, Governor McDonnell has launched yet another effort to intrude in women’s health care decisions and block Virginians access to comprehensive reproductive health care,"" said Caroline O’Shea, deputy director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, in a statement. ""Coverage for safe, legal abortion care -- a procedure one in three women will access in their lifetimes - is a basic benefit that most insurance plans currently include. By banning women from using their own funds to purchase plans that include this common benefit, Gov. McDonnell is restricting Virginians’ personal economic decisions as well as their access to comprehensive care.""McDonnell's office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.Anti-abortion advocacy groups and state lawmakers have been lobbying McDonnell for weeks to propose the abortion coverage amendment. Virginia delegate Bob Marshall (R), who has introduced several anti-abortion bills in the House of Delegates this year that have not gone to a vote, sent out an aggressive email blast to his supporters last week.""The Governor and Republican House and Senate leaders completely ignored any new legislative efforts to protect preborn children in the 2013 session because they wanted to avoid controversy in an election year,"" he wrote. ""If Gov. McDonnell does not hear from many principled pro-lifers like yourself, he may continue to do nothing to protect our conscience from the HHS Mandate or to prohibit abortion coverage in health exchanges."""

I spoke up not out of disrespect, however, either for you or our country. No, I spoke up -- and am writing to you now -- to ask that you use your executive order to halt deportations for 11.5 million undocumented immigrant families.My family came to the United States from South Korea when I was 11 years old. Like many immigrants, my mother brought me to this country to seek a better life for her children. I graduated from UC Berkeley, and am now pursuing a Master's degree in Public Administration at San Francisco State University. I have lived in America now for 13 years. I consider this country as my home. During my senior year in high school, however, I learned that my family had overstayed a tourist visa. We are undocumented immigrants.As an American without papers, I was not able to get a job, obtain a driver's license, or receive governmental financial aid. When my mother was sick and in severe pain, she did not visit a doctor because she cannot procure medical insurance. And when my family's home was burglarized, she refused to call the police because she was afraid that our family would be turned over to immigration officials and deported.Like many other undocumented immigrants, I was living in the shadows and living in fear of deportation. However, I have decided to speak out and stand up. Immigration reform is not only a Latino issue, it's also an Asian and Pacific Islander issue -- in fact, it is a human rights issue. Currently, two million of the estimated 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in our country come from Asia. Under your administration, 250,000 undocumented Asian/Pacific Islander immigrants have been deported. While we only make up five percent of the country, we are disproportionately impacted by your immigration policies.Last week, I was formally invited by White House staff to hear your remarks on immigration reform in San Francisco. As I stood in the stands behind you, I was hoping to hear about your plan to address the lives of 11 million undocumented people living in this country, like my family. And while you expressed your support for comprehensive immigration reform, you did not address how an average of 1,100 immigrants are deported every single day under your administration. You did not address how you deported 205,000 parents of U.S. citizens in the last two years. You did not address how, because of your administration's record number of deportations--nearly two million immigrants in five years, a record--families are being torn apart: spouses are being separated from each other, parents are being separated from their children, and our brothers and sisters are being separated from one another. You did not to address how your administration would end the anti-immigration deportation programs like ""Secure Communities."" You've deported more people than any other president in the U.S. history.Interestingly, you talked about Angel Island during your speech. What you did not mention, however, is that more people are detained every single day in detention today than were detained yearly at Angel Island. You recognized Angel Island as a dark period in Chinatown's history, but you failed to recognize that more Asians and Pacific Islanders are in detention today than were in detention under the Chinese Exclusion Act. In fact, your administration detains up to 34,000 people per day, a record number of detainees in U.S. history.Because you failed to address these issues, I was compelled to address the concerns of our community.You claim that the President of the United States has no authority to stop the deportations. And yet, in June 2012, before the 2012 election, which you won with the help of Latino and Asian voters, you implemented Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. With the stroke of a pen, you dramatically changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people like me who can now live without the daily threat of deportation, and can legally work in this country for the first time in our lives.I know that you support comprehensive immigration reform. But I also know that you have the power to stop the deportations, and that you have the power to stop the suffering, fear, and intimidation facing millions of immigrants like my family.Your fellow American,Ju Hong"

They are not secret, in that every member of Congress has been briefed,"" he said during a speech in San Jose, Calif. ""These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.""""Your duly elected representatives have consistently been informed,"" he said.News outlets revealed this week that vast spying programs began under President George W. Bush and have continued under Obama. The Guardian reported Wednesday that the National Security Agency had obtained a court order to collect phone records from Verizon Wireless customers, while The Washington Post reported Thursday of the existence of a program launched in 2007 called PRISM, which tracks information from nine leading U.S. Internet companies: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, YouTube, Apple, PalTalk and Skype.In response to a question after his speech, Obama defended the programs as essential to combating terrorist threats. ""They may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism,"" he said.He also argued that some have overstated the impact of the programs. ""Some of the hype we've been hearing over the past day or so -- nobody has listened to the content of people's phone calls,"" he said.""I welcome this debate and I think it's healthy for our democracy,"" he continued. ""I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate.""Obama portrayed the programs as a trade-off between security and civil liberties. ""I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security, and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society,"" he said.He also expressed his displeasure that the domestic spying programs' existence was leaked to the press. ""I don't welcome leaks,"" he said. ""There's a reason these programs are classified.""The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations. Obama ran as an antidote to Bush's policies in 2008, but the reports reveal that he has continued many of them, leading to concerns over the reach of the national security state.Obama went on to defend those who operated the programs as ""professionals."" ""In the abstract, you can complain about 'Big Brother' and how this is a potential program run amok. But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance,"" he said.Disclosure: The Huffington Post is owned by AOL, which has denied knowledge of the PRISM program."

By Friday morning, the country's director of national intelligence had confirmed the existence of a program that, in the words of the Washington Post, involved the NSA ""tapping directly into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies, extracting audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents, and connection logs that enable analysts to track foreign targets.""Americans learned about these things because there were people inside the government who were willing to leak them, and journalists who were willing to report on them. At a time when the Justice Department's surveillance of journalists has aroused deep anger, the flood of new information about the NSA's activities is a reminder of the vital need for those journalists to be able to do their jobs without fear.The Guardian's explosive piece on Wednesday about the NSA's continual tracking of Verizon customers was a classic leak story. Glenn Greenwald, the blogger who broke the news for the paper, told the Times that his source was ""a reader of mine"" who ""knew the views that I had and had an expectation of how I would display them.""That leak then inspired more reporting, as leaks often do. People could watch media outlets trying to outgun each other on Thursday as they sought to round out the story of the surveillance programs. They could read the Wall Street Journal's report that AT&T and Sprint were also involved in the data-mining program, or watch an NBC News segment which said that ""a secret surveillance program is collecting the telephone records of every single one of us."" They could learn that two senators had been sending cryptic warnings to them for years about how horrified they might be if they learned about the extent of the surveillance. They could hear people they had voted into office admit that the program had been ongoing for seven years.On Thursday, the Post and the Guardian upped the stakes when they reported about the so-called ""PRISM"" program that accessed the Internet companies (including AOL, HuffPost's parent company). Again, it was a classic whistleblowing case, as the Post vividly reported.The paper identified its source as a ""career intelligence officer"" who had been horrified about what he was seeing:Firsthand experience with these systems, and horror at their capabilities, is what drove a career intelligence officer to provide PowerPoint slides about PRISM and supporting materials to The Washington Post in order to expose what he believes to be a gross intrusion on privacy. “They quite literally can watch your ideas form as you type,” the officer said.It appears likely, if reports are to be believed, that that officer will be hunted down by the government whose secrets he has just exposed.All of this information was completely secret on Wednesday morning. Two days later, the entire federal government apparatus had been forced to acknowledge its existence, and hundreds of millions people were much more aware of the huge size of the American surveillance state. As the Associated Press's Matt Apuzzo tweeted, ""THIS is why America needs 'leakers.'"""

""I think that if we don’t do it now, in 2013, it’s not going to be -- it’s not going to happen in 2014,"" he told ""Al Punto"" host Jorge Ramos, according to a transcript of an interview that will air on Sunday. ""And that means that we’re going to have to wait until 2015. So now, that time is -- it’s becoming a lot shorter. We don't know exactly when we’re going to be able to have this debate."" ""A lot of us thought that the debate was going to be in October, but now, with the problems that we’re having internationally and also here in this country, I don’t see how we’re going to be able to have this debate until -- until November,"" he continued. ""And I really don’t know if it will be possible to do it in November."" Labrador was considered by many to be a potential leader on immigration reform, and even though he is not in leadership, advocates were hopeful he would push to bring Republicans on board. He said he is still working on a bill that would address legal immigration. But Labrador dropped out of a bipartisan group working on legislation and does not support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a criterion Democrats say is absolutely necessary to win their votes. He would support undocumented immigrants gaining legal status, but not a new way for them to move beyond it, he said -- a policy that would prevent many from becoming citizens because of narrow application windows under current law.The congressman said that if the House voted on legalization for undocumented immigrants within the next month, he doesn't think there would be enough support for the reform to pass.""Immigration reform is something about which we have to have a good debate,"" he said. ""We have to convince people that it’s a good thing. ... So I think it’s a debate that we have to have, and at this time I don’t think the votes are there in the House of Representatives."""

Last year, he made a failed bid for Missouri’s secretary of state, and his group has been doing little besides trying to attract national attention ever since.AMPAC was finally successful on Thursday, when Breitbart News reported on the event, calling it ""tasteless"" and including an unrelated picture of hundreds of Muslims praying in front of the Capitol. Fox News later broke from their coverage of the violent military crackdown in Egypt, which has left nearly 600 dead and thousands injured, to give viewers an ""alert"" on the so-called ""Million Muslim March,"" and going so far as to note that the total supporters of the event could currently be counted on two hands. A Facebook page for the ""Million Muslim March"" -- which previously showed less than 10 people planning to attend -- had been taken down by the time of publish.Organizers of the ""Million Muslim March"" have defended the timing of their event by noting that ""Muslim[s] and Non Muslim[s] alike were traumatized"" on Sept. 11, 2001. True, but beneath the group's insistence that the march will be about civil rights, indefinite detention, and ""slanderous"" statements about Islam, lies a toxic strain of trutherism. That fact led Corey Saylor, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, to tell U.S. News last month that CAIR would definitely not support the event.Most groups and individuals have responded similarly, though the event did reportedly receive some backing last month from other truther groups and at least one Pennsylvania tea party organization.At the time of the U.S. News report, AMPAC had even changed the title of the event to ""Million American March Against Fear,"" perhaps in an effort to get more mainstream support. The name apparently didn't catch on, however, so it looks they've since decided to revert back to the more controversial name."

They hurt our country. They limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and to associate freely,"" Snowden said.The videos are the first of Snowden speaking since July 12, when the former NSA analyst was shown at a Moscow airport pleading with Russian authorities to grant him asylum, which they did on Aug. 1. That decision has strained the relations between the U.S. and Russia, and President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Putin at a summit hosted by Russia in September.Snowden said the U.S. government was ""unwilling to prosecute high officials who lied to Congress and the country on camera, but they'll stop at nothing to persecute someone who told them the truth.""In a note accompanying the videos, WikiLeaks said Snowden spoke on Wednesday in Moscow as he accepted the Sam Adams Award, named for a CIA analyst during the Vietnam War who accused the U.S. military of deliberately underestimating the enemy's strength for political purposes, and given annually by a group of retired U.S. national security officers. Four former U.S. government officials who were at the ceremony told The Associated Press on Thursday that Snowden is adjusting to life in Russia and said they saw no evidence that he was under the control of local security services. They refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living.This story has been updated with more from the AP."

From Walsh's show's website:Of all the commentators who have been asking whether King’s dream has been achieved, FOX News’ Juan Williams seems to be the only one with whom I agree. When asked by Chris Wallace if the dream has been fulfilled, Williams noted that there isn’t, “any question that [African Americans] have come along way,” before importantly pointing out that blacks have to address the problems that are created within their communities. “I think that if you look at the realities of today, you’ve got to talk about things like family breakdown,” Williams said. “You’ve got to talk about the fact that 70 percent of black children today are born out of wedlock. I think Dr. King would cry.” I agree with Juan, but instead of invoking King’s legacy to lament about present problems I’ve decided to share my own dream.I have a dream that all black parents will have the right to choose where their kids attend school.I have a dream that all black boys and girls will grow up with a father.I have a dream that young black men will stop shooting other young black men.I have a dream that all young black men will say ""no"" to gangs and to drugs.I have a dream that all black young people will graduate from high school.I have a dream that young black men won't become fathers until after they're married and they have a job.I have a dream that young unmarried black women will say ""no"" to young black men who want to have sex.I have a dream that today's black leadership will quit blaming racism and ""the system"" for what ails black America.I have a dream that black America will take responsibility for improving their own lives.I have a dream that one day black America will cease their dependency on the government plantation, which has enslaved them to lives of poverty, and instead depend on themselves, their families, their churches, and their communities.Walsh was soundly defeated in November 2012 by Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). The tea party favorite has turned heads with race-related remarks in the past, headed by his belief that President Barack Obama is ""a historic figure"" who was only elected because he is black. ""The country voted for him because of that. It made us feel good about [our]self."" Walsh said in April 2012, according to Think Progress. ""I’ve said it before, it helped that John McCain was about 142 years old. It helped that the economy was tanking. A lot of these things helped. But he never would have gotten there without his historic nature.""(H/T Mother Jones)"

The board added: Obama administration officials often talk about the balance between protecting secrets and protecting the constitutional rights of a free press. Accusing a reporter of being a 'co-conspirator,' on top of other zealous and secretive investigations, shows a heavy tilt toward secrecy and insufficient concern about a free press.The Times editorial was just one in a chorus of hard-hitting attacks on Obama's media policy that have surfaced in the wake of the Justice Department investigations. Journalists were outraged by the inquiries into the AP and Fox News reporter James Rosen. In particular, members of the media took issue with the Justice Department labeling Rosen a possible ""co-conspirator"" in a leak case for the crime of trying to get a source to give up information.The New Yorker reported on Tuesday that the investigation into Rosen was even broader than previously suspected, as the DOJ seized records from at least five different numbers used by Fox News and two different White House lines. That followed the Associated Press' revelation that the DOJ had secretly obtained months of phone records for at least seven individual journalists across 20 phone lines while searching for the government official responsible for leaking information about a CIA-thwarted terror plot.Obama's hyper-aggressive leak policy—and his administration's potential equation of routine journalistic interaction with criminality—is nothing new. But the fury in the pages and on the websites of elite outlets about these positions certainly is.The Times' criticism echoed that of many other journalists and press freedom groups.On Tuesday, the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists sent an outraged letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, in which it warned that the DOJ's secret subpoenas for over 20 AP phone lines ""represent a damaging setback for press freedom in the United States."" This came on the heels of a letter signed by over 50 media outlets which made similar arguments.Wednesday also saw Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank lash out at Obama:The Rosen affair is as flagrant an assault on civil liberties as anything done by George W. Bush’s administration, and it uses technology to silence critics in a way Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of.To treat a reporter as a criminal for doing his job — seeking out information the government doesn’t want made public — deprives Americans of the First Amendment freedom on which all other constitutional rights are based. Guns? Privacy? Due process? Equal protection? If you can’t speak out, you can’t defend those rights, either. "

The documents reveal broad disagreement over a host of key positions, and general skepticism that an agreement can be reached by year-end. The Obama administration has urged countries to reach a deal by New Year's Day, though there is no technical deadline.One memo, which was heavily redacted before being provided to HuffPost, was written ahead of a new round of talks in Singapore this week. Read the full text of what HuffPost received here. (Note: Ellipses indicate redacted text. Text in brackets has been added by a third party.) Another document, a chart outlining different country positions on the text, dates from early November, before the round of negotiations in Salt Lake City, Utah. View the chart here. HuffPost was unable to determine which of the 11 non-U.S. nations involved in the talks was responsible for the memo.""These are not U.S. documents and we have no idea of their authorship or authenticity,"" a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said. ""Some elements in them are outdated, others totally inaccurate."" The spokesman declined to specify which parts were outdated or inaccurate.The Obama administration has been leading negotiations on the international trade accord since 2010. The countries involved in the talks include Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.One of the most controversial provisions in the talks includes new corporate empowerment language insisted upon by the U.S. government, which would allow foreign companies to challenge laws or regulations in a privately run international court. Under World Trade Organization treaties, this political power to contest government law is reserved for sovereign nations. The U.S. has endorsed some corporate political powers in prior trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the scope of what laws can be challenged appears to be much broader in TPP negotiations.""The United States, as in previous rounds, has shown no flexibility on its proposal, being one of the most significant barriers to closing the chapter, since under the concept of Investment Agreement nearly all significant contracts that can be made between a state and a foreign investor are included,"" the memo reads. ""Only the U.S. and Japan support the proposal.""Under NAFTA, companies including Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly have attempted to overrule Canadian regulations on offshore oil drilling, fracking, pesticides, drug patents and other issues. Companies could challenge an even broader array of rules under the TPP language.New standards concerning access to key medicines appear to be equally problematic for many nations. The Obama administration is insisting on mandating new intellectual property rules in the treaty that would grant pharmaceutical companies long-term monopolies on new medications. As a result, companies can charge high prices without regard to competition from generic providers. The result, public health experts have warned, would be higher prices around the world, and lack of access to life-saving drugs in poor countries. Nearly every intellectual property issue in the November chart is opposed by a broad majority of the 12 nations. The December memo describes 119 ""outstanding issues"" that remain unresolved between the nations on intellectual property matters. The deal would obligate nations to develop many standards similar to those in the United States, where domestic prescription drug prices are much higher than costs in other nations.Also according to the December memo, the U.S. has reintroduced a proposal that would hamper government health services from negotiating lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. The proposal appears to have been universally rejected earlier in the talks, according to the memo. Australia and New Zealand have medical boards that allow the government to reject expensive new drugs for the public health system, or negotiate lower prices with drug companies that own patents on them. If a new drug does not offer sufficient benefits over existing generic drugs, the boards can reject spending taxpayer money on the new medicines. They can also refuse to pay high prices for new drugs. The Obama administration has been pushing to ban these activities by national boards, which would lock in big profits for U.S. drug companies. Obamacare sought to mimic the behavior of these boards to lower domestic health care costs by granting new flexibilities to U.S. state agencies for determining drug prices. The U.S. is also facing major resistance on bank regulation standards. The Obama administration is seeking to curtail the use of ""capital controls"" by foreign governments. These can include an extremely broad variety of financial tools, from restricting lending in overheated markets to denying mass international outflows of currency during a financial panic. The loss of these tools would dramatically limit the ability of governments to prevent and stem banking crises.""The positions are still paralyzed,"" the December memo reads, referring to the Financial Services Chapter.

Werfel, who currently serves as the controller of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also worked with the Bush administration.""Throughout his career working in both Democratic and Republican administrations, Danny has proven an effective leader who serves with professionalism, integrity and skill,"" Obama said in an emailed statement. ""The American people deserve to have the utmost confidence and trust in their government, and as we work to get to the bottom of what happened and restore confidence in the IRS, Danny has the experience and management ability necessary to lead the agency at this important time.""WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will appoint a new acting commissioner to the Internal Revenue Service this week, a senior administration official confirmed to The Huffington Post.The news comes a day after the president announced the departure of acting commissioner Steven Miller, as the tax agency has become engulfed in scandal for targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status leading up to the 2012 election. ""It is important to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward,"" Obama said Wednesday in a statement. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew requested Miller's resignation after a Treasury Department inspector general's report released earlier this week found that lower-level IRS staff acted out of incompetence by subjecting groups applying for 501(c)(4) status to greater scrutiny if they had words like ""tea party"" in their names. The report also found that the targeting was not politically motivated, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for a firm response from the president.Obama said he had directed Lew to continue investigating the IRS and pledged to ""work with Congress as it performs its oversight role"" in the process.Some Republicans have argued that dismissing Miller is not enough, given that the acting commissioner had already been planning to leave his post in June. Nonetheless, it was influential Republican lawmakers such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) who initially demanded Miller's resignation.At a press conference Thursday, the president rejected calls for a special counsel to investigate the agency.""I think that it's going to be sufficient for us to be working with Congress. They've got a whole bunch of committees,"" Obama said, pointing out the IG had produced a report and conducted an audit. He added that Attorney General Eric Holder had also announced a criminal investigation into what happened. ""Between those investigations, I think we're going to be able to figure out exactly what happened, who was involved, what went wrong, and we're going to be able to implement steps to fix it,"" Obama said. ""That, ultimately, is the main priority that I have, but also I think the American people have.""Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House, told HuffPost on Wednesday that the administration had acted swiftly and appropriately amid the controversy. ""It was good the president said there's going to be accountability and responsibility,"" Hoyer said. ""And the guy who's the head, like the coach, takes the responsibility. I think it was the appropriate action.""Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.This article has been updated with information about events leading up to Miller's resignation, and with comment from Hoyer and further comment from the president."

""I believe we can keep the promise of our founders, the idea that if you're willing to work hard ... you can make it here in America.""The central challenge of Obama's second term is whether he can keep that founder’s ""promise"" to working Americans. It won't be easy, and in an era of divided government and amid cries for austerity and budget cuts, it does not seem likely that the president will offer sweeping new proposals to do so. The administration has said that its top two priorities at the outset of its second term are immigration reform and gun control. Despite an ongoing jobs crisis, creating quality jobs seems to have fallen a few slots on the president's to-do list.As Obama implicitly acknowledged, the American middle class has fallen on hard times, saddled with historic levels of debt, skyrocketing health care costs and flat wages. By most accounts, middle-class Americans are no better off than they were when the president took office in 2009, in the wake of an unprecedented financial crisis and in the midst of the Great Recession. The arithmetic is stark. Median household income is lower than when Obama took office, according to Census Bureau data -- lower even than when President Bill Clinton left office in 2001. The middle 60 percent of households -- those earning between $20,262 and $101,582 -- captured a smaller share of aggregate income in 2011 than they did in 2009, while the top fifth, which already made more than the other groups combined, captured more. Surveys of public opinion reveal a middle class that is smaller, poorer and less optimistic than ever. And although the unemployment rate fitfully has fallen below 8 percent for the first time since Obama's 2009 inauguration, most new jobs are too low-paying to sustain middle-class families.There is more to the plight of the American middle class than numbers can express -- and a greater threat to the country than economists can quantify. Democracy, after all, can't thrive without a broad, strong, educated core of citizens. But today they find themselves buffeted by the remorseless dictates of global capital, the need for evermore education and training and the burdens of higher taxes to pay for social programs they need, such as health care.Battling these global and cultural trends is difficult. In fact, it is unfair to ask any one person -- even a president, even Barack Obama -- to overcome them all. The president’s first responsibility in 2009 literally was to do his part to save the world’s frozen capital, banking and trade systems -- without which the American middle class would have had no prospects at all.Most fair-minded observers would say that Obama did his part, and acquitted himself well under crushing circumstances. A workable and affordable health care system, the central legislative success of his first term, can (if he sets it up properly) be of great benefit to middle-class workers.But now he must make good on his own promise -- not always central to his discourse or decision making -- to find more good-paying middle class jobs.How?On the stump this year, the president made manufacturing a centerpiece of his vision, arguing that a combination of tax reform, investment and education could help repatriate quality jobs to U.S. soil and stabilize the middle class. Perhaps sensing the political popularity of such an idea in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan, the Obama campaign set the lofty but achievable goal of creating a million new manufacturing jobs during the president's second term. In a recent interview on ""Meet the Press,"" the president renewed his commitment to investing in infrastructure, which he called ""broken,"" as another way to create good-paying jobs.   With the conversation in Washington focused not just on austerity but how much austerity to apply to a sputtering economy, it's hard to imagine what kind of rebooted jobs plan the president could propose for his next term while staying within the bounds of political reality.""In the short term, we are in a pretty difficult spot,"" said John Schmitt, an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who studies economic inequality and unemployment. ""Even if there was a serious commitment on the part of the administration towards a jobs program of some sort, it would run into a lot of trouble in the Congress."" Without a clear and politically viable policy objective for jobs -- unlike, say, banning high-capacity magazines to address mass shootings -- the administration is likely to continue the piecemeal approach to economic recovery that it took for most of the president's first term, observers say.Obama's landmark 2009 stimulus bill pumped billions of dollars into the ailing economy, stemming the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. The bill addressed the short-term fallout in the private sector by cutting taxes and pouring money into infrastructure projects and expanded unemployment insurance benefits. But since then, additional spending has been all but off the table. Obama has repeatedly proposed more infrastructure spending, but the White House has routinely given up such demands in negotiations with congressional Republicans.The lack of stimulus since the initial package -- aside from the repeated extensions of long-term unemployment insurance -- has exasperated left-leaning and centrist economists.""The answer is very clear: We need substantial additional stimulus to support the economy,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a left-of-center think tank. ""We are choosing, as a country and as a town [Washington], not to do it, with millions of jobless workers."" To address the decline in manufacturing jobs, the Obama administration has undertaken a number of modest initiatives, such as launching a manufacturing institute in Youngstown, Ohio, with $30 million in federal funding, a joint effort between industry and schools to train workers for tomorrow's manufacturing jobs. The Youngstown facility focuses on training workers for 3-D printing technology, the kind of modern manufacturing industry where observers see a lot of potential.The facility is an acknowledgment that tomorrow's manufacturing jobs will be different from the ones of the past. Gone are the days when a new high school graduate could show up at the factory door, get trained on the shop floor and earn a good wage and a pension. Jobs like those in 3-D printing require more advanced training and a certain degree of computer literacy. The same goes for other areas where experts, as well as the White House, see promise, like industrial robotics or nanomanufacturing. Obama's own tech advisers have warned that the country's ""historic leadership"" in manufacturing technology is ""at risk"" if it can't cultivate the right talent for these fields.In his 2013 budget proposal, Obama called for devoting $1 billion to create a national network of institutes like the one in Youngstown -- a recommendation that hasn't exactly become a priority for Congress. Neither have the loftier goals of his earlier manufacturing package, such as extending tax breaks to companies that return jobs to U.S. shores. They appear unlikely to move forward in a second term, even if the president chooses to champion them. ""The administration has done some things but could do a lot more to help manufacturing,"" said Scott Paul, director of the non-profit Alliance for American Manufacturing. What the White House has done so far is ""not well-publicized or well-known. They will ultimately be helpful, but so much of the debate has become politicized, it's hard to make progress on some of the meaningful issues.""And in the end, the manufacturing plan still faces some cold mathematics. The U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the first decade of this century, falling from 17 million to 12 million. Fewer than 9 percent of American workers have manufacturing jobs, compared with more than 20 percent in 1979. Creating a million new such jobs puts only a dent in that sector's -- and the middle class's -- long-term woes.""It doesn't come close to restoring manufacturing employment to what it had been,"" Paul noted, adding that he still found the goal admirable.Even setting aside the immediate joblessness crisis, Obama still faces the long-term problems of deteriorating wages and growing income inequality for the poor and middle class. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of American households captured more than 38 percent of income growth, while the bottom 90 percent received just shy of 37 percent, according to EPI. The Great Recession technically ended halfway through 2009, but the economic recovery of the past few years is replacing office workers, real estate brokers and insurance claims adjusters with retail salespeople, restaurant workers and warehouse hands. Mid-wage jobs -- ones with median hourly wages ranging from $13.84 to $21.13 -- accounted for 60 percent of the jobs lost during the recession, according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. During the recovery since then, mid-wage jobs have represented just 22 percent of growth. Jobs earning less than $13.84 per hour made up 58 percent of recovery growth, according to the NELP. The president pledged during his 2008 campaign that by 2011 he would have the minimum wage raised to $9.50 and pegged to inflation, a move that worker advocates have clamored for for years, claiming it would help raise the wage floor for the working poor and the middle class. But the federal minimum wage remains $7.25 per hour, well below a living wage in most areas.Many of those same worker advocates tie the stagnation of real wages to the decline of collective bargaining in the workplace. The rate of unionization in the U.S. has fallen to a historic low, with just 7 percent of private-sector workers now belonging to a union. Labor leaders believe that labor law needs to be amended to make it easier for workers to join unions. Their best shot came and went under the president's watch, when Democrats failed to pass the Employee Free Choice Act when they controlled both chambers of Congress.""I do feel disappointment,"" said Schmitt, the Center for Economic and Policy Research economist. ""That said, we're also in a [political] context where it's extremely difficult to make any progress on the concerns of low- and middle-wage workers.""Despite those shortcomings, and despite the acrimony on Capitol Hill, liberals like Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO federation of unions, are bullish on Obama's second term, given the focus on the middle class and jobs during the election. ""It all starts with the political will, or the national appetite, to again create jobs that are going to be family-supportive and middle-class producing, and I think that's underway right now,"" Trumka said. ""People are talking about it. That's the difference between this election and the ones in the past. We actually had a debate about what's hollowing out the country and what isn't. And our side won, big time.""Now the president’s challenge is to turn that political victory into an economic one for the people who supported him.This article is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post that closely examines the most pressing challenges facing President Obama in his second term.

Next time, let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you."" The words came following the Navy Yard shooting in Washington.Guth was put on paid administrative leave Friday, and the university has taken steps to distance itself from the tweet. In a statement reported by Fox4 in Kansas, the school's vice chancellor called the tweet ""repugnant,"" while Ann Brill, Kansas' journalism dean, said the university does not agree with Guth and does not ""advocate violence directed against any group or individuals.""#NavyYardShooting The blood is on the hands of the #NRA. Next time, let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you.— David Guth (@DWGuth) September 16, 2013While the university has taken steps against Guth, Republican state lawmakers want Guth fired. If he isn't, they say, the school could face consequences. State Senate President Susan Wagle (R-Wichita) and Senate Majority Leader Terry Bruce (R-Hutchison) have both issued statements calling for Guth's dismissal. State Sen. Greg Smith (R-Overland Park) released a statement Friday saying that unless further action is taken against Guth, he will react. ""As a public educator in the Kansas high school education system, I am often consulted by my students as to which college they should attend,"" Smith said in his statement. ""As long as Professor Guth remains employed by the University of Kansas I will no longer recommend the university as an institution worthy of attendance by any of my students nor, as a state senator, will I support any budget proposals or recommendations for the University of Kansas.""Other Republican lawmakers echoed Smith's comments about the university budget. State Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (R-Palco) told The Huffington Post that the university's latest budget proposal is arriving this week on lawmakers' desks -- and it asks for an increase. Swift action against Guth is needed to show that the university does not tolerate his tweet, Couture-Lovelady said.""It is a university decision,"" Couture-Lovelady said. ""We are elected representatives of the people who develop the budget for the university. I could see something like this being detrimental to their cause. Things like this hurt their cause, and it's unfortunate. I want to see them continue to grow.""State Rep. Brett Hildabrand (R-Shawnee), one of the most vocal pro-Second Amendment legislators in Kansas, told HuffPost that he and other lawmakers have been in contact with the university to express their opinions that Guth should be fired.""He went after the children of NRA members, and some of those children could be students in one of his classes,"" Hildabrand said. ""That sets up a hostile environment for the students.""Guth has been standing by his comments, telling Fox4KC Thursday that he does not want people to be shot.""If you look at how I structured the statement, I didn’t really bring [the NRA’s) children into it,” he said, according to Fox4KC. “I carefully structured the statement to make it conditional, but apparently it was too much of a nuance for some people.”“I don’t want anybody harmed. If somebody’s going to be harmed, maybe it ought to be the people who believe that guns are so precious that it’s worth spilling blood over,” Guth added, according to Fox4KC. Guth did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.Several lawmakers expressed concern that Guth's administrative leave is paid. Rep. Reid Petty (R-Liberal) said that while he doesn't think administrative leave is enough of a sanction for Guth, it's not the job of the legislature to interject itself into Guth's employment status.""I don't think that it is appropriate for us,"" Petty said. ""We can share our opinions and you have the chancellor and the Board of Regents. If you had a pattern of professors saying outrageous things, then we could.""Jack Martin, University of Kansas spokesman, said the university did not have a comment on the legislators. He referred back to the statement the school released announcing Guth's suspension.All of the legislators contacted by HuffPost said they agree that Guth has a First Amendment right to free speech. But, they said, he's paid by the taxpayer and has embarrassed the state.""He has freedom of speech. Speak all he wants as a former KU professor,"" state Rep. J.R. Claeys (R-Salina) told HuffPost. ""When he voices an insensitive and threatening opinion, he doesn't get to take the good image of our institutions down with him.""UPDATE: 10:30 p.m. -- Guth told The Huffington Post in an email he agreed with University of Kansas officials' request to take paid administrative leave because of the threats. He explained:""I have had conversations with the university and have agreed to this action -- an administrative leave with pay -- in light of the abusive email threats I and others have received. It is in it the best interests and peace of mind of our students that I remove myself from the situation and let cooler heads prevail. It is unfortunate that my comments have been deliberately distorted. I know what I meant. Unfortunately, this is a topic that generates more heat than light. I don't think any further comment would be appropriate at this time."""

The economy seems to be on the right track. Just last week the stock market reached record highs and the jobless rate fell to its lowest point in four years. The war in Iraq is over and most American troops are scheduled to be out of Afghanistan by the end of next year. The GOP appears to have lost the advantage to Democrats on gun control and immigration, and abortion and gay rights are no longer the reliable campaign wedge issues they once were.That leaves ObamaCare and ""big government spending"" as just about the only issues that remain for right-leaning candidates, barring any unforeseen domestic or global calamity. But if their campaigns against ObamaCare next year are as successful as their campaigns against it were in the 2010 midterms -- and the White House and supporters of the law are once again asleep at the switch -- GOP candidates might not need anything else to talk about to take both houses of Congress.When Barack Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, there was wide support for health care reform, and Republican strategists knew it. They realized they might be able to turn reform into a winning issue for their candidates by mounting a campaign to make people afraid of what the Democrats might try to do. So just as Congress was beginning preliminary work on what eventually became the Affordable Care Act, GOP message guru Frank Luntz persuaded his clients to condemn whatever the Democrats proposed as a ""government takeover of health care.""Even though the bill that ultimately became law was anything but a government takeover, GOP lawmakers and candidates never missed an opportunity to insist that it was. Luntz' sound bite was repeated hundreds of times in floor speeches by Republican members of Congress in the hours before the House voted on its version of the bill on November 7, 2009.Their fear-based campaign worked so well to influence public opinion that GOP candidates have never stopped using the ""government takeover"" meme, which is why the perception of ObamaCare as being exactly that has become a reality for millions of Americans.When you consider the inadequate job that the White House and the president's supporters have done in explaining how the law benefits just about every one of us -- and never letting us forget why reform was necessary in the first place -- it's little wonder Republicans see opportunity once again.There no doubt will be glitches when the online health insurance exchanges go live on October 1 for the relatively small percentage of Americans who will use them to shop for coverage because their employers don't offer health insurance as an employee benefit. The exchanges will work just fine for the vast majority of people, but there will be some who will have complaints. You can expect the law's critics to give every one of them a voice in their effort to create the impression that the exchanges are a disaster and that the government can't do anything right.Similarly, some people who have been paying relatively low premiums for what they don't realize is junk insurance will be upset when junk insurance is outlawed next year. Because real insurance costs more than junk, some invariably will complain about having to pay higher premiums for coverage that will actually be there if and when they need it.You can also expect that a fair number of folks will squawk when the requirement to have health insurance kicks in on January 1. And you can bet that the opponents of the law will be aided, unwittingly in most but certainly not all cases, by the media. Just as local TV reporters tell us about the drivers who crash into each other instead of the rest of us who get to our destinations unharmed, the media will focus on the glitches. And they'll interview far more complainers than happy campers.I'm betting that Frank Luntz and other Republican strategists have already been hired to craft the sound bites to use against Democrats next year. If the Democrats and consumer advocates who support ObamaCare are not at work developing their own strategies to counter the coming barrage of misleading spin, the GOP will have an excellent chance of controlling Capitol Hill after the next elections."

The site was back up on Monday.Republicans have seized on the troubled website to further attack Obamacare and question whether administration officials hid problems before the launch. They are expected to press Tavenner on testimony she gave in August, when she said work was on track to roll out a tested website that would make it easy for Americans to enroll for insurance.Tavenner said in her testimony for Tuesday that an ""initial wave of interest stressed the account service, resulting in many consumers experiencing difficulty signing up, while those who were able to sign up sometimes had problems logging in.""She also placed some blame on the contractors helping to build and maintain the website, saying a subset of them ""have not met expectations."" She did not name the contractors.A ""new infusion of talent"" has been brought in and experts are working aggressively to diagnose the parts that are still experiencing problems, Tavenner said. They are continuing to add capacity, and more people are creating accounts, she said.""We are pleased with these quick improvements, but we know there is still significant, additional work to be done,"" she said.Tavenner's testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee marks the second congressional hearing to examine the problems with the program's rollout. Last week, contractors who worked on the site told a different panel that the administration launched it after only a minimum of system-wide testing.Tavenner, 62, was confirmed for her job by the Senate in May. She had been optimistic about the rollout when questioned by lawmakers about it in April and again in August.She is appearing before Congress one day before her boss, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, testifies to Congress on the same subject.With Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients saying Healthcare.gov should be fixed by the end of November, experts say the administration could lose the interest of healthy younger adults aged 18-35 for whom the website was seen as a major avenue for enrollment.On Monday, the White House issued a report promoting the program for young people. Based partly on Census data, it said 46 percent of young adults who live alone in 34 states could get health coverage for $50 a month or less under Obamacare.Republicans in Congress have introduced a flurry of legislation they say is aimed at protecting the public from the problem-plagued rollout.Senators Marco Rubio and Jerry Moran have a bill to delay - until six months after the troubled Healthcare.gov is fully functioning - the mandate requiring most Americans to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty.Fred Upton, the Republican chair of the House, Energy and Commerce Committee, has also produced a bill allowing insurers to maintain existing health plans in 2014 outside the new online health insurance exchanges - even if they do not meet the benefit standards of Obamacare."

They may find they're not insured after all.HealthCare.gov, the federal online portal for health-insurance shopping in more than 30 states, has improved after more than a month of intense fixes, and enrollment is accelerating. But insurance companies are still getting information on their would-be customers that is garbled and incomplete, and in some cases they are getting no information at all. President Barack Obama's administration is scrambling to repair the faulty system, but scant time remains until the Dec. 23 deadline for consumers to choose a health plan that will be in place Jan. 1. The result could be an untold number of consumers remaining uninsured despite completing the enrollment process -- another embarrassing chapter in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health care reform law.The Obama administration insists the enrollment glitches will be fixed in time to prevent any troubles next month, but won't disclose the extent of the problem. Nor will it guarantee that any patients who fall victim to these problems won't be exposed to medical bills if they get sick or injured.""I doubt very seriously the insurance company or the government is going to say, 'Oh, don't worry, We'll take care of it.' I think that's going to fall solely on the patient,"" said Reid Blackwelder, a doctor in Kingsport, Tenn., who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. ""I wouldn't count on anybody else jumping in and bailing everybody out.""In an unusual joint press release on Wednesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the largest national trade groups for insurers, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, emphasized their collaboration in addressing the problem. “Ensuring that all Americans who need coverage are properly enrolled is a top priority for all of us. We are working together closely to resolve back-end issues between health plans and HealthCare.gov,"" the statement said. ""We will report on our progress.”Insurance companies could smooth over difficulties during the first month of new coverage by paying the expenses of people who believed they were enrolled. But that would subject the companies to potentially big costs for patients who get expensive services without having yet paid a premium, or who may not be their customers at all.Moreover, insurers may be reluctant to bear the brunt of another technical failure after having already shouldered responsibility for fixing other Obamacare problems.Insurers grumbled last month after Obama asked them to renew health policies that had been canceled for not meeting Obamacare standards. The White House has also proposed that  insurers cover the cost of birth control for workers whose employers object on religious grounds. And the administration has delayed the launch of the payment system that will transfer government subsidies under Obamacare to insurance companies.""You'd be counting on the goodwill of the insurance company. I'm not sure how long that's going to last,"" said Leslie Norwalk, who was a senior official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President George W. Bush and is now strategic counsel at Epstein Becker Green in Washington.Patients who show up at a doctor's office, hospital, pharmacy or elsewhere without insurance cards in hand will have to rely on the kindness of those providers, Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington & Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Va., wrote in an email. ""It is likely that there will be problems, probably a lot of them, with confirming coverage, but providers are used to dealing with insurer screw-ups and hopefully will be patient,"" Jost wrote. HealthCare.gov users who go through the enrollment process to the end are prompted to connect with their new health insurance provider to make payments, which are due Dec. 31 for coverage that begins in January. Consumers who don't take action or believe they can wait for a bill from their insurance company could find themselves in the lurch next month, especially if the company has no record of their enrollment because of the technical problems.The White House says it is incumbent on individuals to double-check that they have coverage. ""If consumers are not sure if they are enrolled, they should call our customer call center or the insurer of their choice so that they can be sure they’re covered by Jan. 1,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday. The administration is reaching out by telephone and email to consumers who have begun or submitted applications via HealthCare.gov, in order to advise them of the steps they must take to confirm their enrollments.Insurance companies receive daily uploads of data about new enrollees. Despite progress since Obamacare marketplaces launched on Oct. 1, as many as one-third of enrollments submitted through the federal system contain errors, The Washington Post reported on Monday. The administration says that error rate isn't accurate, but won't reveal how many of the submissions -- called 834 forms -- are incorrect. The White House maintains that most of the problems have already been fixed and that the rest will be resolved in time to prevent hardships next month.The George W. Bush administration faced a similar dilemma in January 2006, when the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit launched. Enrollees across the country visited drugstores only to find their benefits weren't in place.""That was a point of crisis because every one of those became a story,"" said Michael Leavitt, who was Bush's secretary of Health and Human Services at the time.A frenzied effort to guarantee patients' access to medications followed, while the Bush administration worked to correct the technical bugs, said Leavitt, now chairman of Salt Lake City-based Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm that has advised states on ACA implementation. ""It became our problem with the system, not the consumer's problem,"" Leavitt said. The Obama administration likewise needs to protect patients, Leavitt said. ""The federal government caused this, and they're the ones who are going to have to take responsibility for it,"" he said. ""There's an obligation to make certain that people have not been seriously disadvantaged in their health by this."" Unlike during the Medicare Part D snafu, the Obama administration has no funding stream to tap to pay for medical expenses incurred by patients who encounter problems. Nevertheless, Leavitt predicted his successor, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, would take unilateral action to avoid a backlash, as the administration has on previous occasions.""The secretary of health does not lack authority in this situation,"" he said. ""I can't tell you the exact authority with which she would act, but you just look at the number of things they've already deferred and the way they've found flexibility, they're going find the authority.""HuffPost readers: Do you plan to try HealthCare.gov or a state-run health insurance exchange website in December?

Software and hardware upgrades put in place since late October have been effective, said Jeffrey Zients, the Obama aide overseeing the repair effort to the online portal for health insurance enrollment in more than 30 states.""HealthCare.gov on Dec. 1 is night and day from where it was on Oct. 1,"" when the health insurance exchanges debuted, Zients said during a conference call with reporters Sunday. ""While we still have work to do, we've made significant progress with HealthCare.gov working smoothly for the vast majority of consumers."" The website can now handle 50,000 users at a time, which was the original goal, and 800,000 visitors a day, he said.The early consumer experience of Obamacare's health insurance exchanges was characterized by crashes, error messages, long wait times and faulty information, threatening the rollout of Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.December could now prove a crucial month for the first year of enrollment via the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces. Consumers who want health coverage in effect on Jan. 1 have until just Dec. 23 to select a health plan via the exchanges -- including many whose current policies don't meet Obamacare standards and can't be renewed for next year. A crush of consumers scrambling to get health insurance for the new year could test the rigor of the administration's fixes, and Zients said traffic to HealthCare.gov spiked over the Thanksgiving holiday compared a typical weekend, although he didn't provide figures. HuffPost readers: Do you plan to try HealthCare.gov or a state-run health insurance exchange website in December? Tell us about your experience -- email jeffrey.young@huffingtonpost.com. Please include your phone number if you're willing to be interviewed.Poor enrollment during the first month, when only about 106,000 people were able to enroll in private insurance via the exchanges, left the administration far from the 7 million projected to sign up by the end of the enrollment period on March 31. During that same time period, 1.5 million people had completed applications and more than 200,000 were pending, suggesting that demand for coverage is high.Almost 20,000 people signed up using HealthCare.gov between Nov. 24 and Nov. 26, the most so far in a three-day stretch, The New York Times reported Friday. And enrollment in some state-run health insurance exchanges, such as those in California, Kentucky, New York and Washington state, accelerated during November.Health insurance consumers who failed to get through the application and enrollment process during the first two months of the sign-up period will be the administration's first targets, Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during the Sunday conference call.""While we certainly want to and will invite new consumers into the site, our focus is on making sure that those who have tried to enroll in the past several weeks are able to successfully complete that process,"" Bataille said.A large majority of visitors to HealthCare.gov should now be able to submit an application for health coverage and enroll into a plan online, Bataille said. ""About five weeks ago, we were seeing only about 30 percent of consumers with information on hand able to complete the application successfully online. Today, we're now more in the zone of about 80 percent of users being able to do that same process successfully,"" she said.The remaining consumers can still use alternate methods to enroll, such as the health insurance exchanges' telephone hotline, Bataille said. And people can purchase health plans directly from insurers or from agents and brokers, although tax credits to cut the cost of coverage are available only via the exchanges in most cases. The administration is testing a system that would let people apply for tax credits directly through 16 insurers in Florida, Ohio and Texas, and the early results are ""encouraging,"" Bataille said.In late October, the White House placed Zients in charge of the overhaul effort, and the Department of Health and Human Services appointed Quality Software Services Inc., a unit of the health insurance company UnitedHealth Group that is one of the exchanges' main architects, as lead contractor. Since that time, administration officials have maintained that HealthCare.gov would work for most users by the end of November.Zients said that goal has been met and emphasized that work on improving the website and its underlying technology will continue through March. The team repairing HealthCare.gov made more than 400 software fixes and upgraded the hardware supporting the system using a ""punch list"" of identified problems.""Over the last five weeks, we've made substantial progress working through the punch list. We've executed hundreds of software fixes and hardware upgrades and the site is now stable and operating at its intended capacity with greatly improved performance,"" Zients said. HealthCare.gov's failure rate has dropped from about 6 percent in October to 0.75 percent as of Friday, according to a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services on Sunday. The website was up and running 95 percent of the time as of Saturday, not counting scheduled maintenance, like an 11-hour period this weekend when applications and enrollments were offline -- an improvement from a low of 43 percent two months ago, the report says.Source: Department of Health and Human ServicesSource: Department of Health and Human ServicesSome problems remain unresolved and consumers and health insurance companies will still face difficulties, Bataille said. ""With any web project, there is not a magic moment but a process of continual improvement over time and we will continue to make enhances in the days, weeks and months ahead,"" she said.Health insurance companies have reported receiving incorrect information about their new customers since the beginning of the enrollment period and the administration is still working to fix these issues. Problems with the data HealthCare.gov sends to insurance issuers were a major part of the administration's push over recent says, Bataille said. Whether these flaws have been adequately addressed -- and whether consumers can be confident their enrollments are complete and their coverage will be effective next month -- won't be fully clear until more people sign up, Bataille said.""We need to see increased volumes of traffic and transactions, which we anticipate seeing over the course of the weekdays, to make sure that we get information from issuers and see the success rates they are having with the fixes put in place this week,"" Bataille said.Read the progress report on HealthCare.gov:  Healthcare.gov Progress Report"
1004	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/30/obama-health-care-reform_n_4361679.html	Opinion	0	Healthcare	Democrat Scandals	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Contrary to the cliché, there are second acts in politics. They just don’t usually come two months after the first.  On Nov. 30, the Obama administration will have a second chance to showcase its capacity to administer a website and oversee health care reform. Senior officials in the administration are quick to insist that the date is merely a point on a calendar, not a moment when a switch is suddenly flipped and all the problems surrounding Obamacare disappear.  But as a political matter, they also understand the scrutiny that comes after Nov. 30 will be heightened, and the stakes a bit higher. More than one administration official over the course of reporting this article said they fully expect that the first time a consumer encounters an error message on the website on Dec. 1, it will be used as a cudgel by the critics. Senate aides, meanwhile, say it's unclear how long a leash up-for-reelection Democrats would give the president should problems persist. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) may not be able to keep legislation reforming the Affordable Care Act off the floor absent major, tangible improvements. And so, as they enter , White House aides and ideological allies are taking steps to avoid repeating the disastrous first one. ""We are better prepared because the site is a better site,"" said one senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss post-Nov. 30 plans. ""We have visibility into the site, what’s happening with it, how many consumers are coming. It is vastly improved. It will allow us to adapt our tactics and tools to reach consumers in real time. And now, people all across the country have enrolled and we will continue to make sure their stories are told. It is different when you have lots of people enrolled as opposed to day one, when you had some people trying to enroll and who were stuck."" On a technological level, the administration is far ahead of where it stood on Oct. 1 -- an important but hardly remarkable feat considering how bad things were two months ago. Medicare spokeswoman Julie Bataille said that as of the end of November, approximately 50,000 users will be able to use HealthCare.gov concurrently, which will be the equivalent of more than 800,000 during a day. If user interest exceeds those numbers, the administration has set up “a customer-friendly queuing system which would notify you when to come back to the site and sort of be first in line,” Jeff Zients, President Barack Obama’s point man for rebuilding the website, told reporters in a Tuesday roundtable.The White House also hired a general contractor to set up a command center in Columbia, Md., that functions as a 24/7 monitoring and incident response team. The center, which is staffed by 25 people with different areas of expertise in web technology, will work with the White House to troubleshoot and react to incidents that may occur on healthcare.gov, in real-time. The better the website works, the logic goes, the easier it will be to manage the politics. But even so, the White House is also making administrative adjustments to HealthCare.gov in order to avoid a repeat the agony of those early October days. One (perhaps the only) unforeseen benefit of the website's disastrous rollout was that interest didn't wane as much as expected over the course of October. In addition to the stream of consumers looking to buy insurance, people wanted to see what the fuss was about -- like drivers who can't help looking at the car wreck across the freeway. So the administrators of the site got a healthy sense of when traffic peaks (around lunchtime) and when it lulls (the weekend). Looking forward, that data will allow them to help keep the number of visits to the site relatively steady.Hoping to manage Nov. 30th expectations, the administration has already told private insurers to hold back on advertising the exchanges, worrying that heavy traffic could overwhelm the servers. Allies in the progressive community, meanwhile, say they've been told to wait for word from the administration before sending out sign-up alerts to their email lists. Already, there has been evidence of some success in micromanaging the traffic flow. According to a 39-page “recess toolkit” put together by the White House for Democrats on the Hill, which was shared by an aide with The Huffington Post, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services was able to invite back, in clusters, nearly 275,000 consumers who had problems during the account creation process in early October. Of those who returned to the site, 92 percent successfully created an account on HealthCare.gov. Another Democratic Hill aide said the White House is expected to step up its consumer education and outreach in early December, particularly focusing on the 18-to-35-year-old demographic. Next week, for instance, the White House is planning a youth summit to ensure that young leaders understand the benefits of the health care law and help get the word out among their peers. That comes on top of the administration’s ongoing efforts to enlist athletes and celebrities to engage with youth on the law’s benefits.The White House is also trying to make it easier for Democratic lawmakers to go on offense this time around. In addition to the sending them home for the Thanksgiving recess with a 54-page packet of Affordable Care Act sign-up “success stories,” broken down by all 50 states, administration officials are encouraging Democrats to talk about a new report released by the White House Council of Economic Advisors showing how Obamacare is helping to slow health care costs, in turn helping the economy.Despite these steps, Democrats in and out of office have a hard time evincing much confidence that the political troubles caused by health care reform will dissipate quickly. Some are hopeful but not yet sold that the administration can successfully manage the next few months after being stunned by the ineptitude they exhibited around the website's launch. ""The website is getting better but it's not fixed,"" said one Democratic lawmaker. ""Don't even get me started on talking points. They should use the time they spend writing useless talking points fixing the website."" Even the administration acknowledges that success on Dec. 1 means that the website will function for some 80 percent of users. And with 20 percent still in the dark, critical focus will continue -- a scary proposition for many Democrats. One party operative who works on health care reform said that it remains a mystery as to how to respond to accusations that the president misled the public when he pledged that people could keep their insurance plans if they liked them. ""If there are good talking points around that, I haven't heard them,"" the operative said. Several other operatives, when interviewed for this piece, marveled at how the administration ""lost"" traditional media allies during the October rollout. Winning them back has proven difficult, though the White House is far better prepared for the media wars now than it was on Oct. 1. A Democratic aide familiar with White House strategy said the administration has given assurances that it will have a beefed-up, rapid-response operation to address new attacks or incorrect stories. They certainly have more manpower.   ""You have to remember what happened on Oct. 1,"" said the health care reform operative. ""There was a government shutdown. All the people who would have been part of the rapid response team were furloughed. That lasted for 16 days.""During the early weeks of October, nearly all the White House staffers chiefly responsible for pushing back against bad press and spreading good health care news were off the job. Eric Schultz, a White press official who worked during the shutdown and has health care reform under his portfolio, was so preoccupied with the shutdown that he was seen running the president's remarks to the podium -- a task usually reserved for a junior staffer. ""The shutdown wasn’t the root cause of the problem,"" commented one administration official, ""but it sure as hell didn’t help.""

Davies, who had trained Libyan security guards for the State Department, claimed he scaled a 12-foot wall that night, knocked out a terrorist with his rifle and later saw Stevens dead in the hospital.But four days later, The Washington Post reported that Davies had told his employer shortly after the attack that he never reached the compound that night, an account that conflicted with the one he had given to “60 Minutes,"" as well as included in a memoir. The memoir was published by a conservative imprint that is a subsidiary of CBS, a financial relationship that was not disclosed at the time of the broadcast.“60 Minutes” dodged questions for several days about the conflicting accounts. Fager later told HuffPost that Davies assured him that he was at the compound that night and the account revealed by The Washington Post wasn’t accurate. On Nov. 6, Fager was still standing by the report, telling HuffPost he was “proud” of it. One day later, The New York Times reported that Davies had also told the FBI he never reached the compound, the second known instance of Davies telling a different story than the one he told on “60 Minutes” and in his book. “60 Minutes” quickly pulled the story and Logan apologized on air the following morning.McClatchy raised more questions on Nov. 13 about the accuracy of the Benghazi report, beyond the issues with Davies' account, and “60 Minutes” acknowledged that the network was doing an internal review of the broadcast.Al Ortiz, executive director of standards and practices at CBS News, presented his findings in a memo to employees obtained by The Huffington Post. He wrote that the Benghazi story “was deficient in several respects” and suggested that “the wider reporting resources of CBS News” could have been employed to obtain information from the State Department and FBI that would have called into question Davies’ account before the report aired.“It’s possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside FBI sources could have found out that Davies had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story,” Ortiz wrote. Ortiz wrote that Davies’ statement to “60 Minutes” that he lied to his employer about his whereabouts the night of the attack but was telling the truth on air “should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process.”  In addition, Ortiz wrote that Logan’s “assertions that Al Qaeda carried out the attack and controlled the hospital were not adequately attributed in her report.”Ortiz also wrote that Logan’s October 2012 foreign policy speech, in which she spoke of the need for “revenge” for the Benghazi attack, was also problematic. “From a CBS News Standards perspective, there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda, while continuing to report on the story,” Ortiz wrote. One question that remains unanswered is how “60 Minutes” first reached Davies and what role his writing a book for Threshold Editions -– an imprint of Simon & Schuster, a subsidiary of CBS –- could have played in him appearing on air. There's been speculation that Logan's husband, a former defense contractor, could have been involved in getting him on air as well.In his memo to staff, Fager wrote that he asked Logan and McClellan, the producer, to take a leave of absence, which they agreed to do. “When faced with a such an error, we must use it as an opportunity to make our broadcast even stronger,” Fager wrote. “We are making adjustments at 60 Minutes to reduce the chances of it happening again.”Full memos from Fager and Ortiz, obtained by The Huffington Post are below:By now most of you have received the report from Al Ortiz about the problems with the 60 Minutes story on Benghazi.There is a lot to learn from this mistake for the entire organization. We have rebuilt CBS News in a way that has dramatically improved our reporting abilities. Ironically 60 Minutes, which has been a model for those changes, fell short by broadcasting a now discredited account of an important story, and did not take full advantage of the reporting abilities of CBS News that might have prevented it from happening.As a result, I have asked Lara Logan, who has distinguished herself and has put herself in harm’s way many times in the course of covering stories for us, to take a leave of absence, which she has agreed to do. I have asked the same of producer Max McClellan, who also has a distinguished career at CBS News. As Executive Producer, I am responsible for what gets on the air. I pride myself in catching almost everything, but this deception got through and it shouldn’t have. When faced with a such an error, we must use it as an opportunity to make our broadcast even stronger. We are making adjustments at 60 Minutes to reduce the chances of it happening again. There is a lot of pride at CBS News. Every broadcast is working hard to live up to the high standard set at CBS News for excellence in reporting. This was a regrettable mistake. But there are many fine professionals at 60 Minutes who produce some of the very best of broadcast journalism, covering the important and interesting stories of our times, and they will continue to do so each and every Sunday. Jeff Fager Chairman, CBS News Executive Producer, 60 Minutes  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS  My review found that the Benghazi story aired by 60 Minutes on October 27 was deficient in several respects:  --From the start, Lara Logan and her producing team were looking for a different angle to the story of the Benghazi attack. They believed they found it in the story of Dylan Davies, written under the pseudonym, “Morgan Jones”. It purported to be the first western eyewitness account of the attack. But Logan’s report went to air without 60 Minutes knowing what Davies had told the FBI and the State Department about his own activities and location on the night of the attack. --The fact that the FBI and the State Department had information that differed from the account Davies gave to 60 Minutes was knowable before the piece aired. But the wider reporting resources of CBS News were not employed in an effort to confirm his account. It’s possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside FBI sources could have found out that Davies had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story.   --Members of the 60 Minutes reporting team conducted interviews with Davies and other individuals in his book, including the doctor who received and treated Ambassador Stevens at the Benghazi hospital. They went to Davies’ employer Blue Mountain, the State Department, the FBI (which had interviewed Davies), and other government agencies to ask about their investigations into the attack. Logan and producer Max McClellan told me they found no reason to doubt Davies’ account and found no holes in his story. But the team did not sufficiently vet Davies’ account of his own actions and whereabouts that night.--Davies told 60 Minutes that he had lied to his own employer that night about his location, telling Blue Mountain that he was staying at his villa, as his superior ordered him to do, but telling 60 Minutes that he then defied that order and went to the compound. This crucial point – his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions – should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process.--After the story aired, the Washington Post reported the existence of a so-called “incident report” that had been prepared by Davies for Blue Mountain in which he reportedly said he spent most of the night at his villa, and had not gone to the hospital or the mission compound. Reached by phone, Davies told the 60 Minutes team that he had not written the incident report, disavowed any knowledge of it, and insisted that the account he gave 60 Minutes was word for word what he had told the FBI. Based on that information and the strong conviction expressed by the team about their story, Jeff Fager defended the story and the reporting to the press.--On November 7, the New York Times informed Fager that the FBI’s version of Davies’ story differed from what he had told 60 Minutes. Within hours, CBS News was able to confirm that in the FBI’s account of their interview, Davies was not at the hospital or the mission compound the night of the attack. 60 Minutes announced that a correction would be made, that the broadcast had been misled, and that it was a mistake to include Davies in the story. Later a State Department source also told CBS News that Davies had stayed at his villa that night and had not witnessed the attack. --Questions have been raised about the recent pictures from the compound which were displayed at the end of the report, including a picture of Ambassador Stevens’ schedule for the day after the attack. Video taken by the producer-cameraman whom the 60 Minutes team sent to the Benghazi compound last month clearly shows that the pictures of the Technical Operations Center were authentic, including the picture of the schedule in the debris.--Questions have also been raised about the role of Al Qaeda in the attack since Logan declared in the report that Al Qaeda fighters had carried it out. Al Qaeda’s role is the subject of much disagreement and debate. While Logan had multiple sources and good reasons to have confidence in them, her assertions that Al Qaeda carried out the attack and controlled the hospital were not adequately attributed in her report.--In October of 2012, one month before starting work on the Benghazi story, Logan made a speech in which she took a strong public position arguing that the US Government was misrepresenting the threat from Al Qaeda, and urging actions that the US should take in response to the Benghazi attack. From a CBS News Standards perspective, there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda, while continuing to report on the story.--The book, written by Davies and a co-author, was published by Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, part of the CBS Corporation. 60 Minutes erred in not disclosing that connection in the segment.

1161	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-ditz/obama-insider-threat_b_3588818.html	Opinion	1	National Security	Democrat Scandals	Negative	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Faced with a public backlash at the revelation of NSA surveillance against the average American citizen, the Obama Administration has responded with a new program, dubbed the ""Insider Threat"" program, which aims to preempt future whistleblowers from speaking out. The system works by encouraging government workers to rat out any coworkers they suspect of being potentially inclined to blow the whistle before any leaks are even attempted, with an eye toward rooting out potential ""threats"" and intimidating rank-and-file workers against even daring to risk revealing information about government crimes and abuses. It wasn't supposed to be this way. President Obama ran his initial campaign on a pledge for transparency and a promise to enhance whistleblower protection, both of which have been scrapped. Instead, the administration now forwards the narrative that whistleblowers by their very nature are a threat to national security, and that all government actions that aren't explicitly publicized by the White House are secrets as a matter of course. Government hostility to whistleblowers is nothing new, of course. Though the claims of grave danger stemming from making the public and ""the enemy"" (in many cases the two seem identical for the career bureaucrat) never pan out, whistleblowers have always faced threats both overt and covert, and attempted retaliation from all levels of government. In the past the worst of this retaliation was extralegal -- President Nixon ordered a break-in at the psychiatrist of whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg in the hope of uncovering something to use against him. That's no longer the case, however, as in spite of laws like the Whistleblowers Protection Act (WPA) of 1989 the retaliation against recent whistleblowers has primarily focused on threats of huge prison sentences, and in an era of secret laws and secret courts, those threats have more force now than in the past.The WPA, and efforts to enhance it like the No-FEAR Act, have at their core an exemption for ""national security,"" and in recent administrations the attempt to label anything and everything as a matter of national security has left them treating these laws as though they essentially don't exist. That's where the Insider Threat program comes in. Detailed by McClatchy newspapers in recent weeks, the new scheme encourages all agencies of the federal government to come up with their own disparate anti-whistleblower rules, at the center of which will be a threat to punish anybody who even suspects a potential whistleblower and doesn't turn them in. The details of the initiative get more terrifying the deeper one delves into them, with the conclusion that recent divorcees and people with perceived money troubles have to be turned in, and will face preemptive action against them, likely ending their careers on mere suspicion that they couldn't be trusted, when the chips are down, to continue betraying the public trust in the name of secrecy. With the ""national security"" exemption in the law, the administration may feel the initiative is secure, but the reality is that any efforts to use the exemption must pass muster in a court. Even in this security-mad era, no court is going to buy that the Department of Education or others implementing this program have real concerns that an internal whistleblower uncovering abuse is truly threatening the nation as a whole. Though it may take quite some time to get fleshed out in court, it is plain that the administration's hostility to whistleblowers has gone from pathological to downright illegal, as the Insider Threat program is explicitly designed to discriminate against whistleblowers (or even would-be whistleblowers) in ways banned under federal law.This level of hostility toward the public's right to know cannot be permitted, nor simply left for the courts to resolve. Congress should immediately push initiatives to bolster protections for whistleblowers to the extent that a sitting president can no longer threaten the entire class of government employees. From Peter Buxtun's revelation of the Tuskegee experiments of the 1960's to the wiretapping and torture revelations of today, whistleblowers have provided an essential check against government overreach and abuse. Now more than ever that's a check we need in place. Jason Ditz is news editor at Antiwar.com, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the cause of non-interventionism.

So, what happens is that the FBI — if, in fact, it now wants to get content; if, in fact, it wants to start tapping that phone — it’s got to go to the FISA court with probable cause and ask for a warrant.Rose: But has FISA court turned down any request?Obama: The — because — the — first of all, Charlie, the number of requests are surprisingly small… number one. Number two, folks don’t go with a query unless they’ve got a pretty good suspicion.Rose: Should this be transparent in some way?Obama: It is transparent. That’s why we set up the FISA court.Later in the interview, Obama said the program had ""disrupted"" terrorist plots in the United States as well as overseas. The president pointed specifically to the prosecution of Najibullah Zazi, who was arrested in 2009 as part of a plan to bomb the New York City subway system.""Now, we might have caught him some other way. We might have disrupted it because a New York cop saw he was suspicious,"" Obama said. ""Maybe he turned out to be incompetent and the bomb didn’t go off. But at the margins we are increasing our chances of preventing a catastrophe like that through these programs.""While Zazi's name has come up frequently in defense of the NSA, the Associated Press and others have thrown cold water on the talking point, stating that the email the NSA says led to the plot's disruption could have been intercepted without the PRISM program.Obama struck a similar tone during a June 7 speech in San Jose, Calif., saying that Congress has been briefed on the programs' details.""The programs are secret in the sense that they are classified. They are not secret, in that every member of Congress has been briefed,"" he said. ""These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.""White House chief of staff Denis McDonough also stood by the program on Sunday during an appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" insisting that Obama ""does not"" have privacy concerns related to the NSA's phone records collection.""The president is not saying, 'Trust me,'"" he said. ""The president is saying, 'I want every member of Congress, on whose authority we are running this program, to be briefed on it, to come to the administration with questions and to also be accountable for it.'"""

Do you know what people think of you guys?""""I told her that Washington needs to work more like Delaware,"" said Carper, a former governor of the state. ""In Delaware, Democrats and Republicans work together.""They have not worked together in Washington. And so the across-the-board cuts of the so-called ""sequester"" - which both Republicans and Democrats have said they oppose - took effect Friday night after President Barack Obama and Republican leaders failed to agree on a way to replace them with targeted spending reductions.Up until the final few days before Friday, when the reductions began because of a law enacted in 2011, constituents urged, some begged, lawmakers to avert them.The cuts threaten the U.S. economic recovery, could disrupt federal services from airports to national parks, and may force furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and employees of federal contractors, the administration says.""They want to kill us all,"" Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said of his constituents.Laura Zayner, a senior officer with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, was among 400 federal workers facing possible furloughs who came to Washington last week to lobby Congress.""We consider the furlough a slap in the face. We take it personally,"" Zayner said. ""We are not picking sides, Democrats or Republicans. But we want them to do their jobs and stop the cuts.""John Kelshaw, who works with the Internal Revenue Service, came to town from New Jersey. He and a few other federal workers met with Republican Representative John Runyan.""We told him that a lot of our people live paycheck to paycheck. We said, 'Give us a break,'"" Kelshaw said. He said Runyan, of New Jersey, listened but made no commitments. WHO'S TO BLAME?Polls so far show most Americans blame Republicans rather than Obama and his Democrats for the standoff. But that could change.Republicans insist that any deficit-reduction replacement deal include only spending cuts. Democrats want a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.According to a February 28 Gallup survey, 56 percent of those polled thought the cuts will damage the economy. The feeling crossed party lines, Gallup reported, with 64 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of Democrats agreeing they would inflict economic pain.Democratic Senator Mark Pryor said his constituents in Arkansas routinely ask him, ""'Why can't you guys work it out?'""Pryor said he tells them, ""Nobody has clean hands on this.""Both sides seem to size up any issue on a basis of who gets the political advantage, he said. ""If someone suddenly came up with a cure to cancer, the question in Washington would be, 'Is this good or bad for Obama?'""The president on Friday said of the cuts, ""This is not a win for anybody. This is a loss for the American people.""Hatch, of Utah, said he recently told his state legislature that he expected the federal government to impose the sweeping cuts. ""A number of them stood up and said maybe that's the only way we are going get any real reduction in spending,"" he said.On the other side, Representative Luis Gutierrez, a Chicago Democrat who won an 11th term last year with more than 80 percent of the vote, said his constituents ""tell me 'Keep on fighting, Luis, keep on fighting.'""Representative Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican whose district includes the shipbuilding yards in Newport News that are likely to be hit hard by cuts in military spending, was dismayed by the untargeted reductions.Rigell got a letter from a constituent last month that read in part, ""My husband, a project manager for the defense industry, went to work this morning to lay off half of his workforce because of sequestration.""In an interview, Rigell said, ""When I think they (shipyard workers) could lose their jobs because of the dysfunction in Washington ... this is not acceptable to me.""""I've been at that shipyard. Some of hardest working folks I know. They're coming in at 5:30 a.m. with a lunch bucket and making $35,000 a year and wondering if they'll have a job."" "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) Monday, calling him a ""schoolyard bully"" for trying to insert instructions into Senate budget negotiations that would prohibit raising taxes or the debt ceiling.""My friend from Texas is like a schoolyard bully,"" Reid said. ""He pushes everybody around and is losing, and instead of playing the game according to the rules, he not only takes the ball home with him but changes the rules. That way no one wins except the bully who tries to indicate to people he has won. We’re asking Republicans to play by the rules and let us go to conference.""""I object too, but what my friend suggests is fairly ridiculous if you want the truth -- before we go to conference determine what you do and not do in the conference, that's not how we do things around here,"" he continued.Cruz responded, ""I wasn't aware we were in a schoolyard.""""There's either an objection or no objection,"" Reid shot back. ""We've had enough of reserving the right to object.""""Reserving the right to object,"" said Cruz.""Mr. President, there is no such thing,"" Reid said.Cruz finally objected.The exchange came after Reid tried to move toward ""regular order,"" in which Senate Republicans appoint budget conferees to negotiate with the House, which passed its own budget resolution. The Senate passed a budget on March 23, neutralizing a key Republican talking point that the Senate had not passed a budget. The bill passed 50-49 with no Republican votes and increased taxes.Cruz, like many Republicans, had criticized the Senate for not passing a budget. ""As you know, we haven't had a budget in over three years,"" he said on Fox News in November 2012, before taking office. ""I think if the Democrats want to pursue big government policy, they ought to vote on it. They've got to go on record and say this is what we want to do, this is our budget."" "

1257	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/26/connor-boyack-police-reform_n_4149410.html	News	1	Civil Rights	Drugs	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	huffingtonpost.com	"This article is the third in a six-part series about the drug war and police reform. Read Part 2 here.SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah is one of the reddest and most culturally conservative states in America. The statehouse would seem to be about as fertile ground for reining in the drug war and curbing police abuse as the briny marshes and salt flats just outside the capital. But if anyone can bring Utah's conservatives on board with police reform, it's probably Connor Boyack, a clean-cut Mormon with a Republican background who is also pushing the state to nullify the Affordable Care Act.Boyack, 31, is the founder and president of the Libertas Institute, a state think tank with a libertarian bent. ""Utah politics is basically a debate between conservatives and libertarian-minded conservatives,"" he says. ""We help conservatives hone their free-market ideas, but we also want to persuade them to be more deferential to civil liberties. That I think is our niche.""Boyack wrote about public policy for several years on his personal blog, built up a readership, and in August 2010 was hired to lead the Utah chapter of the Tenth Amendment Center, an advocacy group that pushes returning federal power to the states. The boyish-looking student of political philosophy also worked on the 2010 campaign of Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee. His credentials on the right are sound.But he felt that more could be done on the state level, and in December 2011, he founded Libertas.""One thing I noticed at the Tenth Amendment Center is that while liberty-minded Utah legislators could join arms to push back the federal government, they weren't nearly as skeptical of the government here in Utah,"" Boyack says. ""But if the government violates your rights, you haven't been any less violated if it came from state or local government instead of the federal government. The thing we try to stress at Libertas is consistency.""He ran the organization part-time for about a year, but by January he had attracted enough funding that he was able to commit to it fully.""What makes Connor unique -- and most effective -- is that he's willing to take on issues that the mainstream political right is generally afraid to touch,"" says Michael Boldin, executive director of the Tenth Amendment Center. ""They might even agree with him on the issues, but don't want to upset the status quo, so they do and say nothing. Connor, on the other hand, recognizes that it takes risk to get things done. And he certainly takes risks.""Boyack gradually became interested in police reform as he was exposed to police abuse stories on social media. ""You can't really be active on Twitter or Facebook without seeing these stories, really on a daily basis,"" he says. ""And it isn't just the misconduct, it's that bad police officers are so rarely held accountable.""After law enforcement officials raided the Ogden, Utah, home of Matthew David Stewart in response to a tip that he was growing marijuana plants in his basement, leading to a gun battle that left one officer dead and five others wounded, Boyack watched closely to see whether that type of scenario would play out.""That case really catalyzed my focus. I watched at first from the sidelines -- followed the story closely. I'm not an activist or a protester. I tend to come at things from an education or legislative angle,"" he says.""As it unfolded the way that it did, I was really disappointed. Once again, the police weren't being held accountable. The media narrative was that Matthew was this evil cop-killer. My concern was with the underlying policy, from a legislative standpoint. The police should not have come in to Stewart's house the way they did, all over a few plants. The law just shouldn't allow that to happen.""As Stewart's supporters -- led by members of his family, as well as progressive activist Jesse Fruhwirth -- protested at Ogden city council meetings, Boyack took a broader view.""I think what the protesters were doing was important,"" he says. ""But my thinking was that this wasn't just happening in Ogden. Police militarization is happening everywhere. So we were more interested in looking at the state as a whole.""Boyack began reaching out to legislators, police organizations and activists to craft a bill that would restrict the use of SWAT teams to emergency scenarios, ones in which lives are at risk.The policy he's pushing is relatively straightforward. Currently, police in Utah may forcibly enter any home, at any time, so long as they've obtained a search warrant. Under Boyack's proposal, officers would be permitted to break into a home only when there is an imminent threat of a violent crime.The police would no longer be permitted to use battering rams or ""dynamic entry"" -- the term used to describe forcible entry, the use of flash grenades, and other paramilitary tactics -- to serve drug warrants. In Utah and across the country, drug investigations comprise the overwhelming majority of instances in which such tactics are used.Last August, the Standard-Examiner ran an editorial in support of Boyack's cause. ""Certainly, the use of a battering rams to combat minor offenses is something that should not occur,"" the paper wrote. ""These raids, as conducted now, are too dangerous.""""We're interested in saving lives,"" Boyack says. ""And we're as interested in saving the lives behind the gun as those in front of it.""Boyack uses that line often. It hints at the realpolitik that may help explain why his message is finding a receptive audience. A cop died during the Stewart raid, and several more nearly joined him. Particularly in conservative Utah, saving the lives of police officers is a more effective sales pitch than saving the lives of suspected drug offenders. ""I don't think there's any question about it. If this law had been in place in 2011, both Officer [Jared] Francom and Matthew Stewart would still be alive,"" Boyack says. Stewart committed suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial.Boyack says many of the lawmakers he's talked to about his bill have been supportive. Indeed, several told The Huffington Post that they see the need for police reform, though they would not say so for attribution.""The response has been surprisingly favorable,"" Boyack says. ""I think most lawmakers want to wait to see the final language, though. The bill should be collaborative, rather than combative. Few legislators will support a bill that's seen as anti-cop, but they're generally supportive of the higher idea.""Ideally, Boyack would like to get a conservative lawmaker who otherwise supports the drug war to sponsor the bill.""I think drugs should be decriminalized, but this bill isn't about legalization,"" he says. ""We can still keep drugs illegal, but enforce those laws in a way that doesn't put lives at risk. So I think it would be helpful to get a sponsor for the bill who has drug war bona fides, but understands that sending police officers to break into homes in the middle of the night creates unnecessary danger.""But he worries that many politicians may be reluctant to publicly embrace the bill, even if they think it's the right thing to do, because they fear retribution.""A few years ago, we tried to outlaw DUI checkpoints, which I think are a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and really are more about issuing citations and raising revenue for police departments than keeping the roads safe,"" he says. ""Law enforcement groups came out aggressively against the bill. But they also went after the bill's sponsor, [state Rep.] David Butterfield, when he ran for reelection.""That bill passed the Utah House, but died in the Senate in February 2012. State police groups organized to support Butterfield's primary opponent in the 2012 election, and Butterfield lost.""They got their scalp,"" Boyack says. ""I understand the concern about micromanaging police departments. I do. But everything police officers do is under authority given them by the legislature, through the people. It's the legislature's job to set the terms under which the laws will be enforced, and its the legislature's job to make sure our rights are protected, not just our safety.""Boyack is the bridge-builder in Utah's burgeoning police reform movement. His task is to forge ties between the state's legislators and other policymakers, and activists and the families of those killed by police.""By sticking his neck out and taking on a golden calf, he's able to bridge the divide with traditional political opponents,"" says The Tenth Amendment Center's Boldin.He's also the pragmatist. For the moment, the bill he and his organization have proposed addresses only forced-entry police raids. It would have had no effect on the police shootings, beatings, and other allegations of misconduct around Utah that weren't the result of drug raids.Some activists want to go further. They would like to see police get more training in interacting with the mentally ill, and they have called for the creation of civilian review boards with the teeth to issue subpoenas and force the termination of bad cops. Some, including Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank, think police need more instruction in conflict resolution, and that training and agency policy put too little emphasis on de-escalation, and too much on how and when to use force.But Boyack says that for now, focusing on forced-entry is a more realistic goal.""Our main goal here is to enact substantive reform. We don't just want a token bill that does more in name than in substance,"" Boyack says. ""But we also need a bill that will pass, and that will be reasonable. So for now, I think it makes sense to focus on the one area that will do the most good, and that in my opinion will save the most lives.""Continue to Part 4: An Occupy Activist's New Cause: Drug Raids And Police AbuseHuffPost writer and investigative reporter Radley Balko is also the author of the new book Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces."
1262	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/19/obama-pardon-crack-cocaine_n_4474876.html	News	0	Civil Rights	Drugs	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"President Barack Obama on Thursday commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates who were convicted of crack cocaine offenses, greatly expanding his use of the presidential clemency power to help those incarcerated because of harsh drug laws.In a statement, Obama said they'd been sentenced under an ""unfair system."" In 2011, Congress passed a law that effectively reduced the federal government's mandatory penalties for people convicted of crack offenses, but commuting the sentences represents the first time the reform has been applied to those convicted before it was adopted. ""If they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society,"" Obama explained in the statement. Three of the inmates -- Reynolds Wintersmith Jr., Clarence Aaron and Stephanie George -- were featured in a recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union about the thousands of people serving life in prison for nonviolent offenses. The report, which received attention from a range of media outlets, including The Huffington Post, revealed that more than 3,000 inmates were serving life without parole for drug, property and other nonviolent crimes as of 2012, comprising about 6 percent of the total life-without-parole population.Reynolds Wintersmith Jr., 39, has spent half of his life in prison, according to the report. He was arrested at 19 for dealing drugs and declined a plea offer of 10 years, choosing to go to trial. He was a street dealer, but opened himself up to the life-without-parole sentence because he was held accountable for the entire amount of cocaine sold as part of a conspiracy in which he had a small role. Clarence Aaron, 43, was sentenced to three life-without-parole sentences as a college student for playing a minor role in two large, planned drug deals. He wouldn't testify against his co-conspirators, but they testified against him and received reduced sentences. Stephanie Yvette George, 43, was sentenced to life in prison without parole at age 26 after the father of one of her children used her attic to store drugs and cash. The harshness of the sentence was due, in part, to prior convictions for selling small amounts of crack. Though George said she didn't know the drugs were hidden in her home, six cooperating witnesses testified that she was paid to store cocaine. Prior to Thursday, Obama had pardoned only 11 people for drug crimes, and had used his powers of clemency to provide relief to just 40 people in all -- fewer than any other modern president. In recent months, his administration has portrayed the country's tough drug policies as unjust, but his decision to commute these sentences may be the most significant step to curtail the war on drugs. In addition to the eight people convicted of crack offenses, he also pardoned 13 others for various crimes.Vanita Gupta, the deputy legal director of the ACLU, called the decision an ""incredibly important development."" ""The president took the enormous step of giving hope and new life to people who were doomed to die behind bars for nonviolent offenses,"" she said. ""Of course, we know there are thousands who are in similar situations in prison, and so now we really need to do the work to change the laws around the country to prevent these sorts of extreme sentences from taking place on our soil.""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated that the president had commuted the sentences of only 11 drug offenders prior to Thursday; that is in fact the previous number of pardons granted to drug offenders."
1265	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/05/dea-surveillance-cover-up_n_3706207.html	News	1	Democrat Scandals	Drugs	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatPositive	huffingtonpost.com	"By John Shiffman and Kristina CookeWASHINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.Although these cases rarely involve national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin - not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges.The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to ""recreate"" the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant's Constitutional right to a fair trial. If defendants don't know how an investigation began, they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence - information that could reveal entrapment, mistakes or biased witnesses.""I have never heard of anything like this at all,"" said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 2011. Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling than recent disclosures that the National Security Agency has been collecting domestic phone records. The NSA effort is geared toward stopping terrorists; the DEA program targets common criminals, primarily drug dealers.""It is one thing to create special rules for national security,"" Gertner said. ""Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations.""THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISIONThe unit of the DEA that distributes the information is called the Special Operations Division, or SOD. Two dozen partner agencies comprise the unit, including the FBI, CIA, NSA, Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Homeland Security. It was created in 1994 to combat Latin American drug cartels and has grown from several dozen employees to several hundred.Today, much of the SOD's work is classified, and officials asked that its precise location in Virginia not be revealed. The documents reviewed by Reuters are marked ""Law Enforcement Sensitive,"" a government categorization that is meant to keep them confidential.""Remember that the utilization of SOD cannot be revealed or discussed in any investigative function,"" a document presented to agents reads. The document specifically directs agents to omit the SOD's involvement from investigative reports, affidavits, discussions with prosecutors and courtroom testimony. Agents are instructed to then use ""normal investigative techniques to recreate the information provided by SOD.""A spokesman with the Department of Justice, which oversees the DEA, declined to comment.But two senior DEA officials defended the program, and said trying to ""recreate"" an investigative trail is not only legal but a technique that is used almost daily.A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who received such tips from SOD described the process. ""You'd be told only, 'Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.' And so we'd alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it,"" the agent said.""PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION""After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their investigation began with the traffic stop, not with the SOD tip, the former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as ""parallel construction.""The two senior DEA officials, who spoke on behalf of the agency but only on condition of anonymity, said the process is kept secret to protect sources and investigative methods. ""Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day,"" one official said. ""It's decades old, a bedrock concept.""A dozen current or former federal agents interviewed by Reuters confirmed they had used parallel construction during their careers. Most defended the practice; some said they understood why those outside law enforcement might be concerned.""It's just like laundering money - you work it backwards to make it clean,"" said Finn Selander, a DEA agent from 1991 to 2008 and now a member of a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, which advocates legalizing and regulating narcotics.Some defense lawyers and former prosecutors said that using ""parallel construction"" may be legal to establish probable cause for an arrest. But they said employing the practice as a means of disguising how an investigation began may violate pretrial discovery rules by burying evidence that could prove useful to criminal defendants.A QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY""That's outrageous,"" said Tampa attorney James Felman, a vice chairman of the criminal justice section of the American Bar Association. ""It strikes me as indefensible.""Lawrence Lustberg, a New Jersey defense lawyer, said any systematic government effort to conceal the circumstances under which cases begin ""would not only be alarming but pretty blatantly unconstitutional.""Lustberg and others said the government's use of the SOD program skirts established court procedures by which judges privately examine sensitive information, such as an informant's identity or classified evidence, to determine whether the information is relevant to the defense.""You can't game the system,"" said former federal prosecutor Henry E. Hockeimer Jr. ""You can't create this subterfuge. These are drug crimes, not national security cases. If you don't draw the line here, where do you draw it?""Some lawyers say there can be legitimate reasons for not revealing sources. Robert Spelke, a former prosecutor who spent seven years as a senior DEA lawyer, said some sources are classified. But he also said there are few reasons why unclassified evidence should be concealed at trial.""It's a balancing act, and they've doing it this way for years,"" Spelke said. ""Do I think it's a good way to do it? No, because now that I'm a defense lawyer, I see how difficult it is to challenge.""CONCEALING A TIPOne current federal prosecutor learned how agents were using SOD tips after a drug agent misled him, the prosecutor told Reuters. In a Florida drug case he was handling, the prosecutor said, a DEA agent told him the investigation of a U.S. citizen began with a tip from an informant. When the prosecutor pressed for more information, he said, a DEA supervisor intervened and revealed that the tip had actually come through the SOD and from an NSA intercept.""I was pissed,"" the prosecutor said. ""Lying about where the information came from is a bad start if you're trying to comply with the law because it can lead to all kinds of problems with discovery and candor to the court."" The prosecutor never filed charges in the case because he lost confidence in the investigation, he said.A senior DEA official said he was not aware of the case but said the agent should not have misled the prosecutor. How often such misdirection occurs is unknown, even to the government; the DEA official said the agency does not track what happens with tips after the SOD sends them to agents in the field.The SOD's role providing information to agents isn't itself a secret. It is briefly mentioned by the DEA in budget documents, albeit without any reference to how that information is used or represented when cases go to court.The DEA has long publicly touted the SOD's role in multi-jurisdictional and international investigations, connecting agents in separate cities who may be unwittingly investigating the same target and making sure undercover agents don't accidentally try to arrest each other.SOD'S BIG SUCCESSESThe unit also played a major role in a 2008 DEA sting in Thailand against Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout; he was sentenced in 2011 to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiring to sell weapons to the Colombian rebel group FARC. The SOD also recently coordinated Project Synergy, a crackdown against manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of synthetic designer drugs that spanned 35 states and resulted in 227 arrests.Since its inception, the SOD's mandate has expanded to include narco-terrorism, organized crime and gangs. A DEA spokesman declined to comment on the unit's annual budget. A recent LinkedIn posting on the personal page of a senior SOD official estimated it to be $125 million.Today, the SOD offers at least three services to federal, state and local law enforcement agents: coordinating international investigations such as the Bout case; distributing tips from overseas NSA intercepts, informants, foreign law enforcement partners and domestic wiretaps; and circulating tips from a massive database known as DICE.The DICE database contains about 1 billion records, the senior DEA officials said. The majority of the records consist of phone log and Internet data gathered legally by the DEA through subpoenas, arrests and search warrants nationwide. Records are kept for about a year and then purged, the DEA officials said.About 10,000 federal, state and local law enforcement agents have access to the DICE database, records show. They can query it to try to link otherwise disparate clues. Recently, one of the DEA officials said, DICE linked a man who tried to smuggle $100,000 over the U.S. southwest border to a major drug case on the East Coast.""We use it to connect the dots,"" the official said.""AN AMAZING TOOL""Wiretap tips forwarded by the SOD usually come from foreign governments, U.S. intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. Because warrantless eavesdropping on Americans is illegal, tips from intelligence agencies are generally not forwarded to the SOD until a caller's citizenship can be verified, according to one senior law enforcement official and one former U.S. military intelligence analyst.""They do a pretty good job of screening, but it can be a struggle to know for sure whether the person on a wiretap is American,"" the senior law enforcement official said.Tips from domestic wiretaps typically occur when agents use information gleaned from a court-ordered wiretap in one case to start a second investigation.As a practical matter, law enforcement agents said they usually don't worry that SOD's involvement will be exposed in court. That's because most drug-trafficking defendants plead guilty before trial and therefore never request to see the evidence against them. If cases did go to trial, current and former agents said, charges were sometimes dropped to avoid the risk of exposing SOD involvement.Current and former federal agents said SOD tips aren't always helpful - one estimated their accuracy at 60 percent. But current and former agents said tips have enabled them to catch drug smugglers who might have gotten away.""It was an amazing tool,"" said one recently retired federal agent. ""Our big fear was that it wouldn't stay secret.""DEA officials said that the SOD process has been reviewed internally. They declined to provide Reuters with a copy of their most recent review.

North Carolina has more than 400,000 jobless workers, making its 9.2 percent unemployment rate higher than the national average of 7.9 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.""Hundreds of thousands of jobless workers thrown out of work through no fault of their own will face deepening poverty as a result of this decision,"" the North Carolina Justice Center, a social justice advocacy group, said in a statement after the bill signing on Tuesday.""North Carolina's legislature and governor chose to permanently cut benefits, reduce employers' contributions over time, and reject $700 million in federal extended benefits,"" the center said.About 170,000 long-term unemployed workers in North Carolina will lose out on extra federal funds under the new law, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.Copyright 2013 Thomson Reuters.

'Twas ever thus, but now, ""big banks"" are doing so more overtly, and with more gusto, and with all kinds of interesting people helping them out. Per the WSJ:The banks have hired longtime, influential Washington hands to deflect regulatory and political pressure to strengthen their finances and to sell assets. Regulators and some lawmakers have raised concern that large banks remain ""too big to fail"" and could require another government bailout in the event of a new financial meltdown.The effort by banks marks a lobbying turning point for the industry, which adopted a mostly low-profile stance to new regulations in the wake of the financial crisis.Of course, most of us are nominally invested in the idea that the Obama administration is working to keep the excesses of these banks in check. I mean, just today, Bloomberg reminded everyone that President Barack Obama greeted the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act thusly: “Because of this reform, the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street’s mistakes...There will be no more taxpayer-funded bailouts -- period.”So, it would be quite reasonable to extract the notion, from that statement, that the Obama White House is fully on board with keeping tight rules on banks in place. Interestingly enough, however, someone who worked very hard to ensure Obama would be reelected to a second term does not appear to agree. Let's go back to that Wall Street Journal piece:Regulators and lawmakers increasingly are signaling that more work is needed to lessen the risk posed by large, complex banks, including bigger capital cushions and minimum amounts of expensive long-term debt.The moves by banks include pushing back against bipartisan legislation sponsored by Sens. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, and Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, that would sharply increase capital cushions at large banks to the point where most analysts expect firms would be forced to shrink.Stephanie Cutter, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, and Ed Gillespie, a former Bush administration official, are providing strategic advice to Bank of America on several issues, including efforts to break up the banks. Morgan Stanley recently hired Michele Davis, a top aide to former Bush administration Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, to help bolster the firm's credibility in Washington.So, Stephanie Cutter (who I guess may also soon be repping Bank Of America's point of view on a rebooted ""Crossfire"" for CNN?) is working to undermine ""tight rules"" on banks? That seems like an odd thing for someone who supported Obama's reelection to do. Or does it? Is the implication here that Obama would not sign Brown-Vitter? Or that he contends that ""bigger capital cushions"" are not required?It could mean that the White House isn't all that sincere about reining in the banks, maybe. It could also mean that the Obama White House will be battling its own adviser in the parking lot with tridents. I've not heard back from Cutter since I emailed her to ask, ""HUH WHAT NOW?"" But the day is young.By the way, here is a fun fact that pertains to why tighter rules on banks, specifically those designed to prevent ""Too Big To Fail"" failures, might be of pertinent interest to normal human Americans. Per Bloomberg, today:The firms that rate the creditworthiness of banks say the likelihood of a government rescue hasn’t gone away. Because of the implicit promise of bailouts, Moody’s Investors Service, the second-largest U.S. ratings company, has boosted the scores for the six banks. Each increase in credit grade makes borrowing less expensive.In a March 27 report, Moody’s displays a bar chart of its credit ratings for the banks in blue. In green bars, it shows Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo would be rated two grades lower if the taxpayer backstop didn’t exist. Moody’s boosted Morgan Stanley’s score by two grades for the same reason, even though it had downgraded that bank in June 2012.The scores for Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan (JPM) are three grades lower in the green bars.Debt sold by the holding companies of Bank of America and Citigroup (C), the second- and third-biggest U.S. banks by assets, would fall to junk status without the implicit government guarantee, Moody’s Senior Vice President David Fanger says.“They have a high probability of government support,” Fanger says.""Government guarantee"" means ""taxpayer guarantee,"" in the above construction. Taxpayer wealth is, to the banks' perspective, an implied asset on their balance sheet. So it's no wonder they don't worry about being overleveraged, and want to resist further regulations.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

""It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default,"" she wrote. ""There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution.""Palin went on to cite the Constitution's 14th Amendment. ""The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first,"" she wrote. ""We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first.""However, Palin suggested that Obama could face impeachment if he used the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling without congressional approval — an option endorsed in a Courier-Journal op-ed by constitutional lawyer Brianne Gorod. Former President Bill Clinton and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have also urged Obama to invoke the 14th Amendment if necessary. Palin, on the other hand, said any such action would be a ""betrayal"" of future generations.""It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense,"" Palin wrote. ""A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill."""

Their aim is to somehow debunk the common-sense fact that legal sourcing erodes the black-market profits of organized crime.The most recent argument thrown out in the anti-Prop. 19 campaign, claims that the California marijuana market is insignificant to Mexican drug traffickers. That argument was blown out of the water on October 18 when the Mexican Army and police seized 134 tons of marijuana, wrapped and ready to be smuggled from Tijuana across the border. The huge cache was estimated to be worth at least $338 million dollars on the street. Mexican authorities guessed that it was owned by the nation's most powerful drug-trafficking organization, the Sinaloa Cartel. Even if much of that is distributed to other states, the sheer size of the potential shipment shows that the U.S. marijuana market for Mexican traffickers, calculated at $20 billion a year, is well worth fighting for. Since before Prop. 19 came along, reports showed that Mexico's drug cartels were concerned about how U.S. production and legalization of medical marijuana cut into their profits. Prohibition creates the underground market that generates their economic, political and military strength. With the drop in income from marijuana sales, cartels have less money for buying arms and politicians, or recruiting young people into the trade.The drug cartels also consider the marijuana black market worth killing for. Just days after the historic bust, thirteen young men were massacred at a drug rehabilitation center. An anonymous voice came over police radio saying the act was ""a taste of Juarez"" and that up to 135 people could be murdered in retaliation for the bust--one per ton. Although calculating Mexican cartel earnings from marijuana sales will always be a guessing game, it's indisputable that as long as it's illegal every penny of those earnings goes into the pockets of organized crime. From the peasant who converts his land from corn to pot to feed his family, to the truckdriver who takes on a bonus cargo, to the Mexican and U.S. border officials who open ""windows"" in international customs controls, to the youth gangs who sell in U.S. cities--all are sucked into a highly organized and brutal system of contraband. Legalization in part of the world's leading market would take a huge chunk out of this transnational business.The government of Mexican president Felipe Calderon, along with Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos, has redoubled efforts in U.S. media and international forums to oppose the California legalization measure. This is not surprising. These two nations are deeply entrenched in a military-model drug war that has channeled a combined total of nearly $9 billion dollars in U.S. government funds to their governments. As in any war, powerful political and economic interests are at stake in perpetuating the drug war.It's interesting to see what they say though. Neither President Santos nor Calderon argue that legalization will strengthen drug cartels. Instead, both complain that legalization will erode their drug war by heightening the contradiction between violent crackdowns on growers and traffickers in their countries and the lax attitude toward consumption of marijuana in the United States.At a recent meeting of the Tuxtla Dialogue in Cartagena, Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos said, ""It's confusing for our people to see that, while we lose lives and invest resources in the fight against drug trafficking, in consuming countries initiatives like California's referendum are being promoted."" It's about time that contradiction was exposed. But the way to resolve it is not to increase fumigation operations that destroy peasant livelihoods and the environment and seizures of marijuana shipments that lead to the deaths of innocent civilians, while further criminalizing consumption in the U.S. The way to resolve it is to halt ineffective measures to stop marijuana use, and focus scarce resources on attacking the financial and violent aspects of transnational organized crime, and providing employment and services for vulnerable sectors. Legalization of marijuana, in addition to reducing the economic base of the cartels, frees up resources to do just that.In a report from the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy former presidents of Mexico, Colombia, Brazil called for discussion on legalizing marijuana, noting, ""Prohibitionist policies based on the eradication of production and on the disruption of drug flows as well as on the criminalization of consumption have not yielded the expected results. We are farther than ever from the announced goal of eradicating drugs."" They add that corruption and violence have increased throughout the region as result of the strategy. The war on drugs launched by President Felipe Calderon has led to more than 30,000 drug-related deaths since late 2006 and the skyrocketing of human rights violations committed by security forces. Last week an international Forum against militarization and violence in Ciudad Juarez, the epicenter of the drug war, was disrupted when police shot a peace protester.As Calderon insists that there is ""no alternative"" to the militarized drug war, a recent survey shows that three-fourths of Mexicans polled believe the drug war is failing. Particularly in border towns, grassroots organizations have formed to protest the violence and high social costs. Meanwhile, the government has largely bypassed non-violent ways to reduce the power of cartels, such as legalization, anti-money laundering efforts and social programs to strengthen affected communities in favor of the military/police model supported by the U.S. government. Organized crime is a business. Reducing demand through providing legal sources hurts that business. Hardline rhetoric and wars of statistics cannot change that fundamental equation. "

But the real news is how much money legalization could bring to the cash-strapped state government. California Attorney General Kamala Harris last week released a summary of the Marijuana Control, Legalization and Revenue Act, which backers are pushing for a spot in November's election. Though not an endorsement, Harris' generally positive title and summary of the initiative explained that it would legalize under state law marijuana use, growth, cultivation, possession, transportation, storage and sale. It also would create a regulatory commission, apply sales taxes, allocate revenue and prohibit discrimination against marijuana users and businesses. The summary says a legislative analyst estimated the initiative would save the state ""hundreds of millions of dollars.""Merry Christmas, indeed! Here's what the fiscal analysis had to say:Reduced costs in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually to state and local governments related to enforcing certain marijuana-related offenses, handling the related criminal cases in the court system, and incarcerating and supervising certain marijuana offenders. Potential net additional tax revenues in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually related to the production and sale of marijuana, a portion of which is required to be spent on education, health care, public safety, drug abuse education and treatment, and the regulation of commercial marijuana activities.As LA Weekly noted, there was a slight speed bump in the language of the initiative. It originally read that the law ""could"" protect people under age 21 from using marijuana, instead of ""shall"" protect them. An amended version is awaiting a title and summary from the attorney general, expected to be released on Jan. 31. ""We're expecting a title and summary nearly identical to the one that was just released, if not even more supportive,"" Dave Hodges, one of initiative's primary backers, told The Huffington Post. ""There isn't any change that would affect the title and summary that was released."" If Hodges is correct, the new title and summary would pave the way for advocates to gather signatures supporting adding the initiative to the November ballot.The move could come at a good time for California, which has struggled with crippling budget deficits over the past decade. Though the state has seen notable financial success under Gov. Jerry Brown's Proposition 30, which temporarily raises taxes, the pot initiative could add much-needed cushioning when the proposition expires in 2018. "

He says his company is joining forces with a Washington state chain of medical marijuana dispensaries run by John Davis, the Northwest Patient Resource Center, as well as dispensaries in Colorado and California.Shively's planned investment will total $100 million over three years, according to the Stranger. ""This historic step today is to be observed and evaluated closely by all of us, because it is a game changer,"" Fox said. ""I applaud this group that has the courage to move ahead. They have the vision, they are clear where they're going, and I'm sure they're going to get there.""Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who was Mexico's president from 2000-06, specified that he's not involved in the venture. He appeared at Shively's invitation. The two first met 13 years ago, when a company Shively used to run was opening a computer center in Sinaloa and Fox appeared at the inauguration, Shively said.Shively described grand visions for his pot brand – hundreds of millions of dollars in investments, tens of millions of customers, more than 1,000 jobs just at Diego Pellicer's Seattle headquarters.""Yes, we are Big Marijuana,"" he announced.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last March, the company wrote that it had raised $125,000 of an anticipated $625,000. Shively suggested those numbers were outdated, but did not provide different figures.Washington and Colorado expect to begin allowing marijuana sales to adults over 21 at state-licensed stores beginning next year, but marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and the Justice Department has repeatedly said it can continue to prosecute large-scale, privately owned marijuana operations even when they comply with state law.It isn't clear how Shively's plans for a national marijuana brand might be accomplished without running afoul of federal laws regarding the distribution of an illegal substance or conspiracy to distribute an illegal substance. He and Davis said no money from their business will travel interstate, nor will the marijuana itself, but neither of those factors would necessarily shield them from arrest.Shively insisted that his deals with the dispensaries are structured in such a way as to minimize any risk of federal prosecution, but neither he nor Davis would explain how. Shively said he had acquired certain ""rights"" related to the dispensaries, and made the plan sound like a marketing agreement by which the stores, beginning next month, would be re-branded as Diego Pellicer.""Neither Diego Pellicer nor our investors are exposed to any significant risk, in terms of criminal risk,"" Shively said. ""In terms of criminal risk, that is vastly mitigated. ... We're making strategic investments, but we're making them in such a way that they are not in violation of either federal or state law.""Asked how his plan didn't constitute a federal conspiracy to distribute marijuana, Shively described his operation as ""a conspiracy to obey the law.""His securities lawyer, Mike Moyer of the prominent Seattle firm of Dorsey and Whitney LLC, declined to elaborate.Fox urged the reporters present to maintain a focus on the important issues at hand: the failure of the drug war, the thousands of lives lost, and the better alternative offered by legalization. He noted he'd rather be sitting at a table next to Shively than the notorious cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.""This is a much better option, no doubt,"" he said.___Johnson can be reached at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle"

Yet between 2001 and 2010, there were over 8 million pot arrests in the U.S. What's worse, the authorities making the arrests were targeting black Americans far more than whites.According to a new study from the American Civil Liberties Union, which tracked marijuana arrests by race and county in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, black and white Americans use marijuana at about the same rate. However, blacks were nearly four times as likely than whites to be arrested on charges of marijuana possession in 2010. In Washington D.C., Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois, blacks were 7.5 to 8.5 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possessing pot.Most of the people being arrested weren't drug kingpins. Fifty-two percent of all drug arrests in 2010 were for marijuana, and according to the ACLU's analysis, most of the arrestees were in possession of small amounts of the drug.Having a black president hasn't eased this racial disparity, either. During President Barack Obama’s first three years in office, the arrest rate for marijuana possession was about 5 percent higher than the average rate under President George W. Bush, The New York Times reported.Obama's first term in office was also marked by an economic recession, a soaring deficit (due to the cost of the Bush tax cuts and two wars) and numerous budget battles that threatened to cause state and federal government shutdowns. In the midst of this, the costs of the War on Marijuana continued to rise.In 2010, states spent an estimated $3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws, which was a 30 percent increase from a decade earlier. Such a large amount of funding provides a strong financial incentive for police to make arrests and boost their crime-fighting statistics, the ACLU reported. In fact, that same year, more people were arrested for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.""In the past 75 years we have seen mounting evidence of the benign nature of the marijuana plant, and its tremendous potential for medical development,"" Amanda Reiman, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance said in 2012. ""But the rampant misinformation about the effects of marijuana USE is dwarfed by the lifetime of suffering that a marijuana CONVICTION can bring.""Click here to download the full report. "
1449	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/14/obama-jobs-plan_n_2450429.html	Opinion	1	Economy	Economy	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- On election night in Chicago two months ago, President Barack Obama triumphantly pledged to fight for a middle class he'd appealed to relentlessly -- and successfully -- on the 2012 campaign trail.""I believe we can build on the progress we've made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunity and new security for the middle class,"" Obama said. ""I believe we can keep the promise of our founders, the idea that if you're willing to work hard ... you can make it here in America.""The central challenge of Obama's second term is whether he can keep that founder’s ""promise"" to working Americans. It won't be easy, and in an era of divided government and amid cries for austerity and budget cuts, it does not seem likely that the president will offer sweeping new proposals to do so. The administration has said that its top two priorities at the outset of its second term are immigration reform and gun control. Despite an ongoing jobs crisis, creating quality jobs seems to have fallen a few slots on the president's to-do list.As Obama implicitly acknowledged, the American middle class has fallen on hard times, saddled with historic levels of debt, skyrocketing health care costs and flat wages. By most accounts, middle-class Americans are no better off than they were when the president took office in 2009, in the wake of an unprecedented financial crisis and in the midst of the Great Recession. The arithmetic is stark. Median household income is lower than when Obama took office, according to Census Bureau data -- lower even than when President Bill Clinton left office in 2001. The middle 60 percent of households -- those earning between $20,262 and $101,582 -- captured a smaller share of aggregate income in 2011 than they did in 2009, while the top fifth, which already made more than the other groups combined, captured more. Surveys of public opinion reveal a middle class that is smaller, poorer and less optimistic than ever. And although the unemployment rate fitfully has fallen below 8 percent for the first time since Obama's 2009 inauguration, most new jobs are too low-paying to sustain middle-class families.There is more to the plight of the American middle class than numbers can express -- and a greater threat to the country than economists can quantify. Democracy, after all, can't thrive without a broad, strong, educated core of citizens. But today they find themselves buffeted by the remorseless dictates of global capital, the need for evermore education and training and the burdens of higher taxes to pay for social programs they need, such as health care.Battling these global and cultural trends is difficult. In fact, it is unfair to ask any one person -- even a president, even Barack Obama -- to overcome them all. The president’s first responsibility in 2009 literally was to do his part to save the world’s frozen capital, banking and trade systems -- without which the American middle class would have had no prospects at all.Most fair-minded observers would say that Obama did his part, and acquitted himself well under crushing circumstances. A workable and affordable health care system, the central legislative success of his first term, can (if he sets it up properly) be of great benefit to middle-class workers.But now he must make good on his own promise -- not always central to his discourse or decision making -- to find more good-paying middle class jobs.How?On the stump this year, the president made manufacturing a centerpiece of his vision, arguing that a combination of tax reform, investment and education could help repatriate quality jobs to U.S. soil and stabilize the middle class. Perhaps sensing the political popularity of such an idea in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan, the Obama campaign set the lofty but achievable goal of creating a million new manufacturing jobs during the president's second term. In a recent interview on ""Meet the Press,"" the president renewed his commitment to investing in infrastructure, which he called ""broken,"" as another way to create good-paying jobs.   With the conversation in Washington focused not just on austerity but how much austerity to apply to a sputtering economy, it's hard to imagine what kind of rebooted jobs plan the president could propose for his next term while staying within the bounds of political reality.""In the short term, we are in a pretty difficult spot,"" said John Schmitt, an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who studies economic inequality and unemployment. ""Even if there was a serious commitment on the part of the administration towards a jobs program of some sort, it would run into a lot of trouble in the Congress."" Without a clear and politically viable policy objective for jobs -- unlike, say, banning high-capacity magazines to address mass shootings -- the administration is likely to continue the piecemeal approach to economic recovery that it took for most of the president's first term, observers say.Obama's landmark 2009 stimulus bill pumped billions of dollars into the ailing economy, stemming the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. The bill addressed the short-term fallout in the private sector by cutting taxes and pouring money into infrastructure projects and expanded unemployment insurance benefits. But since then, additional spending has been all but off the table. Obama has repeatedly proposed more infrastructure spending, but the White House has routinely given up such demands in negotiations with congressional Republicans.The lack of stimulus since the initial package -- aside from the repeated extensions of long-term unemployment insurance -- has exasperated left-leaning and centrist economists.""The answer is very clear: We need substantial additional stimulus to support the economy,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a left-of-center think tank. ""We are choosing, as a country and as a town [Washington], not to do it, with millions of jobless workers."" To address the decline in manufacturing jobs, the Obama administration has undertaken a number of modest initiatives, such as launching a manufacturing institute in Youngstown, Ohio, with $30 million in federal funding, a joint effort between industry and schools to train workers for tomorrow's manufacturing jobs. The Youngstown facility focuses on training workers for 3-D printing technology, the kind of modern manufacturing industry where observers see a lot of potential.The facility is an acknowledgment that tomorrow's manufacturing jobs will be different from the ones of the past. Gone are the days when a new high school graduate could show up at the factory door, get trained on the shop floor and earn a good wage and a pension. Jobs like those in 3-D printing require more advanced training and a certain degree of computer literacy. The same goes for other areas where experts, as well as the White House, see promise, like industrial robotics or nanomanufacturing. Obama's own tech advisers have warned that the country's ""historic leadership"" in manufacturing technology is ""at risk"" if it can't cultivate the right talent for these fields.In his 2013 budget proposal, Obama called for devoting $1 billion to create a national network of institutes like the one in Youngstown -- a recommendation that hasn't exactly become a priority for Congress. Neither have the loftier goals of his earlier manufacturing package, such as extending tax breaks to companies that return jobs to U.S. shores. They appear unlikely to move forward in a second term, even if the president chooses to champion them. ""The administration has done some things but could do a lot more to help manufacturing,"" said Scott Paul, director of the non-profit Alliance for American Manufacturing. What the White House has done so far is ""not well-publicized or well-known. They will ultimately be helpful, but so much of the debate has become politicized, it's hard to make progress on some of the meaningful issues.""And in the end, the manufacturing plan still faces some cold mathematics. The U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the first decade of this century, falling from 17 million to 12 million. Fewer than 9 percent of American workers have manufacturing jobs, compared with more than 20 percent in 1979. Creating a million new such jobs puts only a dent in that sector's -- and the middle class's -- long-term woes.""It doesn't come close to restoring manufacturing employment to what it had been,"" Paul noted, adding that he still found the goal admirable.Even setting aside the immediate joblessness crisis, Obama still faces the long-term problems of deteriorating wages and growing income inequality for the poor and middle class. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of American households captured more than 38 percent of income growth, while the bottom 90 percent received just shy of 37 percent, according to EPI. The Great Recession technically ended halfway through 2009, but the economic recovery of the past few years is replacing office workers, real estate brokers and insurance claims adjusters with retail salespeople, restaurant workers and warehouse hands. Mid-wage jobs -- ones with median hourly wages ranging from $13.84 to $21.13 -- accounted for 60 percent of the jobs lost during the recession, according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. During the recovery since then, mid-wage jobs have represented just 22 percent of growth. Jobs earning less than $13.84 per hour made up 58 percent of recovery growth, according to the NELP. The president pledged during his 2008 campaign that by 2011 he would have the minimum wage raised to $9.50 and pegged to inflation, a move that worker advocates have clamored for for years, claiming it would help raise the wage floor for the working poor and the middle class. But the federal minimum wage remains $7.25 per hour, well below a living wage in most areas.Many of those same worker advocates tie the stagnation of real wages to the decline of collective bargaining in the workplace. The rate of unionization in the U.S. has fallen to a historic low, with just 7 percent of private-sector workers now belonging to a union. Labor leaders believe that labor law needs to be amended to make it easier for workers to join unions. Their best shot came and went under the president's watch, when Democrats failed to pass the Employee Free Choice Act when they controlled both chambers of Congress.""I do feel disappointment,"" said Schmitt, the Center for Economic and Policy Research economist. ""That said, we're also in a [political] context where it's extremely difficult to make any progress on the concerns of low- and middle-wage workers.""Despite those shortcomings, and despite the acrimony on Capitol Hill, liberals like Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO federation of unions, are bullish on Obama's second term, given the focus on the middle class and jobs during the election. ""It all starts with the political will, or the national appetite, to again create jobs that are going to be family-supportive and middle-class producing, and I think that's underway right now,"" Trumka said. ""People are talking about it. That's the difference between this election and the ones in the past. We actually had a debate about what's hollowing out the country and what isn't. And our side won, big time.""Now the president’s challenge is to turn that political victory into an economic one for the people who supported him.This article is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post that closely examines the most pressing challenges facing President Obama in his second term.

Goldman shares sank more than 2 percent.That court let the NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund, which owned some mortgage-backed certificates underwritten by Goldman, sue on behalf of investors in certificates it did not own, but which were backed by mortgages from the same lenders.Goldman and other banks have faced thousands of lawsuits by investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage securities.The bank has said that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand could cost Wall Street tens of billions of dollars.Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally had no immediate comment, saying the bank's lawyers had yet to review the order.Lawyers for the NECA-IBEW fund were not immediately available for comment.Fred Isquith, a lawyer specializing in class action and securities litigation who is not involved in the case, said Monday's order is important because of the amount of mortgage litigation in the 2nd Circuit, home to Wall Street, but said the fallout might be less than Goldman fears.""If you expand the number of securities, you expand the amount of potential damages,"" said Isquith, a partner at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz and former president of the National Association of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys. ""How much more? I'm willing to bet dollars to donuts that when it comes down to dealing with actual damages, it will be less than they argued.""Goldman shares were down $3.43, or 2.2 percent, at $151.41 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.""VEXATIOUS"" LITIGATION FEAREDAt issue was whether the NECA-IBEW fund, a Decatur, Illinois, electrical workers' union pension fund that bought certificates from two of 17 trusts under a 2007 registration statement, could sue on behalf of investors in all 17 offerings.The 2nd Circuit let the fund sue over seven of the offerings: the two it invested in, plus five others that also contained loans from GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, later part of Capital One Financial Corp, and Wells Fargo & Co. It said the other 10 offerings were too different.Theodore Olson, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher representing Goldman, warned in court papers that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand ""will effectively increase by tens of billions of dollars the potential liability that financial institutions face in this and similar class actions.""Goldman said the case also merited review because it conflicted with a decision by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals involving Japan's Nomura Holdings Inc.But Darren Robbins, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing the NECA-IBEW fund, said both decisions ensure that class representatives have ""a genuine stake in establishing liability on all of the claims asserted.""The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported Goldman, saying the 2nd Circuit decision encouraged ""vexatious, abusive litigation and coercive multi-million or billion dollar settlements to the detriment of the nation's economy.""The case is Goldman Sachs & Co et al v. NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-528.(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Howard Goller, Gerald E. McCormick, Jeffrey Benkoe and David Gregorio)"

The two had crossed paths before.The filmmaker tells The Huffington Post that he had actually met Romney at a previous fundraiser, held months before at the home of private equity manager Marc Leder. At that event, which included drinks and a quick speech by the presidential candidate, the would-be filmmaker also tended bar.He and Romney shared a typical bartender-to-patron moment.""I handed him a diet Coke with lemon on it,"" the filmmaker recalled, ""because I was told that that's what he drank.""Romney didn't acknowledge his server at all.""He took it and turned and didn't say anything,"" the filmmaker explained.

The poll, funded by the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change, showed that voters across party lines were overwhelmingly in favor of extending the benefits, with 63 to 68 percent of voters in each district expressing support for preserving jobless benefits.Voters in the four districts surveyed said they were less likely to vote for the Republican incumbent in 2014 -- by at least a 9-point margin -- were he to vote to cut off extended unemployment benefits.Though jobless benefits are set to expire on Dec. 28 for 1.3 million longterm unemployed Americans, members of the House and Senate have returned home for the holidays without a solution to preserve those benefits. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said it was an ""immorality"" that the benefits weren't secured in a recent budget deal, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has promised to bring the extension to a vote no later than Jan. 7, 2014. Moderate Republicans urged Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) to rescue jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed earlier in December, saying the issue was ""important to many American families."" But Boehner would only consider the proposal if cuts were made elsewhere and job growth guaranteed, and the measure ultimately did not make it into Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep.

""All these struggling Americans got from the GOP for Christmas was a ‘Get Employed Soon’ card.""Funk warned cuts to jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed would only put more Americans out of work, and bring a chain reaction of economic fallout in 2014.""But it’s not just in America’s economic interest to extend [unemployment insurance] benefits, these polls show it’s in swing district Republicans’ own political interest to support the jobless in their districts,"" Funk said.

So why, in an exclusive survey of fast-growth CEOs, do 36 percent of these entrepreneurs say they’d support Hillary Clinton for President? That's more than any other potential Presidential candidate except for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whom 47 percent of survey respondents said they would support.The findings are based on a survey of the Inc. 5000, our annual ranking of the fastest-growing private U.S. companies.Some of the other contenders were Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, with 34 percent; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with 31 percent; and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, with 21 percent. After Clinton, the best-scoring Democrat was New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Nine percent of fast-growth entrepreneurs said they’d support him. Strange BedfellowsThe conventional wisdom is that two-thirds of business owners are Republican and one-third are Democrats. That’s misleading. In the Inc. survey, 47 percent of fast-growth CEOs describe themselves as Republicans, compared to only 17 percent who say they’re Democrats. But more than a third--36 percent--say they’re independents.When asked about their political philosophy, as opposed to party affiliation, the results are telling. Only 31 percent say they’re conservative. Liberals are an even smaller minority, at only 10 percent. Everyone else--a whopping 59 percent--claims to be moderate.Women CEOs, not surprisingly, are even less likely to be Republican. About a third of fast-growth women entrepreneurs said they are Republicans, a third said they are Democrats, and about a third are independents. While about two-thirds of fast-growth CEOs who are men voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the last U.S. presidential election, more than half the women--53 percent--voted for Barack Obama. The fact that so many of the Inc. 5000 consider themselves moderates doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for candidates on either edge of the political spectrum, be they Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (6.3 percent) or Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas (15 percent). But it leaves plenty of business owners who are willing to back a Democratic woman for President--especially one whose bridge-building efforts have won praise from both sides of the political aisle and who is widely regarded as having had a successful tenure as the U.S. Secretary of State. Forty percent of fast-growth CEOs who said they were independents also said they’d back Clinton. Eighty-seven percent of Democrats said they’d support her, as did 13 percent of Republicans. Among women, 61 percent said they’d back Clinton for President. It’s telling that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican who got flak from his own party by appearing to buddy up with President Obama just a bit too much during Hurricane Sandy last year, was the only one to make a stronger showing than Hillary. More than half of independents--53 percent--said they’d back Christie for president.It undoubtedly helps both Christie and Clinton that neither of them is currently serving in Washington. When it comes to the federal government shutdown, the threatened debt default, and the record-breaking level of dysfunction in D.C., their hands are clean. For now.Based on the results of an October survey of Inc. 5000 entrepreneurs. The survey had 306 respondents.

Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.), feeling sandbagged, got into a heated exchange with House Speaker John Boehner soon after the decision was made to adjourn without taking up the relief bill. Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) told reporters that he was ""utterly devastated."" From New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie declaimed that the House had ""failed that most basic test of public service,"" adding, ""Shame on you. ... [This] is why the American people hate Congress."" (Curiously, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg greeted the news with something of a bemused shrug.)But when it comes to unrelenting anger over the Sandy relief bill, none can hold a candle to Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), whose fury at the delay was hardly assuaged when the package finally passed at the end of January -- it merely turned on his GOP colleagues who refused to vote ""yes"" on the aid's passage. And, now, he's not happy about Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) making the fundraising rounds in New York City, after Rubio cast a ""no"" vote on the relief bill's passage. As Politico reported Wednesday, Rubio's been working Wall Street in order to ""lock down some of Wall Street’s biggest donors ahead of the 2016 presidential race."" According to Ben White and Maggie Haberman, not only do ""campaign finance experts"" deem Rubio's efforts to be logical in the main, they're also shrewd tactically: Rubio's aggressive early Wall Street outreach comes as yet another potential 2016 GOP hopeful, Christie, is limited in his ability to raise money from his many supporters in the financial world. Strict federal ""pay-to-play"" laws ban contributions from those who might seek bond underwriting and some other forms of business from New Jersey.But King is spitting fire at Rubio for having the chutzpah to come begging in the Big Apple. Here he is in an interview with Colin Campbell at the New York Observer's Politicker blog:""Being from New York we're not supposed to be suckers,"" Mr. King told Politicker this morning. ""It's bad enough that these guys voted against it, that's inexcusable enough. But to have the balls to come in and say, 'We screwed you now make us president?'""Mr. King went on to urge Empire State donors to cut off Mr. Rubio and any other member of Congress who ""threw a knife in the back in New York"" by voting ""no"" on the bill.For King, this is just keeping an apocalyptic commitment he made, way back when the Sandy relief bill was left on the floor of an adjourned House of Representatives, to nurture a longstanding grudge:As HuffPost reported:""I'm saying right now, anyone from New York or New Jersey who contributes one penny to congressional Republicans is out of their minds,"" he said in an interview on Fox News. ""Because what they did last night was put a knife in the back of New Yorkers and New Jerseyans. It was an absolute disgrace.""Well, no one can say they weren't warned.Elsewhere in his Politicker interview, King professes a distaste for his party's ""anti-Northeast attitude,"" demonstrated -- to his mind, fittingly -- by the snub Christie received from Conservative Political Action Conference organizers. He expanded on this in an interview with The Hill:""If Republicans had any brains they'd stay away from CPAC,"" King said. ""The thought that he's being penalized because he sought to get the aid for Sandy relief is disgraceful regional bias. To hold that out against him shows a narrow-minded bigotry from the party.""READ THE WHOLE THING: Pete King Can't Believe Rubio Has the 'Balls' to Fundraise in New York [Politicker] GOP lawmaker: CPAC snub of Christie shows 'narrow-minded bigotry' [The Hill][Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

Chris Christie, who could leave before a second term ends to run for president, and Barbara Buono, a little-known state senator who was the only Democrat willing to challenge the popular incumbent.Polls opened at 6 a.m. and will close at 8 p.m.Christie has been barnstorming the state by bus since Wednesday to drive up turnout. Polls leading up to Election Day showed him with a 20-plus point advantage as he pushes for a landslide to burnish his bipartisan credentials and show how well a reach-across-the-aisle Republican can do in a Democratic-leaning state. Christie is looking to become the first Republican running statewide to break 50 percent since George H.W. Bush in 1988.Buono campaigned without the aid of big-name Democrats. She also was spurned early on by Democratic leaders who control party politics in the state. They have a good working relationship with Christie and didn't believe the progressive from Metuchen, on the fringes of the New York City metropolitan area, could win.Christie, 51, was already popular when Superstorm Sandy slammed into the coast a year ago, damaging 360,000 homes and businesses, plunging 5.5 million people into darkness and disrupting gasoline supplies for days. His popularity skyrocketed as he donned a blue fleece pullover and led the state through its worst natural disaster, whether he was embracing President Barack Obama during a visit to the battered coast or consoling a tearful 9-year-old who had lost her house.Christie underwent weight-loss surgery in February and has been shedding pounds steadily since, addressing a health issue that could affect his political plans in the future. He was disqualified as a 2012 vice presidential candidate after refusing to answer questions about his health and other matters, according to a new book on last year's presidential campaign.Christie has refused to rule out a presidential run, which may mean he could resign before his second term ended.Nearly half of New Jersey residents think he'll run, according to a recent poll.Buono, 60, has portrayed Christie's ambitions as a negative. In an interview on MSNBC on Monday, she said the governor is putting his personal ambitions ahead of the needs of the state.Buono has also challenged Christie on gay marriage, which she supported and he opposed before it became legal in New Jersey last month. She criticized Christie's budget priorities — refusing to reinstate a surcharge on millionaires while trimming a property tax credit for the working poor, for example — and his veto of legislation raising the minimum-wage.Though a majority of New Jersey residents agree with Buono on social issues, she has been unable to get out from a campaign Catch-22: She couldn't get her message out because she hadn't raised a lot of money for advertising, and she had trouble raising money because voters didn't know her.Democrats, including Buono, rejected Christie's minimum-wage compromise of scaling back an increase and phasing it in over three years, and instead decided to put the question to voters.So voters are being asked in ballot question No. 2 to increase the minimum wage by $1, to $8.25 per hour, and to allow annual cost-of-living increases based on inflation. They'll also be asked to allow veterans' groups to use proceeds from games of chance to run their organizations.Voters will also choose their legislative representatives. Democrats now control both the Senate and Assembly with all 120 seats up for election.

Any move to restrict polluting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, they maintained, would send energy costs up and lead to mass layoffs in a vital job sector. At a press conference last Thursday, House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) blasted the expected proposal as “absolutely crazy.” “Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs at a time when the American people are still asking where are the jobs?” he asked.But experts who have studied the intersection of environmental policy and the job market say there's little truth to this claim, if any. Such assertions are ""wildly overstated,"" said Richard Revesz, the director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University. He framed Boehner's remark as the latest iteration of a “job-killer meme” that has surfaced frequently in recent years as Republicans have sought to drum up fears about Obama’s environmental efforts. “We hear often that large swaths of the economy will be wiped out due to one regulation or another,” Revesz said. “Fortunately, and not surprisingly, we don't see those predictions coming true.” In a comprehensive 2012 review of more than 25 studies that attempted to gauge the effect of environmental regulations on jobs, a team of researchers led by Revesz found that many claims about such regulations were unreliable.While studies commissioned by the coal industry warned that millions of jobs could be lost, others conducted by left-leaning think tanks and environmental groups predicted that millions of jobs would be gained, their survey found.By contrast, the most detailed studies concluded that job losses and gains from environmental regulations essentially balanced out. ""When serious studies have been done, the impacts tend to be small -- sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but small,"" Revesz said.Obama said Tuesday that he would use his executive powers to place limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The plan is the most ambitious effort by a U.S. president to address climate change to date and includes $8 billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects, such as efforts to trap and store carbon dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plants. One company that stands to benefit from the plan is Neumann Systems Group, based in Colorado Springs, Colo. The company recently won a $73.5 million contract to apply its liquid-based emissions scrubbing technology to a local power plant that is under construction. Todd Tiahrt, Neumann's CEO, said the technology could also be used to retrofit older plants at a cost of about $150 million for an average-sized facility.Tiahrt said he expected Obama's proposal would spur growth in his field, and that in five years his operation could employ 500 engineers. But he also worried that new regulations would single out coal plants for closure, even though they are hardly the only carbon polluters.""My initial reaction is this amounts to an unfair segregation of the coal industry,"" he said.Coal plants are still proliferating across the world, Tiahrt said, and any initiative to curb their use in the United States would also inhibit the growth of businesses like his that are developing methods to make coal clean.Perhaps sensing this paradox, Democrats seem to be pulling back on their attempts to directly counter Republicans' jobs fears and portray climate regulations as boons to the job market.The policy paper that accompanied Obama's announcement mentions potential job growth stemming from the proposed measures six separate times, but it avoids any specifics, such as what types of jobs might be created and in which industries.Indeed, the only specific job-growth number in the report refers to an ""estimated"" 17,000 jobs created at 50 solar and wind farms and geothermal plants approved by the Department of Energy since 2009.This reluctance to be predictive could be a sign the administration wants to bury a boast Obama made while on the campaign trail in 2008. If elected president, he pledged, he would invest in green-energy technology that would yield 5 million jobs.The best opportunity at realizing that goal came in 2009, when the massive stimulus approved by Congress provided $90 billion in loans, tax credits and other measures for increasing clean energy production and bolstering public transit.Even the most vocal supporters of the stimulus acknowledge that the investment didn't create many jobs. Robert Pollin, a former Energy Department official who was tasked with tabulating jobs stemming from the stimulus, said his ""best guess"" is that 240,000 green jobs were created from 2009 to 2011.But while those green-energy efforts may not have boosted the job market, they weren't job-killers either, Revesz noted. And all things considered, he said, Obama's newly proposed climate rules are likely to do more good than harm.""With the health benfits and environmental benefits are strong as they are, it's really clear to us that we as a nation are better off with these regulations,"" he said.

Several states with constitutional prohibitions on same-sex marriage have implemented rules in the past several weeks saying that same-sex married couples in their states will have to file state taxes as individuals. The U.S. Department of the Treasury ruling recognizing same-sex married couples even if they live in states that do not, was issued in August in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision earlier this year to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Treasury's new rule covers all federal tax matters where marriage is involved, including filing status. North Dakota Tax Commissioner Cory Fong (R) wrote an email to state Rep. Kylie Oversen (D-Grand Forks) in late September explaining North Dakota's policy: Because the North Dakota Constitution does not recognize same sex marriages, the married filing status cannot be recognized for same-sex couples at the state level. Instead, each individual will complete a new supplemental schedule that instructs them on how to report their separate share of the joint federal taxable income. The information on the completed schedule will then be used by each individual to fill out their respective state tax return. The filing status selected by each individual on the state tax return must be either single or head of household.Last week, Kansas Revenue Secretary Nick Jordan made a similar announcement, while the Idaho Tax Commission also indicated that same-sex married couples would be treated as singles on their state filings. In Kansas, Tom Witt, the executive director of Equality Kansas, told The Huffington Post that the state revenue department's ruling may actually violate a state law that allows married couples to use their federal tax returns to determine their state return. ""The administration should really follow state law and federal guidelines, and stop discriminating against gay and lesbian couples in the state,"" Witt told HuffPost.Kansas Revenue Department spokeswoman Jeannine Koranda disagreed with Witt, saying that the state constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage trumps the federal law. She noted that the revenue department is taking steps to help same-sex couples, like developing guidelines on how to use the federally adjusted gross incomes from an IRS worksheet to complete state returns. But Witt said that he believes the state will be sued over this.""If we get sued and go to the courts, and the court decides it is not constitutional, then we will address it,"" Kansas state Rep. J.R. Claeys (R-Salina) told HuffPost. Claeys said he agrees with the rule changes, noting that same-sex marriage is banned in the Kansas constitution. North Dakota Deputy Tax Commissioner Ryan Rauschenberger told HuffPost that his department also wants to streamline the process for same-sex married couples. He said under the North Dakota rules, same-sex couples would be able to divide their federal taxable income between them for state tax purposes. Rauschenberger said rough estimates show those filing as singles under this plan would pay less in taxes than if they filed as a married couple. ""It is a pretty streamlined process,"" Rauschenberger said. In Idaho, the state tax commission will require same-sex married couples to prepare paperwork as singles for the state, in addition to their federal tax preparation. In North Dakota, Rauschenberger said allowing joint filing will have to be addressed by amending the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and noted that state lawmakers don't reconvene until January 2015. Anything the state adopted would have to face a statewide referendum. Oversen said she would like to bring up the issue with her colleagues in the Legislature, but said it would be a tough climb. ""We can't even get same sex housing discrimination banned yet,"" she said. "

For starters, the effort has elicited something long missing on the part of this president -- some spine.Ever since he stepped into the Rose Garden on October 1 to warn the Republicans that he simply wasn't prepared to negotiate while the government was shut down and default on the debt was threatened, we've seen a much tougher Obama. The split in the Republicans, meanwhile, continues to widen, with an ever-increasing backlash among party professionals against the nihilism of Ted Cruz and company. Poor John Boehner tacks back and forth between frantically trying to hold his coalition together and signaling that he'd be willing to suspend the Hastert Rule and allow pragmatic Republicans vote with Democrats to keep the government open.Public opinion seems to be moving against the Republicans. The question is no longer whether they will continue their suicidal gambit but when they will cave and on what terms.Weirdly, by threatening to shut the government unless Obama killed the Affordable Care act, they got the opposite of what they sought. The rest of the government is closed, and Obamacare is open for business.And, while Republicans and movement conservatives have spent the better part of a year demonizing Obama's health reform, the more people become familiar with it, the more people will appreciate it -- leaving the Republican alarmism with no clothes. In that regard, the president and his strategists would do well to change one core piece of their rhetoric. In his Rose Garden remarks, the president said this:Now, of course, if you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, you don't need to do a thing. You're already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law. But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance, this opportunity is life-changing. In fact, that's profoundly wrong, and weakens the president's case. The statistically accurate contention that 85 percent of people will have no change in their insurance is a throwback to the early days of the health reform debate, when focus groups suggested that people who had employer-provided insurance and liked it needed to be reassured.But a lot has changed since then. Employer coverage is eroding. People who lose jobs or change jobs typically lose their insurance. COBRA protection paid entirely by the former worker is only a temporary and largely unaffordable stopgap.The fact is that the Affordable Care Act helps a lot more the 15 percent of the population. Young adults with no employer-provided insurance (and their parents) already know how valuable Obamacare is, for allowing people under age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance. People without jobs and at risk of losing jobs are also coming to value the Affordable Care Act.There is an analogy here with the revolution in broad acceptance of sexual diversity. As more and more gays and lesbians came out, straight people were initially shocked, then surprisingly accepting, as they realized that they had a friend, co-worker, neighbor, or family member who turned out to be gay.As more and more people sign up for affordable insurance thanks to Obama Care, many Americans who have insurance (and many who are worried about losing it) will hear heart-rending firsthand stories about friends, colleagues and relatives with medical worries, who finally get insurance. That coalition is a lot more than 15 percent.Many of these people, incidentally, are in red states, where the percentage of the uninsured tends to be far higher than the national average. In several such states, Republican governors have broken ranks and signed their states up for the provision of the Affordable Care Act that has the Federal government finance nearly all the costs of expanded Medicaid.No wonder the Republicans are so desperate to kill Obamacare in utero. The more it takes effect, the more their hysteria will be proven to be a phony. By 2014, when the Republican House majority will present itself for re-election, the Affordable Care Act could be quite popular. What then?President Obama, increasingly, finds himself in the chips. Let's see if this time he can resist the impulse to fold a winning hand.  Robert Kuttner's new book is Debtors' Prison: The Politics of Austerity Versus Possibility.

Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of data published by 17 states and the District of Columbia.Retail prices for health insurance can be considerably different based in part on the cost of health care services where a person lives, even within the same state, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Wednesday. Premiums also vary based on age, family size and tobacco use. But under Obamacare, prices cannot be based on someone's medical history and patients with preexisting condition cannot be turned away. The law also mandates a set of minimum benefits that includes hospitalizations, prescription drugs and maternity care.The prices included in the report don't include health benefits provided by employers because the health insurance exchanges are intended for the uninsured and those who don't get job-based health plans.The actual premiums for the health plans on the exchanges have been a chief unknown since Obama enacted the health care law in 2010 and although complete information won't be available until the exchanges open, the Kaiser Family Foundation examined detailed data published by state authorities to create a snapshot of what coverage will cost.In Baltimore, a 40-year-old will be able to buy a so-called bronze health insurance plan for as little as $146 a month, compared to $336 a month in Burlington, Vt., not including the savings from tax credits available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level -- $45,960 for a single person this year -- according to the report.The health insurance exchanges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are slated to open Oct. 1 for small businesses, uninsured people, and for people who don't get health benefits at work, to comparison shop and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance. People who get health benefits from large employers or who are enrolled in government programs like Medicare don't need to use the exchanges. Employers provide coverage to 150 million U.S. residents, according to census data, and virtually all large firms are expected to continue doing so next year despite the Obama administration's one-year delay of the law's requirement that large companies cover workers or pay a penalty.The exchanges will sell four tiers of health insurance -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum -- indicating how generous the coverage is. Bronze plans will tend to have the lowest premiums, but expose consumers to the highest possible out-of-pocket costs and platinum plans will have the highest prices but the lowest additional expenses. Those younger than 30 can purchase so-called catastrophic insurance with minimal coverage at a lower price, but cannot apply federal tax credits to these plans. The Kaiser Family Foundation didn't compare the premiums on the health insurance exchange with the cost of health insurance for those who don't get health benefits at work today, however. The new law's guaranteed benefits, prohibition against turning down people with preexisting conditions will make health insurance on this market too different from what's currently available, the report says.""These changes make direct comparisons of exchange premiums and existing individual market premiums complicated, and doing so would require speculative assumptions and data that are not publicly available,"" it says. Some people, most likely young adults who don't qualify for financial assistance, may see higher prices as a result.The variation isn't limited to bronze plans, the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis reveals. ""The lowest cost exchange silver exchange plan available range in cost for a 40-year-old from $194 per month in Portland, Oregon, to $395 per month for a 40-year-old in Burlington, Vermont, before tax credits,"" the report says. Under Obamacare, people whose incomes range from poverty, $11,490 for a single person this year, and 400 percent of poverty may be eligible for tax credits to buy private insurance. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are running their own exchanges while the federal government will at least partly manage exchanges, also called marketplaces, in the remaining states. ""Most people buying their own insurance will qualify for premium tax credits, which will significantly lower the cost of their premiums,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation report says. The foundation also notes that premiums released so far are lower than projected by the Congressional Budget Office.People who earn up to 133 percent of poverty, or $15,282 for an individual this year, can enroll in Medicaid if they live in the District of Columbia or one of the 24 states that are expanding the program under the law. The Kaiser Family Foundation examined insurance company filings to state regulators in 17 states and the District of Columbia and analyzed the prices in the largest cities in each jurisdiction for people at ages 25, 40, and 60. At least two health insurance companies are offering products in all of the locations included in the report. California has the largest number of companies participating in its exchange, Covered California, at 12, while HealthSource RI in Rhode Island and Maine's federally run marketplace each have two companies.  Source: Henry J. Kaiser Family FoundationEligibility for tax credits via the exchanges is determined based on the maximum amount of a person's income they must spend on health insurance and the price of the second-cheapest silver-level health insurance plan where they live. In addition to the tax credits for annual premiums, people who earn up to two-and-a-half times poverty can qualify for additional subsidies to cover their out-of-pocket costs like copayments and deductibles. Most legal residents of the United States must obtain coverage or face a tax penalty under the law's individual mandate. Source: Henry J.

Jan Brewer (R) through the state legislature on Thursday.Brewer, a conservative and avowed foe of President Barack Obama's health care reform law, announced her support for the Medicaid expansion in January, but faced stiff resistance from fellow Republicans in Arizona's House and Senate. During a marathon session that began Wednesday afternoon and stretched into the wee hours of Thursday morning before culminating in a final vote late Thursday afternoon, a handful of Republicans joined Democrats in the House and Senate to pass the Medicaid expansion.Although Obama's health care law continues to divide elected officials and the public along starkly partisan lines, Brewer is one of nine Republican governors who have bucked their party and embraced the Medicaid expansion. ""With landmark votes today in the House and Senate, legislators have tackled the issue that is Job One every session -- adoption of a responsible State budget -- and enacted Arizona’s most sweeping health care legislation in decades,"" Brewer said in a news release after the vote Thursday. ""It will extend cost-effective care to Arizona’s working poor, using the very tax dollars our citizens already pay to the federal government.""The Arizona governor aggressively promoted the Medicaid expansion since taking her surprising public stand earlier this year. Brewer assembled a coalition of health care interests and business groups and worked alongside Democratic legislators in addition to campaigning across the state in service of extending health coverage to hundreds of thousands of poor Arizonans using Obamacare funding.Brewer played hardball with Republican legislative leaders in the state to get her way, earning their ire in the process. She followed through on her threat to veto any bill not addressing the Medicaid expansion last month. On Tuesday, she raised the stakes by calling a special session and forcing the temporarily adjourned legislature back to work on Medicaid and the state's budget. Democratic lawmakers in both chambers unanimously voted for the Medicaid legislation. ""We have done truly the right thing for the people of this state,"" state Senate Minority Leader Leah Landrum Taylor said during the vote Thursday.Republican legislative leaders and conservative lawmakers have bristled at Brewer's embrace of the expansion, a key component of Obamacare, and objected to her calling a special session when the legislature was scheduled to reconvene later in the week anyway. ""I'm deeply and profoundly disappointed at the manner in which this came down,"" said Senate President Andy Biggs, before voting against the measure Thursday. Brewer won praise from conservatives for her hardline stance against illegal immigration, but she has attracted strong right-wing condemnation over Medicaid. ""This proposal is not a freebie for Arizona taxpayers,"" said state Sen. Nancy Barto, a Republican and the chairwoman of the health committee, on the floor Thursday. ""Here we are, once again, putting ourselves at the mercy of the federal government.""The political fallout from the split among Arizona Republicans won't have an immediate effect on Brewer's electoral future: She can't seek another four years as governor when her time runs out next year because of state term limits. She ascended from Arizona secretary of state to the governor's office when Obama tapped then-Gov. Janet Napolitano (D) to be his secretary of homeland security in 2009; voters reelected Brewer in 2010.Arizona is among the 29 states and the District of Columbia with chief executives who support expanding Medicaid under Obamacare to anyone who earns less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,282 for a single person this year. Majority-Republican legislatures in a number of states have stymied expansions endorsed by their governors, including Florida's Rick Scott (R), Ohio's John Kasich (R), Michigan's Rick Snyder (R), Missouri's Jay Nixon (D) and others.""This is a big deal because Arizona and Gov. Brewer are very conservative,"" said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy organization that supports the health care reform law. ""It shows that at least for this governor and this state, practicality and common sense has prevailed over ideology and partisanship,"" he said. ""This is a reflection of what we're going to see over time in many other states across the country.""But about a dozen Republican governors, including Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, remain opposed to broadening the program, citing opposition to Obama's health care law and the expense of the expansion. The Supreme Court ruling that upheld the law last year gave states the right to opt out of its Medicaid provisions.Under the law, the federal government will pay the full cost of the Medicaid expansion from 2014 through 2016, after which the federal share will gradually decline until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and beyond. Currently, the federal government covers an average of 57 percent of Medicaid costs and the states pay the remainder.States that refuse the expansion risk losing $8.4 billion in federal money and face $1 billion in new state spending on programs to compensate hospitals that treat people without health insurance, according to an analysis released last week by the Rand Corporation. About 3.4 million people who could have gained health coverage under Obamacare will remain uninsured next year because of states that won't expand the program, Avalere Health estimated.The uninsured rate in Arizona was 18 percent in 2011, when 1.2 million residents lacked health insurance, according to census data compiled by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.Unique factors affecting Arizona's Medicaid program, called the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System or AHCCCS, played a role in Brewer's decision to set aside her staunch opposition to Obamacare.In 2011, a federal court allowed Brewer to freeze enrollment of adults without children into Medicaid to resolve a budget crunch, which resulted in more than 140,000 fewer people on the program, according to Brewer. Accepting Obamacare's federally financed expansion enables Arizona to reopen Medicaid without having to pay about half the cost. This is why Brewer consistently refers to her Medicaid plan as a ""restoration"" of the program.Moreover, Arizona expanded Medicaid to cover all adults below the poverty line based on a ballot initiative approved by voters in 2000, which Brewer has cited as justification for participating in the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. In 1982, Arizona became the last state to join Medicaid, a program President Lyndon Johnson enacted in 1965. Arizona pioneered the use of private health insurance companies to administer the program, an approach since copied by nearly every state.This story has been updated with comment from Jan Brewer, Leah Landrum Taylor, Andy Biggs and Nancy Barto."

Now, only beneficiaries of TRICARE, the Defense Department health system, will be eligible, along with members of the military, their families and military retirees.""In the past, AFMC has offered both the flu vaccine and wellness programs because civilian health and wellness is an important factor that supports our command mission,"" said Col. James King, AFMC command surgeon, in a statement this week. ""Unfortunately, limited resources required us to prioritize and ultimately fund broader health programs that provide more resources for the total health of our civilian workforce.""The Air Force added that it had had to purchase vaccines in early 2013, ""when this year's budget numbers were less certain""; sequestration went into effect on March 1. ""Analysis determined that less than 20 percent of the civilian population used the AFMC-provided flu vaccine program and officials elected to instead fund AFMC's more comprehensive civilian programs, the Employee Assistance Program and Civilian Health Promotion Services,"" King added.The Navy said it will not be following the path taken by the Air Force and will continue to offer free flu shots to civilian employees.""The Navy is not taking this measure with its civilian workers,"" said spokesman Paul Ross. ""We intend to vaccinate all civilian health care workers providing direct patient care and those where it is written in their position description as a condition of employment.""""We highly encourage vaccination of other Navy civilian personnel if flu vaccine is available at the medical treatment facility, but priority groups must be vaccinated first (e.g. service members, and health care workers),"" he added. ""We anticipate being able to offer this opportunity this year.""Army spokeswoman Alayne Conway said their policy on flu shots had not changed due to sequestration, and civilians are still eligible to receive the vaccination.Lisa Novak, a spokeswoman with the Coast Guard, was not aware of any changes to their flu shot policy due to sequestration. ""The seasonal flu vaccine is mandatory for all Coast Guard Active Duty and Selected Reserve personnel and is also mandatory for Child Development Services personnel and civilian, contract and Auxiliary healthcare personnel who provide direct patient care in clinics,"" she said. ""After these mandatory groups, the next highest-priority groups are deploying civilian employees and others enrolled at Coast Guard Regional Practice clinics and deemed high-risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.""""One these priority populations are immunized, Coast Guard Regional Practice clinics may offer the flu vaccine to all other beneficiaries, and all Coast Guard civilian employees as supplies allow,"" she added.The Marines did not return a request for comment on how sequestration was affecting flu season preparation.Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, is also concerned that sequestration will make it harder to fight the flu. He recently told The Huffington Post that a universal flu vaccine could potentially be developed in the next five years, but that work will be significantly slowed due to budget cuts.""If you want to convert this into real meaningful numbers, that means people are going to die of influenza five years from now because we don't yet have the universal vaccine,"" said Collins. ""And God help us if we get a worldwide pandemic that emerges in the next five years, which takes a long time to prepare a vaccine for. If we had the universal vaccine, it would work for that too.""This article was updated after publication with comment from the Army, Navy and Coast Guard."

Novitas has numerous contracts with CMS, including to administer doctor and hospital claims in the federal Medicare program for elderly Americans.The problem-plagued HealthCare.gov is being worked on by contractors racing to fix it by the end of November so that people can enroll in insurance plans for 2014 under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The law aims to provide health care insurance to millions of uninsured people. OBAMA ASKED FOR FEWER 'NO-BID' CONTRACTSFederal agencies are normally required to solicit bids for work, so as to get the best deal for taxpayers, but can award a contract to a favored company in emergencies as long as they document the urgency.A few weeks after taking office in 2009, Obama issued a memorandum to government agency heads ordering them to minimize the use of non-competitive contracts, calling them potentially ""wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse.""The procurement documents made clear how crucial the financial functions on the healthcare portal are. If payments were not made on time and accurately, CMS said, ""operation of the Marketplace and the Affordable Care Act will certainly be jeopardized.""Financial management includes such functions as transmitting premium payments to insurers. Building that capability into the Obamacare marketplace ""is already minimally two months overdue,"" according to the August documents.Just a few weeks before the financial-management contract was awarded, according to emails released last week by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, CMS officials were becoming increasingly concerned about the status of the federal insurance marketplace, asking for assurance that the lead contractor was not ""going to crash the plane at take-off.""On Tuesday, CMS's deputy chief information officer, Henry Chao, author of the ""crash"" email, told a congressional panel that 30 to 40 percent of the federal marketplace was still under construction.Invisible to consumers are what Chao called the ""back office systems."" Those include accounting and payment systems to send premiums to insurers and transfer funds to insurers that attract more than their share of customers with high medical costs.The no-bid contract awarded to Novitas includes these systems. Novitas is a subsidiary of Diversified Service Options, which is wholly-owned by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida .Asked about how Novitas was awarded the contract and the work it is doing, Florida Blue spokesman Mark Wright said a company official told him, ""We're not going to be able to get into this right now.""Chao told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that CMS and its contractors had focused on building HealthCare.gov so it could launch on Oct. 1, postponing construction of ""the financial management aspects of the system.""The lead contractor on HealthCare.gov, the U.S. subsidiary of Canada's CGI Group Inc, is also involved in building the financial management piece of the marketplace, a company official said.The construction ""is a bigger problem than people realize,"" said Robert Booz, a vice-president and healthcare specialist at technology consultant Gartner.""Everyone recognizes it's going to be a problem in January,"" he said, referring to financial management. In the worst case, if financial records are wrong, then people who have signed up for, and paid a monthly premium for, insurance may be told incorrectly that they are not covered.

On Thursday, Obama sought to heighten awareness of such parts of the health care law that already are in effect, ahead of a major campaign to enroll a targeted 7 million more people in health insurance starting Oct. 1.""If you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance -- could be through your employer or through Medicare or through Medicaid -- you already have an array of new benefits in place,"" Obama said during remarks at the White House. ""You don't have to wait until Oct. 1. You're already getting benefits even if you don't know if it's because of the Affordable Care Act.""Obama's speech is part of a growing campaign by the White House and its allies to push back against Republican attacks on the 3-year-old law and to improve woeful public understanding and weak support for its mandates and benefits for health insurance consumers. Obamacare's health insurance exchange marketplaces for people who don't get health benefits at work and for small companies are set to open in less than three months, amid questions about the administration's preparedness and resistance from Republican-led states.The administration faces significant challenges to getting those health insurance exchanges ready for the six-month enrollment period that begins in October, and it is embarking on a major effort to promote enrollment in health insurance and Medicaid among people -- especially the young, healthy, and poor -- who are uninsured or currently buy their own health insurance. The difficulty of the task and doubts about the administration's readiness are underscored by the White House's decision to delay a separate requirement that large employers cover their workers of face penalties of up to $3,000 per worker.The biggest parts of the health care law not yet online -- and the hardest measures to put into place -- will affect the uninsured. ""Our broken health care system threatened the hopes and dreams of families and business across the country who feared that one illness or one accident could cost them everything they spent a lifetime building. Step by step, we're fixing that system,"" Obama said Thursday. ""Affordable health care is not some privilege just for the few. It's a basic right that everybody should be able to enjoy."" But he also must assuage concerns of the majority of Americans who already are covered by job-based health insurance and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that Obamacare will upend their benefits. The president sought to promote the insurance rebates as an example of how the law has positively affected currently insured people.""Millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies, but instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill, they were pleasantly surprised with a check,"" he said. ""Most folks wouldn't know when that check comes in that this was because of Obamacare.""Obama also touted the news, reported Wednesday by The New York Times, that health insurance premiums in New York state will decline by as much as half under Obamacare next year, not counting the tax credits available to low- and middle-income people. Health insurance premiums in 10 states and the District of Columbia will be lower on average than projected by the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Health and Human Services reported in an analysis released Thursday. Premiums will vary greatly from state to state and based on individuals' ages and other factors, and will be higher for some people next year.On average, the lowest premium for a ""silver"" plan -- the second-least-generous of four levels of coverage available to anyone on the exchanges -- in those states will be $321 a month for a single person, compared to the $392 the CBO predicted, according to HHS. That represents an 18 percent difference, although the prices in those states could change before October.HHS produced charts comparing the lowest and second-lowest average premiums for a silver-level plan in those 10 states and the District of Columbia. The first bar on the right represents the department's analysis of the CBO projections and the second shows the average across the states. New Mexico will have the lowest average health insurance premiums among the states, at $226, while the highest will be in Vermont, at $400, according to the analysis.Republican opposition to Obamacare remains fierce, and the GOP brushed aside Obama's messages about New York's premiums and other positive effects of the law, emphasizing instead its potential negatives, like that some Americans may pay more for coverage next year. The House voted Wednesday to to repeal parts of the law, marking nearly 40 such attempts to eliminate, scale back or defund Obamacare since 2011.""The picture that the president paints of his health care law looks nothing like the reality facing struggling American families,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a press release after Obama's speech Thursday. ""House Republicans will continue our efforts to fully repeal the president’s health care law in its entirety once and for all.""In his speech, Obama acknowledged political opposition to the law was affecting his administration's ability to carry it out and criticized House Republicans for ""re-fighting these old battles.""But it's resistance to Obamacare at the state level that is having a more tangible impact on the law's reach. Just 16 states and the District of Columbia elected to manage their own health insurance exchanges, leaving the federal government responsible for the remainder, and as many as half of states won't expand Medicaid to more poor people under the law.""In states that are working hard to make sure that this law delivers for their people, what we're seeing is that consumers are getting a hint of how much money that's going to be saved because of this law,"" Obama said, citing California, New York, Oregon and Washington state, where health insurance premiums for next year beat estimates.""It's hard, it's a big country, and the health care industry is massive,"" he said. ""As we implement, there are going to be glitches and there are going to be certain states that, for political reasons, are resisting implementation. And we're just steadily working through all that stuff.""This story has been updated with additional information on health insurance premiums, quotes from President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), and background information."

The agreement, which demands a five-year commitment from participating retailers to conduct independent safety inspections of factories and pay up to $500,000 per year toward safety improvements, has seen greater support abroad than in the U.S.Major European retailers -- for example, Marks & Spencer and Carrefour -- have joined the agreement. Others who've signed on include companies recently involved with factory disasters in Bangladesh, such as Swedish retailer H&M and Italian fashion house Benetton. A 2010 factory fire at a facility that made cardigans for H&M killed 21 people, and Bennetton had a supplier in the Rana Plaza factory that collapsed last month, killing more than 1,100 people.PVH, parent to Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, signed the accord, along with Abercrombie & Fitch, which agreed just hours before the deadline. That leaves plenty of U.S. retailers absent from the agreement, according to the Worker Rights Consortium, an international labor monitoring group. However, some retailers, like Walmart, claim they are working on separate initiatives to improve conditions and workplace safety in Bangladesh.Here are 14 North American retailers manufacturing goods in Bangladesh that have not signed the safety accord:

Rubio, the Republican Florida senator who is spearheading outreach to the Republican base and to conservative talk radio hosts, was unable to persuade one of the top radio figures on the right to support the Senate's immigration reform effort when he appeared on The Mark Levin Show Wednesday night. Levin, a former Reagan administration official, was pleasant and polite with Rubio during his 17-minute interview with the senator. But his skepticism was clear, and he referred to undocumented immigrants as ""illegal aliens."" On Thursday morning, he made his opposition to the Senate effort official. Levin posted a note on his Facebook page that said, ""Count me out: the border is NOT secured and Obama cannot be trusted, period.""Levin linked to a site that referred to Rubio as a ""slick used car salesman."" Levin said later Thursday morning that he wished he had not linked to the site criticizing Rubio. ""While I oppose the immigration bill, given the border-security issue and Obama's record of non-enforcement, among other things, I regret linking to a post that refers to Senator Rubio as a slick used car salesman,"" Levin wrote. ""He is earnest and thoughtful and deserves much better. He loves his country and means well, unlike too many politicians. There are slick used car salesmen on Capitol Hill, many come to mind, but Rubio is certainly not one of them.""But he's not the only one. Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a former South Carolina senator who is a friend of Rubio's and was instrumental in helping Rubio get elected in 2010, posted an op-ed Thursday explaining why he thinks the Senate bill that Rubio is pushing is ""flawed.""DeMint foisted the term ""amnesty"" -- the one-word wrecking ball that killed the 2007 immigration reform effort -- on the immigration reform legislation introduced by the Senate's ""gang of eight"" this week. ""After decades of empty promises on immigration enforcement, Congress simply lacks credibility to keep its promises,"" DeMint said, describing the Senate bill as ""immediate amnesty in the form of provisional status within months and lofty promises of 'strategies' and 'plans' for enforcement years later.""DeMint decried the creation of a comprehensive bill, and said Congress should ""debate and develop understandable reforms in a transparent step-by-step process that addresses all of the immigration issues."" With that language, DeMint appears to have given himself some wiggle room to support a bill in Congress this year, but not a lot. Many Republicans see passing an immigration reform bill as crucial to the party's electoral future, given the horrid state of their relationship with Latino voters. But conservatives like DeMint and Levin are not persuaded by that argument.This post has been updated."

And the immense cost of confining so many people is draining vital resources from from other public safety endeavors, including investigations and prosecutions.Politicians across the political spectrum, from Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to Rand Paul (R-Ky.), increasingly agree that something has to be done. Now, a report from the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank for social and economic policy research, examines a host of specific suggestions, including several proposals awaiting a vote in Congress.The study, released this week, concludes that the federal government could save billions and significantly ease the overcrowding crisis by adopting strategies that include cutting fixed sentences for drug offenses in half, retroactively applying a law that lessens the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences, and offering early-release credits to inmates who participate in programs designed to keep them from committing new crimes after they're released.“The current situation with respect to the prison system is unsustainable,” said Julie Samuels, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center and one of the authors of the report (no relation to the prisons director). “I think what we’ve tried to do is lay out the array of options that we have to change that.”Not everyone agrees that it’s in the country’s best interests to pursue these options. At the Senate hearing where the prisons chief spoke, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a former U.S. attorney, attributed the dramatic reduction of violent crimes over the last three decades to the growth of the prison population. The more murderers and rapists “you have in jail, the fewer murders and rapes you are going to have,” he said. “That’s just a fact.”But supporters of prison reform argue that it’s possible to reduce overcrowding without compromising public safety. Below are 10 key proposals examined by the Urban Institute and how they may help save money and empty prison beds over the next decade.1. Send fewer people to prison for drug crimes.The problem: There are 219,000 inmates in the federal prisons system -- compared with 25,000 in 1980. About half are there for drug offenses.The fix: In a major speech in August, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would try to ensure that fewer people spend years behind bars for non-violent drug crimes, in part by directing prosecutors to bring fewer drug cases to federal court.Potential savings: If prosecutors and judges send 20 percent fewer drug offenders to prison, the federal government would save $1.29 billion and the prisons would save 125,000 “bed years.” (A bed year is a year’s worth of prison time for one person.) 2. Allow drug offenders to serve shorter sentences.  The problem: Why are so many people locked up for drug crimes? The answer has a lot to do with federal mandatory-minimum sentencing laws. Under one law, judges are required to sentence drug offenders to prison terms ranging from 5 years to 20 years, depending on the type and quantity of the drug. Before this 1986 law, one-quarter of all federal drug offenders were fined or sentenced to probation, the study notes. Today, 95 percent end up behind bars.The fix: A recent bill introduced by Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) in the Senate, and an identical proposal unveiled last week by Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), among others, would cut the length of those mandatory prison sentences in half.Potential savings: The report concludes that this reform would have “a monumental effect,” saving the government $2.49 billion over 10 years while reducing overcrowding to “its lowest level in decades.”3. Give judges greater discretion over sentencing.  The problem: Even under the current law, judges don’t always have to subject defendants to minimum sentences. A judge can deviate from this protocol, but only if the defendant has been convicted of a nonviolent drug crime and has a very clean criminal record.The fix: The bill introduced by Durbin, Lee, and Leahy would expand this “safety valve” to include drug offenders with slightly greater criminal histories who pose little danger to the public.Potential savings: 53,000 bed years, $544 million.4. Give judges even greater discretion.  The problem: That “safety valve” only applies to drug offenders, not to people who face mandatory minimum sentences for offenses that have nothing to do with drugs, like some white-collar crimes.The fix: Create a new “safety valve” that could be offered to everyone facing a mandatory minimum sentence.Potential savings: 81,000 bed years, $835 million.5. Lower the “truth-in-sentencing” requirement.The problem: Current law says that everyone in the federal prison system must serve at least 85 percent of the time to which he or she is sentenced, known as the “truth-in-sentencing” requirement.The fix: Require offenders instead to serve 70 percent of their sentences.Potential savings: 150,000 bed years, $1.55 billion.6. Make sure that people aren’t disproportionately punished for using crack instead of powder cocaine. The problem: A sentencing law passed in the 1980s dictated that that people caught dealing or posessing crack would go to prison for much longer than people caught with powder cocaine. Many criminal justice advocates have argued that this law essentially targeted blacks, since crack is cheaper than powder cocaine and more popular among low-income people. Carl Hart, an associate professor of neuroscience at Columbia University and an expert on illegal drugs, writes that “there are no pharmacological differences between crack and powder cocaine to justify their differential treatment under the law.”The fix: The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 decreased the disparity between crack and powder cocaine punishments for anyone sentenced after the law was passed. By applying this law retroactively, to people now serving crack-related prison time, the government would extend its benefits to people who were sentenced before the law was adopted.Potential savings: 22,000 bed years, $229 million.7. Allow more prisoners to reduce their sentences through credit for good behavior.  The problem: Many federal prisoners are eligible to get months or years chopped off of their sentences, but only if they participate in a particular drug treatment program.The fix: Expand the number of rehabilitation programs that offer credits toward early release for those who participate. (This option also offers the benefit of providing more inmates with skills that could help them stay out of trouble after they’re released.)Potential savings: 22,000 bed years, $224 million.8. Give prisoners a full year off their sentences for participation in a drug rehabilitation program.The problem: Federal prisoners who graduate from the system’s main drug program are supposed to get a full year off their sentences. But thanks to overcrowding, the line to get into the program is so long that many offenders have less than a year of their sentences left by the time they graduate.The fix: Expand the program so that every graduate receives a full year off his or her sentence.Potential savings: 880 bed years, $9.1 million.9. Release more elderly prisoners from Bureau of Prisons custody. The problem: After the age of 55, people who are released from prison are highly unlikely to commit new crimes, according to many studies. Yet 17,400 people in federal prisons are older than 55, according to the report.The fix: Release some of them before their sentences are up. (The report assumed that fewer than half would be promising candidates.)Potential savings: 700 bed years, $7.8 million.10: Send more foreign inmates back to their home countries.The problem: 54,200 federal prisoners aren’t U.S. citizens.The fix: Streamline the “international transfer” program so that twice as many prisoners are sent to prisons in their home countries.Potential savings: 670 bed years, $6.9 million.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back Tuesday against calls to put out more information on the committee's investigation into the controversy, sparked after a Treasury Department Inspector General report revealed the IRS had singled out tea party groups applying for nonprofit status for extra scrutiny. Responding specifically to criticism from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democratic member of the committee, Issa said that releasing full interviews conducted with IRS employees would hurt the ongoing investigation. ""Your decision to publicly announce that the investigation should wrap up was irresponsible, but not surprising,"" said Issa, in a letter to Cummings. ""However, your push to release entire transcripts from witness interviews while the investigation remains active was reckless and threatened to undermine the integrity of the Committee’s investigation.""The position is a tenuous one for Issa, who during an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" just over a week ago promised that the full transcripts would be released. On that same program, Issa revealed several partial transcripts that suggested the directive to screen tea party groups came from officials in Washington. Since then, The Huffington Post has sent four emails asking Issa's office when the full transcripts would be made public. Not one was returned. When asked why Issa's release of a partial transcript was fine but he opposed releasing the transcripts in full, a spokesman for the congressman referred HuffPost to another statement.“Limited releases of testimony may also serve to empower other witnesses to become whistleblowers and serve to vindicate individuals who have been subjected to criticism or retaliation at the hands of their managers,"" said Issa, in that statement. ""On the other hand, if a full transcript were released, it would serve as a roadmap of the Committee’s investigation.""It could take weeks, if not months, to see the full transcripts should the committee wait to release them until the investigation is completed. According to a Democratic aide on the committee, investigators have interviewed five IRS employees so far and have 18 more to go. In addition, investigators are hoping to look through hundred of thousands of documents that could shed light on the tax agency's controversial screening practices.Unwilling to allow the partial transcripts Issa released to be the only evidence in the public record, Cummings this week also released segments of interviews. In a Sunday memo to his colleagues on the oversight committee, the congressman said that a manager in the IRS Cincinnati office who oversaw the nonprofit screening said that no one in Washington ordered him to employ the practice of targeting tea party groups.""Although the Committee interviewed a self-identified ‘conservative Republican’ who denied any White House involvement or any political motivation for screening Tea Party cases, Chairman Issa now appears to be going back on his promise to release the full interview transcripts of IRS employees,"" said Cummings, in a statement. ""Chairman Issa changes his mind so fast that even when I agree with him, we’re not on the same page. I fully support responsible oversight, but cherry picking transcript excerpts to fuel partisan and unsubstantiated claims is not a credible or effective way to investigate.""On Tuesday, an aide to Cummings said the congressman would release the full transcripts of the already completed interviews by the end of the week, if Issa did not do so himself -- though the aide also cautioned that those plans could change. The squabbling between the chairman and ranking member of the oversight committee has made the conversation surrounding the scandal far more contentious. When news first broke that the IRS had targeted conservative groups, there was near bipartisan condemnation of the agency.Over time, however, politics has entered the debate, and Issa's handling of the committee's investigation has been criticized as a poorly disguised attempt to tie the issue to the president. When Issa called White House Press Secretary Jay Carney a ""paid liar"" earlier this month, he was criticized publicly by Democrats and privately by his own party. More recently, Republicans have been more open in their concerns about where the investigation is heading. As Politico reported on Tuesday:Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana, a senior Ways and Means Republican who chairs the panel’s Oversight subcommittee, criticized Issa’s tactics, saying the release of partial transcripts could “adversely alter our ability to get future information from other IRS employees.”“Just simply from a process standpoint, you don’t want to do that and alter what others might say,” Boustany told POLITICO. “I really am concerned that it could tip this into the political realm rather than a true detailed investigation to get the facts out.”He added: “A lot of this has to be done quietly, obviously, as we piece together what has happened, and once we piece it together and get the firm proof, then you can come out” and say what happened.DISCLOSURE: This reporter's spouse works for the White House Counsel's Office on congressional oversight, but not on matters pertaining to the IRS."
2219	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-reich/republicans-obamacare-distraction_b_4326249.html	Opinion	0	Economy	Education	SomewhatPositive	SomewhatPositive	huffingtonpost.com	"Having failed to defeat the Affordable Care Act in Congress, to beat it back in the last election, to repeal it despite more than 80 votes in the House, to stop it in the federal courts, to get enough votes in the Supreme Court to overrule it, and to gut it with outright extortion (closing the government and threatening to default on the nation's debts unless it was repealed), Republicans are now down to their last ploy.They are hell-bent on destroying the Affordable Care Act in Americans' minds.A document circulating among House Republicans (reported by the New York Times) instructs them to repeat the following themes and stories continuously: ""Because of Obamacare, I Lost My Insurance."" ""Obamacare Increases Health Care Costs."" ""The Exchanges May Not Be Secure, Putting Personal Information at Risk.""Every Republican in Washington has been programmed to use the word ""disaster"" whenever mentioning the Act, always refer to it as Obamacare, and demand its repeal.Republican wordsmiths know they can count on Fox News and right-wing yell radio to amplify and intensify all of this in continuous loops of elaboration and outrage, repeated so often as to infect peoples' minds like purulent pustules.The idea is to make the Act so detestable it becomes the fearsome centerpiece of the midterm elections of 2014 -- putting enough Democrats on the defensive they join in seeking its repeal or at least in amending it in ways that gut it (such as allowing insurers to sell whatever policies they want as long as they want, or delaying it further).Admittedly, the president provided Republicans ammunition by botching the Act's roll-out. Why wasn't HealthCare.gov up and running smoothly November 1? Partly because the Administration didn't anticipate that almost every Republican governor would refuse to set up a state exchange, thereby loading even more responsibility on an already over-worked and underfunded Department of Health and Human Services.Why didn't Obama's advisors anticipate that some policies would be cancelled (after all, the Act sets higher standards than many policies offered) and therefore his ""you can keep their old insurance"" promise would become a target? Likely because they knew all policies were ""grandfathered"" for a year, didn't anticipate how many insurers would cancel right away, and understood that only 5 percent of policyholders received insurance independent of an employer anyway.But there's really no good excuse. The White House should have anticipated the Republican attack machine.The real problem is now. The president and other Democrats aren't meeting the Republican barrage with three larger truths that show the pettiness of the attack:The wreck of private insurance. Ours has been the only health care system in the world designed to avoid sick people. For-profit insurers have spent billions finding and marketing their policies to healthy people -- young adults, people at low risk of expensive diseases, groups of professionals -- while rejecting people with preexisting conditions, otherwise debilitated, or at high risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. And have routinely dropped coverage of policy holders who become seriously sick or disabled. What else would you expect from corporations seeking to maximize profits?But the social consequences have been devastating. We have ended up with the most expensive healthcare system in the world (finding and marketing to healthy people is expensive, corporate executives are expensive, profits adequate to satisfy shareholders are expensive), combined with the worst health outcomes of all rich countries -- highest rates of infant mortality, shortest life spans, largest portions of populations never seeing a doctor and receiving no preventive care, most expensive uses of emergency rooms.We could not and cannot continue with this travesty of a healthcare system.The Affordable Care Act is a modest solution. It still relies on private insurers -- merely setting minimum standards and ""exchanges"" where customers can compare policies, requiring insurers to take people with preexisting conditions and not abandon those who get seriously sick, and helping low-income people afford coverage.A single-payer system would have been preferable. Most other rich countries do it this way. It could have been grafted on to Social Security and Medicare, paid for through payroll taxes, expanded to lower-income families through Medicaid. It would have been simple and efficient. (It's no coincidence that the Act's Medicaid expansion has been easy and rapid in states that chose to accept it.)But Republicans were dead set against this. They wouldn't even abide a ""public option"" to buy into something resembling Medicare. In the end, they wouldn't even go along with the Affordable Care Act, which was based on Republican ideas in the first place. (From Richard Nixon's healthcare plan through the musings of the Heritage Foundation, Republicans for years urged that everything be kept in the hands of private insurers but the government set minimum standards, create state-based insurance exchanges, and require everyone to sign up).The moral imperative. Even a clunky compromise like the ACA between a national system of health insurance and a for-profit insurance market depends, fundamentally, on a social compact in which those who are healthier and richer are willing to help those who are sicker and poorer. Such a social compact defines a society.The other day I heard a young man say he'd rather pay a penalty than buy health insurance under the Act because, in his words, ""why should I pay for the sick and the old?"" The answer is he has a responsibility to do so, as a member the same society they inhabit.The Act also depends on richer people paying higher taxes to finance health insurance for lower-income people. Starting this year, a healthcare surtax of 3.8 percent is applied to capital gains and dividend income of individuals earning more than $200,000 and a nine-tenths of 1 percent healthcare tax to wages over $200,000 or couples over $250,000. Together, the two taxes will raise an estimated $317.7 billion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Here again, the justification is plain: We are becoming a vastly unequal society in which most of the economic gains are going to the top. It's only just that those with higher incomes bear some responsibility for maintaining the health of Americans who are less fortunate.This is a profoundly moral argument about who we are and what we owe each other as Americans. But Democrats have failed to make it, perhaps because they're reluctant to admit that the Act involves any redistribution at all.Redistribution has become so unfashionable it's easier to say everyone comes out ahead. And everyone does come out ahead in the long term: Even the best-off will gain from a healthier and more productive workforce, and will save money from preventive care that reduces the number of destitute people using emergency rooms when they become seriously ill.But there would be no reason to reform and extend health insurance to begin with if we did not have moral obligations to one another as members of the same society.The initial problems with the website and the president's ill-advised remark about everyone being able to keep their old policies are real. But they're trifling compared to the wreckage of the current system, the modest but important step toward reform embodied in the Act, and the moral imperative at the core of the Act and of our society. The Republicans have created a tempest out of trivialities. It is incumbent on Democrats -- from the president on down -- to show Americans the larger picture, and do so again and again.ROBERT B.

Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), was intern Daniel Hernandez Jr., who helped save his congresswoman's life. Later that year, he continued his public service when he was elected to the school board for the Sunnyside Unified School District, which covers southern Tucson and adjacent areas in Pima County.Now, however, Hernandez is facing not only a recall campaign, but an anonymous anti-gay smear campaign as well.Four of the five members of the school board, in fact, are facing recall. On one side are the two opponents of superintendent Manuel Isquierdo -- including Hernandez. On the other side are the superintendent's supporters, who include board president Louie Gonzales. Hernandez and fellow board member Buck Crouch voted against extending Isquierdo's contract in June, after news broke about his financial and legal issues.Community members launched a recall effort against Gonzales and another Isquierdo supporter, Bobby Garcia, a month ago. Last week, supporters of Gonzales began a retaliatory recall effort against Hernandez and Crouch.But flyers being passed around to constituents, first reported by Right Wing Watch, go after Hernandez for being gay and for supporting gun control measures.""Put a REAL Man on the Sunnyside Board,"" reads one flyer, with a picture of Hernandez speaking at an Equality Forum event. ""Daniel Hernandez is LGBT. We need someone who will support Sports and cares about our kids. We don't need someone who hates our values. RECALL Daniel Hernandez TODAY.""The second flyer claims that Hernandez ""cares about only one things [sic] taking your guns away.""Hernandez told The Huffington Post several parents had alerted him to the flyers, which were being distributed outside at least five of the 23 schools in the district.""I've had a target on my back from my fellow board members for awhile because I don't go with the flow, and if something doesn't sound right or make sense, I call them out on it,"" Hernandez said.Hernandez said he first heard the ""real man"" attack during his 2011 campaign, when he ran against Garcia, who was voted onto the board in a subsequent election.The Hernandez recall campaign is being run by Marcos Castro, the campaign manager for Gonzales.Castro told The Huffington Post he had nothing to do with the Hernandez flyers, although he received one at his house.""I don't have nothing to do with it,"" he said.Multiple requests to the office of the Sunnyside School Board to speak with Gonzales were not returned.Hernandez's opponents need to collect 1,300 signatures by Dec. 14 to get the recall vote on the ballot.""My governing board president has started the recall process on me, with the people who are his friends and closest allies in the community. I'm not overly concerned they're going to get the 1,300 signatures, but just the negative tone and nature of the way they're doing it has been really bothersome and upsetting,"" said Hernandez. ""It's disheartening that this is where we are in 2013, that people think it's okay to put out these kinds of flyers about anybody,"" he added.UPDATE: Aug. 27 -- Gonzales told The Huffington Post that he was not at all involved in the flyers and does not support anti-gay attacks. He added that he believed Hernandez and his allies were actually the ones behind them, in a subterfuge attempt to make his opponents look bigoted.""He's trying to turn this whole thing around,"" said Gonzales, adding, ""We're not anti-gay or gun control by any means.""Gonzales said he supported the superintendent because he believed he should be judged strictly on his performance in the schools, regardless of his financial and legal issues.""I think Mr. Hernandez may be a bit immature and young, and he's using all the resources ... and doing that, and it's kind of embarrassing,"" he said.Hernandez later replied that he wasn't surprised his opponents are denying a role in creating the flyers, stating, ""If they truly have nothing to do with it, I ask that they renounce these attacks, drop this sham of an election and attend sensitivity training.""Also on Tuesday afternoon, Giffords tweeted in support of Hernandez:View the flyers, via Right Wing Watch: "

Stephen Bloom (R) is under fire after seeking cosponsors for legislation that critics say would allow creationism to be taught in the classroom. Bloom denies such claims, saying the bill would spur intellectual debate by allowing K-12 students in public schools to question scientific theories like evolution and climate change, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. “With free discourse in the classroom under threat, I will soon be introducing a bill to preserve academic freedom in Pennsylvania’s schools,” Bloom said in a memo. “Efforts to squelch and stifle free critical inquiry in the classroom have too frequently arisen, often in the context of the teaching and debate of controversial scientific theories and paradigms.”In the memo, sent Aug. 1, Bloom began soliciting fellow politicians to cosponsor the bill, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. ""In the real world, outside of academia, scientific theory is up for all kinds of argument,"" Bloom said of the bill, which has not been written. ""I don't think it's right to exclude any particular kind of argument prima facie. If a student wants to discuss a criticism, he or she should be able to,"" reports the Philadelphia Inquirer. Bloom told a local ABC affiliate that he did not intend to insert religion into the classroom, but rather to expand students’ academic freedoms.""The free exchange of ideas was being quelled by these very strict speech codes in school,"" said Bloom. ""And, so for me ... it's just something from the heart.""Still, the idea of Bloom’s bill already has prompted opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union in Pennsylvania. Andy Hoover, legislative director for the Pennsylvania branch of the ACLU, said that it would be difficult to ensure that scientific debates regarding evolution would not veer into religious territory.""We do think that ultimately some teacher somewhere or students ... will bring religious doctrine into public school classrooms,"" he told a local ABC affiliate. States like Louisiana and Tennessee currently have similar academic freedom laws in place. At the same time, comparable bills in states like Colorado and Indiana recently failed to pass."
2291	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-weiler/chief-justice-roberts-and_b_3503768.html	Opinion	0	Civil Rights	Elections	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"When John Roberts came before the Senate in 2005 for confirmation as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, many scribes penned encomiums to this undeniably conservative, but seemingly eminently reasonable and restrained judge. Writing in the New Yorker, Hendrick Hertzberg expressed concerns about Roberts views once he reached the high court. But he also allowed that Roberts was ""not, it appears, a hater; nor is he even a particularly rigid ideologue. Unlike Justices Scalia and Thomas, Roberts does not project a sense of resentful beleaguerment.""Roberts, of course, worked assiduously to cultivate that image, famously insisting during his opening remarks before the Senate that he was merely an umpire calling balls and strikes and enforcing the rules of the game, not making them up. Then-Senator Biden did point out to Roberts that different umps had different strike zones and it was fair to ask Roberts a little bit about what his was. Roberts, an evidently highly intelligent and polished man, sailed through those hearings.All of this, mind you, was obvious BS even at the time, to anyone paying attention. As I wrote during the confirmation hearings:""Roberts' career is characterized not so much by a generalized fealty to judicial restraint, but to a highly selective version thereof, one that consistently favors powerful interests over the less advantaged and that appears consistently to advance the preferred conservative agenda of the day. According to [a report by the Alliance for Justice]: ""one can discern that Judge Roberts holds a troublingly limited view of the federal government's authority to enact key worker, civil rights and environmental safeguards and a similarly troublingly narrow view of the vital role of our courts and our government play in safeguarding our individual rights, especially civil and women's rights....these views, taken together, could produce a government with less power to protect ordinary people and give ordinary people less power to protect themselves from abuse by government and other powerful interests.""This is, of course, precisely who Roberts has turned out to be. In order to arrive at yesterday's opinion, which the seasoned legal observer Paul Campos described as a ""travesty... of basic legal reasoning,"" Roberts had to create a new legal doctrine out of whole cloth. The Chief Justice insisted that the portions of the Voting Rights Act struck down yesterday violated the ""fundamental principle of equal sovereignty of the states."" The eminent jurist Richard Posner responded by saying ""this is a principle of constitutional law of which I have never heard"" because, in fact, ""there is no such principle.""As many have pointed out, now is an especially disturbing time to claim that, because we have made so much progress over the past half century, proven mechanisms for ensuring voting rights are no longer necessary. In fact, over the past few years, we have seen a new war on voting pushed by right-wing activists and legislators all over the country. The transparently dishonest justification for these laws is the need to rein in voter fraud and ensure the integrity of the voting process. Voter fraud, of the sort that defenders of these new laws insist must be stopped is, as has been well-established, virtually non-existent. On the eve of last year's presidential election, John McCain's former campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, described voter fraud claims as ""bogus"" and part of the Republican Party's ""mythology."" The actual purpose of such legislation is, of course, to make it much more difficult for African Americans and other less favored groups of people to vote -- because when they do, they vote overwhelmingly Democratic. Sometimes, those pushing these laws are honest about their motives. When Pennsylvania passed a particularly problematic voter ID law last year, the House Majority leader of the Pennsylvania House, Mike Turzai, didn't declare triumphantly that Pennsylvania could now ensure integrity in its elections. Instead, to wild cheers from his cronies, he thundered that the legislation had just successfully delivered the state to Mitt Romney (much of the law was later tossed out and, of course, Romney did not win Pennsylvania). In fact, the toner cartridge was barely dry on Roberts' execrable opinion yesterday when several states announced that previously blocked voter suppression laws would go into force immediately, including in Texas -- where hundreds of thousands of voters might now be adversely affected -- and Mississippi.Writing in the Nation, Ari Berman rightly denounced the Court's right-wing majority in a post yesterday titled, ""What the Supreme Court doesn't understand about the Voting Rights Act."" And in the piece itself, Berman quoted from Justice Ginsburg's dissent -- ""The sad irony of today's decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven so effective."" The sentiments are understandable -- and in Ginsburg's case, perhaps professionally prudent -- but the premises are wrong. The right-wing majority understands precisely how the VRA has been effective. That is why they gutted it. There is no misunderstanding, no well-intentioned but misguided application of the law. They are neither dumb nor naïve. They are merely without conscience. When Chief Justice Roberts extolled the progress of the past fifty years in justifying his decision to try to undermine that progress, the irony should have been lost on no one, since the conservative movement has worked ceaselessly to try to roll back and reverse that progress. (Remember Trent Lott, former Senate Majority leader, lamenting in 2002 how much better things would have been if Strom Thurmond's vision of a segregated America had prevailed?)As Adam Serwer wrote yesterday, Roberts has worked hard to avoid being painted with that brush. Serwer reminded readers that during oral arguments in February in the Shelby v. Holder case -- the one the Court ruled on -- Scalia blurted out that the Voting Rights Act represented the ""perpetuation of racial entitlement."" One needs to step back for a moment to appreciate just how extraordinary and revealing that statement was. Roberts himself appears to have been a determined opponent of the VRA since he was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department in the early 1980s (so much for his claim that the long passage of time now provides a justification for gutting the law). But Roberts doesn't project an air of ""resentful beleaguerment."" And just as it's become a favored trick of the contemporary right to pretend to admire Martin Luther King while trying to undermine everything he stood for, so the clever and cunning Roberts knew enough in his Shelby opinion to pretend to extol the virtues of a law he has long wanted to bury. He's tried to put a ""moderate"" face on what has been a consistently extremist agenda, but it's that agenda, including rolling back civil rights protections to the maximum possible extent -- that animates Roberts and his cronies' jurisprudence (and see Rick Hasen's discussion about why Roberts thought it might be politically prudent to hold off on killing affirmative action for the time being). Emily Bazelon, in Slate, described Roberts as a ""stealth conservative"" who has successfully concealed his political agenda. That gig should have been up before he ever reached the high court. But yesterday should have removed the last shred of doubt. Roberts is a Stepford judge -- the tip of the spear of the conservative movement's three decade long march through the judiciary -- a robotic ideologue ceaselessly committed to undermining legal protections for the vulnerable while further stacking the deck in favor of the already-powerful. There's no principle here -- no respect for judicial restraint, or original intent or limited government or any of the other nonsense by which right-wingers try to defend their judicial ""philosophy."" Only a remorseless attack on common decency for the sake of enriching and empowering their ideological allies."

A sheriff's spokesman referred a request for comment to attorney Tim Casey, who said he was reading the ruling and had no immediate comment.'ILLEGAL AND PLAIN UN-AMERICAN'Cecillia Wang, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project and plaintiffs' counsel, called the judge's ruling ""an important victory that will resound far beyond Maricopa County.""""Singling people out for traffic stops and detentions simply because they're Latino is illegal and just plain un-American,"" Wang said after the ruling was made public.""Let this be a warning to anyone who hides behind a badge to wage their own private campaign against Latinos or immigrants that there is no exception in the Constitution for violating people's rights in immigration enforcement.""During testimony in the non-jury trial last year, Arpaio said he was against racial profiling and denied his office arrested people because of the color of their skin.The sheriff, who won re-election to a sixth term in November, has been a lightning rod for controversy over his aggressive enforcement of immigration laws in the state, which borders Mexico, as well as an investigation into the validity of President Barack Obama's U.S. birth certificate.The lawsuit was brought against Arpaio and his office on behalf of five Hispanic drivers who said they had been stopped by deputies because of their ethnicity.The plaintiffs, which include the Somos America immigrants' rights coalition and all Latino drivers stopped by the sheriff's office since 2007, were seeking corrective action but not monetary damages.Arpaio has been the subject of other probes and lawsuits. In August, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said it had closed a criminal investigation into accusations of financial misconduct by Arpaio, and it declined to bring charges.A separate U.S. Justice Department investigation and lawsuit relating to accusations of civil rights abuses by Arpaio's office is ongoing.Arizona has been at the heart of a bitter national debate over immigration since Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed a 2010 crackdown on illegal immigration.The federal government challenged the crackdown in court and said the U.S. Constitution gives it sole authority over immigration policy. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has allowed to stand the part of the law permitting police to question people they stop about their immigration status.Snow scheduled a hearing in the case for June 14 at 9:30 a.m. at the Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Federal Courthouse in Phoenix.

""You say you want to reach out, you say you want to have a new message. You say you want to see if you can bring some of these voters to the Republican side. This is not the way to do it.""""The way to do it is to make it easier for them to vote and then give them something to vote for that they can believe in,"" Powell added.In the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling that struck down a key portion of the Voting Rights Act, Republicans in states like North Carolina, Florida and Texas have sought voter restrictions that critics, including Powell, say will disproportionately hurt minorities at the polls. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed legislation earlier this month that requires voter identification, rolls back early voting hours and ends a state-supported voter registration drive. Powell condemned that particular law at an event in Raleigh last week.Powell pointed out that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, the very premise of the identification statutes. ""You need a photo ID. Well, you didn't need a photo ID for decades before,"" Powell said. ""Is it really necessary now? And they claim that there's widespread abuse and voter fraud, but nothing documents, nothing substantiates that. There isn't widespread abuse."" Powell predicted that such measures will blow up in Republicans' faces.""These kind of procedures that are being put in place to slow the process down and make it likely that fewer Hispanics and African Americans might vote, I think, are going to backfire, because these people are going to come out and do what they have to do in order to vote, and I encourage that,"" he said.During the interview, Powell also reflected on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, recalling times when he couldn't eat in certain places due to the color of his skin, even though he'd just served his country. ""In my lifetime, over a long career in public life, you know, I've been refused access to restaurants where I couldn't eat, even though I just came back from Vietnam: 'We can't give you a hamburger, come back some other time,'"" Powell recalled. ""And I did, right after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, I went right back to that same place and got my hamburger, and they were more than happy to serve me now. It removed a cross from their back, but we're not there yet. We're not there yet. And so we've got to keep working on it."""
2310	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/21/kris-kobach-ken-bennett_n_3791621.html	News	1	Civil Rights	Elections	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"The Kansas secretary of state announced Wednesday that he and his Arizona counterpart are suing the federal government in an effort to ensure that anyone registering to vote shows proof of citizenship.A lawsuit filed by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) and Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett (R) asks that the United States Election Assistance Commission include state-specific requirements for proof of citizenship on all federal voter registration forms in the two states, the Kansas City Star reported. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Arizona's law allowing proof of citizenship requirements on state forms unconstitutional since federal forms did not require it. But the court also said that states with proof of citizenship requirements could ask the federal government to note those requirements on federal registration forms distributed in their states. The recent lawsuit comes days after the American Civil Liberties Union told Kobach that it intended to sue him over the state requirement, citing 15,000 voter registrations being held up due to lack of proof. But Kobach said his suit could preempt the ACLU suit since it addresses the ACLU's concerns, the Topeka Capitol-Journal reports. Doug Bonney, the legal director for the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri, told The Huffington Post that Kobach and Bennett's lawsuit was expected. At the same time, Bonney said he disagrees with Kobach's analysis that this will end his group's lawsuit to overturn the Kansas law.Bonney said that citizens are not able to register to vote because they cannot display proof of citizenship or because of bureaucratic issues. He said laws requiring people to attest to being citizens when registering to vote have worked well to prevent fraud.""There is no proof of people fraudulently registering to vote,"" Bonney said. ""For scores of years, the attestation requirement has been perfectly find. This law makes it difficult for those who are citizens to vote because they cannot get properly registered.""Kobach, a tea party favorite who has written controversial immigration laws in Arizona and Alabama, said that the citizenship proof is needed. ""Every time an alien votes, it effectively cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen,"" Kobach said at the press conference on Wednesday.Opponents of the citizenship requirement told The Huffington Post that the suit is ""fear mongering"" and unnecessary. Former Kansas state Rep. Ann Mah (D-Topeka), Kobach's most vocal critic, said that she is not surprised by the suit. At the same time she stressed that every voter fraud investigation in Kansas has turned up minimal cases in the last decade. She said the real problem is the 15,000 voter registrations being held up.""There is no evidence out there at all,"" Mah told HuffPost. ""Why do we have 15,000 Americans who can't vote because of the hoops they have to jump through?""She said that since most voters register at state motor vehicle offices, which are not equipped to process birth certificates to meet the state law, voters would need to also visit an election office to complete the process. Arizona state House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told HuffPost that he believes this is a way for Bennett to draw tea party votes for his 2014 Republican gubernatorial primary. Campbell, who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, agreed with Mah that there is no voter fraud in the state.""We've gone down this road time and time again, we hear about all this supposed fraud from the tea party all the time,"" he said. ""Every analysis shows there is no voter fraud taking place. It is political grandstanding and fear mongering from the tea party movement."""
2312	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/02/north-carolina-voter-intimidation_n_3695657.html	News	0	Civil Rights	Elections	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"In the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, reports of harassment and intimidation at the polls were so rampant in North Carolina that the state's top election official was obliged to send a memo to his employees reminding them that they could call police if necessary.  Now, as North Carolina's governor prepares to sign one of the most restrictive election bills in the nation, civil-rights advocates and election officials in the state expect to see a rise in what they call voter intimidation.  The law, which North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory is expected to sign any day, would allow political parties to send 10 roving ""observers"" from precinct to precinct on voting days, and it would authorize citizens to challenge the legality of votes cast in the county where the challenger lives. (Under the current law, you can only challenge a vote cast by someone living in your precinct.)  Supporters contend that the law will help observers catch people in the act of fraud, but critics point out that evidence of this type of fraud is scarce. They insist that the real goal is to intimidate Democratic-leaning black voters, some of whom may remember the threats and assaults that swept the South in the late 1960s, after the 1965 Voting Rights Act toppled the official barriers blacks had faced at the polls.  ""In my mind, the only reason the change is occurring is to have a harmful impact on eligible voters who are trying to exercise their constitutional right,"" said Bob Phillips, the director of Common Cause North Carolina, a progressive group. ""We have hundreds of precincts located in all the communities across our state, and now you're going to be introducing outside observers who are not residents of those precincts and who are really are up to, in my opinion, intimidation.""  In addition to boosting the presence of poll observers, the law would require every voter to display specific forms of government-issued identification, which minorities and low-income people disproportionately lack. It would also cut back on the hours allotted for early voting, prohibit people from registering on the same day that they vote, and cancel a popular program to register high-school students -- practices that have boosted electoral participation among young and black voters and may have helped President Barack Obama carry the state in 2008.The state’s Republican-dominated Legislature passed the law in July, despite scant evidence of voter impersonation fraud in North Carolina (or in any other state). In a statement, Phil Berger, the leader of the State Senate, said the bill ""restores clarity, transparency and confidence in the voting process. It curtails the questions of voter fraud by folks on both sides of the aisle and helps ensure every candidate wins or loses on his or her own merits.""In recent years, more than 30 states around the country have passed laws requiring voters to show ID. North Carolina would become one of at least three states to allow behavior by poll watchers or poll observers that could threaten voting rights, according to a report by the progressive groups Demos and Common Cause.Even among the voter laws in other states, North Carolina’s stands apart. Mainstream election experts have panned the proposal, calling it the most sweeping anti-voter law in the country. For Jay Delancy, though, it doesn't go far enough. Delancy, a retired Air Force office and the head of a group called the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina, is one of the state’s best-known activists in the campaign against fraud and a proponent of even stricter election rules, like ending early voting altogether. Last year, he repeatedly challenged the validity of the state's voter rolls, at one point claiming that nearly 30,000 registered North Carolina's voters were actually names of deceased people.  A state investigation eventually undermined this claim, and Delancy now admits that concerns about counting dead people as voters are ""greatly exaggerated."" But he remains adamant that voter fraud is pervasive, and although he has little evidence to back this up, he hopes the new rules will make it easier for groups like his to catch people cheating at the polls.He plans to train people to act as observers, a strategy modeled on True the Vote, a national tea party-affiliated organization that has stirred up controversy by sending observers into African-American districts in recent years. ""We need to safeguard the ballot box, just like banks,"" Delancy says.  According to one state election official, however, the expected influx of observers could have the opposite effect.  ""You're going to have more observers than you have actual workers,"" said Gary Sims, deputy director of the Wake County Board of Elections. ""Some of our polling places are very small. I don't know how we're going to fit 15, 16 people in there. We're not going to have enough poll workers to make sure observers are following the law.""During last year’s early voting period, there were reports of official poll observers and campaign workers interrogating and harassing voters, hovering over them as they voted and getting into shouting matches with each other. The state board of elections sent out a memo reminding employees that they were obliged to “prevent and stop improper practices and attempts to obstruct, intimidate, or interfere with any person in registering or voting.” Now that job could get harder, election officials say. Some worry that the increased presence of observers could overwhelm poll workers, contributing to long lines and effectively discouraging people from voting.   ""How do you police people?"" asked Sims. ""We're not in the police business.""  If the bill is signed, Delancy and his allies in North Carolina will owe its success in part to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in June on the Voting Rights Act, which cleared the way for North Carolina and other Southern states to pass restrictive voter laws that the federal government could have previously prohibited. In the landmark case, a 5-4 majority ruled that areas with histories of extensive discrimination, including 40 counties in North Carolina, no longer needed to submit their electoral policies to the federal government for approval.  In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the South has changed so dramatically since the Voting Rights Act was passed almost half a century ago that the need for special federal oversight has been eliminated. Civil-rights advocates tend to agree that things have improved since the ‘60s. Yet they see the furor over voter fraud as a thinly veiled attempt to roll back those changes. ""What we've seen recently are efforts by Republicans in largely non-white communities to go in and systematically challenge ballots,"" said Kareem Crayton, a law professor at the University of North Carolina. ""Maybe people in these communities aren't familiar with the process of voting, or aren't entirely clear what their rights are, and in the face of people telling them ‘if you vote illegally or inconsistently with the rules you can be challenged in court under a felony conviction’, that can be intimidating.""  In a recent interview, Delancy dismissed the suggestion that his crusade against fraud and the voter-suppression tactics of the Jim Crow era are in any way alike. No one in today’s North Carolina needs to worry about “dogs and fire hoses and all that,” he said. “It's laughable.”Then he corrected himself: “It's really not laughable. It's tragic. I think in the end, as I tell every black activists who will dare to have a civil conversation with me, we are not who you say we are. What I care about is open and honest elections.”"

During the arguments, Roberts asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli if he knew ""which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African-American voter turnout,"" claiming that state is Massachusetts.“I’m calling him out,” Galvin told the Boston Globe. “We have one of the highest voter registrations in the country, so this whole effort to make a cheap-shot point at Massachusetts is deceptive,” Galvin said.Galvin didn't dispute Roberts' point, but said Massachusetts shouldn't be falsely represented in the Chief Justice's argument.“The concept of black communities in Massachusetts not voting is an old slur, and it’s not true,” Galvin said. “I guess the point [Roberts] is trying to make is Mississippi is doing so much better they don’t need the Voting Rights Act. He can still relay that conclusion, but he shouldn’t be using phony statistics. It’s deceptive, and it’s truly disturbing.”Galvin wasn't the only one to question Roberts' comments. Tito Jackson, Boston city councilor and political director for Gov. Deval Patrick's most recent campaign, said Massachusetts has ""seen a great ­increase in voter participation in communities of color, particularly among African-Americans, Latinos, and Asian.""The AP reports a Supreme Court spokeswoman refused to offer supporting evidence of Roberts' comments.Roberts' comments during the hearings weren't the only ones that caused alarm. Questions posed by Justice Anthony Kennedy -- who HuffPost's Ryan Reilly reports ""is likely the only hope that voting rights advocates and the Obama administration have for the Supreme Court to uphold a crucial component of the Voting Rights Act"" -- alarmed progressives."

This is a willful act of intimidation intended to discourage a point of view,"" said Becky Gerritson, president of a Tea Party group in Wetumpka, Alabama.She tearfully described how she and her husband had to seek legal counsel when confronted with questionnaires about their donors, communications with legislators and their voter education activities.""I'm not interested in scoring political points. I want to protect and preserve the America I grew up in,"" Gerritson said.Multiple congressional committees and the Department of Justice have opened probes into the matter, which has become a distraction as President Barack Obama pursues an aggressive second-term agenda.They are trying to determine if the IRS had a political agenda in subjecting these groups to extra scrutiny, or if workers in the tax-exempt division chose partisan criteria as a way to cope with a flood of applications starting in 2010.Current and former officials have defended IRS employees by saying they were given a challenging task of determining the level of political activity among 501(c)4 groups. Those social welfare groups are eligible for tax-exempt status as long as their activities are not primarily political.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on Tuesday condemned the IRS and pledged to find out who was responsible for the targeting and what their motivation was.""We have found a cancer someplace in Cincinnati...and we have to find out what caused this,"" Democrat Representative Charles Rangel of New York said during the hearing.The leaders of Tea Party and religious groups said they were harassed by IRS officials and said the demanding questionnaires reflected an intolerance for their views.Coalition for Life of Iowa president Sue Martinek recounted how an IRS employee asked that her group, which opposes abortion rights, agree in writing not to picket the abortion provider Planned Parenthood.""We had done nothing wrong. We had not indicated that we would do anything but peaceably assemble and hold up signs like 'Stop abortion' and 'Pray to end abortion,'"" she said.Democrat Jim McDermott, while expressing outrage at the IRS mismanagement, challenged some of the groups' assertions that they were repressed by the IRS's treatment. He said the groups were seeking a tax exemption and the IRS had to ask questions.""None of your organizations were kept from organizing or silenced.

It also marks an escalation between Bloomberg and national Democrats, who have worried that targeting vulnerable members of the party could backfire and lead to Republicans winning.

It can be difficult to objectively assess the quality of a state’s management. The economy and standard of living can be affected by decisions made decades ago, forces outside the control of the state’s government and administrators, as well as the government’s own actions.Every year, 24/7 Wall St. tries to answer this question by conducting an extensive survey of every state. To determine how well states are managed, we examined their financial data, as well as the services they provide and their residents’ standard of living. This year, North Dakota is the best-run state in the country for the second year in a row, while California is the worst-run for the third year in a row.CLICK HERE TO SEE THE BEST AND WORST RUN STATES. Identifying appropriate criteria to compare the 50 states can be challenging because they vary so much. Some states have abundant natural resources, while others rely on services or innovation. A few have been burdened by struggling industries. Some are more rural, while others are more urban. Because of such differences, a spending or tax policy that can be beneficial in one state can be disastrous in another.Many of the best-run states in the nation benefit from an abundance of natural resources. North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, and Texas, among the best-run states, are all among the states with the greatest concentration of GDP in the mining industry, which includes activities such as oil and natural gas extraction, as well as coal mining. The presence of this industry benefits states in several ways. North Dakota and Texas led the nation in real GDP growth in 2012, while Alaska has used its oil revenue to establish a permanent fund that pays residents an annual dividend.The housing crisis has had a major negative impact on a number of the worst-run states. It caused a drastic decline in construction employment in states like Arizona, California, and Nevada. Many of these lost jobs have yet to be replaced. In the hardest-hit states, this has resulted not only in worsening unemployment, but increased poverty and budget shortfalls. Although the economies of these states have largely improved, the residual effects of the housing crisis remain.While these can be considered extenuating circumstances, the fact is that each state must deal with the cards it is dealt. Governments must plan for worst-case scenarios, including the collapse of an industry. Several resource-rich states have squandered their advantages and rank poorly on our list. Good governance involves raising and spending enough to provide for the well-being of the population without risking the state’s long-term stability.To determine how well the states are run, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed hundreds of data sets from dozens of sources. We looked at each state’s debt, revenue, expenditure, and deficit to determine how well it was managed fiscally. We reviewed taxes, exports, and GDP growth, including a breakdown by sector, to identify how each state was managing its resources. We looked at poverty, income, unemployment, high school graduation, violent crime and foreclosure rates to assess the well-being of the state’s residents.While each state is different, the best-run states share certain characteristics, as do the worst run. For example, the populations of the worse-off states tended to have lower standards of living. Violent crime rates in these states were usually higher and residents were much less likely to have a high school diploma.The worst-run states also tended to have weak fiscal management reflected in higher budget shortfalls and lower credit ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poors.The better-run states tended to display stable fiscal management. Pensions were more likely to be fully funded, debt was lower, and budget deficits smaller. Credit ratings agencies also were much more likely to rate the well-run states favorably. Only two poorly run states received a perfect credit rating from either agency. California and Illinois, which are ranked worst and third worst, received the lowest ratings from both agencies.The states that were well-managed also tended to have lower unemployment rates. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates ranked as the best-run states. California, Illinois, and Nevada — the states with the highest unemployment rates as of 2012 — were among the five worst-run states.Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that worst-run states tended to have better fiscal management. They have weak fiscal management.These are the worst-run states in America, according to 24/7 Wall St.

The poll, funded by the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change, showed that voters across party lines were overwhelmingly in favor of extending the benefits, with 63 to 68 percent of voters in each district expressing support for preserving jobless benefits.Voters in the four districts surveyed said they were less likely to vote for the Republican incumbent in 2014 -- by at least a 9-point margin -- were he to vote to cut off extended unemployment benefits.Though jobless benefits are set to expire on Dec. 28 for 1.3 million longterm unemployed Americans, members of the House and Senate have returned home for the holidays without a solution to preserve those benefits. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said it was an ""immorality"" that the benefits weren't secured in a recent budget deal, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has promised to bring the extension to a vote no later than Jan. 7, 2014. Moderate Republicans urged Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) to rescue jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed earlier in December, saying the issue was ""important to many American families."" But Boehner would only consider the proposal if cuts were made elsewhere and job growth guaranteed, and the measure ultimately did not make it into Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) budget deal.""Speaker Boehner and fellow Washington Republicans are hopelessly out-of-touch, and their decision to Scrooge over a million unemployed Americans three days after Christmas is the latest and among the worst examples of it,"" Jeremy Funk, communications director of Americans United for Change, said. ""All these struggling Americans got from the GOP for Christmas was a ‘Get Employed Soon’ card.""Funk warned cuts to jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed would only put more Americans out of work, and bring a chain reaction of economic fallout in 2014.""But it’s not just in America’s economic interest to extend [unemployment insurance] benefits, these polls show it’s in swing district Republicans’ own political interest to support the jobless in their districts,"" Funk said. ""Otherwise they just might join their ranks."""

It's an outcome that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has worked hard to avoid, for the sake of his party's reputation. But Boehner, short on time and tactics, may have no other choice now than to let calamity physics work its will.For the past week, warnings over the possibility of a shutdown have rung out. Jonathan Chait advised just last week that ""a government shutdown is more likely now"" because the time in which to actually deal-make around it is quickly elapsing. Not that a deal seemed likely. As one source, positioned to suss out the state of negotiations, told Jonathan Cohn, ""The breakdown is more extensive than you've heard ... There is no discussion going on at all at this point.""And Peter Weber cautions, ""Brace yourselves,"" because everyone's incentives seem to align in such a way that makes a shutdown a fait accompli. President Barack Obama thinks the shutdown will add political capital to his coffers. Democrats believe it will improve their position to bargain on the budget. Tea party Republicans believe the conventional wisdom -- which holds that the GOP's brand loses out in the event of a shutdown -- is wrong, and that they actually have the leverage. The Hill reports that ""at least 43 conservatives want the GOP leadership to go for broke"" over this.Standing at the center of all of this is House Speaker John Boehner, who has, thus far, attempted to stave off a shutdown on the grounds that it would be bad for the GOP's brand. But he might be all out of options. His most recent gambit was to try to get the House to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning, with a sidecar resolution attached that would defund Obamacare. The idea is to give his caucus colleagues another chance to vent their disapproval of Obamacare without imperiling the federal government. At the same time, Boehner has extended the notion that there will be time enough for hostage-taking when the debate over the debt ceiling is enjoined. (Of course, there's no indication that Boehner thinks a debt ceiling row would be any better for the GOP than a shutdown, but if his colleagues accepted this plan, he would at the very least buy some time.)The problem, however, is that the more raucous members of his caucus have rejected Boehner's ""continuing resolution with a side of Obamacare defunding,"" and call this plan a ""sell-out."" Boehner is further hamstrung by the fact that his colleagues have turned the ""Hastert Rule"" -- which holds that the speaker can't bring anything to the floor for a vote without first securing a ""majority of the majority"" -- into official House GOP dogma. All of this brought Boehner to his lowest point last week, when he vented his frustrations at reporters, saying, ""Do you have an idea? They'll just shoot it down anyway."" So now, as The New Republic's Noam Scheiber posits, Boehner might just let his colleagues take aim at their own collective foot.Back in March, Scheiber mapped out the strategy that Boehner's been using to move important business through the House and survive -- both as a House speaker and as a guy tasked with keeping his party's standing from collapsing. It goes something like this:First Boehner stakes out a position so extreme or impractical that he effectively marginalizes himself from any negotiation with Democrats. At that point, Democrats begin to bargain with Boehner's Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell. Once they strike a deal, it passes the Senate with overwhelming support. This is the cue to Boehner to troop before his caucus and lament that they fought the good fight for as long as they could, but now even their fellow Republicans have turned on them. If it is their will to hold out, then Boehner will obey it. (Always best to give crazy people the illusion of agency.) But he can no longer in good faith recommend this path. Invariably, the lunatics fold.But with those same lunatics in full revolt against Boehner's continuing resolution gambit, that particular jig is up. So Scheiber now reckons that Boehner has no choice left but to stop treating the symptoms and fully feed the disease:Now, don’t get me wrong: Boehner clearly prefers to avoid a government shutdown. He's spent months figuring out how to do that, fully aware of the political debacle it would entail. Unfortunately, it's now clear that the only way he can induce the political isolation he typically relies on to prod his caucus into semi-rational action is by shutting down the government and inviting the public backlash he's been so desperate to avoid. Boehner simply has no other way of talking sense into his people, no other hope of making the House GOP governable. And so, in the end, a shutdown is in Boehner's interest, too.The hopeful possibility here, according to Scheiber, is that now maybe Boehner's GOP antagonists will ""sober up before we take on the substantially higher-stakes proposition of avoiding a debt default."" That would, indeed, be a welcome occurrence. But contending against this possibility are electoral fundamentals. The GOP goes into the midterm elections with a very strong hand. The vagaries of redistricting, and the fact that the bulk of the Democratic base has sequestered itself into a limited number of urban districts, means that there literally might not be enough votes in the right districts to threaten any of the GOP dead-enders. And a government shutdown may not actually be enough of an apocalypse to alter the underlying electoral plate tectonics.So there's a good chance that Boehner's plan will simply further tarnish the GOP's standing, without providing sufficient motivation to push his colleagues in a saner direction.But as Boehner himself has asked, do you have a better idea?[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

""This is pretty straightforward,"" said Obama. ""If, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that is outrageous, and there is no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable, because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a non-partisan way. You should feel that way regardless of party."" ""But I have got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this,"" he added.The remarks were the president's first on the evolving scandal surrounding the tax collection agency. News broke last Friday that the IRS had targeted groups with the words ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in their name, forcing them to fill out additional questionnaires and provide more information in order to get approval for their tax-exempt status. Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the IRS had also given extra scrutiny to organizations that focused on government spending, debt and taxes.Lawmakers have responded with anger and outrage. On Monday morning, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called on the IRS commissioner to be fired. The senator's office confirmed to The Huffington Post that he was referring to Steven Miller, the acting commissioner. The Senate has not yet confirmed a full-time commissioner since Douglas Shulman, a Bush appointee, stepped down this past fall.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), meanwhile, called for a ""congressional investigation to determine"" how the IRS scandal took place. Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said that ""The IRS should be prepared for a full investigation into this matter by the Senate Finance Committee.""The results of such an investigation will ultimately determine whether the story amounts to a case of terrible bureaucratic judgment or becomes a wider political scandal.The IRS began taking on additional campaign finance regulatory responsibilities after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which led to an uptick in filings for 501(c)(4) organizations seeking social welfare status. The agency's Cincinnati office became the central clearing point for those applications. Officials there, the agency said, were the ones who inappropriately targeted conservative groups for scrutiny. As early as mid-2011, however, high-ranking IRS officials became aware that the Cincinnati office was engaging in this activity, a forthcoming Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report will reportedly reveal. Why nothing was said or done prior to last Friday is unclear. The president on Monday said that neither he nor his advisers were aware that this was taking place. ""I learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this,"" said the president. ""I think it was on Friday."" The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported that a government official who had reviewed a copy of the report said no one outside the IRS was involved in encouraging the targeting of conservative groups. UPDATE: 2:45 p.m. -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has joined the chorus of concerned lawmakers, saying that he supports bipartisan calls for an investigation into the IRS scandal. From his floor remarks:I have spoken today to the senior Senator from Montana, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Max Baucus, and he is looking into this matter in his role as finance chairman of that committee. If the Inspector General's report indicates further investigation is needed, I have full confidence in the ability of Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee to get to the bottom of this matter and recommend appropriate action."

Democrats say the plan would make it harder for vulnerable groups like the elderly and disabled to get access to the job training they need.Committee Democrats argued that funding for job training had been a generally bipartisan issue until recently. After making little headway in negotiations, they sent committee Republicans a letter on Monday asking them to cancel the markup of the bill scheduled for Wednesday, saying that the GOP plan ""eliminates programs for the sake of eliminating programs, without any independent evaluation of whether they are in fact duplicative of one another."" Nonetheless, Republicans went ahead with their markup and approved the legislation on Wednesday.

Rubio, the Republican Florida senator who is spearheading outreach to the Republican base and to conservative talk radio hosts, was unable to persuade one of the top radio figures on the right to support the Senate's immigration reform effort when he appeared on The Mark Levin Show Wednesday night. Levin, a former Reagan administration official, was pleasant and polite with Rubio during his 17-minute interview with the senator. But his skepticism was clear, and he referred to undocumented immigrants as ""illegal aliens."" On Thursday morning, he made his opposition to the Senate effort official. Levin posted a note on his Facebook page that said, ""Count me out: the border is NOT secured and Obama cannot be trusted, period.""Levin linked to a site that referred to Rubio as a ""slick used car salesman."" Levin said later Thursday morning that he wished he had not linked to the site criticizing Rubio. ""While I oppose the immigration bill, given the border-security issue and Obama's record of non-enforcement, among other things, I regret linking to a post that refers to Senator Rubio as a slick used car salesman,"" Levin wrote. ""He is earnest and thoughtful and deserves much better. He loves his country and means well, unlike too many politicians. There are slick used car salesmen on Capitol Hill, many come to mind, but Rubio is certainly not one of them.""But he's not the only one. Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a former South Carolina senator who is a friend of Rubio's and was instrumental in helping Rubio get elected in 2010, posted an op-ed Thursday explaining why he thinks the Senate bill that Rubio is pushing is ""flawed.""DeMint foisted the term ""amnesty"" -- the one-word wrecking ball that killed the 2007 immigration reform effort -- on the immigration reform legislation introduced by the Senate's ""gang of eight"" this week. ""After decades of empty promises on immigration enforcement, Congress simply lacks credibility to keep its promises,"" DeMint said, describing the Senate bill as ""immediate amnesty in the form of provisional status within months and lofty promises of 'strategies' and 'plans' for enforcement years later.""DeMint decried the creation of a comprehensive bill, and said Congress should ""debate and develop understandable reforms in a transparent step-by-step process that addresses all of the immigration issues."" With that language, DeMint appears to have given himself some wiggle room to support a bill in Congress this year, but not a lot. Many Republicans see passing an immigration reform bill as crucial to the party's electoral future, given the horrid state of their relationship with Latino voters. But conservatives like DeMint and Levin are not persuaded by that argument.This post has been updated."

Brad Dayspring, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called Grimes “an empty dress” in an interview with The Hill published Wednesday. The insults continued from there. “Alison Lundergan Grimes seems incapable of articulating her own thoughts, and faced with questions, either directly parrots the talking points handed to her by [Sen.] Chuck Schumer or she babbles incoherently and stares blankly into the camera as though she’s a freshman in high school struggling to remember the CliffsNotes after forgetting to read her homework assignment,” Dayspring told The Hill.""This degrading and offensive comment from McConnell's campaign team is appalling and he should condemn it immediately,"" Grimes spokeswoman Charly Norton told The Huffington Post.

It’s why women turned out in historic numbers for Democratic candidates last election, and it’s why we’ll see a repeat next November.""Grimes, Kentucky's secretary of state, has been hesitant to talk about policy specifics since she officially jumped into the 2014 Senate race. But she has pushed to raise the minimum wage, been vocal about her support for reproductive rights, and announced her intention to delay the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.“The president and I disagree on a lot of things,” she said in an August interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman. “Sen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.“Well, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen.

Jeff Gohringer, press secretary for the national League of Conservation Voters, said that the group has contributed $1.9 million to the state league in both cash and in-kind contributions this election cycle across all races. The Sierra Club launched its own anti-Cuccinelli efforts as well.Polling heading into Tuesday's election shows McAuliffe with a 6-point lead over Cuccinelli.Cuccinelli has been a particularly popular target for environmental groups, given his outspoken denial of climate change. In his role as attorney general, Cuccinelli attempted to subpoena the records and emailed correspondence of a former University of Virginia climate scientist, accusing him of fraud in his climate research. That climate scientist, Michael Mann, has been campaigning against Cuccinelli in the state.""We got involved in this race because of climate change,"" said LCV's Gohringer. ""[Cuccinelli] is one of the most vocal climate deniers in the country. To defeat him would send a signal to other climate change deniers, and also highlight the growing environmental movement.""The McAuliffe campaign has also criticized Cuccinelli's climate change denial in television ads that accuse the Republican of being too extreme for Virginia. The Virginia League of Conservation Voters' political action committee is also running a field program that it characterized as the largest effort by an outside group this year -- with volunteers making an estimated 300,000 canvassing visits over the course of the campaign -- one-third of them in the final five days of the race, according to Gohringer. McAuliffe has been accused of waffling on coal and greenhouse gas emissions over the years. He did not come out in support of the EPA's new rules for coal-fired power plants until early last month. His opponent quickly seized on the statement as part of a ""war on coal.""""I think we've seen Terry McAuliffe unafraid to really lean into these issues throughout the campaign, talking about climate change, supporting the EPA,"" said Gohringer. ""He's been a champion throughout the campaign. It's been a dividing line between the candidates.""The League of Conservation Voters was a significant spender in the Virginia Senate race last year, as well, contributing $2 million to help Democrat Tim Kaine defeat Republican George Allen. The group and its affiliates spent a record $14 million on the 2012 election."

A gun-rights group in New Hampshire - the site of a key presidential nominating primary where Christie would want to do well should he run for president - warned that it would organize voters against him if he were to crack down on gun owners in New Jersey.""There are still three major anti-gun bills on Governor Christie's desk, and we are watching,"" said Sam Cohen, executive vice president of Pro Gun New Hampshire.Gun control supporters in New Jersey said the signings represented a step forward.""Seeing these bills signed into law is a victory for New Jersey's communities,"" said Louis Greenwald, majority leader of the state assembly. ""Yet they do not go far enough in doing all we can to prevent gun-related tragedies from afflicting our families.""Neighboring New York state and nearby Connecticut have recently tightened their already restrictive laws on gun ownership in the wake of the Newtown shooting.Not all legislation aimed at guns this year will tighten restrictions. Illinois in July adopted a law allowing its residents to carry concealed guns, making it the last state in the nation to permit some form of possession of guns in public.

Lisa Murkowski's (R-Alaska) net approval rating dropped 16 points, as she shed much of her previous cross-party appeal. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) saw his numbers dive 18 points, from a positive to a negative rating.Not all of the change can be attributed to the vote. Portman, for instance, saw his approval drop among Republicans when he announced his support for gay marriage in March. But in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada and Ohio, at least 60 percent of voters supported background checks, and many expressed disappointment with politicians who voted otherwise. Fifty-two percent of Arizona voters said they were less likely to support Sen. Jeff Flake (R) for reelection due to his ""no"" vote, while 46 percent of Nevadans said the same of Sen. Dean Heller (R). More than a third of voters were less likely to back Portman as well as Alaska Sens. Mark Begich (D) and Murkowski. A previous PPP poll found that Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) also saw her ratings tumble 15 points, likely due in part to her vote against background checks.Much of the lost support comes from independent or moderate voters.PPP hasn't yet conducted polling on how senators who supported the bill have fared. But Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who cosponsored background check legislation, saw his approval rating increase by a net 7 points, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Friday.Nationally, most polls taken since the shooting in Newtown, Conn., have found that upwards of 80 percent of people support gun background checks, and that there is relatively little partisan division on the issue.Opinions were less unified on the actual legislation considered in the Senate, but most still say they wish it had gone through. A 65 percent majority of Americans said the measure should have passed, including 45 percent of Republicans and a majority of Democrats and independents, according to a Gallup poll released Monday. "

Kingston's legislation obviously falls far short of fully repealing Obamacare, which many conservatives insist should be the main goal. But Kingston said such a focus was not the best path. ""And there’s some criticism, 'Well, are you helping improve this law when you make that change? And should we be doing that?'"" Kingston said, referring to pushback against his bill. ""A lot of conservatives say, 'Nah, let’s just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own.' But I don’t think that’s always the responsible thing to do.""""I think we need to be looking for things that improve health care overall for all of us,"" he added. ""And if there was something in Obamacare, we need to know about it.""Listen:Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford told the Hill, which first picked up Crawford's comments, that the congressman was pushing for a replacement to Obamacare.""He essentially said that we don't just need to wait for Obamacare to die under its own weight, we need to be looking for solutions that would replace it,"" Crawford said.Kingston has also repeatedly voted to defund Obamacare.Kingston is running against seven other Republicans in the primary to replace the retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), and the winner is expected to face Michelle Nunn, the leading contender on the Democratic side, in the general election. An October survey by the Democratic Public Policy Polling found Nunn tied with with a generic Republican opponent.Kingston's position is notable because his primary opponents have staked out positions far more to the right. On Monday, Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.), for example, posted an op-ed on the conservative site Breitbart titled, ""Stop Wasting Time Trying To Fix Obamacare."" ""Obamacare is simply not fixable, and Congress must stop wasting time passing bills which keep Obamacare in place,"" wrote Broun.Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.) has promised to ""help repeal Obamacare in my first term, or go home"" and not run for reelection.While every Republican seems to want to repeal Obamacare, there is no consensus on what should go in its place. Making sure people have health insurance is expensive and disruptive, and Republicans don't have much appetite for taking up that battle. ""If you think about it, it would be in the interest of conservatives who believe in the magic of markets to make this system work,"" wrote Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""If it can be demonstrated that real competition in a real marketplace offers good services at lower overall costs, that adds powerful ammunition to the case for free markets.

Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) -- that appeals to the enthusiasms of a population that united against Obamacare under the banner of Taxed Enough Already in 2009, a year in which federal taxes actually hit historic lows.Cruz has argued that united Republicans could force President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate to accept a government-funding measure that essentially ends Obama's marquee achievement, the Affordable Care Act.""I believe that if Republicans stand together, this is a fight we can win,"" Cruz told reporters last week. ""It represents our best opportunity to actually defund Obamacare, and potentially our last good opportunity to do so,"" he said, arguing that although his side doesn't have the votes now, that can change over the August break.But more senior members of the GOP caucus -- most prominently Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) -- have said they see the idea as ill-conceived and unreasonable. In an unexpected twist, the veteran lawmakers who are not exactly known for being voices of moderation are appealing for a more deliberate approach. They worry that most of the nation simply is not ready to shutter the government just to hamstring Obamacare. And in interviews as Congress was getting ready to ready to adjourn until September, McCain, Coburn and other Republican leaders said that while they believe the health care law will be the train wreck the GOP is forecasting, following the path of Cruz, Lee and Rubio could produce a more immediate derailment -- of the GOP's electoral chances in 2014. ""I'm not sure why we should advocate for something that's absolutely impossible. The only way Obamacare is going to be repealed is with a 60-vote Republican Senate, and then, in order to override a presidential veto, I think it's 67 votes,"" McCain said. ""I haven't seen an attempt to override a veto in a long time. It's a non-starter.""And a political land mine, he added.""Those of us who have been around for a while know what happens when there's the threat of a shutdown of the government: It's the Congress that gets blamed,"" McCain said. ""If the minority uses its strength, its 41 votes [to filibuster government funding], then clearly the American people will blame the Congress. And they do -- that's the history. And those who say that's not the case ignore the lessons of history and the realities of American politics.""One of those who remembers the history is Coburn, who was first elected as a member of the House in the Republican revolution of 1994 -- before the last time the GOP shut down the government under then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) in 1995 and 1996.Coburn suggested that even then, when Republicans were more unified around the idea of a shutdown, they were not really all that committed to it -- making their efforts doomed to fail.""Here's what I know. I saw the lack of us holding what we said was our strategy, and ultimately losing 9 seats in the House when we should have won 22, and being less effective in the long-run because we didn't hold onto our strategy,"" Coburn told The Huffington Post. ""The difference is you had the vast majority of Republicans wanting to do that. You don't have the vast majority of Republicans wanting to do that now. So if you could do it, you'd hold for even less time. So what you'd do is say, 'Yes, the government's shut down.' And the first time the pressure gets up with people not really sold on the strategy, they'll bail on you,"" he said.""The only way that strategy works is if you're going to take the hostage and shoot it. Which means you're never going to open the government back up until Obama says uncle,"" Coburn said, arguing that there's no way a filibuster-strong 40 members of the GOP caucus would be willing to halt Social Security checks, mail delivery, passport services, construction work and the myriad other things constituents expect from the government in hopes of making Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blink. ""What is the likelihood of that? And what is the probability that members of the Senate will hold on that? It's about zero.""GOP strategists who lived through the Gingrich debacle are also keenly aware of the downsides.""Shutting down the government never works at the end of the day,"" said longtime GOP consultant Ed Rollins, who rose to prominence under Ronald Reagan and most recently served a brief stint running Rep. Michele Bachmann's (R-Minn.) 2012 presidential campaign. ""Even though we shut it down last time, it helped the president [Bill Clinton] win reelection.""Another strategist, former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Brian Walsh, said he found the tea party senators' push especially ill-timed because the GOP, he feels, is already scoring significant points by spotlighting and magnifying every new problem with the rollout of the health care law.Having the tea party heroes launch a holy war against fellow Republicans over their alleged insufficient purity on Obamacare is just about as welcome as a bruising primary challenge, Walsh said.""The frustrating part is politically we are on offense,"" Walsh said. ""You're seeing stories in a lot places about companies pulling out of the [Obamacare] markets, and small businesses cutting workers' hours. You're seeing all these stories about problems with the Obamacare implementation … So it's a little frustrating that instead of that being the focus, instead of keeping the Democrats on defense, there's a section of the party that would rather engage in fratricide.""Walsh is an especially acute observer in this case because it was during his stint at the NRSC that Republicans failed to retake the Senate, largely thanks to stumbles from tea party candidates such as Christine O'Donnell in Delaware in 2010 and Nevada's Sharron Angle that same year. Last year featured failures by Richard Mourdoch in Indiana and Todd Akin in Missouri. They all triumphed over more mainstream candidates in primaries, but alienated too many voters in the general elections, even in red states.""Conservatively, the party gave away five seats in those years,"" Walsh said.Coburn probably would not agree that anyone lost by being too conservative. He's proud of his own right-wing philosophy, and suggests that some of today's younger firebrands might not do as well holding on to core conservative values amid the compromises and temptations of Washington.""We'll see after 10 years if they still have a 99 [American Conservative Union] rating,"" Coburn said.What Coburn worries about is his newer colleagues making dumb promises.""If your strategy is to hold government funding hostage to defund Obamacare, the [Congressional Research Service] says as you do that, guess what's going to happen? Funding for Obamacare is going to continue,"" Coburn said, referring to a report by the nonpartisan CRS that explained most of the funding for the health care law is mandatory and not subject to Congress' annual appropriations battles. ""So it tells you the problem with the strategy.""And of course, there are the electoral consequences.""The other thing that's dangerous in it, is that you create the expectation in our base that you can do something that is absolutely not achievable. It may be achievable for two weeks or three weeks, but if your ultimate goal is to defund it, and you have a president and a Senate controlled by Democrats, and a thin majority in the House, the strategy doesn't work,"" Coburn said.""If you pump the base up and say here's something we can do when in fact you can't, but they believe you could have done it, and then you don't do it -- I think it keeps a lot of people at home, because they say, 'Gosh, the Republicans wouldn't stand again,'"" he said.Nevertheless, Cruz and Co. have embarked on a drive -- including an online petition that's racked up more than 250,000 signers -- to promote their shutdown showdown all through August, hoping to galvanize the same sort of 2009 outpouring that handed the GOP control of the House of Representatives the next year, and to pressure their colleagues into standing with them.""I for one, and I know my colleagues as well, are not prepared to go home and tell people, ‘Well, we tried, but we couldn’t,’"" Rubio said in announcing the push last week. ""We have to go home and say, 'We did everything we could. We took every step available to us.' And that's why this is such an important issue.""But McCain noted that a letter they circulated before the break was actually losing support. Indeed, one of the senators listed as uncommitted in the online petition, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, echoed her more conservative colleagues in slamming the shutdown threat.""Let's be realistic. Obamacare, a law that I strongly oppose, is not going to be repealed. So the effect of trying to repeal the funding of government inevitably leads to a government shutdown, which I do not believe is good policy or good politics,"" Collins said. ""The American people want common-sense solutions. They don't want us to pursue policies that are pointless, that are going to end in government shutting down, more partisanship, more gridlock. They want us to actually get things done.""Walsh argued that the dissidents should take a page from the conservative playbook of four years ago. ""When you look at 2009, the tea party ire was focused appropriately on Obamacare, and now you see some of that focused on the Republican Party,"" Walsh said, adding that the government shutdown threat is taking the GOP ""off message.""Particularly confounding to him was the fundamental irrationality in a push that casts some of the opponents of the Cruz-Lee-Rubio effort -- who also include Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) -- as not real conservatives.""When you're suggesting that anyone like Tom Coburn is less than conservative, you better look in the mirror,"" Walsh said.The older Republicans did not disparage the motives of their younger brethren, but at least three of them -- Cruz, Rubio, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) -- have openly flirted with a 2016 GOP presidential bid, which could benefit from tea party support. And the inboxes of just about anyone paying attention to the conservative movement has seen the steady stream lately of praise for the effort from groups like the Tea Party Express, as well as fundraising appeals. Still, political veterans thought the hotshots would be wise to cool it, at least a little.""Ted Cruz hasn't even been here two years, and he's got a bright, long future in the party,"" said Rollins. ""But he should be a little patient. You need make sure that whatever your goal is, it's something you can achieve. And you can't achieve this.""Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post. Talk to him on Facebook."

In certain corners of the foreign policy community, two theories in particular have developed. The first is that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice was promised the position of secretary of state only to have it taken away under the weight of Republican opposition. The second is that Obama never actually considered Rice for the post, instead, having her name floated to divert fire for his preferred choice, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). The former theory is regarded as more plausible than the latter. But the latter still has its believers. Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, pushed the theory in a blog post published on The Huffington Post on Tuesday arguing that former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod admitted that Rice was never considered during a recent interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe. It is possible that Axelrod saw his remarks as a way to protect the president from any lingering criticism over his handling of the Rice issue. There had, after all, been some undercurrent of discontent among women's groups who were upset over Rice's public humiliation. Also, the very visible scuttling of Rice did suggest to many observers that, despite Obama's reelection, Obama was once again showing how he caves into Republicans under a barrage of partisan attacks.But Axelrod never actually said that Obama didn't consider Rice for Foggy Bottom; in fact, in interviews during the process and as recently as today, he has said that Rice was very much in the mix. As he recounts, Obama surveyed a number of possible candidates, including Rice. He never came to a decision on who to appoint until he ultimately chose Kerry. The attacks on the U.N. ambassador over her role in disseminating talking points about the consulate attack in Benghazi factored into the administration's thinking. But they weren't disqualifying. If anything, Axelrod said, they made the president more sympathetic towards choosing her. ""There is a myth that has grown up that the president was run off from choosing her,"" Axelrod told The Huffington Post Tuesday. ""That just wasn't true. She was highly regarded and considered for the post.""""So far as my conversations with him and everything I know, he had never made a decision on that particular appointment and it is a misstatement of history to suggest he had chosen her or never considered her,"" he added. ""Kerry always was a strong candidate for that position.""  "

Rand Paul of Kentucky remains unequivocal in his opposition, tangling with Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday over constitutional powers and the possibility that a U.S. attack will further destabilize the Mideast. The tea party favorite and leading anti-interventionist in the GOP sees only a downside to a U.S. attack.""There's no sentiment in Kentucky, and the people up here are so out of touch,"" Paul told reporters on a conference call after a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing with Kerry and other national security officials. ""These senators who are going to vote for this, they need to go home and talk to their people or look at what their people are saying because people do not want to get involved in Syria and, despite what the people want, their senators are going to vote the opposite way, I have a bad feeling.""Paul didn't rule out a Senate filibuster of a resolution authorizing the president to use military force.""Whether there is an actual standing filibuster, I've got to check my shoes and see if I can hold my water,"" he said. ""We'll see. I haven't made a decision on that.""Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a fierce foe of Syrian President Bashar Assad, expressed frustration with the Obama administration's handling of Syria and skepticism about U.S. involvement.""When America ignores these problems, these problems don't ignore us,"" Rubio told senior administration officials at the Senate hearing. ""Yes, this is a horrible incident where perhaps 1,000 people died, but before this incident 100,000 people had died ... and nothing happened.""The administration says it has proof that the Assad regime used deadly chemical weapons in an attack on Damascus suburbs and must respond. It places the number killed at 1,429 people, including 426 children. However, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the death toll at 502.Potential Republican presidential candidates hardly want to appear weak on national security, an issue that traditionally has been a strength for the GOP. But no one knows whether the United States would be drawn into a protracted conflict or if limited military steps would prove unsuccessful in the 2-year-old civil war.Any Republican who supports the use of force resolution essentially will be siding with Obama, who is despised in conservative circles, and a vote in favor could anger more isolationist Republicans who are wary of getting involved in another military conflict after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.The votes could dog Republican candidates with voters in early primary states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Even the most nuanced explanation for a vote could be undermined by events on the ground.Yet if Republicans oppose the resolution, they could be accused of giving Assad a pass after his regime used chemical weapons.Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, who managed Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, said a vote in favor of the resolution would be the equivalent of ""a purchase of stock over the long term in Obama's decision-making on Syria.""""Any Republican may go into a vote thinking, `I have given authority for a limited scope of action to the president,' but the reality is you're buying stock in the president's current decisions on Syria and also his future actions in any escalation that may occur,"" Schmidt said.Polls show public opposition to U.S. military intervention in Syria, regardless of whether Syria's government used chemical weapons on its people, and doubts about airstrikes across party lines.A war vote can make or break a candidate. Just ask Hillary Rodham Clinton.In the 2008 Democratic primary, Obama used the October 2002 vote for the Iraq war as a cudgel against Clinton, who along with John Edwards voted to give President George W. Bush the broad authority to invade Iraq. Edwards said his vote was a mistake; Clinton stood by her decision - and never recovered with strong anti-war Democratic voters.Clinton, a potential Democratic candidate in 2016, has not spoken publicly about Obama's attempt to win congressional support for a military strike against Syria. But an aide to Clinton said Tuesday that she supports the president's effort in Congress to pursue a targeted response to the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons.In 2004, the first presidential election since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Democratic primary voters rejected the anti-war candidate, Howard Dean, and nominated John Kerry, the decorated Vietnam War veteran who had backed the Iraq war. Kerry was perceived as the stronger candidate on national security against the incumbent president, but he stumbled in explaining his Iraq war votes, saying he voted for an $87 billion war supplemental ""before I voted against it."" Bush prevailed in the election.For Republicans, the debate over Syria foreshadows a fierce argument in the party over the role of U.S. foreign policy and military involvement after Iraq and Afghanistan. The divisions have been simmering for months.Paul conducted a lengthy Senate filibuster in March to raise concerns over the president's use of aerial drones to kill suspected terrorists, rallying libertarians within the party. Some establishment Republicans opposed the filibuster and pushed back against criticism of the National Security Agency's collection of hundreds of millions of U.S. phone records, saying it was needed to keep Americans safe.In July, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the libertarian strain within the GOP a ""very dangerous thought"" more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. Paul responded, saying Christie was worried about the ""dangers of freedom"" instead of being concerned about losing those freedoms.As Obama has pushed for the U.S. to intervene in Syria, the GOP divisions have emerged.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has expressed skepticism about possible intervention, saying the administration has yet to make a forceful case that it would protect U.S. national security interests.The Syria question is easier to avoid outside Washington.Christie, asked about the Syrian conflict Tuesday, told reporters the ""use of chemical weapons is something that just is intolerable for civilized society,"" but he said he would ""let the policymaking be done by the people who are getting the bulk of the briefing on this, which is our federal representatives."""

Washington and its allies are intrigued but still wary, making clear they hope to see tangible steps to back up his words.Speaking to the U.S. network at his presidential compound in Tehran, Rouhani said the tone of a letter he had received from President Barack Obama, part of a recent exchange of messages between the leaders, was ""positive and constructive.""""It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,"" Rouhani said six days before he is due to address the U.N. General Assembly, a speech that will be closely watched for fresh diplomatic overtures.Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said that nuclear weapons development would be inconsistent with Islamic values. But a willingness by a newly elected president to rule out nuclear arms could help provide a new opening in long-stalled international nuclear talks.Questions remain about how much bargaining room Khamenei, a staunch promoter of Iran's nuclear program, will give his negotiators, whether in secret talks with Washington or in multilateral discussions with major powers.Comments on Tuesday by Khamenei about the need for ""flexibility"" suggests a new willingness at the highest level to explore a compromise solution to Tehran's dispute with the West. 'COMPLETE AUTHORITY'""This government enters with full power and has complete authority,"" Rouhani said, according to an NBC translation. ""I have given the nuclear negotiations portfolio to foreign ministry. The problem won't be from our side. We have sufficient political latitude to solve this problem.""The White House responded cautiously.""The world has heard a lot from President Rouhani's administration about its desire to improve the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's relations with the international community, and President Obama believes we should test that assertion,"" White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said.""We hope that this new Iranian government will engage substantively in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program.""The United States and its allies suspect Iran is seeking bomb-making capability despite Tehran's insistence that its program has only peaceful aims. Israel, believed to be the Middle East's only nuclear weapons power, has repeatedly called for a credible military threat to halt Iran's nuclear advance.Since Rouhani was elected president in June, the centrist cleric has called for ""constructive interaction"" with the world, a dramatic shift in tone from the strident anti-Western rhetoric of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Obama said in a television interview on Tuesday that he was prepared to test Rouhani's willingness to open a nuclear dialogue, but he did not back away from previous U.S. demands.The United States and Iran cut diplomatic relations in 1980, after students and Islamic militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took American diplomats hostage.Obama ran for president in 2008 in part by vowing to engage with Iran. But Tehran continued its nuclear development and tough sanctions imposed by Washington and the United Nations have taken a severe toll on Iran's economy."

The young Kim rose to power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. But is the 30-year-old ""Dear Leader"" the only one pulling North Korea's political strings? HuffPost World investigates. THE INSTITUTIONSThe International Crisis Group explains that the Korean Workers Party (KWP) is North Korea's main political organ. The 124 members of the party's Central Committee select a General Secretary, the 10-member Secretariat, a 14-member Politbureau, a Presidium and the members of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC). As the ICC notes, the party structure fully support the dictatorship. Deceased leader Kim Jong Il is the party's ""Eternal Secretary,"" while Kim Jong Un is First Secretary. Kim Jong Un also heads the powerful National Defense Commission (NDC), a position that gives him control over the armed forces. Powerful figures in the regime can take up different mandates within the party or the security apparatus over time and can even combine several positions. THE FIGURESKim Kyong Hui Since the death of her brother Kim Jong Il, Kim Kyong Hui has become one of North Korea's most powerful officials. The Dear Leader's 66-year-old aunt was appointed the most important member of the KWP's Politburo and first among members of the Secretariat. In addition, she was made a general in the army. Jang Song Thaek Kim Kyong Hui's husband, Jang Song Thaek, is deputy chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission and an alternate member of the Politburo, Reuters explains. The Soviet-trained technocrat was first spotted  in a general's uniform in the wake of Kim Jong Il's death. Kim Jong Un's aunt and uncle were crucial figures in the transition of power after Kim Jong Il's death in December 2011. John Park of the U.S. Institute for Peace told the Associated Press after the former leader's passing that the powerful couple are ""key pillars"" of the young Kim's reign. While analysts speculated the duo's power would gradually decline as young Kim gained ruling experience, thus far, the duo's influence has not waned -- as evidenced by their frequent appearances flanking their nephew on official events. ABC points out that the leader's aunt and uncle were present on stage when Kim reaffirmed his country's commitment to nuclear weapons during a speech on March 31. This power couple appears to occasionally live through its version of drama, too. According to ABC, Jang did not support North Korea's long-range missile launch last December, ""but was overruled by his wife."" Kim Kyong Hui, Kim Jong Un and Jang Song Thaek in December 2011.

The 70-year-old Pak has been a confidant to the Kim family and earlier served as prime minister from 2003 until 2007. He was tasked with implementing economic reforms to lift the country out of poverty, but was dismissed when the measures appeared to fail. Pak is closely associated with Jang Song Thaek and Kim Kyong Hui, Reuters notes, and while his reappointment is meant to strengthen Kim's grip on power, it makes the young leader ""dangerously dependent"" on the power duo.

Jeb Bush (R) makes a notable reversal on immigration reform, arguing that creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants would only encourage future unauthorized immigration.""It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences -- in this case, that those who violated the law can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship,"" Bush and lawyer Clint Bolick argue in a new book, Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution. ""To do otherwise would signal once again that people who circumvent the system can still obtain the full benefits of American citizenship."" The book, which The Huffington Post obtained before its Tuesday release, lays out the two men's proposals for comprehensive immigration reform. Both are longtime proponents of reform, and Bush in particular has long beat the drum for the GOP to take a new tone on the matter. But the book's treatment of a pathway to citizenship stands in contrast to Bush's previous statements on immigration reform. And ironically, later in the book Bush argues that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, suffered immense political damage by moving to the right on the issue during the GOP primary. ""Mitt Romney moved so far to the right on immigration issues that it proved all but impossible for him to appeal to Hispanic voters in the general election,"" Bush and Bolick write. ""Although Romney eventually called for comprehensive immigration reform, a platform that hardened the party's stance on immigration hung like an anvil around his candidacy,"" they continue. Bush's reversal doesn't appear as severe as some of the tough rhetoric used by Romney during the primary. Still, it creates a contrast between him and some of Bush's possible 2016 Republican primary opponents, and shows what could be the biggest problem in finding a compromise on immigration reform this year. While some Republicans, including potential 2016 candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), are calling for a pathway to citizenship, most members of the party are arguing for only legalization. Democrats, meanwhile, argue a special road to become citizens is absolutely necessary. The American people for the most part also support such a measure, according to a number of polls. As of June 2012, Bush asserted that he supported a pathway to citizenship.""You have to deal with this issue,"" Bush told CBS' Charlie Rose. ""You can't ignore it, and so either a path to citizenship, which I would support -- and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives -- or ... a path ... to residency of some kind.""In the book, however, Bush and Bolick write that there should be ""two penalties for illegal entry: fines and/or community service and ineligibility for citizenship."" They don't fully rule out citizenship, however, despite what that sentence implies. Although Bush and Bolick state there should be no special pathway, they say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to go through normal channels to naturalize by going to their native country to apply. That process currently requires three- or 10-year bars and no guarantee of return, making it untenable to many undocumented immigrants. ""A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage,"" they write. ""However, illegal immigrants who wish to become citizens should have the choice of returning to their native countries and applying through normal immigration processes that now would be much more open than before."" Bush and Bolick propose a different solution for Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children. They argue citizenship should be granted to people who entered the country under the age of 18, have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, committed no ""significant crimes"" and either graduated from high school, obtained a GED or entered military service. For legal immigration, they argue there must be a better process that makes it less appealing to come to the United States without authorization.""There is one reason above all others that we have millions of illegal immigrants in our country: because under our current immigration system, there is no lawful avenue for them to enter the country. ... So that saying 'they should wait in line like everyone else' is hollow because there is no line in which to wait,"" they write. ""The days in which people could lawfully emigrate to the United States just because they wanted to pursue the American Dream are as much a memory as Ellis Island."" UPDATE: 2:55 p.m. -- Bush defended his stance to the Miami Herald's Marc Caputo after an anonymous Romney adviser accused him of advocating for the same positions that he said tanked the former GOP presidential candidate.""[I] am not advocating self deportation. read the book,"" Bush wrote in an email. The advisor argued to Caputo that it was the same stance. ""Where the hell was this Jeb Bush during the campaign?"" the advisor said. ""He spent all this time criticizing Romney and it turns out he has basically the same position. So he wants people to go back to their country and apply for citizenship? Well, that's self deportation. We got creamed for talking about that. And now Jeb is saying the same thing."""

The Israeli consul general is set to speak, along with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.Clinton interrupted a trip to Japan to return to New York for the funeral, according to Koch spokesman George Arzt.He said Koch was a friend of both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and was helpful during her successful campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York. Koch also backed Hillary Clinton in her presidential run.Bill Clinton will serve as a representative for President Barack Obama at the funeral.Koch died Friday of congestive heart failure at age 88.Friends from his weekly Greenwich Village luncheon gathering got together on Saturday, two weeks after his last meal with them.The funeral will be held at one of the nation's most prominent synagogues, a Reform Jewish congregation on Fifth Avenue. Bloomberg is a member, as are comedian Joan Rivers and former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer.""I don't want to leave Manhattan, even when I'm gone,"" he told The Associated Press in 2008 after purchasing a burial plot in Trinity Church Cemetery, at the time the only graveyard in Manhattan that still had space. ""This is my home. The thought of having to go to New Jersey was so distressing to me.""Koch led his city for 12 years, with a brash, humor-tinged style that came to personify the New York of the 1980s.The Democratic mayor is credited with helping save New York from its economic crisis in the 1970s and leading it to financial rebirth. But during his three terms as mayor, he also faced racial tensions and corruption among political allies, as well as the AIDS epidemic, homelessness and urban crime.In his weekly radio address, Bloomberg called Koch ""our most tireless, fearless, and guileless civic crusader.""The mayor said his predecessor's ""tough, determined leadership and responsible fiscal stewardship ... helped lift the city out of its darkest days and set it on course for an incredible comeback.""He added, ""When someone needed a good kick in the rear, he gave it to them.""Koch lost the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1989 to David Dinkins, who succeeded him.Koch said he was defeated ""because of longevity.""

Paladino easily defeated Adrian Fitzgerald Harris 79 percent to 20 percent to capture a seat representing the south Buffalo neighborhood. The move comes 2 1/2 years after Paladino lost the race for the governor's mansion to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) by 29 percentage points after upsetting New York's Republican establishment in the GOP primary. Paladino, a millionaire developer, entered the school board race in January vowing to ""destroy"" the nine-member board. He has long been at odds with board members, filing a lawsuit against the board last year to challenge the appointment of a new schools superintendent. He said he wants to fire the school system's entire top leadership and has challenged the Buffalo teachers union. Paladino has described African American women school board members as a ""parasitic black sisterhood.""  In 2010, the Buffalo Common Council considered a resolution condemning Paladino for racial insensitivity. In 2011, Paladino proposed that Buffalo's school system create boarding schools in order to improve test scores. He said boarding schools would provide children with study skills, meals and a chance to escape dysfunctional families. He repeated the boarding school proposal during his school board campaign. Paladino has courted controversy. In October, he had bumper stickers tied to the birther movement placed on cars at a Thrifty rental car branch he owns at Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The stickers said, ""Vote for the American."" During his failed gubernatorial campaign, a series of racist and sexually charged emails he forwarded to friends surfaced. At the time, he told the New York Post that he was not a racist, but said he would not run a politically correct campaign for New York state's top job. Despite his business success, Paladino has struggled in elective politics. In 2008, he used his own money in an unsuccessful effort to oust a Republican state senator he did not like.Paladino won the 2010 Republican primary over former Rep. Rick Lazio, who was backed by the state GOP, based largely on landslide numbers in western New York, where he captured 93 percent of the vote in Buffalo's Erie County. "

Or...rather, any such debates will not be sanctioned. Any GOP candidate who appears on any such debates will be...well, I don't know what will happen to them.This ultimatum is the ""news-making"" portion of the resolution the RNC has just passed, in which it makes its displeasure over these Clinton projects known. Or rather, more earnestly known -- obviously these complaints have been in the news for weeks. Deep within the resolution, however, is the acknowledgement that the 2012 primary debates were not beneficial to the GOP, and an outline of a sensible plan to improve the way the party handles its primary season debates in 2016.The ""news-making"" part of the resolution really complicates the ""sensible plan"" part of the resolution, for reasons that I am at a loss to understand.Here is the resolution that was passed:The RNC's paramount complaint is that any sort of Hillary Clinton biopic or documentary amounts to a tacit political endorsement. This has been Reince Priebus' argument from the outset. As I've previously discussed, there is a reality that Priebus is probably missing. One of the proposed ""Hillary Clinton movies"" is actually a documentary that's being created by Charles Ferguson, who helmed the documentary ""Inside Job"" about the financial crisis. It's very likely to be highly critical of Clinton and her husband's administration. As Frank Rich notes: ""It’s impossible to imagine that Ferguson would do a hagiography of Hillary, whose husband’s administration empowered many of the villains in 'Inside Job.'"" Obviously, Rich is making an assumption, but it's not a big leap. The irony I'm imagining, actually, is the CNN documentary providing a lot of fodder for future RNC attack ads. I'm going to go ahead and make plans to write the piece titled, ""RNC Attack Ad Cites CNN Documentary It Tried To Derail.""Now, as for NBC's proposed Clinton project -- it's a biopic, in which Diane Lane will portray Clinton. This sounds to me like it's going to fit more squarely in the parameters of ""hagiography,"" though I'd prefer to call it ""soft focus melodramatic made-for-teevee cheese."" Now, I doubt that this movie will ultimately conclude anything other than the fact that Clinton is an amazing, historical figure. I'd suggest to Priebus, however, that there will nevertheless be a saving grace here: This Clinton movie is likely to be really, really stupid.And as I've previously written, I think Peggy Noonan has sort of grokked what it's going to be like, in the end:It will be a drama about Hillary’s wonderfulness and when it’s done they’ll privately screen it and an executive will say, “We’re going to be accused of liberal bias, we’d better balance it a little.” So they’ll reshoot some scenes and insert things that might make Hillary look bad, but they’ll choose the wrong things, stupid things, and it will make the whole effort look cheesy.So, this is not something that I'd particularly worry about if I were Priebus. In the end, I think we're looking at one project that will, if anything, hurt Clinton and another project that will, if anything, simply prove to be unhelpful to Clinton.What I would worry about, if I were in the RNC, is the way Priebus portrays his party as helpless in the face of a few teevee shows. Whatever happened to ""never let them see you sweat""? This whole ""trembling in the face of some movies about Hillary Clinton"" thing is not a good look. Moreover, while I understand that much of this is simply a bit of ""working the refs"" kabuki, Priebus is actually helping to amplify Clinton's whole phenomenon, when he should be trying to promote what his party and its future candidates are all about.Priebus, however, does have a debate problem, which is addressed in the last part of the RNC resolution. Bringing an ""order to the primary debates"" and ""[ensuring] a reasonable number"" of them? That's a solid plan. Let's definitely never have 20 debates in a primary season again! On this matter, I consider Priebus to be an American hero. (As I'll have to watch all debates that happen, I think of Priebus as being on a mission of mercy, tailored to me, and I really cannot thank him enough.)I also think that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the RNC angling to put its candidates in debates with moderators who are on the same side of the ideological spectrum. Why not? The singular purpose of the party's primary debates is to help its base make determinations between candidates of a similar ideological strain. Even if this means that Fox News' Chris Wallace serves as moderator for all of them, believe me, Wallace will take that task very seriously.Over at the Washington Examiner, Byron York agrees that it's the final part of this resolution that really illuminates what's going on in the back of Priebus' mind:That is what top party officials have wanted to do ever since it became clear that the GOP’s grueling series of twenty-plus debates in 2011 and 2012 created more bloodletting, division, and sometimes embarrassment for the party than enlightenment of voters. Ever since that moment — RNC officials realized it as it was happening but were powerless to stop it — the party has wanted to limit the number of debates and exert more control over who moderated them. That was going to happen even if NBC and CNN had never announced plans for Hillary Clinton programs. And that is what today’s resolution is really all about.The real question, then, is why did this solid plan for improving the primary debates get inextricably tied to this hysterical garment-rending session over a couple of movies? I don't have a good answer to this question. Maybe the RNC is in this place right now where it can't even move forward without some foil at which to take aim. Maybe it thinks that a decision to limit the number of debates will be met with derision and criticism, and so it's putting forth the Clinton movies as a way of insulating itself from criticism. The simplest explanation is probably just that any resolution about debates and debate moderators is going to ""make news,"" and the RNC would rather the headline be, ""RNC Takes Stand Against Clinton Movies,"" as opposed to, ""RNC Admits That Its Last Set Of Primary Debates Was Embarrassing.""Ultimately, however, the RNC is probably not going to get NBC or CNN to bend to its ultimatum. It is not going to be able to stop NBC or CNN (or Telemundo and CNN Espanol) from staging debates. It is not even going to be able to stop Republicans from participating in those debates, if they really want to do so. That's a lot of battles that it can't really win, so why fight them?[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"
2975	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/26/climate-change-jobs_n_3505254.html	News	1	Economy	Environment	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Even before President Barack Obama unveiled his sweeping climate change plan on Tuesday, Republican leaders were denouncing the effort as a job-killer. Any move to restrict polluting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, they maintained, would send energy costs up and lead to mass layoffs in a vital job sector. At a press conference last Thursday, House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) blasted the expected proposal as “absolutely crazy.” “Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs at a time when the American people are still asking where are the jobs?” he asked.But experts who have studied the intersection of environmental policy and the job market say there's little truth to this claim, if any. Such assertions are ""wildly overstated,"" said Richard Revesz, the director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University. He framed Boehner's remark as the latest iteration of a “job-killer meme” that has surfaced frequently in recent years as Republicans have sought to drum up fears about Obama’s environmental efforts. “We hear often that large swaths of the economy will be wiped out due to one regulation or another,” Revesz said. “Fortunately, and not surprisingly, we don't see those predictions coming true.” In a comprehensive 2012 review of more than 25 studies that attempted to gauge the effect of environmental regulations on jobs, a team of researchers led by Revesz found that many claims about such regulations were unreliable.While studies commissioned by the coal industry warned that millions of jobs could be lost, others conducted by left-leaning think tanks and environmental groups predicted that millions of jobs would be gained, their survey found.By contrast, the most detailed studies concluded that job losses and gains from environmental regulations essentially balanced out. ""When serious studies have been done, the impacts tend to be small -- sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but small,"" Revesz said.Obama said Tuesday that he would use his executive powers to place limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The plan is the most ambitious effort by a U.S. president to address climate change to date and includes $8 billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects, such as efforts to trap and store carbon dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plants. One company that stands to benefit from the plan is Neumann Systems Group, based in Colorado Springs, Colo. The company recently won a $73.5 million contract to apply its liquid-based emissions scrubbing technology to a local power plant that is under construction. Todd Tiahrt, Neumann's CEO, said the technology could also be used to retrofit older plants at a cost of about $150 million for an average-sized facility.Tiahrt said he expected Obama's proposal would spur growth in his field, and that in five years his operation could employ 500 engineers. But he also worried that new regulations would single out coal plants for closure, even though they are hardly the only carbon polluters.""My initial reaction is this amounts to an unfair segregation of the coal industry,"" he said.Coal plants are still proliferating across the world, Tiahrt said, and any initiative to curb their use in the United States would also inhibit the growth of businesses like his that are developing methods to make coal clean.Perhaps sensing this paradox, Democrats seem to be pulling back on their attempts to directly counter Republicans' jobs fears and portray climate regulations as boons to the job market.The policy paper that accompanied Obama's announcement mentions potential job growth stemming from the proposed measures six separate times, but it avoids any specifics, such as what types of jobs might be created and in which industries.Indeed, the only specific job-growth number in the report refers to an ""estimated"" 17,000 jobs created at 50 solar and wind farms and geothermal plants approved by the Department of Energy since 2009.This reluctance to be predictive could be a sign the administration wants to bury a boast Obama made while on the campaign trail in 2008. If elected president, he pledged, he would invest in green-energy technology that would yield 5 million jobs.The best opportunity at realizing that goal came in 2009, when the massive stimulus approved by Congress provided $90 billion in loans, tax credits and other measures for increasing clean energy production and bolstering public transit.Even the most vocal supporters of the stimulus acknowledge that the investment didn't create many jobs. Robert Pollin, a former Energy Department official who was tasked with tabulating jobs stemming from the stimulus, said his ""best guess"" is that 240,000 green jobs were created from 2009 to 2011.But while those green-energy efforts may not have boosted the job market, they weren't job-killers either, Revesz noted. And all things considered, he said, Obama's newly proposed climate rules are likely to do more good than harm.""With the health benfits and environmental benefits are strong as they are, it's really clear to us that we as a nation are better off with these regulations,"" he said.

The main message that the promo hammered home over and over again was that Americans were being denied the news they deserved on television.Clips of Bill O'Reilly and Al Sharpton were played, and people in different towns were filmed talking about how underserved they felt.""Americans want wider coverage and more real news,"" Richelle Carey, one of the anchors hosting the promo, told viewers.The network also touted its 12 bureaus across the country and vowed to tell stories that weren't airing on its rival channels.The problem for Al Jazeera America is that many millions of people don't have access to those stories. Though the network is available in 40 million households, Al Jazeera America faces a distribution challenge. The network recently took its request directly to viewers, asking potential audience members to ask their cable providers for Al Jazzera America if they do not already provide it. The network's highly anticipated debut was more than 8 months in the making. In January, former Vice President Al Gore  and Joel Hyatt sold Current TV to Al Jazeera. The Doha-based news network said it would replace Current TV's programming and launch a new cable network called Al Jazeera America, which would be based in New York City.The announcement was met with some hostility, as many criticized Gore for selling to a network backed by oil money. ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart described the deal as an ""odd move"" and grilled the former vice president on his decision to sell the network to a ""fossil-fuel-based buyer.""Upon news of the sale, Time Warner Cable, which accounts for 12 million households, dropped the low-performing Current TV. Hyatt told staff in a memo that Time Warner Cable ""did not consent to the sale to Al Jazeera.""Al Jazeera also has a well-known image issue with viewers who stubbornly associate it with anti-Americanism. The initial promo tried to address this head-on, playing clips of Hillary Clinton and John McCain praising Al Jazeera, and showing a man on the street who said, ""It's a business. They're entitled to set up a business.""Originally set to launch in June, Al Jazeera America had to push its launch back a few months as it searched for New York office space, a news director and top talent. The network eventually hired hundreds of employees and plucked some top talent from competing cable news networks. CNN's Ali Velshi left to join Al Jazeera America as a primetime host, and former CNN morning show host Soledad O'Brien signed on as a correspondent. She also inked a documentary production deal. Just last month, former ABC News executive Kate O'Brian was named the network's president."

Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), was intern Daniel Hernandez Jr., who helped save his congresswoman's life. Later that year, he continued his public service when he was elected to the school board for the Sunnyside Unified School District, which covers southern Tucson and adjacent areas in Pima County.Now, however, Hernandez is facing not only a recall campaign, but an anonymous anti-gay smear campaign as well.Four of the five members of the school board, in fact, are facing recall. On one side are the two opponents of superintendent Manuel Isquierdo -- including Hernandez. On the other side are the superintendent's supporters, who include board president Louie Gonzales. Hernandez and fellow board member Buck Crouch voted against extending Isquierdo's contract in June, after news broke about his financial and legal issues.Community members launched a recall effort against Gonzales and another Isquierdo supporter, Bobby Garcia, a month ago. Last week, supporters of Gonzales began a retaliatory recall effort against Hernandez and Crouch.But flyers being passed around to constituents, first reported by Right Wing Watch, go after Hernandez for being gay and for supporting gun control measures.""Put a REAL Man on the Sunnyside Board,"" reads one flyer, with a picture of Hernandez speaking at an Equality Forum event. ""Daniel Hernandez is LGBT. We need someone who will support Sports and cares about our kids. We don't need someone who hates our values. RECALL Daniel Hernandez TODAY.""The second flyer claims that Hernandez ""cares about only one things [sic] taking your guns away.""Hernandez told The Huffington Post several parents had alerted him to the flyers, which were being distributed outside at least five of the 23 schools in the district.""I've had a target on my back from my fellow board members for awhile because I don't go with the flow, and if something doesn't sound right or make sense, I call them out on it,"" Hernandez said.Hernandez said he first heard the ""real man"" attack during his 2011 campaign, when he ran against Garcia, who was voted onto the board in a subsequent election.The Hernandez recall campaign is being run by Marcos Castro, the campaign manager for Gonzales.Castro told The Huffington Post he had nothing to do with the Hernandez flyers, although he received one at his house.""I don't have nothing to do with it,"" he said.Multiple requests to the office of the Sunnyside School Board to speak with Gonzales were not returned.Hernandez's opponents need to collect 1,300 signatures by Dec. 14 to get the recall vote on the ballot.""My governing board president has started the recall process on me, with the people who are his friends and closest allies in the community. I'm not overly concerned they're going to get the 1,300 signatures, but just the negative tone and nature of the way they're doing it has been really bothersome and upsetting,"" said Hernandez. ""It's disheartening that this is where we are in 2013, that people think it's okay to put out these kinds of flyers about anybody,"" he added.UPDATE: Aug. 27 -- Gonzales told The Huffington Post that he was not at all involved in the flyers and does not support anti-gay attacks. He added that he believed Hernandez and his allies were actually the ones behind them, in a subterfuge attempt to make his opponents look bigoted.""He's trying to turn this whole thing around,"" said Gonzales, adding, ""We're not anti-gay or gun control by any means.""Gonzales said he supported the superintendent because he believed he should be judged strictly on his performance in the schools, regardless of his financial and legal issues.""I think Mr. Hernandez may be a bit immature and young, and he's using all the resources ... and doing that, and it's kind of embarrassing,"" he said.Hernandez later replied that he wasn't surprised his opponents are denying a role in creating the flyers, stating, ""If they truly have nothing to do with it, I ask that they renounce these attacks, drop this sham of an election and attend sensitivity training.""Also on Tuesday afternoon, Giffords tweeted in support of Hernandez:View the flyers, via Right Wing Watch: "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), served up a stemwinder this week, laying out God’s positions on the death penalty, guns in schools, gay marriage, communism and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), all in an impassioned 45 minutes.The Cuban-American creationist quoted Bible verses that he said described God’s hardline position on capital punishment. “You know, the Bible is so clear,"" he said. ""Go to Genesis chapter nine and you will find the death penalty clearly stated in Genesis chapter nine ... God ordains the death penalty!”He brushed off “all these people that want to come home with their violins to tell you, ‘Oh, we need to show mercy,'"" declaring that the death penalty rightly shows no mercy.On the subject of mass shootings on school campuses, Cruz blamed Democrats who have lobbied for gun control in response to the atrocities. “Look at all the massacres that we’ve had in the last year or two that the left is using to try to tell us that we need to control guns. Every one of those was in a gun-free zone,” Cruz said, amid exclamations of “Amen!” and “Exactly!” from the audience.“You want to eliminate school massacres? Have the teachers carry [guns]! … How stupid can you be?” Cruz said. An audience member answered, “It’s doggone stupid!”Cruz also spoke at length against same-sex marriage, arguing, “It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.” He said the legalization of gay marriage would lead to a deluge of hate speech claims. “After this homosexual marriage law gets passed, do you know what the next thing that is coming very soon is? ... Hate speech,” Cruz said. “You preach Romans chapter one in your church, you’re going to be called before a court for hate speech. Now what are you gonna do? Are you going to take that page and cut it out of your Bible? Because it’s not politically correct? So it’s going to come to a head.”More broadly, the senator's father warned that “social justice very quickly leads to socialism and ultimately communism.” He squeezed in a jab at the National Rifle Association's past support for the Senate majority leader, asking, “How can you call yourself righteous and go endorse Harry Reid?”Cruz attacked President Barack Obama as a “king” and a “tyrant,” before closing with “God bless you all.”The event at which Cruz spoke was sponsored by the gun rights advocacy group OK2A and the anti-government Tulsa 9.12 Project.

The action threw the communion into disarray.At the Jerusalem meeting, the primates called for the creation of an Anglican province in North America to rival the Episcopal Church. Five years later, the primates say the new Anglican province, known as the Anglican Church in North America, is thriving.Now, the archbishop of Nigeria and archbishops in East Africa have organized the second Global Anglican Future Conference at which they hope to accelerate the process that began in Jerusalem. The so-called GAFCON II meeting will take place Oct. 21-26 in Nairobi.“We have succeeded in consolidation,” said Ugandan Anglican Archbishop Stanley Ntagali.“Anglican churches have been planted in North America. The clergy trust one another to preach according to the Bible,” he said. “But the crisis in the communion continues to deepen as more (homosexual) consecrations occur.”In addition to the consecration of gay bishops, the African primates are concerned with the growing acceptance of same-sex unions in the West. They say attempts to discipline the Episcopal Church were not successful, and, as a result, a “spiritual cancer” has spread to other provinces, including the Anglican Church of Canada, the Church of England, the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church in Wales, and the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.In their words, GAFCON II seeks to restore good order, theological integrity and biblical faithfulness.“We need to see the overthrow by some churches of the creation order of female and male as just one symptom of the disease,” wrote Kenyan Anglican Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, chairman of the GAFCON primates’ council in a letter to the conference dated Thursday (Aug. 22). “The cause is spiritual.”The primates remain optimistic that Archbishop Justin Welby, the new global leader of the Anglican Communion, may prevent a split since he is on record as being opposed to gay consecrations.“The primates are happy with Welby since he has been attending our meetings,” said Ntagali. “He has taken time to follow what we are doing and he understands we are not breaking the communion.”YS/AMB END NZWILI

The article examines a new book by Stephen Jimenez, The Book of Matt, which suggests Shepard's murder was drug-related.In Rios' retelling, however, Shepard's murder was part of a long-term plan by liberals and the LGBT community to create a society that is accepting of gay people.It is up to Christian conservatives, Rios argued, to stop that acceptance. ""We can't let [gay people] keep breaking hearts and taking lives,"" she said, one of a number of references Rios made to her theory that gay men are responsible for the AIDS epidemic.""You think youth is worshipped in heterosexual sex? It is top of the line [for gay men]. And they like young men, young virile men,"" Rios told a crowd of hundreds in the ballroom of the Omni Shoreham Hotel. ""You get old and you're a gay man? There's so much rejection.""Rios also railed against the nonprofit civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks and catalogues extremist and hate groups in the United States. Rios said the SPLC ""cares more about attacking American Christians than it does about protecting"" the civil rights of African-Americans, which the group has done for more than three decades.SPLC and a coalition of other human rights groups encouraged members of Congress not to speak at the Values Voter Summit because a number of the sponsoring groups, including the American Family Association and the Family Research Council, hold extremist anti-gay views.President Barack Obama in 2009 passed anti-hate crimes legislation named after Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., who was also killed in a hate crime."

""I was insulted and offended."" Wenis told The Huffington Post in an interview Friday night that in the 36 hours since he first posted his response, he received two more robocalls from the NRA, one later on Thursday night and one on Friday evening. ""I've got a 5-year-old son who went to preschool on the Sandy Hook Elementary School campus,"" Wenis explained. ""And this was a really hard week for me on a lot of levels.

He said an NRA phone operator assured him he would be removed from NRA call lists. But the calls kept coming. By Friday night, Wenis said, he was desperate to be left in peace.

""Our son loves to answer the phone because it might be Grandma.""Maurath said he listened to a prerecorded message about Connecticut state gun legislation for about 30 seconds -- a call that he was stunned to realize took no account of who might pick up the phone.""The idea that this message could have been delivered to a sibling of one of the families who lost children at [Sandy Hook Elementary School] is just appalling,"" he said. In the months since the tragic school shooting in December, Newtown has become a focal point for the nation's renewed debate over gun control, as well as an international symbol of America's epidemic of gun violence.

In a concise, 3-minute argument, Merkle said the proposed legislation would not prevent violence.“Ever since I first learned how to shoot, the issue with gun violence around the nation became clear — guns are not the problem, people are,"" Merkle told the lawmakers. “Purging our society of violence and murder cannot be done by gun control legislation.""The teen, who is secretary of the Maryland Rifle Club and a life-long sport shooter, also said ""guns are not needed for mass murder, and robbing American citizens over rights to own them won’t solve anything."" Merkle added that the proposed laws would stop her from attending college on a shooting scholarship.ABC News notes that Maryland's ""Firearm Safety Act of 2013,"" a provision regarding interstate transportation of weapons, could make it harder for Merkle to practice shooting at a range in Delaware.While Merkle's testimony will probably not influence Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is expected to soon sign the gun measure into law, it has made her a budding star among conservative bloggers and gun rights advocates.A YouTube video of the teen's testimony has racked up more than 2.5 million views in the ensuing weeks. The clip also has garnered 16,000-plus comments. On Sunday, Merkle told the Washington Times that she was glad her video was getting attention, if only to bring more awareness to the issue.“The biggest part of this is that the pro-gun, Second Amendment argument is getting publicity,” Merkle said. “I like that it actually got out there, and not just because it’s me, but because it’s the argument.”On Tuesday, Merkle also made an appearance on Fox News program ""Hannity."" Host Sean Hannity praised Merkle for understanding that gun control wouldn't have prevented the Sandy Hook tragedy. ""Here you are, 15-years-old, you get that,"" he said, asking why did she think the massacre was being ""used as an issue to control people's guns.""""I don't understand what they're doing, they are criminalizing law abiding citizens,"" Merkle replied. She also told him that she thought the AR-15 rifle -- the weapon used by Newtown shooter Adam Lanza -- is actually one of the most effective weapons for self-defense. The AR-15 is much more accurate, and much easier to fire, Merkle said, especially for children or people with smaller frames.Merkle told the Washington Times that her high profile comments have also attracted some less-than-positive feedback, including pretty nasty threats, but she said she remains committed to the cause.""I’m not going to stop fighting on this just because some people disagree with me,"" she said."

The Change for Trayvon movement will shine the light on stand-your-ground laws across the nation. These laws allow individuals to shoot first and ask questions later.”The site provides PayPal links for those wishing to make contributions, which ""will be used to educate voters, candidates, and elected officials on the impact these laws have on victims and families,"" according to the site. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin’s family, said the committee was formed in response to a growing number of states that have placed Stand Your Ground laws -- which they believe prevented their son’s killer, George Zimmerman, from being immediately arrested -- on ballots for the upcoming November election.“The family is saying straightforward that it is not just about Trayvon; all of our children have the possibility of being a Trayvon and having to face this battle against the Stand Your Ground law and the way it’s written,” Crump told The Huffington Post. “They’re saying its too late for them, we can’t do anything about Trayvon. But it’s not too late for others.”In the wake of Martin’s Feb. 26 killing by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch member in Sanford, Fla., who claims he shot the teen in self-defense, so-called Stand Your Ground laws were scrutinized not only by supporters of Martin’s family, but also by legal experts and advocacy groups who say the laws are written in a way that allows broad interpretation and application and give people wide discretion in the use of deadly force.Sanford police initially said that it would have been against the law and possibley a violation of Zimmerman’s rights to arrest him. But police arrested Zimmerman more than 40 days after the killing, not long after Florida Gov. Rick Scott assigned a special prosecutor to the case.Scott also formed the Task Force on Citizen Safety and Protection to hold town hall meetings, consult with legal experts, and make recommendations for possible changes to the law. The task force has itself been controversial, with critics assailing it and Gov. Scott for appointing supporters of the law to the board, including two of the law's authors.The family’s announcement today comes on the eve of a meeting of the 19-member task force on Tuesday in Jacksonville. “These laws allow people to shoot first and ask questions later,” Tracy Martin, Trayvon’s father, said in a video featured on the Change For Trayvon website.“Worse, under existing Stand Your Ground laws, decisions on shootings are made even before a judge or prosecutor can review the case,” added Sybina Fulton, Martin’s mother. “Stand Your Ground is a solution in search of a problem, and it’s a terrible solution with tragic result, like the death of our son.”The Change For Trayvon website also ups the ante in a media battle between the Martin and Zimmerman camps, as both sides work to drum up moral and financial support.Zimmerman has given exclusive interviews to sympathetic cable news pundits. And his parents, friends and brother have defended him on various television news programs. Meanwhile, Martin's family has made the rounds on the major morning shows and have done countless primetime interviews.The fight for support has also been waged on the Internet.Zimmerman, who remains free on bail pending trial, set up a website early on, which he used to thank supporters and raise funds. That site was later taken down, at which time his defense attorney, Mark O’Mara, launched a new website, gzlegalcase.com, which has been used to publish evidence, court filings and various statements.Zimmerman’s parents also launched a website in support of their son.According to the Change For Trayvon website, laws similar to Florida’s Stand Your Ground law exist in 32 states “and have allowed people to escape responsibility.”In Florida, the bill sailed through the state legislature in 2005 with bipartisan majorities. It was intended to strengthen existing self-defense laws after a series of major hurricanes raised fears of looting. But critics say the law is ambiguously written, which consequently has allowed some misapplication. Recent investigative reports suggest a troubling pattern in the application of the law, which seems to skew along racial lines.Among the more controversial aspects of the debate are the law's possibly biased application, its widespread support among gun rights advocates like the NRA and conservative groups like ALEC, and a number of recent high-profile shootings, including the Trayvon Martin case, in which people have attempted to invoke the law as a legal defense."

The advocacy group, the Newtown Action Alliance, posted a Facebook message Thursday about the calls, prompting responses from people who said they'd received communications from the NRA and were upset by them.""I received one of these,"" Newtown resident Christopher Wenis wrote on Facebook Thursday afternoon. ""I was insulted and offended."" Wenis told The Huffington Post in an interview Friday night that in the 36 hours since he first posted his response, he received two more robocalls from the NRA, one later on Thursday night and one on Friday evening. ""I've got a 5-year-old son who went to preschool on the Sandy Hook Elementary School campus,"" Wenis explained. ""And this was a really hard week for me on a lot of levels. These calls were the very last thing I needed."" Wenis said that he called the NRA twice to request that his name be placed on a ""Do Not Call List"" -- first on Tuesday and again Thursday. He said an NRA phone operator assured him he would be removed from NRA call lists. But the calls kept coming. By Friday night, Wenis said, he was desperate to be left in peace. Another woman, Lisa Abrams, wrote on Facebook that she had ""received a call and a postcard asking me to call my congressmen and tell them 'NO ASSUALT WEAPONS BAN' [sic] ... I was not happy and needless to say did just the opposite!""LISTEN: NRA robocall in Connecticut, sent by a HuffPost reader: Tom Maurath, a 40-year resident of Newtown, said he was having dinner with his family on Tuesday when the phone rang at 6:37 p.m. ""Our caller ID announces who is calling, and when I heard 'National Rifle Association,' I jumped to answer the phone so my 6-year-old son wouldn't get there first,"" he told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""Our son loves to answer the phone because it might be Grandma.""Maurath said he listened to a prerecorded message about Connecticut state gun legislation for about 30 seconds -- a call that he was stunned to realize took no account of who might pick up the phone.""The idea that this message could have been delivered to a sibling of one of the families who lost children at [Sandy Hook Elementary School] is just appalling,"" he said. In the months since the tragic school shooting in December, Newtown has become a focal point for the nation's renewed debate over gun control, as well as an international symbol of America's epidemic of gun violence. The Connecticut Legislature is considering a bevy of gun-control measures in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre. On Tuesday, a bill requiring universal background checks for gun purchases in Connecticut cleared a key committee.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) -- was seen as the key to passing the first legislation in decades to address the sorts of mass slaughters that so recently horrified the country in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children and six educators were gunned down at an elementary school, and in Aurora, Colo., where 12 people were killed in a theater.The amendment failed 54 to 46, falling short of the 60-vote threshold needed to break a filibuster. That failure upset anew victims of the Sandy Hook shootings and other slaughters who watched from the Senate gallery.""Shame on you!"" shouted two women in the gallery after the vote. One was Patricia Maisch, who grabbed the third clip from the gunman who opened fired at then-Rep. Gabby Giffords in the Tuscon., Ariz., shooting in 2011. The other was Lori Hass, whose daughter was injured in the Virginia Tech shootings six years and one day ago.""I think we're going to continue to work for the right thing to be done. I think the senators who voted against this will have to live with that vote, and I think they're going to have to account for themselves,"" said Peter Read, whose daughter, Mary, was among the 33 killed at Virginia Tech.An angry and disappointed-looking President Barack Obama also hammered the vote in a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday.""All in all, this is a pretty shameful day for Washington,"" Obama said.""The American people are trying to figure out -- how can something that has 90 percent support not happen?"" Obama said.He was echoed by other victims of mass shootings who watched the Senate vote.""I was extremely disappointed,"" said retired Col. Bill Badger, one of the people who tackled Jared Lee Loughner in Tucson. ""When 90 percent of the people want something, and the senator votes against them, the next election, we're going to take care of those senators, because they're not representing the people.""Passage of the background check amendment had been seen as key because it represented a bipartisan agreement in a highly polarized debate. It also would have preserved a major part of the overall bill that many advocates against gun violence saw as a minimum step toward stemming gun massacres.Stronger measures up for a vote also failed, including a ban of assault weapons sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that went down 40 to 60, in spite of an impassioned plea from the senator.""I know how this is going to end, and the despair and the dismay of the families standing out there whose safety we need to protect, and we don't do it. I am really chagrined,"" said Feinstein, who argued that lawmakers with six-year terms should have the fortitude to take tough votes.""Show some guts,"" Feinstein said.The only significant steps that all sides agreed on were stemming illegal trafficking of weapons and improving mental health efforts, but even an amendment written with NRA input to crack down on trafficking failed 58 to 42.A vote on improving mental health services was delayed until Thursday.The background check measure would have expanded the current check system to cover sales of weapons on the Internet and at gun shows.Democratic aides privately conceded that with the failure of background checks, the rest of the bill would likely go down. One described it as a ""pyrrhic victory,"" noting that a majority of the Senate backed the bill that is so popular outside the halls of Congress. ""It's the farthest we've come,"" said the aide, speaking on background to talk freely.The aides saw little hope of it being resurrected, although leaders kept that option open.Opponents, citing a National Institute of Justice study, argued that the expanded check system would have laid the groundwork for a national registry of gun owners, although the measure expressly forbid such a step, with a 15-year jail sentence for anyone who tried to do that.They also called it a useless step that would achieve little.""Expanded background checks would not have prevented Newtown,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who offered an alternative measure with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lacking new background checks. That measure also failed, 52 to 48.But Toomey said his amendment would have at least been a modest step in the right direction.""The goal was to see if we can find a way to make it a little bit more difficult for people who have no legal right to have a gun for them to obtain it,"" Toomey said. ""That was the goal.""The Senate failed to meet it.CORRECTION: This post originally incorrectly stated Chuck Grassley's state. He is a senator from Iowa. Patricia Maisch's first name was also misstated.Final Vote For Manchin-Toomey Background Check Deal:*Note: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) supported the legislation, but he voted against it for procedural reasons, in order to preserve the right to bring the measure back up."

The group also vowed to ""continue to focus on keeping our children safe and securing our schools, fixing our broken mental health system, and prosecuting violent criminals to the fullest extent of the law."" The NRA's response to the president's far-reaching proposals to address the nation's epidemic of gun violence, underscored by the tragic shooting of 26 children and teachers last month at Sandy Hook Elementary School, struck a much different tone than the group's incendiary attack ad, released just a day earlier.In it, a narrator argued that the Secret Service protection provided to Obama's two daughters, Sasha and Malia, is evidence that the president is an ""elitist hypocrite,"" who wants armed guards for his own daughters, but not for other people's children. The ad was widely panned as soon as it was released, and White House spokesman Jay Carney called it ""repugnant and cowardly."" The NRA's response to Obama's Wednesday press conference contained no direct mention of the president or the administration, nor did it address the 23 executive actions Obama signed immediately following his remarks at the White House. Instead, the NRA said it looks ""forward to working with Congress on a bi-partisan basis to find real solutions to protecting America’s most valuable asset –- our children."" In many ways, the NRA's tone was similar to Obama's, with its emphasis on protecting children, working with Congress and exploring multiple ways to address factors that may have contributed to the shooting massacres that occurred in now-infamous places -- Newtown, Conn.; Virginia Tech; Tucson, Ariz.; an Aurora, Colo., movie theater; a Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisc., and elsewhere.But behind the scenes, the NRA is gearing up for a vicious fight against Obama's proposals. An urgent fundraising email sent to NRA members from NRA chief executive Wayne La Pierre Tuesday night accused the administration of telling ""a dirty lie"" when it invited NRA representatives to be part of White House talks last month. ""Barack Obama, Joe Biden and their gun ban allies in Congress only want to BLAME you, VILIFY you, BULLY you, and STRIP you of your Second Amendment freedoms,"" LaPierre wrote. ""This is the fight of the century and I need you on board with NRA now more than ever,"" LaPierre said in the email.In the coming weeks the NRA plans to apply its legendary lobbying pressure to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, in the hopes that any gun regulations in Congress will fail to garner enough votes to pass.

They're hard to aim, they're difficult to use. But shotguns, well, that's a different story.During a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Parents magazine, Biden took a handful of questions from readers about gun violence. One questioner named Kate asked how gun owners would be able to sufficiently protect themselves if Congress passed a bill banning certain weapons and high-capacity gun magazines. ""Kate, if you want to protect yourself, get a double barreled shotgun,"" Biden responded. ""I promise you, as I told my wife, we live in an area that's wooded and somewhat secluded. I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here, walk out, put [up] that double barreled shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.""The vice president said that by firing two shotgun blasts, anyone who might be trying to break in would be scared off. ""You don't need an AR-15,"" he said. ""Buy a shotgun! Buy a shotgun!"" Biden fielded a handful of other questions about gun reform proposals. He said he doesn't support making changes to the Second Amendment and described America's ""really healthy gun culture,"" which was a ""part of my father's ethic.""

The message, sent to the young woman's sorority sisters, forcefully instructed them to represent the sorority better at events with their ""matchup"" frat.While perhaps misguided, her language and, dare we say, her passion, was so effective, we couldn't help but imagine her talents being directed at other subjects -- such as, say, senators who blocked gun control legislation in yesterday's vote. President Obama's speech chastising the lawmakers who voted against extending background checks certainly was Obama at his most visibly angry, but if he took this writer's cue, he could have gone a lot further than ""shameful.""So, we took the liberty of aggregating her anger and recontextualizing its meaning, applying it instead to what Obama could have said on Wednesday. Obviously, some VERY NSFW language is used below, so if obscenity offends you, stop reading (and keep in mind, the writer's anger is so universal, we had to change very little).If you tuned into this like I told you to, tie yourself down to whatever chair you're sitting in, because this speech is going to be a rough fucking ride.For those of you that have your heads stuck under rocks, which apparently is the majority of this Senate, you have been FUCKING UP in terms of reasonable gun control legislation. I've been getting texts on texts about Senators LITERALLY being so fucking INHUMANE and so fucking CALLOUS. If you're reading this right now and saying to yourself ""But oh em gee Barry, I've been having so much fun with my NRA pals this week!"", then punch yourself in the face right now so that I don't have to fucking find you on the Hill to do it myself.I do not give a flying fuck, and Gabby Giffords does not give a flying fuck, about how much you fucking love to talk to your NRA pals. You have 364 days out of the fucking year to talk to the NRA, and today is NOT, I fucking repeat NOT ONE OF THEM. Today is about repairing something broken in our communities, and that's not fucking possible if you're going to stand around and talk to the NRA and not to families of victims. Newsflash you stupid cocks: AMERICANS DON'T LIKE COWARDS. Oh wait, DOUBLE FUCKING NEWSFLASH: AMERICANS DO NOT WANT TO VOTE FOR YOU IF YOU FUCKING SUCK, which by the way in case you're an idiot and need it spelled out for you, YOU FUCKING SUCK SO FAR. This also applies to you little shits that have talked openly about how background checks won’t change anything IN FRONT OF NEWTOWN FAMILIES. Are you people fucking retarded? That's not a rhetorical question, I LITERALLY want you to email me back telling me if you're mentally slow so I can make sure you don't go to anymore votes. If your constituents openly said ""Yeah we're gonna screw you the next chance we get"", would you be happy? WOULD YOU? No you wouldn't, so WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU DO IT TO THEM?? IN FRONT OF THEM?!! First of all, you SHOULDN'T be voting against 90% of Americans interests, I don't give a FUCK if Wayne LaPierre wants you to, if Ted Nugent wants you to, or if the entire NRA wants you to. YOU DON'T. YOU. DON'T. And you ESPECIALLY do fucking NOT convince other Senators to vote with you.""But Barry!"", you say in a whiny little bitch voice to your TV screen as you listen to this speech, ""I've been saying I’m appalled by the tragedies, doesn't that count for something?"" NO YOU STUPID FUCKING ASS HATS, IT FUCKING DOESN'T. DO YOU WANNA KNOW FUCKING WHY?!! IT DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN FUCKING UP ON INTERNATIONAL FUCKING VOTES TOO. I've not only gotten texts about Senators being fucking WEIRD on the UN Arms Trade Treaty (for example, being stupid shits and adding amendments to budget bills saying ""durr we don’t approve treaty…"" is not fucking funny), but I've gotten texts about Senate Democrats voting with the opposing team. The opposing. Fucking. Team. ARE YOU FUCKING STUPID?!! I don't give a SHIT about bipartisanship, YOU VOTE FOR OUR GODDAMN TEAM AND NOT THE OTHER ONE, HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN IN AN ELECTION? ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND? Or are you just so fucking obsessed with making the NRA like you that you think being a good little supporter of the gun community is going to make your voters happy? Well it's time someone told you, NO ONE FUCKING LIKES THAT, ESPECIALLY YOUR FUCKING VOTERS. I will fucking cunt punt the next person I hear about doing something like that, and I don't give a fuck if you IMPEACH me, I WILL FUCKING ASSAULT YOU.""Ohhh Barry, I'm now crying because your speech has made me oh so so sad"". Well good. If this speech applies to you in any way, meaning if you are a little asswipe that votes against dead children or if you're a weird shit that thinks a gentle breeze can infringe on the second amendment, this following message is for you:DO NOT RUN FOR REELECTION.I'm not fucking kidding. Don't run. Seriously, if you have done ANYTHING I've mentioned in this speech and have some rare disease where you're unable to NOT do these things, then you are HORRIBLE, I repeat, HORRIBLE PR FOR THIS COUNTRY. I would rather have 40 Senators that are reasonable, talk to the families of victims, and not fucking cowardly than 80 that are fucking bitches. If you are one of the people that have told me ""Oh nooo boo hoo I can't talk to victims families I have an A rating from the NRA"", then I pity you because I don't know how you got this far in life, and with that in mind don't fucking run for reelection unless you're going to stop being a goddamn cock block for legislation that can save fucking lives. Seriously. I swear to fucking God if I see anyone being a goddamn boner at the next vote, I will tell you to resign even if you're a Democrat. I'm not even kidding. Try me.And for those of you who are offended at this speech, I would apologize but I really don't give a fuck. Go fuck yourself."

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) -- was seen as the key to passing the first legislation in decades to address the sorts of mass slaughters that so recently horrified the country in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children and six educators were gunned down at an elementary school, and in Aurora, Colo., where 12 people were killed in a theater.The amendment failed 54 to 46, falling short of the 60-vote threshold needed to break a filibuster. That failure upset anew victims of the Sandy Hook shootings and other slaughters who watched from the Senate gallery.""Shame on you!"" shouted two women in the gallery after the vote. One was Patricia Maisch, who grabbed the third clip from the gunman who opened fired at then-Rep. Gabby Giffords in the Tuscon., Ariz., shooting in 2011. The other was Lori Hass, whose daughter was injured in the Virginia Tech shootings six years and one day ago.""I think we're going to continue to work for the right thing to be done. I think the senators who voted against this will have to live with that vote, and I think they're going to have to account for themselves,"" said Peter Read, whose daughter, Mary, was among the 33 killed at Virginia Tech.An angry and disappointed-looking President Barack Obama also hammered the vote in a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday.""All in all, this is a pretty shameful day for Washington,"" Obama said.""The American people are trying to figure out -- how can something that has 90 percent support not happen?"" Obama said.He was echoed by other victims of mass shootings who watched the Senate vote.""I was extremely disappointed,"" said retired Col. Bill Badger, one of the people who tackled Jared Lee Loughner in Tucson. ""When 90 percent of the people want something, and the senator votes against them, the next election, we're going to take care of those senators, because they're not representing the people.""Passage of the background check amendment had been seen as key because it represented a bipartisan agreement in a highly polarized debate. It also would have preserved a major part of the overall bill that many advocates against gun violence saw as a minimum step toward stemming gun massacres.Stronger measures up for a vote also failed, including a ban of assault weapons sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that went down 40 to 60, in spite of an impassioned plea from the senator.""I know how this is going to end, and the despair and the dismay of the families standing out there whose safety we need to protect, and we don't do it. I am really chagrined,"" said Feinstein, who argued that lawmakers with six-year terms should have the fortitude to take tough votes.""Show some guts,"" Feinstein said.The only significant steps that all sides agreed on were stemming illegal trafficking of weapons and improving mental health efforts, but even an amendment written with NRA input to crack down on trafficking failed 58 to 42.A vote on improving mental health services was delayed until Thursday.The background check measure would have expanded the current check system to cover sales of weapons on the Internet and at gun shows.Democratic aides privately conceded that with the failure of background checks, the rest of the bill would likely go down. One described it as a ""pyrrhic victory,"" noting that a majority of the Senate backed the bill that is so popular outside the halls of Congress. ""It's the farthest we've come,"" said the aide, speaking on background to talk freely.The aides saw little hope of it being resurrected, although leaders kept that option open.Opponents, citing a National Institute of Justice study, argued that the expanded check system would have laid the groundwork for a national registry of gun owners, although the measure expressly forbid such a step, with a 15-year jail sentence for anyone who tried to do that.They also called it a useless step that would achieve little.""Expanded background checks would not have prevented Newtown,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who offered an alternative measure with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lacking new background checks. That measure also failed, 52 to 48.But Toomey said his amendment would have at least been a modest step in the right direction.""The goal was to see if we can find a way to make it a little bit more difficult for people who have no legal right to have a gun for them to obtain it,"" Toomey said. ""That was the goal.""The Senate failed to meet it.CORRECTION: This post originally incorrectly stated Chuck Grassley's state. He is a senator from Iowa. Patricia Maisch's first name was also misstated.Final Vote For Manchin-Toomey Background Check Deal:*Note: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) supported the legislation, but he voted against it for procedural reasons, in order to preserve the right to bring the measure back up."

""I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if it -- if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than defuse potential altercations,"" Obama told reporters in a surprise press conference at the White House on Friday. Florida was the first state in the nation to pass a law that allows an individual who feels threatened to ""stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force."" There are now about 30 states with such statutes. George Zimmerman was recently found not guilty of second-degree murder in the killing of Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager. Police originally did not arrest Zimmerman for six weeks because of Stand Your Ground. Although Zimmerman's defense team did not invoke a Stand Your Ground defense, it was still central to the trial and read to the jury as part of its instructions. ""If we're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms, even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see?"" asked Obama on Friday.""And for those who resist that idea, that we should think about something like these 'Stand Your Ground' laws, I just ask people to consider if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened? And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws,"" he added.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also announced on Friday that his Senate judiciary subcommittee will hold a hearing on such laws in September. It will delve into how these laws and racial profiling mix and the role of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council in pushing these statutes nationwide. In May, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission voted to launch an investigation into whether Stand Your Ground laws have a racial bias.A June 2012 study by the Tampa Bay Times found that in Florida, defendants who cited the Stand Your Ground law were more likely to prevail when the victim was black. Seventy-three percent of those who killed a black person walked away with no penalty, compared to 59 percent of those who killed a white victim."

Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy."" The group also vowed to ""continue to focus on keeping our children safe and securing our schools, fixing our broken mental health system, and prosecuting violent criminals to the fullest extent of the law."" The NRA's response to the president's far-reaching proposals to address the nation's epidemic of gun violence, underscored by the tragic shooting of 26 children and teachers last month at Sandy Hook Elementary School, struck a much different tone than the group's incendiary attack ad, released just a day earlier.In it, a narrator argued that the Secret Service protection provided to Obama's two daughters, Sasha and Malia, is evidence that the president is an ""elitist hypocrite,"" who wants armed guards for his own daughters, but not for other people's children. The ad was widely panned as soon as it was released, and White House spokesman Jay Carney called it ""repugnant and cowardly."" The NRA's response to Obama's Wednesday press conference contained no direct mention of the president or the administration, nor did it address the 23 executive actions Obama signed immediately following his remarks at the White House. Instead, the NRA said it looks ""forward to working with Congress on a bi-partisan basis to find real solutions to protecting America’s most valuable asset –- our children."" In many ways, the NRA's tone was similar to Obama's, with its emphasis on protecting children, working with Congress and exploring multiple ways to address factors that may have contributed to the shooting massacres that occurred in now-infamous places -- Newtown, Conn.; Virginia Tech; Tucson, Ariz.; an Aurora, Colo., movie theater; a Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisc., and elsewhere.But behind the scenes, the NRA is gearing up for a vicious fight against Obama's proposals. An urgent fundraising email sent to NRA members from NRA chief executive Wayne La Pierre Tuesday night accused the administration of telling ""a dirty lie"" when it invited NRA representatives to be part of White House talks last month. ""Barack Obama, Joe Biden and their gun ban allies in Congress only want to BLAME you, VILIFY you, BULLY you, and STRIP you of your Second Amendment freedoms,"" LaPierre wrote. ""This is the fight of the century and I need you on board with NRA now more than ever,"" LaPierre said in the email.In the coming weeks the NRA plans to apply its legendary lobbying pressure to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, in the hopes that any gun regulations in Congress will fail to garner enough votes to pass. Read the NRA's complete statement below.Fairfax, Va. –- Throughout its history, the National Rifle Association has led efforts to promote safety and responsible gun ownership.

John Hickenlooper (D) signed three major gun control measures into law on Wednesday morning, just hours after the state's Department of Corrections chief, Tom Clements, was shot and killed at home. The new legislation represents the culmination of a battle between Hickenlooper and national gun rights advocacy groups that began on a cordial note, but ended acrimoniously on both sides.The three laws will ban gun magazines with a capacity of more than 15 rounds, require background checks for all firearms sales (with exceptions made for antique guns and ""bona fide"" gifts between immediate family members), and impose a fee on background checks that covers the cost to the state of performing them. The laws are scheduled to go into effect July 1. Hickenlooper signed the bills in a solemn ceremony at the state Capitol in Denver a few hours after he held a news conference on the death of Clements, who had been appointed executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections in 2011. ""Corrections is a very different job. You make difficult decisions every time that affect different people,"" Hickenlooper said at the news conference. ""Tom Clements dedicated his life to being a public servant, to making our state a better place, and he is going to be deeply, deeply missed.""Authorities have not apprehended a suspect in Clements' murder, which occurred Tuesday around 8:30 p.m. The killer allegedly knocked on Clements' front door and then shot him at close range when he opened it. Hickenlooper said he would be visiting with Clements' family Wednesday after he signed the gun control bills. In recent years, gun violence has become an increasingly divisive political issue in Colorado, in no small part because the state has been the scene of two mass shootings. The first was at Columbine High School in 1999, when two students murdered 12 people and injured 21 others before committing suicide. Then, in August 2012, a lone gunman opened fire in a movie theater in nearby Aurora, killing 12 and injuring 58 people. ""Colorado is in a unique position in that we have suffered these tragedies firsthand, so there is a drumbeat [for greater gun control] in Colorado,” said state Senate President John Morse (D) this month in an interview with NBC News.But Colorado is also a state with a strong tradition of firearms ownership and a pioneer heritage that remains a source of pride for residents. As the state House of Representatives prepared to introduce the gun control legislation this winter in the wake of the tragic shooting in Newtown, Conn., gun rights advocates initially sought to capitalize on that goodwill by announcing that their goal was to find a reasonable compromise. In February, the National Rifle Association's president, David Keene, traveled to Colorado to meet with Hickenlooper in person and said afterward that the NRA had always considered the governor ""a pretty reasonable and thoughtful guy."" In turn, Hickenlooper said that ""while [the NRA and I] might not agree on a number of things, there will certainly be places we can find common ground."" As the sweeping gun control bills advanced through the Colorado House and Senate in late February and March largely unamended, however, the NRA and similar groups dropped the ""nice guy"" veneer. The NRA established a dedicated website, Defend Colorado, aimed at mobilizing opposition to the bills and took out print advertisements in Colorado newspapers attacking Hickenlooper. The attacks continued right up to Tuesday afternoon, when the NRA put out a release warning Colorado residents that ""Governor Hickenlooper is likely to sign a series of draconian bills that attack on [sic] your Second Amendment rights."" On Wednesday, after the news of Clements' death broke, the NRA was silent on both social media and its website. A spokesman for the group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "

However, both surveys found that support for stricter laws remains higher than it was before the Newtown shooting.In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 48 percent of Americans said they think gun laws should be made more strict, while 16 percent said they should be made less strict and 29 percent said they preferred no change. Support for stricter gun laws in the poll is down from a high of 60 percent in a YouGov/Economist poll conducted in January, weeks after the Newtown shooting. Likewise, a Gallup poll released Friday found that support for stricter gun laws has fallen from a high of 58 percent after the Newtown shooting to 49 percent now. Both the Gallup poll and the HuffPost/YouGov poll were conducted Sept. 17 and 18, after the Monday deaths of 13 people in the shooting at Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.Although support for stricter gun laws was down in both surveys from the rates seen just after the Newtown shooting, it has not fallen to levels seen before that shooting. The most recent Gallup and YouGov polls conducted before the Newtown shooting both found support for stricter gun laws below 45 percent.Some policies supported by advocates of stricter gun laws still receive broad support -- most notably universal background checks. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in August found that 79 percent of Americans support universal background checks, including for gun shows and private sales. However, overall support for stricter laws has shown a marked decline over the past 25 years. Two major school shootings -- Columbine and Newtown -- have reversed that trend, but only temporarily.In accordance with the longer-term trend against support for tightening gun laws, the post-Newtown bump in support never reached the same level that it did after Columbine.Following other mass shootings, including the recent shooting in Washington, polls have found little evidence of anything more than fleeting changes in opinion on gun laws. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted a month ago, before the Navy Yard shooting, found that 49 percent of Americans said they support stricter gun laws -- almost identical to the 48 percent who said so in the most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll. Both the latest HuffPost/YouGov poll and the Gallup poll were conducted before the shooting Thursday in Chicago in which 13 people were injured, including a 3-year-old boy who was shot in the head.Fifty-nine percent of respondents to the HuffPost/YouGov poll said they had ""heard a lot"" about the Navy Yard shooting. In contrast,  a HuffPost/YouGov poll  conducted in the days after the Newtown school shooting found that 70 percent said they had heard a lot about that shooting.The HuffPost/YouGov poll also found that many Americans don't think stricter gun laws will prevent future mass shootings. Forty percent said stricter laws would help, but 52 percent said changing things won't make a difference.And when it comes to ways to reduce the likelihood of future violence, many people didn't look to gun laws. By a 57 percent to 29 percent margin, the HuffPost/YouGov poll found that most people think better mental health care is more likely to prevent future mass shootings than stricter gun laws. Similarly, the Gallup poll found that 48 percent of Americans place a ""great deal"" of blame for mass shootings on the ""failure of the mental health system to identify individuals who are a danger to others,"" compared to 40 percent who said the same of ""easy access to guns.""On the other hand, the HuffPost/YouGov survey showed little sympathy for the argument frequently made by gun-rights advocates that people carrying guns would lead to lower gun violence. A plurality of respondents to the poll rejected that argument, saying by a 44 percent to 38 percent margin that stricter gun laws were more likely to prevent mass shootings than allowing more people to carry guns for protection. Just after the Newtown shooting, respondents said the same by a 46 percent to 34 percent margin. Mark Blumenthal and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reportingThe HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Sept. 17-18 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

""The illegals are trying to hijack the cockpit of America's government!"" the email continues. ""Let's roll!""Immigration reform opponents often invoke the 9/11 attacks to help make their arguments, pointing to the undocumented status of some of the hijackers who overstayed their visas.ALIPAC was founded on 9/11 nine years ago, according to its email, ""in honor of the victims of the terror attacks that occurred because our government failed at its most basic responsibility to protect our citizens from those who would enter our nation to do us harm."" The email seems to imply that other undocumented immigrants are, at least metaphorically, in a similar position of trying to harm the United States. It called on recipients to contact members of the House of Representatives who might support reform and urge them to vote against it.Members of the ""gang of eight,"" a bipartisan group that drafted a reform bill passed by the Senate in June, argued that their legislation would aid the government's efforts to detect people who overstayed their visas by requiring airports to track both entries and exits to the United States.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the gang of eight, said after the bombings in Boston earlier this year that such attacks only showed the importance of immigration reform.

J.R. Hoell (R-Dunbarton) suggested that it may some day be necessary to use ""firearms and ammo"" against the government if its policies continue to be shaped by elected officials like former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.).Hoell was discussing plans to protest outside a state GOP fundraiser that is scheduled to feature Brown, who is rumored to be considering a run for one of New Hampshire's U.S. Senate seats. Hoell has characterized Brown as too liberal for the state, and accused him of supporting laws that encroach on the Second Amendment. Hoell then invoked the armed uprisings of the Revolutionary War.When asked whether protesters should bring weapons to the rally, Hoell responds:I'm never going to tell a person not to carry a firearm ... I will recommend people carry firearms concealed. Tactically it's a better solution; it doesn't make you out to be a target. In terms of messaging to the media, if you're carrying concealed, versus carrying an AR-15 or AR-10 slung over your back, it's a lot easier to make the statement, ""We're not here to threaten anybody. We're here standing on our soapbox, as opposed to standing with our ammo box in hand, to make a point politically.""The message needs to get out that Scott Brown does not represent New Hampshire. If things continue the way they are, there may be a day or a time where firearms and ammo are necessary. It happened in the Revolutionary War. I'd like to think we're not there yet, but as things continue to unravel, that may be the next step. Let's stand on our soapbox this time.Earlier this month, a source close to Brown told The Huffington Post that Brown is ""warming to the idea"" of another run for a U.S. Senate seat. Brown may not make his decision until January, said the source, who estimated the chances that Brown would enter the race against first-term Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) at 50 percent.(h/t ThinkProgress)CORRECTION: Rep. J.R. Hoell was incorrectly referred to as a representative of Merrimack. He represents Dunbarton. "

It was also the first publicly recognized by Obama since the elementary school massacre, which claimed the lives of 27, including 20 children.There have been six mass shootings over the past nine months -- and at least 20 during Obama's presidency. That may be disturbing. But some would argue even that startling figure grossly underreports the number of shooting sprees.The growing number of mass killings over the past five years left the country in search of a term that would distinguish mass murder by gun from those using other weapons. Mass shooting has gained favor as the obvious choice. Though the FBI doesn't specifically define mass shooting, it does define mass murder, calling it a single incident in which a perpetrator kills four or more people, not including himself or herself.The FBI defined mass murder to distinguish it from serial murder. That definition provides the basis for the unofficial definition of mass shooting that has gained use in recent years. Mother Jones explained the definition  in an extensive ""Guide to Mass Shootings in America,"" writing that mass shootings typically involve a single episode in a single location, usually a public place. The Mother Jones definition of mass shooting matches the FBI definition of mass murder in that it includes single incidents that kill at least four victims.Over on Reddit, the Guns Are Cool community has compiled a list of every mass shooting in the United States this year. The moderators of the subreddit, which doesn't actually appear to be of the belief that guns are cool, use an expanded definition of mass shooting, listing every event in which ""four or more people [including the shooter] are shot in a spree."" Under the Reddit definition, a shooting spree that wounds at least four people, but doesn't kill them, is still a mass shooting.Including Monday's mass shooting, the Reddit list for 2013 is nearing 250 incidents. That's an average of one mass shooting almost every day.With so many mass shootings, even those that fit the frequently used definition rarely prompt a presidential response.

""I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if it -- if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than defuse potential altercations,"" Obama told reporters in a surprise press conference at the White House on Friday. Florida was the first state in the nation to pass a law that allows an individual who feels threatened to ""stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force."" There are now about 30 states with such statutes. George Zimmerman was recently found not guilty of second-degree murder in the killing of Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager. Police originally did not arrest Zimmerman for six weeks because of Stand Your Ground. Although Zimmerman's defense team did not invoke a Stand Your Ground defense, it was still central to the trial and read to the jury as part of its instructions. ""If we're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms, even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see?"" asked Obama on Friday.""And for those who resist that idea, that we should think about something like these 'Stand Your Ground' laws, I just ask people to consider if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened? And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws,"" he added.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also announced on Friday that his Senate judiciary subcommittee will hold a hearing on such laws in September. It will delve into how these laws and racial profiling mix and the role of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council in pushing these statutes nationwide. In May, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission voted to launch an investigation into whether Stand Your Ground laws have a racial bias.A June 2012 study by the Tampa Bay Times found that in Florida, defendants who cited the Stand Your Ground law were more likely to prevail when the victim was black. Seventy-three percent of those who killed a black person walked away with no penalty, compared to 59 percent of those who killed a white victim."

Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" Obama said.Obama said he understands why people are so upset that George Zimmerman was found not guilty for shooting and killing Martin, an unarmed teen who was walking down the street in Sanford, Fla., in February 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman, pursued Martin for no clear reason and ultimately shot him in what he said was self-defense.The president urged the nation to accept the court's verdict, saying the judge conducted the trial ""in a professional manner"" and that the jury had made its decision. But in an unusually personal moment, he began talking about the broader context of the case and the need to better understand the experiences of black men in this country.""I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,"" Obama said. ""There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.""He went on to recount instances when he had heard ""the locks click on the doors of cars"" as he walked down the street. African-American men are used to getting into an elevator and seeing a fellow passenger ""clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off,"" he said.""I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,"" Obama said. ""And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.""Obama also pointed to the fact that young African-American men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, both as perpetrators of violence and as its victims. And that violence, he noted, often takes place in poor black neighborhoods that are ""born out of a very violent past in this country."" The poverty and dysfunction in those communities ""can be traced to a very difficult history,"" he said.Obama said he's going to be thinking about what steps he can take as president in the wake of the ruling. He put forward the idea of meeting with local and state officials to come up with ways to provide more training to law enforcement on racial bias, and he also suggested that he plans to examine certain states' Stand Your Ground laws.More generally, Obama lent support to the idea of creating a coalition -- of business leaders, elected officials, celebrities, athletes -- to address the need for African-American men to feel that they are ""a full part of this society.""Obama's decision to speak on the verdict was a bit of a surprise. Several days had passed since it was issued on Saturday, and he had already put out an official statement. The conventional wisdom was that the president was wary of bringing more politics to an already sensitive issue. But both he and his advisers wanted to offer a bit more.Speaking after the president finished his remarks, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that the process behind putting the impromptu speech together wasn't all that complicated. The president had been prepared to address the jury verdict in Zimmerman's trial had he been asked about it in one of the interviews he did this week, but he wasn't asked. Eventually, Obama met with the press office and decided to just address the issue. A Friday statement before the press corps was as good a time as any other.""This is not hard at all,"" said Carney. ""The president wanted to say something, and he opened the briefing today so he could say something."""

Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who resigned her congressional seat in 2011 to focus on her recovery after being shot in the head, gave a moving opening testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence.""Speaking is difficult but I need to say something important: violence is a problem. Too many children are dying,"" Giffords said.Wednesday's hearing is a direct response to the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 first-graders and six adults were killed at an elementary school. ""Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you,"" Giffords urged the committee.Watch video of Giffords' comments above.Giffords' husband Mark Kelly, a NASA astronaut, also spoke at the hearing. Yahoo! News reports:Giffords' husband, NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, testified at the hearing and called for action to increase background checks on gun purchasers and to remove limitations on public health organizations that collect gun violence data. He also urged the enactment of a federal gun trafficking statute that increases penalties on illegal guns purchases.""Our rights are paramount. But our responsibilities are serious,"" Kelly said. ""And as a nation we are not taking responsibility for the gun rights our Founding Fathers conferred upon us. Gabby and I are pro-gun ownership. We are anti-gun violence.""The AP reports:WASHINGTON — She uttered just 80 halting words. But her presence was powerful.Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, shot in the head by a Tucson gunman in 2011, opened the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on gun violence in dramatic fashion Wednesday.""OK,"" she began, steeling herself before a packed yet hushed committee room.""Speaking is difficult,"" she continued, pronouncing each syllable with deliberation.This former congresswoman, once blessed with a politician's easy gift of gab, spoke in a high pitch, her voice almost childlike.""I need to say something important. Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something.""It will be hard, but the time is now. You must act. Be bold, be courageous, Americans are counting on you.""Giffords, her every movement labored, punctuated her conclusion by raising a clenched fist to her chest.And that was it.Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, gently guided her from the table, then returned to fill out the picture.""Gabby's gift for speech is a distant memory,"" Kelly said. ""She struggles to walk and she is partially blind. And a year ago, she left a job she loves, serving the people of Arizona.""Giffords' appearance at the witness table offered rare insight into her condition. Her family has closely guarded her privacy and the details of her impairment.Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida told CNN it takes her good friend ""a tremendous amount of rehearsal and practice"" to utter even a few sentences.""What she did today was remarkable,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""You could hear the emotion and the power behind the statement she was making because she feels so strongly about this.""White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama was looking forward to seeing Giffords and Kelly later Wednesday, and that everyone at the White House was heartened by her appearance on Capitol Hill.Giffords has made only a few public appearances and interviews since the January 2011 shooting, including reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democratic National Convention and casting a single vote in August 2011 on legislation to raise the federal debt limit.She resigned her seat in Congress a year ago to focus on her recovery. Giffords and Kelly, both gun owners, have formed a political action group called Americans for Responsible Solutions, aimed at promoting gun restrictions.Gun control is an issue that really hasn't been debated in Congress for more than 10 years. It rarely gets an airing and engenders strong emotions.And so it was that both sides did their all to ensure maximum impact from Wednesday's hearing.Giffords was clearly happy to do her part.This post has been updated to include Kelly's remarks.

It does, however, highlight Lanza's ""preoccupation with mass shootings, in particular the Columbine shootings, and a strong interest in firearms.""Items found within digital evidence seized from Lanza's possessions include:Bookmarks pertaining to firearms, military, politics, mass murder, video games, music, books, Army Ranger, computers and programs, ammunition, candy, economic books  Two videos showing suicide by gunshot  Commercial movies depicting mass shootings  The computer game titled “School Shooting” where the player controls a character who enters a school and shoots at students  Images of the shooter holding a handgun to his head  Images of the shooter holding a rifle to his head  Five-second video (dramatization) depicting children being shot A spreadsheet listing mass murders by name and information about the incident  Materials regarding the topic of pedophilia and advocating for rights for pedophiles (not child pornography) Large amount of materials relating to Columbine shootings and documents on mass murders The report also states that authorities recovered a New York Times article from February 18, 2008, regarding the school shooting at Northern Illinois University and photocopied newspaper articles from 1891 pertaining to the shooting of school children.Authorities found Lanza ""dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,"" according to the report. He was wearing nearly all black and had a yellow earplug in each ear.Monday's release is only a partial collection of evidence contained in a several thousand-page file belonging to the Connecticut State Police, according to the Associated Press. Sendensky wouldn't say why the full evidence file is being withheld from the public. Previously, police have cited consideration for victims' families and the sheer size of the investigation as reasons for keeping the file private.Critics say that withholding information demonstrates the secrecy of the state's investigation.""What I found troubling about the approach of the state's attorney is that from my perspective, [Sedensky] seems to have forgotten his job is to represent the state of Connecticut,"" Dan Klau, a Hartford attroney, told the AP. ""His conduct in many instances has seemed more akin to an attorney in private practice representing Sandy Hook families.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated the date of the Sandy Hook shooting as December 12. This has been corrected to reflect that the shooting was in fact on December 14, 2012."

"" (It) is clearly an invalid and unconstitutional law based on the United States Supreme Court precedent in Roe v. Wade from 1973 ... and the progeny of cases that have followed.""""We have our job to do,"" Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem told The Associated Press. ""We need to convince (Hovland) why the Legislature wanted to enact the law.""Stenehjem said the state will ask the court for a trial and already has hired an attorney to help argue the case.New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the state's lone abortion clinic, Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo, filed the lawsuit in June after the law was passed this year by the North Dakota Legislature. It would outlaw the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before some women even know they are pregnant.Abortion-rights advocates say the measures are an attempt to close North Dakota's lone abortion clinic. Supporters of the so-called fetal heartbeat measure, including Gov. Jack Dalrymple, have said it's a challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion up until a fetus is considered viable, usually at 22 to 24 weeks.Janet Crepps, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the law banning abortions at six weeks ""poses a very immediate threat to virtually all women seeking an abortion in North Dakota.""Red River director Tammi Kromenaker and Crepps said the six-week abortion ban would stop about 90 percent of abortions at the clinic.""This ruling means that women won't have to rush in and make a decision,"" Kromenaker said of the injunction. ""Now they have more time to talk to their loved one, their pastor – whoever they need to talk to – while weighing their decision to have an abortion.""Jeff Zent, a spokesman for Dalrymple, said the governor would not comment on the federal judge's ruling.""It's our standing policy not to comment on litigation,"" he said.The clinic's lawsuit also is challenging another new measure that would make North Dakota the only state to prohibit women from having an abortion because a fetus has a genetic defect, such as Down syndrome.Kromenaker said the clinic wants that law overturned but didn't seek an immediate injunction to block it because abortions are not performed there for that reason.The clinic is not challenging another new North Dakota law that would outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain by then. Texas Gov. Rick Perry last week signed into law a 20-week ban and other abortion restrictions for that state.Kromenaker said the 20-week ban, which she believes is unconstitutional, does not apply to North Dakota because no abortions are performed at the clinic after 16 weeks.Another measure would require a doctor who performs abortions to be a physician with hospital admitting privileges. A lawsuit challenging that law has been combined with another one challenging a 2011 North Dakota law that outlaws one of two drugs used in nonsurgical abortions. A state judge ruled last week that the 2011 law violates the state and U.S. constitutions. A judge hasn't yet issued a ruling on the new law requiring abortion doctors to have hospital admitting privileges.___Follow James MacPherson on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/macphersonja"

Thomas A. Garrett (R-Lynchburg) has introduced a bill that would prevent Medicaid from subsidizing abortion services for low-income women in cases ""in which a physician certifies ... that the fetus would be born with a gross and totally incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency."" Women who currently receive Medicaid in Virginia have abortion coverage in cases of rape, incest, severe fetal abnormalities, or when the life of the mother is in danger.Four other abortion- and contraception-related bills have been introduced by Del. Bob Marshall (R-Prince William), the author of the fetal personhood bill that state GOP leadership rejected in November. Three of Marshall's bills would allow insurance providers the option to deny women contraception coverage, and a fourth would impose a criminal ban on doctors who knowingly perform sex-selective abortions.Marshall's abortion ban, reproductive rights advocates argue, will intimidate doctors and violate doctor-patient confidentiality without solving the problem of gender-related abortions. It could also encourage physicians to racially profile women who are seeking abortions, since the practice of sex-selective abortions is most common in South Asian countries that have a cultural preference for boys.""This is a sexist and racist bill,"" said Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, in a conference call with reporters. ""The true purpose under the guise of the concern for gender discrimination is to continue to strip away access to safe legal abortion services.""It will already likely be harder for Virginia women to access abortions in 2013 than in previous years. Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) quietly approved a controversial set of abortion clinic regulations last week that could shut down many of the clinics in the state. The regulations impose strict building standards that were intended for new hospitals, such as specific hallway widths and hands-free sinks, on first-trimester abortion clinics.Republican leaders in Virginia have indicated that they will take a softer stance on abortion in 2013, and Marshall told The Huffington Post in November that his GOP colleagues pressure him ""seven days a week, 52 weeks a year"" to drop his anti-abortion legislative efforts. But those efforts are lost on a principled social conservative, he said.""You're talking about human beings being killed,"" he said. ""What higher considerations do I put out there?"""

Mark Obenshain (R) won the Republican nomination for attorney general this weekend, Think Progress dug up a bill he introduced in 2009 that would have required a woman to report her miscarriage to the police within 24 hours of it happening or risk jail time. A spokesperson for Obenshain told HuffPost on Monday that the senator introduced the bill in response to a news story about a 20-year-old college student who allegedly disposed of her dead newborn in the trash in Rockingham County, Virginia. Jared Walczak, Obenshain's deputy campaign manager for policy, said Obenshain was trying to pass a law to enable law enforcement to prosecute a woman in that circumstance, but he ended up with a bill that threatened all pregnant women with prosecution in the event that they miscarry. ""As sometimes happens, the legislation that emerged was far too broad, and would have had ramifications that neither he nor the Commonwealth's attorney's office ever intended,"" Walczak said. ""Sen. Obenshain is strongly against imposing any added burden for women who suffer a miscarriage, and that was never the intent of the legislation.""Walczak said Obenshain met with representatives of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia in an attempt to resolve the problem, but he was unable to come up with a solution, so he withdrew the bill. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia confirmed that Obenshain reached out to them about the bill in 2009, and they told him they did not support it. Tarina Keene, the group's executive director, told HuffPost, ""In 2009 we made it clear to Sen. Obenshain that NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia vehemently opposed his bill to criminalize tragic pregnancy complications and intimidate grieving Virginian women with the threat of law enforcement -- not to mention jail time. Although Sen. Obenshain did reach out to us amidst public backlash for a 'solution,' we clearly told him we would support nothing but immediate defeat of the legislation. While I'm relieved that he eventually decided to pull his bill, it is deeply troubling that an elected official would even consider such a callous and insulting effort.""Obenshain joins a wave of far-right social conservatives running for office in Virginia, including gubernatorial candidate and current attorney general Ken Cuccinelli and his running mate, Bishop E.W. Jackson. As a state senator, Cuccinelli co-sponsored personhood legislation that would have granted legal rights to embryos, and Jackson made a YouTube video last year in which he compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan."

Whatever value there is in judging a politician's standings in late December, it's limited. In today's hyper-kinetic Washington politics, conventional wisdom changes -- and quickly. And yet, in talking with operatives, Capitol Hill aides, Washington observers, and others, one impression is more permanent than any other: President Barack Obama had a really bad, tough-to-spin 2013.It was, as conceded by David Axelrod, the president's longtime adviser, a ""crappy year.""It's not just the poor rollout of the Affordable Care Act. To review: Obama worked Congress hard on gun control measures. It failed. He was hands-off with Congress on immigration reform. It failed. He pushed to avert sequestration cuts. They were enacted. He argued for unemployment benefits to be extended. They weren't. Revelations of aggressive investigations into national security leaks led to a review of Justice Department activities. Revelations that the IRS had screened tea party groups led to a reworking of the tax agency's practices. Revelations of the National Security Agency's broad surveillance programs, endorsed by Obama, led to popular revulsion, a court rebuke, another review, and likely reforms. That a government shutdown gave the president one of his better moments says something about the year. Shortly after the October standoff was resolved, with polls showing a majority blamed Republicans, the anti-Obama dam broke. The ACA rollout was a disaster, and a signature promise of the program that Obama made himself was proven hollow. At his year-end press conference Friday, Obama declined to call it the worst year of his presidency.""I have now been in office five years, close to five years, was running for president for two years before that, and for those who've covered me during that time, we have had ups and we have had downs,"" he said. ""I think this room has probably recorded at least 15 near-death experiences.""  As proof that his rumored demise may be premature, Obama noted recent legislative activity and the prospect of a continued thaw. Obama's defenders, meanwhile, argued that some 2013 setbacks should be placed in context. The IRS ""scandal"" lost fizz when it became clear that the agency had screened progressive groups, too. Sequestration relief was passed during the year-end budget deal. Even the stalled immigration reform effort has an upside. ""We actually aren’t quite as gloomy about this year,"" said Matt Bennett, senior vice president for public affairs and a co-founder of the centrist-Democratic group Third Way. ""Yes, the ACA rollout was very rocky. But if they get their act fully together on that, he may be in for a more productive year in 2014 than many expect. He got a really good immigration bill out of the Senate, and there is hope in the House once the primary filing deadlines pass. ... We actually made some headway on gun safety -- getting a vote on final passage and a handful of Republicans is nothing to sneeze at. So we see a few green shoots. Of course, we don’t yet know if they are flowers or weeds.""But even when taking those green shoots into account, it's impossible to argue that Obama has been on a course he's enjoyed. The charts don't lie. The more pertinent question (one whose answer has implications for the years ahead) is whether to blame personal missteps and mismanagement, or unforeseen events and structural problems with the political system? For Axelrod, the president and his team aren't entirely blameless. Part of the damage was ""self-inflicted,"" including the ""atrocious rollout of the health care website,"" he said. But broader issues outside of Obama's control were more determinative. ""The fact is you start out wanting to talk about and work on one set of issues and then events drag you to other places,"" Axelrod said, pointing to the Newtown shootings and Syrian civil war as examples. ""That is really the story of this year. ... A lot of it has to do with random events and orchestrated subversion on the part of the opposition.""Certainly, there were moments during the year when the president was forced off of his agenda. White House officials had planned a big jobs-related legislative push in January, for example, before the docket was overwhelmed by gun control. Other Democrats argued that the kinks of the political system did Obama in, with Republicans rewarded above all else for obstinacy. ""No White House is perfect and everyone makes mistakes, but I do think the structural problems overwhelmed everything else because it just became apparent that nothing could happen,"" said Bennett. ""The degree of dysfunction was historic. ... He could have been Lincoln in 1863 and he wouldn't have been able to do anything."" But Republican obstruction isn't exactly new. Nor is the notion that the news cycle is unwieldy and difficult to control. Other Democrats were sympathetic to the president, but more inclined to say that Obama and his team were responsible for the mess. Mike Lux, who served as Obama's liaison to the progressive community during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the administration since, argued that self-assuredness played a damaging role, preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon. When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination, the advice was heard, but not necessarily heeded. ""I feel like the White House goes it alone too much,"" said Lux. ""In advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem, it doesn't seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion in the party and with progressive allies."" A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: ""These guys are stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn't smell, that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt them.""As for policy, insularity has become the enemy of originality, Lux argued. That's led to an administration too comfortable with conventional wisdom. The president didn't challenge the intelligence community over the surveillance programs, and he made back room deals that complicated the health care law unnecessarily. What's ironic, others said, is that Obama is more comfortable as president now than at any point since he was elected. Drew Westen, a professor at Emory University, famously criticized Obama in 2011 on the op-ed pages of The New York Times for acquiescing too much to his opponents and for uninspiring oratory. Today, Westen praises Obama for increasingly relying on executive actions. If he were to grade Obama, he said he'd give him higher marks than ""in all his prior years."" Where Obama's administration has been tripped up, he argued, has been in a failure to elevate issues and messages that matter. ""There were people like me who at the end of 2009 were saying, 'You have got to start messaging in a coherent way about not only health care, but about what you are going to do about jobs and reigning in the power of banks, protecting consumers against predatory lending and credit practices that the average person was furious about,'"" said Westen ""That stuff was all clearly predictable by the end of 2009. Where I would fault him now is that I think he is doing the same thing again before this midterm election.""A request for comment from the White House was not returned. But it seems clear already that Obama and his team see value in Westen's point. In recent weeks, the administration has begun focusing on income inequality, wage stagnation and the need to spur job growth. Aides stressed that one of the first orders of business in 2014 will be getting unemployment insurance renewed. ""The core issue of the 2012 campaign was strengthening economic security for the middle class,"" said one former White House official. ""The question is whether putting every other issue on the back burner and focusing on that out of the gate would have changed the outcomes. My answer: maybe not significantly, but somewhat."" And then there is the Occam's razor view of what went wrong. Had the Affordable Care Act's rollout not been so badly botched, the year-end retrospective would have been kinder. Howard Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Vermont governor, argued as much when asked for his assessment. Every president who wins a second term suffers setbacks during his fifth year in office, Dean noted. And in all cases, the problems confronting Obama had to do either with a policy that he pushed or a personal decision that he made. ""It wasn't a policy issue, it was a digital problem,"" Dean said. ""He is in trouble because of the website.""And for that reason, there is hope for a bounce in 2014. ""I would argue that if he didn't have the website collapse, he wouldn't be subjected to the five-year curse as much,"" said Dean. ""All the other five-year curses were of the sitting president's own making. This one you may argue that three people down the line screwed up the website, not Obama. ... I do not think that he has been personally stained the way the other presidents were.""  "

Mike Lee (R-Utah) declared on Monday that he and other congressional Republicans would be willing to shut down the federal government in order to block further implementation of President Barack Obama's health care reform law.Speaking on Fox News, Lee said Republicans determined that refusing to fund Obamacare was the ""last stop"" before the individual mandate and the law's health insurance exchanges are set to go into effect at the beginning of next year.“Congress of course has to pass a law to continue funding government -- lately we’ve been doing that through a funding mechanism called a continuing resolution,"" Lee said. ""If Republicans in both houses simply refuse to vote for any continuing resolution that contains further funding for further enforcement of Obamacare, we can stop it. We can stop the individual mandate from going into effect.”Lee added that his effort, which he said was backed by ""13 or 14"" Senate Republicans and a host of House Republicans, wouldn't target popular Obamacare provisions that already had gone into effect, like a measure that allows children to remain on their parents' health insurance until the age of 26.Congress passed a continuing resolution in March, temporarily funding the government for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Lee is suggesting that Republicans refuse to vote on a future measure to fund the government, setting up another standoff that would put critical government functions at risk.The threat comes just days after House Republicans took their 38th vote to repeal part or all of Obamacare. Their latest move followed the Obama administration's announcement that it was delaying the law's employer mandate for a year, a decision that Republicans used to support their claims that Obamacare is unworkable.Lee similarly suggested in a Friday interview on WBAL 1090 AM that he and other Republicans would be willing to shut down the government.“I’ll utilize every procedural mechanism at my disposal to do it,” he said. “I generally don’t signal in advance what procedural maneuvers exactly I’ll use because it’s usually not good strategy. But what I am saying is I will not vote for a continuing resolution that contains funding for further Obamacare implantation and enforcement. So far I have got, I don’t know, 13 or 14 Senate Republicans who have joined me. I think a corresponding effort is starting to be kicked off in the House. And I expect these numbers to grow steadily as Americans realize the president has said he’s not going to implement the law as written. If he’s not going to implement the law, we shouldn’t be forced to fund it.”"

Now, only beneficiaries of TRICARE, the Defense Department health system, will be eligible, along with members of the military, their families and military retirees.""In the past, AFMC has offered both the flu vaccine and wellness programs because civilian health and wellness is an important factor that supports our command mission,"" said Col. James King, AFMC command surgeon, in a statement this week. ""Unfortunately, limited resources required us to prioritize and ultimately fund broader health programs that provide more resources for the total health of our civilian workforce.""The Air Force added that it had had to purchase vaccines in early 2013, ""when this year's budget numbers were less certain""; sequestration went into effect on March 1. ""Analysis determined that less than 20 percent of the civilian population used the AFMC-provided flu vaccine program and officials elected to instead fund AFMC's more comprehensive civilian programs, the Employee Assistance Program and Civilian Health Promotion Services,"" King added.The Navy said it will not be following the path taken by the Air Force and will continue to offer free flu shots to civilian employees.""The Navy is not taking this measure with its civilian workers,"" said spokesman Paul Ross. ""We intend to vaccinate all civilian health care workers providing direct patient care and those where it is written in their position description as a condition of employment.""""We highly encourage vaccination of other Navy civilian personnel if flu vaccine is available at the medical treatment facility, but priority groups must be vaccinated first (e.g. service members, and health care workers),"" he added. ""We anticipate being able to offer this opportunity this year.""Army spokeswoman Alayne Conway said their policy on flu shots had not changed due to sequestration, and civilians are still eligible to receive the vaccination.Lisa Novak, a spokeswoman with the Coast Guard, was not aware of any changes to their flu shot policy due to sequestration. ""The seasonal flu vaccine is mandatory for all Coast Guard Active Duty and Selected Reserve personnel and is also mandatory for Child Development Services personnel and civilian, contract and Auxiliary healthcare personnel who provide direct patient care in clinics,"" she said. ""After these mandatory groups, the next highest-priority groups are deploying civilian employees and others enrolled at Coast Guard Regional Practice clinics and deemed high-risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.""""One these priority populations are immunized, Coast Guard Regional Practice clinics may offer the flu vaccine to all other beneficiaries, and all Coast Guard civilian employees as supplies allow,"" she added.The Marines did not return a request for comment on how sequestration was affecting flu season preparation.Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, is also concerned that sequestration will make it harder to fight the flu. He recently told The Huffington Post that a universal flu vaccine could potentially be developed in the next five years, but that work will be significantly slowed due to budget cuts.""If you want to convert this into real meaningful numbers, that means people are going to die of influenza five years from now because we don't yet have the universal vaccine,"" said Collins. ""And God help us if we get a worldwide pandemic that emerges in the next five years, which takes a long time to prepare a vaccine for. If we had the universal vaccine, it would work for that too.""This article was updated after publication with comment from the Army, Navy and Coast Guard."

Here's what the fiscal analysis had to say:Reduced costs in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually to state and local governments related to enforcing certain marijuana-related offenses, handling the related criminal cases in the court system, and incarcerating and supervising certain marijuana offenders. Potential net additional tax revenues in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually related to the production and sale of marijuana, a portion of which is required to be spent on education, health care, public safety, drug abuse education and treatment, and the regulation of commercial marijuana activities.As LA Weekly noted, there was a slight speed bump in the language of the initiative. It originally read that the law ""could"" protect people under age 21 from using marijuana, instead of ""shall"" protect them. An amended version is awaiting a title and summary from the attorney general, expected to be released on Jan. 31. ""We're expecting a title and summary nearly identical to the one that was just released, if not even more supportive,"" Dave Hodges, one of initiative's primary backers, told The Huffington Post. ""There isn't any change that would affect the title and summary that was released."" If Hodges is correct, the new title and summary would pave the way for advocates to gather signatures supporting adding the initiative to the November ballot.The move could come at a good time for California, which has struggled with crippling budget deficits over the past decade. Though the state has seen notable financial success under Gov. Jerry Brown's Proposition 30, which temporarily raises taxes, the pot initiative could add much-needed cushioning when the proposition expires in 2018. "

""It's a different time and a different Congress,"" Kelley told HuffPost. ""There are too many people who remember [1995 and 1996] or were told about it by someone and I want them to know that is not a guarantee.""""I'm telling employees not to assume they would be paid,"" Kelley continued, ""and that adds to the frustration and the anger. They're tired of being caught in the middle of this.""Last week, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill that ties government funding to the defunding of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Of course, the White House and Senate Democrats have refused to neuter the president's landmark health care reform law at the behest of Republicans. Barring a resolution, funding for government services will expire next week.Many workers employed in national security roles, like Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officers, would be exempted from furloughs and keep working even if the government goes into shutdown mode. In that case, they would get paid retroactively for their service, but not until Congress passes the new spending legislation.For other workers, the shutdown would lead to an unknown number of furlough days. Congress could later choose to pay workers for the furlough period -- or not. After the mid-'90s shutdowns, Congress passed legislation compensating workers for the wages they lost.According to J. David Cox, head of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, the looming government shutdown would amount to ""involuntary servitude"" for federal workers who continue clocking in even if government operations go unfunded by Congress.Cox, whose union represents 670,000 workers across federal agencies, told HuffPost that union members were ""unnerved"" by the possibility of a shutdown, especially after many have already taken unpaid furlough days this year due to sequestration.""They've lost a whole week's pay,"" Cox said of many federal employees. ""Now you're talking about a government shutdown. In many instances employees will be required to go to work but won't get paid on payday.""""This is no way to run a country,"" Cox added.The threat of a government shutdown has become more common amid Congress' ongoing budget battles. In addition to facing furlough days, many federal employees have also been under a three-year pay freeze as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for belt-tightening. (Although many workers have still received merit raises, they have not been eligible for their traditional cost-of-living increases each year.)Cox said the union has been in close contact with the offices of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) on the possibility of a shutdown. Kelley said her union has asked all its members to pressure their representatives to strike a deal.""I don't think anyone is willing to accept it as the new normal, because it's no way to run any operation, much less the federal government,"" Kelley said."
4031	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/29/ted-cruz-house-republicans_n_4014071.html	Opinion	1	Economy	Healthcare	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatPositive	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans give one person the most credit for bringing Congress to its current standoff over funding for the federal government: Ted Cruz.With the clock ticking toward the first government shutdown in 17 years, many lawmakers said they never would have been here had it not been for the junior senator from Texas.""I think he's played a lot of role in where we are right now,"" Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said as he left a closed-door meeting of the House Republican conference on Saturday afternoon.During the meeting, GOP leaders announced plans to advance a bill that would keep the government funded beyond Sept. 30 in exchange for a one-year delay of Obamacare and repeal of its medical device tax. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) declared the proposal dead on arrival a couple hours later.But conservatives were jubilant as they left the meeting, and they identified Cruz as the force that pushed a reluctant GOP leadership to the brink.""I think Ted Cruz did a huge service to the nation and to the cause of Republicanism,"" Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) told The Huffington Post.""[He played] an excellent role,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.). ""I think what he's done is strengthened our hand. He's made the case that we need to act and act decisively, and so I think we have a lot to credit him for.""Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) called Cruz's role ""huge.""""He's been the rallying flag that has pulled Republicans around conservatives,"" Fleming said. ""Just the mere fact that he's out there talking, that he's had petitions going, that he did a 21-hour [speech] that was highlighted in the media … all of these things are building energy among Republicans and conservatives who are unified in the fact that we oppose Obamacare.""Cruz, along with his main ally Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), spent much of the summer mounting a full-fledged campaign to include a provision defunding Obamacare in a bill to fund the government. He starred in robocalls and television and radio ads, and raised millions for a possible White House bid in 2016, all while ramping up pressure on the House to yield to his demands.At first, House Republicans seemed content to pass a continuing resolution that defunded Obamacare and leave it to Cruz to filibuster any attempts by Reid to amend it. The Texas senator failed to gather enough support from his colleagues to mount a filibuster and embarked on a 21-hour floor speech anyway.As the Cruz show ran its course, House GOP leaders looked unlikely to tamper with Obamacare once again in their next government funding offer. They instead shifted focus to the pending debt ceiling fight, unveiling plans to seek a one-year delay in the implementation of Obamacare in exchange for raising the nation's borrowing limit.But once again, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) found himself up against Cruz.National Review reported that Cruz told House conservatives in a Thursday conference call to oppose leadership's fiscal strategy. Two days after the call, GOP leaders once again hinged funding for the government on Obamacare and dramatically raised the odds of a shutdown.Some Republicans denied that Cruz was responsible.""That's a different body over there,"" said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.). ""I think our leadership has been onto this the whole time. I think they listened to the American people. That's what we're supposed to do.""""I think we motivated him. We stood firm first and he did what he did,"" said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.). Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said it was a team effort, but conceded the senator from Texas had been at the forefront of it all.""I think we're motivated by the dangers of Obamacare, not by Ted Cruz,"" he said. ""Although it is good to see Ted Cruz take a leadership role.""Democrats have pounced on Cruz's influence among the House GOP's right flank and played up the idea of the Texas Republican becoming the next speaker of the House. But Cole, the House GOP's deputy whip, laughed at the suggestion that Cruz had dictated the House's strategy over funding the government and said the conference was in ""total support"" of Boehner.""It's not as if any of us have ever been for Obamacare, so we've had multiple proposals to change, delay, what have you,"" he said, before taking a jab at Cruz's lengthy talkathon last week.""He's dragged the clock out a little bit, so it's made it a little tougher, but we'll see what he does once we move [our bill] back over there,"" Cole said.Luke Johnson contributed reporting."

Salaries and benefits soared far above civilian compensation, military bases and housing were refurbished, support services like day care, family counseling and on-base college courses were expanded.Now comes the reckoning. These personnel costs, necessary and warranted for those bearing the burden of war, are threatening to wreck the military, squeezing the accounts meant to fix or replace gear worn from a decade of war, for research and development, and for new missions in, say, Africa.So stubbornly are personnel costs rising that at the current rate of increase, they would consume the entire defense budget by the year 2039, leaving well-paid troops standing around with their tanks, ships and airplanes rusting and out of gas.The problem has been evident for years -- the past two defense secretaries have called personnel costs ""unsustainable."" But neither the Obama White House nor Congress has signalled its willingness to tackle the issue by proposing bold reductions in pay and benefits -- or by deep cuts in the active-duty force.In his confirmation hearing Thursday, former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) will get a chance to weigh in on the issue as the nominee for defense secretary. He has said nothing in public on the issue, and his background gives little clue: as a successful businessman he's cognizant of the bottom line; as a former combat infantryman, his heart may make him to reluctant to touch the grunts' pay stubs.But with deep cuts in defense spending barrelling down toward the Pentagon, some defense officials and outside experts fear that the opportunity for thoughtful reforms may be passing. Personnel costs are likely to be cut -- but perhaps not wisely. A freeze on hiring of new civilian personnel, for instance, could demolish plans to hire more mental health care providers for returning troops suffering from post-traumatic stress, even though Ash Carter, deputy defense secretary, has vowed to protect such programs ""to the extent feasible.""Military pay and benefits ""are the third rail of budget planning in the Defense Department,"" said Gordon Adams, a defense economist who oversaw the post-Cold War defense drawdown during the Clinton administration. With no long-term budget deal in sight and no long-term planning in the works, the shrinking of the Defense Department ""will happen year by year -- more ankle-biting than systematic planning,"" Adams said.Pentagon spending plans are getting slammed by the automatic cuts under sequestration, scheduled to take place on March 1; by the likelihood that Congress will pass no new defense spending bill, leaving the Pentagon confined, under a continuing resolution to last year's defense budget plan; and by long-term spending cuts which have yet to be made.But the impact is real. The Pentagon has been spending money it expected from the 2013 budget proposed last year by the White House. Cranking back to conform to last year's budget levels will be painful, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno said recently, requiring the Army to squeeze $6 billion out of its operations and maintenance accounts by Oct. 1. These are funds that pay for fuel, training, some family support programs and vehicle maintenance.And while Pentagon officials have vowed not to cut family programs, a continuing resolution, rather than a new 2013 budget, will not allow the Army to move money from one operations account to another -- it all gets cut, Odierno said. ""People have been in denial about this ongoing trend, and now the accumulated impact of it is coming home,"" said Clark Murdock, a former senior planner at the Pentagon and a senior analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.But the data is clear. Since 2001, total military compensation, including pay and benefits, grew by 20.5 percent, while comparable private-sector civilian pay did not increase at all, according to a broad Pentagon review of pay and compensation released last year. The cost of military compensation rose steeply even though the size of the active-duty force grew by only 3 percent during that period.Part of the reason was that Congress mandated that military personnel should get an annual pay raise 1 to 1.5 percent higher than the Employment Cost Index, which measures civilian earnings.Thus, a sergeant's base pay and housing allowance rose 20.5 percent between 2001 and 2009, when the average enlisted military member was earning $50,747 in base pay and housing -- not including other allowances and bonuses. Officer pay rose 9.1 percent, to an average of $94,700.Congress also demanded that the Pentagon absorb a larger share of the housing costs of military families. Their housing allowance was bumped up by 5.7 percent in 2007, another 4.7 percent in 2008 and 5 percent in 2009. Currently, the Pentagon pays all housing costs for families who live off base. Other benefits include shopping at on-base commissaries, which typically save military shoppers about 30 percent on groceries.Base pay and housing allowance boosts the income of an Army master sergeant with 10 years of service, living at Fort Drum, N.Y., to $84,666.48 a year, according to the current Pentagon pay tables. This sergeant would pay a tax rate of 15 percent, a $6,417.40 tax advantage over civilians.An Army captain with six years of service with the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, earns $85,330.80 a year in pay and housing allowance -- not counting bonuses, tax-free danger pay for service in a war zone and other benefits. A brigadier (one-star) general at Fort Drum, with 16 years of service, is earning $131,652 a year plus a housing allowance of $2,247 per month.""The fiscal reality facing us means that we also have to look at the growth in personnel costs which are a major driver of budget growth and are, simply put, on an unsustainable course,"" soon-to-retire Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in October 2011. Months later, the White House included in its budget proposal a timid increase of between $31 and $128 a month in the health insurance premiums paid by military retirees, unchanged since 1985. That proposal was trashed by Congress.But in the new era of budget austerity and tough choices, that kind of congressional protection may not last.""Our folks are worried about whether they're going to get paid, what support services aren't going to be there to help them and their families,"" said Joyce Raezer, executive director of the National Military Family Association. She defended the increases in pay and benefits by saying, ""We've been at war. We've had to pay for people to be at war.""The inevitable cuts in defense spending could, if not managed properly, hurt military families, she said. For instance, whittling down the size of the active duty force could put more of a burden on families if the global missions the military is expected to fill aren't reduced as well. ""We are going to be an on-call force, there is going to be trouble somewhere, and if there are fewer people, the ones left will be on call more often,"" said Raezer, a long-time military spouse.She also worries that cuts in family support programs will drive reductions in mental health services just at a time when they are most needed.""We're not saying all these programs will be needed forever,"" said Raezer. But in all the talk about budget cuts and dwindling resources, she said, there is no thoughtful plan to reduce spending in a rational way.""What we see coming,"" she said, ""is budget cuts first -- and then figuring out how to do with less.""Clarification: Language has been added to clarify the calculations of base pay and allowance increases for specific members of the military. Original language in the headline and copy referring to ""Lavish Benefits"" was inaccurate and reflected neither the views of David Wood nor The Huffington Post. We regret the mischaracterization."
4077	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/07/tea-party-obamacare_n_3719124.html	News	0	Elections	Healthcare	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Long-serving Republicans aren't engaged in an increasingly public smackdown of their tea party colleagues because they disagree with them -- it's more that they don't want a few hotheads to blow their party's best chance in years to retake control of the United States Senate.Several tea party-powered senators have laid down a gauntlet of late, saying the GOP should refuse to pass a bill to fund the government in September unless all funding for the implementation of the health care reform law is cut.It's a message -- championed by Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) -- that appeals to the enthusiasms of a population that united against Obamacare under the banner of Taxed Enough Already in 2009, a year in which federal taxes actually hit historic lows.Cruz has argued that united Republicans could force President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate to accept a government-funding measure that essentially ends Obama's marquee achievement, the Affordable Care Act.""I believe that if Republicans stand together, this is a fight we can win,"" Cruz told reporters last week. ""It represents our best opportunity to actually defund Obamacare, and potentially our last good opportunity to do so,"" he said, arguing that although his side doesn't have the votes now, that can change over the August break.But more senior members of the GOP caucus -- most prominently Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) -- have said they see the idea as ill-conceived and unreasonable. In an unexpected twist, the veteran lawmakers who are not exactly known for being voices of moderation are appealing for a more deliberate approach. They worry that most of the nation simply is not ready to shutter the government just to hamstring Obamacare. And in interviews as Congress was getting ready to ready to adjourn until September, McCain, Coburn and other Republican leaders said that while they believe the health care law will be the train wreck the GOP is forecasting, following the path of Cruz, Lee and Rubio could produce a more immediate derailment -- of the GOP's electoral chances in 2014. ""I'm not sure why we should advocate for something that's absolutely impossible. The only way Obamacare is going to be repealed is with a 60-vote Republican Senate, and then, in order to override a presidential veto, I think it's 67 votes,"" McCain said. ""I haven't seen an attempt to override a veto in a long time. It's a non-starter.""And a political land mine, he added.""Those of us who have been around for a while know what happens when there's the threat of a shutdown of the government: It's the Congress that gets blamed,"" McCain said. ""If the minority uses its strength, its 41 votes [to filibuster government funding], then clearly the American people will blame the Congress. And they do -- that's the history. And those who say that's not the case ignore the lessons of history and the realities of American politics.""One of those who remembers the history is Coburn, who was first elected as a member of the House in the Republican revolution of 1994 -- before the last time the GOP shut down the government under then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) in 1995 and 1996.Coburn suggested that even then, when Republicans were more unified around the idea of a shutdown, they were not really all that committed to it -- making their efforts doomed to fail.""Here's what I know. I saw the lack of us holding what we said was our strategy, and ultimately losing 9 seats in the House when we should have won 22, and being less effective in the long-run because we didn't hold onto our strategy,"" Coburn told The Huffington Post. ""The difference is you had the vast majority of Republicans wanting to do that. You don't have the vast majority of Republicans wanting to do that now. So if you could do it, you'd hold for even less time. So what you'd do is say, 'Yes, the government's shut down.' And the first time the pressure gets up with people not really sold on the strategy, they'll bail on you,"" he said.""The only way that strategy works is if you're going to take the hostage and shoot it. Which means you're never going to open the government back up until Obama says uncle,"" Coburn said, arguing that there's no way a filibuster-strong 40 members of the GOP caucus would be willing to halt Social Security checks, mail delivery, passport services, construction work and the myriad other things constituents expect from the government in hopes of making Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) blink. ""What is the likelihood of that? And what is the probability that members of the Senate will hold on that? It's about zero.""GOP strategists who lived through the Gingrich debacle are also keenly aware of the downsides.""Shutting down the government never works at the end of the day,"" said longtime GOP consultant Ed Rollins, who rose to prominence under Ronald Reagan and most recently served a brief stint running Rep. Michele Bachmann's (R-Minn.) 2012 presidential campaign. ""Even though we shut it down last time, it helped the president [Bill Clinton] win reelection.""Another strategist, former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Brian Walsh, said he found the tea party senators' push especially ill-timed because the GOP, he feels, is already scoring significant points by spotlighting and magnifying every new problem with the rollout of the health care law.Having the tea party heroes launch a holy war against fellow Republicans over their alleged insufficient purity on Obamacare is just about as welcome as a bruising primary challenge, Walsh said.""The frustrating part is politically we are on offense,"" Walsh said. ""You're seeing stories in a lot places about companies pulling out of the [Obamacare] markets, and small businesses cutting workers' hours. You're seeing all these stories about problems with the Obamacare implementation … So it's a little frustrating that instead of that being the focus, instead of keeping the Democrats on defense, there's a section of the party that would rather engage in fratricide.""Walsh is an especially acute observer in this case because it was during his stint at the NRSC that Republicans failed to retake the Senate, largely thanks to stumbles from tea party candidates such as Christine O'Donnell in Delaware in 2010 and Nevada's Sharron Angle that same year. Last year featured failures by Richard Mourdoch in Indiana and Todd Akin in Missouri. They all triumphed over more mainstream candidates in primaries, but alienated too many voters in the general elections, even in red states.""Conservatively, the party gave away five seats in those years,"" Walsh said.Coburn probably would not agree that anyone lost by being too conservative. He's proud of his own right-wing philosophy, and suggests that some of today's younger firebrands might not do as well holding on to core conservative values amid the compromises and temptations of Washington.""We'll see after 10 years if they still have a 99 [American Conservative Union] rating,"" Coburn said.What Coburn worries about is his newer colleagues making dumb promises.""If your strategy is to hold government funding hostage to defund Obamacare, the [Congressional Research Service] says as you do that, guess what's going to happen? Funding for Obamacare is going to continue,"" Coburn said, referring to a report by the nonpartisan CRS that explained most of the funding for the health care law is mandatory and not subject to Congress' annual appropriations battles. ""So it tells you the problem with the strategy.""And of course, there are the electoral consequences.""The other thing that's dangerous in it, is that you create the expectation in our base that you can do something that is absolutely not achievable. It may be achievable for two weeks or three weeks, but if your ultimate goal is to defund it, and you have a president and a Senate controlled by Democrats, and a thin majority in the House, the strategy doesn't work,"" Coburn said.""If you pump the base up and say here's something we can do when in fact you can't, but they believe you could have done it, and then you don't do it -- I think it keeps a lot of people at home, because they say, 'Gosh, the Republicans wouldn't stand again,'"" he said.Nevertheless, Cruz and Co. have embarked on a drive -- including an online petition that's racked up more than 250,000 signers -- to promote their shutdown showdown all through August, hoping to galvanize the same sort of 2009 outpouring that handed the GOP control of the House of Representatives the next year, and to pressure their colleagues into standing with them.""I for one, and I know my colleagues as well, are not prepared to go home and tell people, ‘Well, we tried, but we couldn’t,’"" Rubio said in announcing the push last week. ""We have to go home and say, 'We did everything we could. We took every step available to us.' And that's why this is such an important issue.""But McCain noted that a letter they circulated before the break was actually losing support. Indeed, one of the senators listed as uncommitted in the online petition, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, echoed her more conservative colleagues in slamming the shutdown threat.""Let's be realistic. Obamacare, a law that I strongly oppose, is not going to be repealed. So the effect of trying to repeal the funding of government inevitably leads to a government shutdown, which I do not believe is good policy or good politics,"" Collins said. ""The American people want common-sense solutions. They don't want us to pursue policies that are pointless, that are going to end in government shutting down, more partisanship, more gridlock. They want us to actually get things done.""Walsh argued that the dissidents should take a page from the conservative playbook of four years ago. ""When you look at 2009, the tea party ire was focused appropriately on Obamacare, and now you see some of that focused on the Republican Party,"" Walsh said, adding that the government shutdown threat is taking the GOP ""off message.""Particularly confounding to him was the fundamental irrationality in a push that casts some of the opponents of the Cruz-Lee-Rubio effort -- who also include Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) -- as not real conservatives.""When you're suggesting that anyone like Tom Coburn is less than conservative, you better look in the mirror,"" Walsh said.The older Republicans did not disparage the motives of their younger brethren, but at least three of them -- Cruz, Rubio, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) -- have openly flirted with a 2016 GOP presidential bid, which could benefit from tea party support. And the inboxes of just about anyone paying attention to the conservative movement has seen the steady stream lately of praise for the effort from groups like the Tea Party Express, as well as fundraising appeals. Still, political veterans thought the hotshots would be wise to cool it, at least a little.""Ted Cruz hasn't even been here two years, and he's got a bright, long future in the party,"" said Rollins. ""But he should be a little patient. You need make sure that whatever your goal is, it's something you can achieve. And you can't achieve this.""Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post. Talk to him on Facebook."
4102	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/obamacare-virginia-governor_n_4229062.html	News	1	Elections	Healthcare	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON –- Two weeks before Virginia's gubernatorial election Tuesday, Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli's pollster e-mailed his senior campaign advisers with the latest polling results. They weren't good.  ""There is nothing in the data that suggests it's not all that bad,"" pollster Glen Bolger wrote. ""It's pretty bad.""  Cuccinelli was down 9 percentage-points among voters labeled ""10's"" by the campaign because they were considered most likely to vote, trailing Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe 38 percent to 47 percent. Cuccinelli was also down 33 percent to 44 percent among all the voters surveyed, with 10 percent for Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis.   Public polling was about the same. The HuffPost Pollster average on Oct. 18 gave McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, an 8.5-point lead, 45.5 to 37 percent. Bolger informed the Cuccinelli brain trust that the numbers were terrible for a few reasons: ""We are being badly outspent, and the shutdown/end game has not been successful at revving up Republicans OR deflating Democrats.""  The claim by Bolger and by many Republicans now, in the wake of a much narrower than expected, 2.5-point McAuliffe win on Tuesday, is that the numbers closed in in the last two weeks as Cuccinelli honed in on Obamacare. He stressed his early opposition to the law in 2010 as attorney general, just as the law kicked in, suffering massive implementation problems.   The takeaway, then, for some, is that Obamacare became a millstone that almost dragged McAuliffe from a sure victory to an epic collapse.  ""Despite being outspent by an unprecedented $15 million, this race came down to the wire because of Obamacare,"" Cuccinelli said in his concession speech Tuesday night.  The problem is, there's not much evidence for this. Closer to Election Day, on Nov. 1, Cuccinelli campaign manager Chris LaCivita e-mailed supporters and claimed that among the ""10's,"" McAuliffe had just a 1-point lead. This wasn't from a poll done by the campaign, however. Bolger told HuffPost on Wednesday that the Oct. 18 poll was the last one the campaign conducted. ""Had no more money,"" he wrote in an e-mail. (LaCivita did not respond to an e-mail asking what he had based his Nov. 1 claim on.)  In addition, the public polling itself was not as volatile as people thought. In mid-July, McAuliffe began opening a lead, and the HuffPost/Pollster average of the public polling showed that advantage at around 5 points for most of August and September, and at 7 points in October, all the way up to Election Day. A cluster of polls showing McAuliffe up by double digits in mid- to late October, followed by two polls showing him up only four points and two points, respectively, created the impression of a tightening race.  Late last week, in a briefing with reporters, McAuliffe's pollster said that their internal polling had showed the race steady for a month.  ""Our margin both in the head-to-head and in the three-way race are exactly what they were a month ago,"" Geoff Garin, the Democratic pollster, said. Garin didn't say then what the margin was, but in a phone conversation the same day he told HuffPost's Mark Blumenthal that it was 4 points. The day after the election, Garin said, ""Terry’s lead from mid-summer on was always in the 2-4 range.""  Voter modeling conducted for McAuliffe by a group of former Obama campaign analytics experts gave McAuliffe a 2-point lead. McAuliffe's team believes they drove up Cuccinelli's negatives over the summer with attack ads, and the race never moved from there. McAuliffe communications director Brennan Bilberry said Wednesday that the Cuccinelli number showing the Republican trailing by 11 in mid-October was ""lunacy.""  Here's why the Democrats might be right, and why the Republican theory that Obamacare gave Cuccinelli momentum may be wrong: the Democrats continue to hold a data advantage over Republicans. The quality of their voter information is better, but perhaps more importantly, there is a greater cultural willingness among Democratic pollsters and campaigns to do surveys and voter targeting based on enhanced voter files. And so McAuliffe’s polling, predictive modeling and voter targeting was, quite likely, vastly superior to Cuccinelli's and to the public polling. If that is the case, it is a repeat of what happened in 2012, when Mitt Romney's pollsters, and the public pollsters, were outclassed by the Obama machine and its deadly combination of rigorous quantitative analysis and a vast army of ground volunteers vacuuming up large quantities of raw data and feeding it back to headquarters.  Because of the 2012 election and the massive amount of resources thrown into Virginia by President Obama's reelection campaign, the Democrats said they had better data on which to base their predictive models for who was going to vote, who they were going to vote for and who was open to being persuaded.  ""We just have richer data. We've been collecting more data and we've been using the same file more consistently for the past few years,"" McAuliffe campaign manager Robby Mook said last week.  This data edge drove the McAuliffe campaign's decisions on how to conduct its polling, which then dictated the results it got. It also drove the campaign's decisions on how to allocate ground-game resources, and early voting effort, as well as TV ad strategy.  If Republicans had hard data showing them closing to within a point or two, wouldn't that have drawn money for more ads into the race in the last few days? The fact that this didn't happen suggests the GOP was flying blind in Virginia, and that they are still struggling to catch up to Democrats in the realm of data-driven campaigns.  Although Republicans have promised that they are going to leapfrog the Democrats in running data-centric campaigns, the bottom line is they are trying to make up ground that has been lost over several years, which will take time to rectify.  ""The problem is not that this stuff takes a ton of money to figure out once you have the data. The problem is the gathering of the data is so fucking labor intensive and requires so much work,"" said one Republican operative. ""The richer the data you have, the better targeting you can do.""  That explains why the Republican National Committee dedicated its resources in Virginia to building out a ground operation. They spent $3 million on the race, but an RNC official acknowledged that their efforts were also “building the party’s presence in Virginia.”  “We went into this race working with the campaigns about what they needed to win based on their plans. We committed to funding/running the ground games and minority engagement –- that’s what we did,” the RNC official said.   The residue of the 2012 Obama campaign also helped McAuliffe with his ground game. The Democrat claimed to have 13,513 volunteers working for the campaign in the last four days, and said his campaign knocked on over 2 million doors and made 2 million phone calls. Cuccinelli said he doubted these numbers, but neither his campaign nor the RNC ever disclosed their own ground-game numbers, despite repeated requests before and after Election Day. None of this is to say that Obamacare is not a political problem for Democrats, and could play a big role in the 2014 midterms. “They have to get it fixed and they have to get it fixed fast,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost’s Sam Stein. But it’s not clear that in Virginia, Obamacare played the role some Republicans say it did. "

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said Tuesday, in another sign of a growing split in the Republican Party.""I want to defund this bill, but I also want a way to do it that kills it,"" Coburn, who was one of the health care law's most vocal opponents when it passed, said in a Senate floor speech.He argued that the plan by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and several other tea party-backed senators to try and strip funds for the law from a September government funding bill simply won't work.The reason, Coburn argued, is that most of the spending in Obamacare is mandatory, and the spending cannot be touched, even if the GOP were to shut down the rest of the government. He cited a new Congressional Research Service report that found as much.""There's not a legislative method that we have that is capable of defunding it short of 67 votes in the U.S. Senate, short of two-thirds [of the] votes in the U.S. House,"" Coburn said, referring to the number of votes needed to override the presidential veto that would be sure to block any attempt to defund the law.Nevertheless, Lee said that the GOP has an obligation to try.He and Cruz argued that if the House passed a bill to fund all of the government except for Obamacare and the president blocked it, it would be the White House shutting down the government, not the GOP. They also contended that this year was Republicans' last real chance to stop the health care law before it is fully implemented, and said any members of the GOP who don't stand against it now are essentially guaranteeing the law will continue to exist.""Defund it, or own it,"" Lee said to his colleagues. ""If you fund it, you're for it.""Cruz told reporters shortly before taking to the floor that Americans would essentially be hooked on the law if it's not blocked by the start of next year.""Jan. 1 is when the exchanges start and subsidies start. And the administration's plan is to get as many people as possible addicted to the sugar, addicted to the subsidies,"" Cruz said, arguing that entitlements never get repealed.""It is an iron rule of politics that those who receive subsidies, inevitably, after they start receiving those subsidies, fight to retain those subsidies,"" Cruz said. ""They want as many people as possible receiving those subsidies in order to ensure that they remain a permanent aspect of the economy.""But other Republicans, like Coburn, think a shutdown showdown is doomed to not only fail, but to make Americans angry at the GOP, potentially harming chances to win fights in other areas, from tax reform and the debt ceiling later this year to next year's elections.Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) has called the defunding gambit the ""dumbest idea"" he's ever heard. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) warned against it, while Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Americans were tired of GOP-led debt ceiling and government shutdown ""shenanigans."" Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said shutting down the government was ""foolish.""Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) added her criticism to the chorus Tuesday, saying the plan was simply not realistic, and that it was both bad policy and bad politics.""The American people want commonsense solutions,"" Collins told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""They don't want us to pursue policies that are pointless, that are going to end in governments shutting down, more partisanship, more gridlock. They want us to actually get things done.""Even conservative Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) was not willing to join Lee, Cruz and company, although he opposes Obamacare.""We all agree and have voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. Our conference is united on that,"" he told HuffPost. ""Now we're just working through what's the best tactic or strategy to do it. So we're working through that, and obviously there are different opinions. Nobody wants the government to shut down. Nobody wants that to happen.""Nevertheless, Cruz said he saw a path, saying that ""August is a critical period"" to convince the public to put pressure on lawmakers while they are on their month-long recess.""If we see a grassroots tsunami, if we see millions of Americans stand up and say, 'Stop giving speeches about Obamacare, stop casting symbolic votes that don't do anything, and actually stand and fight,' if senators, if members of the House actually listen to their constituents, I believe we will return and come September... I believe we will succeed in getting either 41 senators in the Senate to stand together, or 218 members in the House to stand together. That's the path to winning this fight,"" Cruz said. The 41 senators he referred to are the number needed to filibuster a bill in the Senate.Cruz -- who argued on the Senate floor that no ""parade of horribles"" materialized when the GOP shut down government for several weeks in the Clinton era -- told reporters that Republicans need to stop being afraid of being blamed.""Republicans actually will have to stand up and fight and win the argument, and say, 'No, we have voted to fund the federal government. We want to keep the federal government funded, and why is President Obama threatening to shut down the federal government in order to force Obamacare down the American people's throats?'""During the shutdowns in 1995, the GOP took adamant positions on the budget while Clinton signaled willingness to negotiate. The showdowns are widely credited with aiding Democrats in the 1996 elections. "

Even many Republicans believe Obama would never agree to sign a spending bill that removed funding for his signature domestic policy achievement.Cole disagrees with the idea of using a government shutdown threat to try to take aim at Obamacare but added, ""the frustration is how do you keep fighting it without taking an action that is counterproductive.""On the call, Boehner sketched out a plan in which Republicans would pass a short-term measure to fund the government until around December while insisting on keeping in place steep cuts in spending known as the ""sequester.""When Congress reconvenes on Sept. 9 after its summer break, Boehner said, ""Our intent is to move quickly on a short-term continuing resolution that keeps the government running and maintains current sequester spending levels.""Earlier on Thursday, about a third of the Republican caucus sent a letter to Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor urging them to oppose any annual spending bills that include funding for Obamacare.The letter was spearheaded by Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina and got the signatures of 80 House Republicans.During the call, one member asked Boehner, ""Can you at least announce that you want to defund Obamacare?"" Another asked Boehner how he would get a short-term spending measure passed, according to one person on the call.Congressional Republicans have sought repeatedly to repeal the law.While Republicans say the law will hurt job creation, supporters view it as a landmark initiative that will extend health insurance coverage to millions of Americans.In addition to the House lawmakers who signed the letter to Republican leaders, there is support for denying funds to Obamacare from prominent Republican senators including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida.During the five-week summer recess, Obamacare has been riling up constituents at town hall-style meeting in lawmakers' home districts, with both critics and supporters airing their views.Republican Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas told Reuters there was a ""large divide between Republican leaders in (Washington) D.C. and Republicans in the rest of the country.""Huelskamp, who participated in the call and agrees with using the government shutdown strategy on Obamacare, said Republican leaders were ignoring that divide ""at their own peril.""Republican leaders have been working to find alternative ways to weaken the health law.One idea under consideration is tying approval of an increase in the country's borrowing limit to agreement by the Obama administration to delay implementation of the measure.An aide to Cantor, the No. 2 House Republican, told Reuters on Wednesday that the debt limit was a good ""leverage point"" to try to force action on Obamacare."

Brad Dayspring, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called Grimes “an empty dress” in an interview with The Hill published Wednesday. The insults continued from there. “Alison Lundergan Grimes seems incapable of articulating her own thoughts, and faced with questions, either directly parrots the talking points handed to her by [Sen.] Chuck Schumer or she babbles incoherently and stares blankly into the camera as though she’s a freshman in high school struggling to remember the CliffsNotes after forgetting to read her homework assignment,” Dayspring told The Hill.""This degrading and offensive comment from McConnell's campaign team is appalling and he should condemn it immediately,"" Grimes spokeswoman Charly Norton told The Huffington Post. ""It shows his team's true feelings towards women and continues his disgraceful pattern of not standing up for the women of Kentucky. From misleading Kentuckians on his votes against the Violence Against Women Act, to voting against equal pay for equal work, Senator McConnell has failed to lead on issues important to women and their families.""""Republicans think a substance-free insult is the right way to deal with a qualified, popular woman challenger – at least their rhetoric is consistent with their anti-woman policies,"" said Jess McIntosh, communications director at EMILY's List, which endorsed Grimes.""The only surprising part of all this is the GOP’s continued unwillingness to understand that other women –- including Kentucky women -– can hear them when they say this stuff. It’s why women turned out in historic numbers for Democratic candidates last election, and it’s why we’ll see a repeat next November.""Grimes, Kentucky's secretary of state, has been hesitant to talk about policy specifics since she officially jumped into the 2014 Senate race. But she has pushed to raise the minimum wage, been vocal about her support for reproductive rights, and announced her intention to delay the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.“The president and I disagree on a lot of things,” she said in an August interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman. “Sen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.“Well, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen. McConnell is a Chippendale dancer.”This article was updated with comment from the Grimes campaign."

Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, on Friday.Rogers, whose committee is effectively short-circuited by the three-month stopgap bill, said almost nothing about the Affordable Care Act, but House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) made clear that the main point of the measure is to block the health care law.""This resolution will also protect the working middle class from the devastating effects of Obamacare,"" said Cantor. ""Let's defund this law now, and protect the American people from the economic calamity that we know Obamacare will create.""The vote marked the 42nd time that the House Republican conference has said yes to gutting Obamacare. While some tweaks have been made to the program, the Senate has ignored nearly everything the House has pushed for.Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.), who faces reelection in a district that Obama carried in 2012, was the only Republican to vote against the bill. Rigell has bucked his party on fiscal matters before; he appeared with the president at an event in February opposing sequestration and even took a ride aboard Air Force One.Rigell released a statement in which he said he agreed that Obamacare should be defunded, but couldn't support a bill that would set government spending levels at sequester levels.""This [continuing resolution] fails to address the sequester that is negatively impacting those who wear our nation’s uniform and is the result of Congress' inability to pass the 12 appropriations bills necessary to properly fund the government on time,"" Rigell said. ""What is needed is a comprehensive solution to our nation’s fiscal challenges, including a replacement for sequestration."" On the Democratic side, Reps. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.) were the only two lawmakers to vote in favor of the bill. The blue dog Democrats have often voted across party lines in the past.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) slammed the bill in a floor speech ahead of the vote, saying that the measure ""was designed to shut down the government.""""It could have no other intent. Its purpose is clear,"" Pelosi said. ""It is a wolf in wolf's clothing.""""Either you don't know what you are doing, or this is one of the most intentional acts of brutality that you have cooked up, with stiff competition for that honor,"" she added, while underscoring the damaging effects the bill would have on a program that provides health insurance to more than 8 million moderate-income children.The continuing resolution would not only permanently strip the Affordable Care Act of its funding, but would lock in government spending at sequester levels that conflict with the budget passed in the Senate. It also sets up another potentially even more consequential showdown over the nation's debt limit, by including the so-called Full Faith and Credit Act, a measure that Republicans say would allow the Treasury Department to still pay the nation's creditors, and therefore avoid a default, if the debt limit, now at $16.7 trillion, is not raised sometime next month.Democrats have dubbed that measure the ""Pay China First Act,"" pointing out that it would prioritize payments to U.S. bondholders, which include many foreign governments like China, while obligations such as Medicare and military benefits would be placed on the backburner.While leaders such as Cantor insisted that the legislation was responsible, many members of his own party, including more than a dozen senators, have called the move ""foolish"" and ""dumb.""Even Rogers seemed aware of the potential pitfalls of the stratagem.""I'd like to remind my colleagues … both in the House and the other body that a government shutdown is a political game in which everyone loses,"" Rogers said. ""It shirks one of our most basic duties as members of Congress, and it puts our national security at stake. To be clear, if this legislation is not enacted and we embark on a government shutdown, the consequences are severe.""""Our brave men and women in uniform don't get paid, our recovering economy will take a huge hit,"" he added. ""A government shutdown, even the illusion of the threat of a shutdown, says to the American people that this Congress does not have their best interests at heart.""This story has been updated with the names of those House lawmakers who did not vote with their party on the stopgap funding bill."
4213	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-reich/republicans-obamacare-distraction_b_4326249.html	Opinion	1	Republican Scandals	Healthcare	Neutral	Negative	huffingtonpost.com	"Having failed to defeat the Affordable Care Act in Congress, to beat it back in the last election, to repeal it despite more than 80 votes in the House, to stop it in the federal courts, to get enough votes in the Supreme Court to overrule it, and to gut it with outright extortion (closing the government and threatening to default on the nation's debts unless it was repealed), Republicans are now down to their last ploy.They are hell-bent on destroying the Affordable Care Act in Americans' minds.A document circulating among House Republicans (reported by the New York Times) instructs them to repeat the following themes and stories continuously: ""Because of Obamacare, I Lost My Insurance."" ""Obamacare Increases Health Care Costs."" ""The Exchanges May Not Be Secure, Putting Personal Information at Risk.""Every Republican in Washington has been programmed to use the word ""disaster"" whenever mentioning the Act, always refer to it as Obamacare, and demand its repeal.Republican wordsmiths know they can count on Fox News and right-wing yell radio to amplify and intensify all of this in continuous loops of elaboration and outrage, repeated so often as to infect peoples' minds like purulent pustules.The idea is to make the Act so detestable it becomes the fearsome centerpiece of the midterm elections of 2014 -- putting enough Democrats on the defensive they join in seeking its repeal or at least in amending it in ways that gut it (such as allowing insurers to sell whatever policies they want as long as they want, or delaying it further).Admittedly, the president provided Republicans ammunition by botching the Act's roll-out. Why wasn't HealthCare.gov up and running smoothly November 1? Partly because the Administration didn't anticipate that almost every Republican governor would refuse to set up a state exchange, thereby loading even more responsibility on an already over-worked and underfunded Department of Health and Human Services.Why didn't Obama's advisors anticipate that some policies would be cancelled (after all, the Act sets higher standards than many policies offered) and therefore his ""you can keep their old insurance"" promise would become a target? Likely because they knew all policies were ""grandfathered"" for a year, didn't anticipate how many insurers would cancel right away, and understood that only 5 percent of policyholders received insurance independent of an employer anyway.But there's really no good excuse. The White House should have anticipated the Republican attack machine.The real problem is now. The president and other Democrats aren't meeting the Republican barrage with three larger truths that show the pettiness of the attack:The wreck of private insurance. Ours has been the only health care system in the world designed to avoid sick people. For-profit insurers have spent billions finding and marketing their policies to healthy people -- young adults, people at low risk of expensive diseases, groups of professionals -- while rejecting people with preexisting conditions, otherwise debilitated, or at high risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. And have routinely dropped coverage of policy holders who become seriously sick or disabled. What else would you expect from corporations seeking to maximize profits?But the social consequences have been devastating. We have ended up with the most expensive healthcare system in the world (finding and marketing to healthy people is expensive, corporate executives are expensive, profits adequate to satisfy shareholders are expensive), combined with the worst health outcomes of all rich countries -- highest rates of infant mortality, shortest life spans, largest portions of populations never seeing a doctor and receiving no preventive care, most expensive uses of emergency rooms.We could not and cannot continue with this travesty of a healthcare system.The Affordable Care Act is a modest solution. It still relies on private insurers -- merely setting minimum standards and ""exchanges"" where customers can compare policies, requiring insurers to take people with preexisting conditions and not abandon those who get seriously sick, and helping low-income people afford coverage.A single-payer system would have been preferable. Most other rich countries do it this way. It could have been grafted on to Social Security and Medicare, paid for through payroll taxes, expanded to lower-income families through Medicaid. It would have been simple and efficient. (It's no coincidence that the Act's Medicaid expansion has been easy and rapid in states that chose to accept it.)But Republicans were dead set against this. They wouldn't even abide a ""public option"" to buy into something resembling Medicare. In the end, they wouldn't even go along with the Affordable Care Act, which was based on Republican ideas in the first place. (From Richard Nixon's healthcare plan through the musings of the Heritage Foundation, Republicans for years urged that everything be kept in the hands of private insurers but the government set minimum standards, create state-based insurance exchanges, and require everyone to sign up).The moral imperative. Even a clunky compromise like the ACA between a national system of health insurance and a for-profit insurance market depends, fundamentally, on a social compact in which those who are healthier and richer are willing to help those who are sicker and poorer. Such a social compact defines a society.The other day I heard a young man say he'd rather pay a penalty than buy health insurance under the Act because, in his words, ""why should I pay for the sick and the old?"" The answer is he has a responsibility to do so, as a member the same society they inhabit.The Act also depends on richer people paying higher taxes to finance health insurance for lower-income people. Starting this year, a healthcare surtax of 3.8 percent is applied to capital gains and dividend income of individuals earning more than $200,000 and a nine-tenths of 1 percent healthcare tax to wages over $200,000 or couples over $250,000. Together, the two taxes will raise an estimated $317.7 billion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Here again, the justification is plain: We are becoming a vastly unequal society in which most of the economic gains are going to the top. It's only just that those with higher incomes bear some responsibility for maintaining the health of Americans who are less fortunate.This is a profoundly moral argument about who we are and what we owe each other as Americans. But Democrats have failed to make it, perhaps because they're reluctant to admit that the Act involves any redistribution at all.Redistribution has become so unfashionable it's easier to say everyone comes out ahead. And everyone does come out ahead in the long term: Even the best-off will gain from a healthier and more productive workforce, and will save money from preventive care that reduces the number of destitute people using emergency rooms when they become seriously ill.But there would be no reason to reform and extend health insurance to begin with if we did not have moral obligations to one another as members of the same society.The initial problems with the website and the president's ill-advised remark about everyone being able to keep their old policies are real. But they're trifling compared to the wreckage of the current system, the modest but important step toward reform embodied in the Act, and the moral imperative at the core of the Act and of our society. The Republicans have created a tempest out of trivialities. It is incumbent on Democrats -- from the president on down -- to show Americans the larger picture, and do so again and again.ROBERT B.

In as little as 10 years, experts who watched the ivory crushed said, trinkets like those could bring about the extinction of elephants.""What was once a local or regional problem has become a global crisis,"" said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director Daniel Ashe. ""How will we answer the question when our grandchildren ask why there are no elephants remaining in the wild? Will they be proud of us when we say it was more important to own beautiful things than for beautiful things to roam in spectacular places?""The condemnation of ""blood ivory"" supports an executive order by President Barack Obama to fight wildlife trafficking. The event also marked the first time in U.S. history that such a large quantity of ivory, stockpiled over 25 years, was destroyed, although selling ivory within the U.S. remains legal. ""We hear a lot about China, and concerns about the trade there are warranted, but the fact is, the United States is the second-largest market for ivory in the world,"" President and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States Wayne Pacelle said in a statement. ""Ivory trade laws in the U.S. are riddled with loopholes ... and smugglers take advantage of this deficiency.""A September report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence says the illicit ivory trade has grown to $10 billion and is now a major resource to fund crime and terrorism. Reports said activists claim elephant poaching helped finance al-Shabaab, the Somali terrorist group that recently attacked Kenya's Westgate mall. Poaching also has grown increasingly brutal. Earlier this year, poachers reportedly used cyanide to kill 300 African elephants for their tusks, and some have used night-vision goggles and AK-47s. African elephants have returned to the brink of extinction after an increase in poaching. According to a recent report by the National Intelligence Council, wildlife trafficking has doubled since 2007 and just last year, about 30,000 African elephants were slaughtered -- the most since the United Nations-backed Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) issued an ivory ban in 1989. CITES relaxed the ban in 1997, however, to allow limited sales of ivory in Zimbabwe and later China. According to Peter Knights, the executive director of WildAid, relaxing the ban resulted in ""disaster"" and destroying the ivory is the best thing to do.""People need to understand that this is as heinous a crime as consumption of heroin,"" Knights said. ""We don’t put heroin back on the market after we seize it, so this [crush] is the right thing to do. I think people who say otherwise are people who [support] this theory of legal supply, which we tried for 20 years, they fiddled with it and it was a disaster and we tried it with another release into China and that was a disaster, too, so you have to look at history and you have to learn its lesson."""

However, this has yet to happen.Jamaica Anti-Homophobia Stand reportedly wants Jamaica to legalize homosexuality.Protestors shouted “Gay rights are human rights!” and “Portia, shame on you!” as the Prime Minister came out of the building, blew a kiss at the group, and returned inside.Since its branding as the ""most homophobic place on earth"" in 2006 by Time magazine, Jamaica has gained international media attention surrounding its treatment of LGBT citizens. The country still operates under an ""abominable crime"" law of buggery that punishes sex between two men or two women with up to ten years of hard labor. As a result, LGBT Jamaicans live enshrouded within a culture of fear and violence, largely driven by the homophobic attitudes their friends and neighbors are raised to embody.Earlier this summer, five gay men were trapped and barricaded in their home by members of their village after an ""alleged homosexual man... made statements that made them gravely concerned."" Additionally, a mob attempted to attack two men following a minor car accident because they perceived them to be gay, forcing the men to take refuge in a police station.Increasingly violent instances of anti-LGBT sentiment have also plagued Jamaica, with an openly gay man having allegedly been stabbed to death and his house burned with his body inside late one evening. The anti-LGBT violence pervading the country has sparked not only international outrage, put protests against Jamaica's homophobic climate. Though coverage of anti-LGBT violence in the country is sparse and limited, smaller news outlets have sprung up, enabling those outside of the nation to gain a perspective surrounding the lives of LGBT Jamaicans.For updates on anti-LGBT violence in Jamaica, follow Jamaica LGBT News and Jamaica Anti-Homophobia Stand on Facebook.Jamaica Anti-Homophobia Stand is reportedly planning another protest on Saturday, Sept. 28 at the United Nations Plaza.(h/t JMG)Check out photos of the protest, courtesy of Clayton Carr, below: "

4437	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/murray-lipp/the-top-10-arguments-agai_b_3337249.html	Opinion	1	Gay Rights	International News	Positive	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"Both in the U.S.A. and internationally the marriage equality movement is gaining momentum. Accordingly, more and more people are starting to acknowledge the flawed nature of all arguments which oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage. This article discusses 10 of the most common positions presented by opponents of marriage equality and outlines why each deserves a failing grade.1. Nature: ""It's Not Natural"" (FAIL) The most basic argument presented by gay marriage opponents purports that marriage between two people of the same sex is ""not natural"" and is in violation of the ""natural order."" At this level of the debate there is very little exploration of the inherent validity (or otherwise) of same-sex marriage but rather a fixation on the notion that homosexuality is unnatural: ""It's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,"" the opponents quip. In reality, marriage is a societal institution. The natural world didn't create marriage, humans did. Nature-themed arguments against gay marriage say little about the societal institution of marriage but reveal a lot about the homophobia and heterosexism of those who present such arguments. In this regard, the disapproval isn't about gay marriage per se -- it's more about discomfort with homosexuality, period.2. Procreation: ""Marriage is for Procreation"" (FAIL) With the procreation argument, opponents of equality argue that the institution of marriage is essentially in place to assist with procreation and the raising of children. They reason that because two people of the same sex cannot procreate that they should not be allowed to marry. While the production of children may indeed be a feature of many heterosexual marriages the capacity to procreate does not determine the legal validity of such marriages. There are many married straight couples who cannot biologically have children or who choose not to. The procreation argument ignores the fact that people marry for a wide range of reasons unrelated to procreation including love, friendship and companionship.3. Religion: ""It's Against My Religion"" (FAIL)   Christianity-based arguments lead the way in efforts to oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage in America. References to the Bible, the ""sinful"" nature of homosexuality, and ""religious beliefs"" are regularly made by those who seek to rationalize their support of discrimination via religion. Marriage is a religious institution, they argue, and not one for society to tamper with. Given that the U.S.A. is a secular nation, religion should play no role in any discussion about civil and societal laws. In order to legally marry there is absolutely no requirement for a religious ceremony to be held. In this sense, marriage is not a religious institution but a socio-legal one governed by the state. Religious beliefs about marriage should never be enshrined in laws in ways that restrict the freedom of others who do not share those beliefs.4. Redefinition: ""You're Trying to Redefine the Institution"" (FAIL)Opponents argue that marriage has always been between a man and a woman and that it should stay that way. They say that efforts to legalize same-sex marriage will fundamentally alter the institution for the worse. History reveals, however, that marriage laws in the U.S.A. and in countries across the globe have been modified repeatedly in response to evolving cultural norms. There was a time when women were the legal property of their husbands. There was a time when a man and a woman of different races couldn't marry each other. There was even a time when not one country in the world had legalized same-sex marriage! Removing discrimination from the institution of marriage does not redefine ""marriage"" -- it simply makes the institution more accessible and reflects the evolution of society.5. Sanctity: ""It's a Threat to the Sanctity of (Opposite-Sex) Marriage"" (FAIL)With roots in religion, the sanctity argument posits that marriage is a ""sacred"" institution that only heterosexual couples should have access to. Allowing same-sex couples to marry apparently poses a ""threat"" to ""traditional marriage"" as though somehow heterosexual married couples will all be at risk of divorcing when two people of the same sex marry each other. If those who use the ""sanctity"" argument were genuinely concerned about the institution of marriage they'd focus their efforts on helping those straight married couples who are at risk of divorcing. If marriage was so ""sacred"" they'd also be pursuing the outlawing of heterosexual divorce. They do neither of these things. The only married straight couples impacted by the legalization of gay marriage are those in which one of the parties is a closet-case gay person who dreams of coming out and marrying someone of the same sex!6. Children: ""It Will Harm the Children"" (FAIL)Opponents of equality frequently make use of flawed research studies to insinuate that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow harm children. They argue that children need a ""mom and a dad"" in order to flourish in life and that legalizing same-sex marriage denies children this opportunity of ""normalcy."" Multiple studies across the social sciences have repeatedly demonstrated that there is no difference in psychosocial outcomes between children raised by opposite-sex couples and those raised by same-sex couples. There is no evidence that children are psychologically harmed by having two dads or two moms. The American Psychological Association (APA), the American Sociological Association (ASA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has each endorsed the legalization of same-sex marriage and its capacity to provide a stable familial framework for children. 7. Reverse Discrimination: ""Religious People Will Be Discriminated Against"" (FAIL)Some opponents of marriage equality describe a future in which religious people become the new ""victims"" of oppression. They talk of charity-based religious organizations being ""forced out of business"" for ""sticking to their beliefs"" about marriage. In this reverse scenario, gay people are apparently ""hateful"" for wanting to be treated equally in society. How dare we demand equal rights and criticize those who discriminate against us! In no state of the U.S.A. in which gay marriage is legal is a church legally required to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. Religious groups and churches are still free to pick and choose who they will and won't marry. Organizations that receive public money, however, and which must adhere to anti-discrimination laws, should rightly be challenged if they engage in discrimination against a protected class of people. 8. Slippery Slope: ""It Will Lead to Marriage Involving Animals, Siblings, Children, or Groups of People!"" (FAIL)Slippery slopes arguments suggest that legalizing gay marriage will serve as a ""gateway"" for the legalization of marriage involving animals, siblings, children, or groups of people. People who present these scenarios portray a catastrophic future with society crumbling under the weight of rampant immorality and social discord. Efforts to legalize same-sex marriage, however, simply aim to provide same-sex couples with equal access to marriage laws -- there is no intention to change the fundamental definition of marriage as the legal union between two adult human beings who have no direct biological connection with each other. Facts are useful in this regard: of the fifteen countries and 12 U.S. states that have legalized same-sex marriage, none of them has subsequently legalized marriage involving animals, children, siblings, or groups of people.9. Civil Unions: ""Civil Unions Are Good Enough"" (FAIL)Some opponents of same-sex marriage support the creation of a ""separate but equal"" platform in which straight couples and gay couples receive the same relationship rights and benefits, but from within different institutional frameworks. They argue that ""marriage"" should be left exclusively for opposite-sex couples and that same-sex couples should be granted ""civil unions."" History has demonstrated that this ""separate but equal"" approach doesn't work. Various countries and American states which initially permitted ""civil unions"" for same-sex couples have subsequently enacted marriage equality legislation. These jurisdictions have pursued such changes because civil union legislation, no matter how valiant the effort, is not able to provide the same rights and benefits as legal marriage. In essence, having a two-class system continues to maintain the erroneous notion that one group (straight people) is more superior to another group (LGBT people). 10. States' Rights: ""States Have the Right to Oppose It"" (FAIL) This position stresses that states have a constitutional right to make their own decisions about the legalization of same-sex marriage which may include banning it. Ironically, most advocates of this argument also support the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law which allows the federal government to deny more than one thousand federal rights and benefits to same-sex couples legally married at the state level. The maintenance of a system which allows some states to recognize same-sex marriage and others not to, and which allows the federal government to ignore legal same-sex marriages performed at the state level, sets up a cumbersome and extremely complicated national map of unequal rights and legal nightmares. Those who support a ""states' rights"" approach to same-sex marriage should at least be consistent and drop their support of a federal government act (DOMA) which essentially tramples states' rights.Conclusion: Marriage Equality is the Future -- Embrace it! There is no logical or reasonable basis for denying same-sex couples access to secular marriage laws. Opposing the inevitable (marriage equality) is a waste of time, money and energy. I urge all of those who oppose gay marriage to start focusing on their own lives, to accept that they don't need to marry a person of the same sex, and to recognize the right of all Americans to be treated equally under the law: ""liberty and justice for all"" should not come with a disclaimer.(A longer version of the above article is available at the GMUSA blog.

The 18-page document, known as Presidential Policy Directive 20, aims ""to put in place tools and a framework to enable government to make decisions"" on cyber actions, a senior administration official told the Guardian. The directive states that cyber attacks can be launched as part of ""anticipatory action taken against imminent threats,"" but should comply with U.S. and international law and receive approval from the president if they are ""reasonably likely to result in significant consequences,"" according to the Guardian. The memo is the latest sign that the Obama administration is laying the groundwork to retaliate in a potential cyber conflict. Earlier this year, Gen. Keith Alexander, who runs the Pentagon's Cyber Command, told Congress he is establishing ""an offensive team"" of 13 teams of experts to carry out cyberattacks against foreign countries that target the United States with destructive computer code.President Barack Obama has directed the United States, along with Israel, to launch a series of cyber attacks known as Stuxnet that damaged Iran's nuclear program, according to The New York Times. Last year, the Washington Post reported on Plan X, a Pentagon effort to develop new technologies to launch cyber attacks, including a plan to map the entirety of cyberspace and build a system that can launch cyberweapons without human operators typing in the code.But while the U.S. takes steps to build its offensive cyber muscle, its digital defenses remain weak, officials say. Last month, the deputy inspector for the Department of Homeland Security told a Congressional committee that the nation's critical infrastructure ""are increasingly under attack by a variety of malicious sources,"" and that a majority of the companies in the energy sector had experienced cyber attacks."

Thousands of citizens, virtually all of them Sunni Muslims, have been gathering in public squares to protest the oppressive Shiite-led government in Baghdad. Sleeping in tents and wielding Twitter feeds and YouTube accounts, the young Sunnis have attempted to take democracy, and a certain sectarian disaffection, into their own hands.It's not quite the Iraqi Arab Spring -- although that's what it's been tentatively called by some -- but it is a reminder of the stark failure of nearly a decade of American-led warfare in that country.When President George W. Bush announced the invasion into Iraq in March 2003, the goal was to remove a dangerous dictator and his supposed stocks of weapons of mass destruction. It was also to create a functioning democracy and thereby inspire what Bush called a ""global democracy revolution.""The effort was supposed to be cheap -- to require few troops and even less time. Instead, it cost the United States $800 billion at least, thousands of lives and nearly nine grueling years (see the graphic below for a further breakdown of various costs). The toll on the people of Iraq were even greater. A decade of war left chaos and impoverishment, hundreds of thousands of citizens dead and millions more displaced, and a vicious sectarianism that still threatens to rip the country apart at the seams. The government of Nouri al-Maliki, which has reportedly interfered with independent government bureaucracies and ordered the arrest of his Sunni vice president on trumped-up terrorism charges, often rules in a manner more befitting the autocrat the U.S. invaded to remove. ""Here is a country that's being liberated,"" proclaimed Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a few days into the invasion, even as the first signs of the chaos to come began to stir. ""Here are people that are going from being repressed and held under the thumb of a vicious dictator, and they're free.""Instead, today in Fallujah, the site of two of the war's largest and most devastating military campaigns, the very best that can be said is that two years late to the party -- not 10 years early -- the Arab Spring has arrived. But the government the people are rising up against is the very one the U.S. installed.What does it mean to say that the war in Iraq was a wasted effort? Last month, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction filed a final report that found $8 billion of U.S. development aid had been ""wasted outright,"" in the words of Wired magazine.But nearly eight times as much money -- $60 billion -- was spent rebuilding the country on the whole, with very little to show for it. And more than 10 times that amount -- $800 billion -- was spent on the mission overall, a boondoggle that left more than 4,000 American service members dead, 32,000 more wounded, and an authoritarian government in place that is little better -- and possibly, owing to its closer ties to Iran, worse -- than the one that was taken out. Was any of that money wasted? Was any of it not?"

Just like with the Guardian and the Washington Post, I only work with journalists,"" he said in response to a question from The Guardian's Spencer Ackerman.Responding to a similar query, Snowden painted the spy allegations as an attempt to destroy his character:This is a predictable smear that I anticipated before going public, as the US media has a knee-jerk ""RED CHINA!"" reaction to anything involving HK or the PRC, and is intended to distract from the issue of US government misconduct. Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.Snowden also appeared defiant in the face of calls for his prosecution.""The U.S. government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped,"" he said. He added the government ""immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home,"" by labeling him a traitor, and indicated he would not return to the U.S. voluntarily.Congressional leaders have called Snowden a traitor for revealing once-secret surveillance programs two weeks ago in the Guardian and The Washington Post. The National Security Agency programs collect records of millions of Americans' telephone calls and Internet usage as a counterterror tool. The disclosures revealed the scope of the collections, which surprised many Americans and have sparked debate about how much privacy the government can take away in the name of national security.""It would be foolish to volunteer yourself to"" possible arrest and criminal charges ""if you can do more good outside of prison than in it,"" he said.The Guardian announced its website was hosting an online chat with Snowden, in hiding in Hong Kong, with reporter Glenn Greenwald receiving and posting his questions. The Associated Press couldn't independently verify that the man answering the questions was indeed Snowden.Snowden was working as a contractor for NSA at the time he had access to the then-secret programs. He defended his actions and said he considered what to reveal and what not to, saying he did not reveal any U.S. operations against what he called legitimate military targets, but instead showed the NSA is hacking civilian infrastructure like universities and private businesses.""These nakedly, aggressively criminal acts are wrong no matter the target. Not only that, when NSA makes a technical mistake during an exploitation operation, critical systems crash,"" he said, though he gave no examples of what systems have crashed or in which countries.""Congress hasn't declared war on the countries – the majority of them are our allies – but without asking for public permission, NSA is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people,"" he said. ""And for what? So we can have secret access to a computer in a country we're not even fighting?""Snowden was referring to PRISM, one of the programs he disclosed. The program sweeps up Internet usage data from all over the world that goes through nine major U.S.-based Internet providers. The NSA can look at foreign usage without any warrants, and says the program doesn't target Americans.U.S. officials say the data-gathering programs are legal and operated under secret court supervision.Snowden explained his claim that from his desk, he could ""wiretap"" any phone call or email – a claim top intelligence officials have denied. ""If an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw SIGINT (signals intelligence) databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want,"" he wrote in the answer posted on the Guardian site. ""Phone number, email, user id, cell phone handset id (IMEI), and so on – it's all the same.""The NSA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. But Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that the kind of data that can be accessed and who can access it is severely limited.Snowden said the restrictions on what could be seen by an individual analyst vary according to policy changes, which can happen ""at any time,"" and said that a technical ""filter"" on NSA data gathering meant to filter out U.S. communications is ""weak,"" such that U.S. communications often get ingested.Snowden defended U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning for his disclosures of documents to Wikileaks, which he called a ""legitimate journalistic outlet,"" which ""carefully redacted all of their releases in accordance with a judgment of public interest."" He said the Wikileaks release of unredacted material was ""due to the failure of a partner journalist to control a passphrase,"" which led to the charge against Manning that he dumped the documents, which Snowden called an attempt to smear Manning.Manning is currently on trial at Fort Meade – the same Army base where the NSA is headquartered – on charges of aiding the enemy for releasing documents to Wikileaks.Snowden defended his description of his salary as being $200,000 a year, calling that a ""career high,"" but saying he did take a pay cut to take the job at Booz Allen Hamilton, where he worked as a contractor at an NSA facility in Hawaii. When Booz Allen fired him, they said his salary was $122,000.__On the web:Follow Associated Press reporter Kimberly Dozier on Twitter at http://twitter.com/kimberlydozier"

(And, no, France and Australia do not constitute enough.)Only those who have forgotten how the United States and its allies wound up in a catastrophic war in Iraq could now charge toward military confrontation with Syria, absent a clear and credible annunciation of the intelligence that supposedly ties Bashar Assad's government to the chemical weapons attack, and without an agreed upon plan for how to handle the potential repercussions. Yes, the Syria conflict of today and the Iraqi misadventure undertaken a decade ago present two different circumstances, as many experts have already emphasized. Iraq was in no way related to the incident that -- at least publicly -- provoked the American-led war, the attacks of Sept. 11 delivered by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda partners-in-terrorism. In Syria, Assad has for years been meting out horrific brutality on those who oppose him, with visibly lethal consequences. The crime for which he now stands accused fits a pattern.Where the case for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was manufactured from the beginning, the likelihood that Assad's government really was responsible for the chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb appears far more plausible.And where the government of George W. Bush was palpably intent on waging a broad and transformational military campaign against longtime enemies in the wake of Sept. 11, President Barack Obama could not be more reluctant to take on the battle before him. He made his name as the man who opposed the Iraq war from inception. He has finally charted a course out of the companion disaster in Afghanistan.But in one crucial regard, the rush to strike Syria is indeed reminiscent of the ill-fated march into Iraq: It would undermine the very thing it is premised on defending -- international norms and a supposed code of decency.Put aside the bloviating about spreading freedom and democracy that accompanied the plunge into Iraq and go back to the narrative that sold the campaign -- the bogus intelligence that then-Secretary of State Colin Powell shared with the U.N. in seeking its blessing for the war: Iraq was a threat to the community of nations. Its very existence raised the prospect of mushroom clouds, as Bush's national security adviser at the time Condoleeza Rice famously intoned. That was nonsense, a fact that needs no rehash here. Iraq's then-President Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction. Even if he had, using them against the U.S. or a regional ally would have amounted to suicide -- the sort of basic common sense understanding that had enabled Saddam to endure for decades.And now here is Obama, declaring in a television interview with PBS, that part of the reason Americans ought to fear Syria is that ""chemical weapons that can have devastating effects could be directed at us.""Let us generously assume that this is merely unfortunate rhetoric, the usual fear-mongering employed by a commander in chief needing to prepare a dubious public that a now-inevitable military strike is in the national interest. The realpolitik conversation has it that the strike has two aims: to make clear that American dictates are to be taken seriously -- in this case, Obama's delineation of a red line barring chemical weapons -- and to reinforce an international agreement making such means beyond the pale.Both of these supposed aims would be ill-served by a strike on Syria absent the active assent and support of other actors around the globe, and not least the U.N.Making a case for a strike based on the first of these two notions, David Ignatius puts it this way in a column in The Washington Post: ""What does the world look like when people begin to doubt the credibility of U.S. power? Unfortunately, we're finding that out in Syria and other nations where leaders have concluded they can defy a war-weary United States without paying a price.""But that's an idea that urgently needs updating, a frame that retains greatest currency only in the place of its minting -- Washington. In much of the world, governments and peoples fundamentally inclined to casting their lot with the U.S. have spent much of the past decade assaulted by realities that challenge those proclivities. And this is hardly of help to the narrow American interest or broader multinational concerns. A self-appointed global cop seen as morally reprobate, hypocritical and dismissive of the laws it is supposed to enforce does no favors to stability or security, let alone loftier aspirations like justice and progress on problems like climate change. Begin with the ill-conceived, poorly executed post-war occupation of Iraq, and the torture of combatants there in American-run military prisons. Consider the kidnapping of suspected militants by American authorities on streets of multiple cities, and the detention of the people seized in the cells of Guantanamo, a festering sore on the American image as moral authority. Contemplate the drone strikes unleashed by a superpower on villagers stuck in places that constitute venues for a nominal global war on terror. These are not realities that will simply be forgotten by the intended audience for the military strikes in Syria, those powers who are supposed to deduce that international norms are really operative. You can't run torture prisons one day and the next day all but unilaterally unleash missile strikes as moral curative without being seen as a less-than-honest broker among the very community of nations in whose name you act. You need a coalition, backing from the U.N. And if you don't get those things, taking action may well be worse than no action at all.Obama must surely understand this as deeply as anyone. At home, his presidency traces its existence to American revulsion over the parochial, faith-based, fact-free reign of his predecessor. Around the world, his embrace as a moral authority -- his Nobel Peace Prize! -- reflects a deep sense of relief that the reckless cowboy who occupied the White House before had been replaced by a thoughtful, sophisticated person with international experience and respect for other cultures and values.The standard for the legitimacy of a strike on Syria ought to be very high -- high enough to require a clear motive and objective, and a demonstrably shared plan of action among a multitude of global actors. But the U.N is missing. The Arab League is missing. Even Great Britain is now on the sidelines. It is fair to shame and pressure these powers to go along. It may be imperative. But failing to curry such support does not constitute justification for going it almost alone.If the objective is indeed defending international norms, how can one justify a strike authorized only by the U.S. and two stalwart allies? If this is about international law, how can one countenance rushing ahead before the U.N. inspectors complete their work and issue a report? If this is really about justice, is there no place for due process and critical scrutiny of the intelligence before letting loose with lethal power?And let us not kid ourselves in the face of a concerted rhetoric effort by the Obama administration to downgrade what is really unfolding. We hear of narrow limited strikes, targeted surgical procedures, and it's as if robots will reach into Syria, avoid all the people, and defang the military capabilities of the Assad regime. But what is being prepared -- by most accounts a two-day bombardment of Syrian installations with cruise missiles fired from American destroyers -- is an act of war. It may well prove to be a justified act of war, provided it is supported by a community of nations and based on credible intelligence. But war is what this is.War, it ought to go without saying, is a risky, unpredictable pursuit. You fire missiles at another country and people will die. If we have learned anything from the past decade, it's that military campaigns have unintended consequences. We could miss the intended targets or learn that the things we were aiming at had other uses than those we understood. We could provoke a strike on Israel from Iran. We could incite unforeseen violence from the Assad regime. And when one of those things happens and some fresh hell breaks loose, genuine moral leadership capable of speaking for international norms had best be supported by more than a couple of far-flung allies going along on a ride that has not been adequately mapped out.For Obama, this poorly sold, as-yet ill-defined intervention into another seething conflict in the Middle East presents grave risks: He could wind up representing the sort of American power defined by his predecessor, the shoot first-contemplate later mode of operation that has served no interests beyond the Islamist militants for whom such violence functions as a valuable recruiting aid."

The 18-page document, known as Presidential Policy Directive 20, aims ""to put in place tools and a framework to enable government to make decisions"" on cyber actions, a senior administration official told the Guardian. The directive states that cyber attacks can be launched as part of ""anticipatory action taken against imminent threats,"" but should comply with U.S. and international law and receive approval from the president if they are ""reasonably likely to result in significant consequences,"" according to the Guardian. The memo is the latest sign that the Obama administration is laying the groundwork to retaliate in a potential cyber conflict. Earlier this year, Gen. Keith Alexander, who runs the Pentagon's Cyber Command, told Congress he is establishing ""an offensive team"" of 13 teams of experts to carry out cyberattacks against foreign countries that target the United States with destructive computer code.President Barack Obama has directed the United States, along with Israel, to launch a series of cyber attacks known as Stuxnet that damaged Iran's nuclear program, according to The New York Times. Last year, the Washington Post reported on Plan X, a Pentagon effort to develop new technologies to launch cyber attacks, including a plan to map the entirety of cyberspace and build a system that can launch cyberweapons without human operators typing in the code.But while the U.S. takes steps to build its offensive cyber muscle, its digital defenses remain weak, officials say. Last month, the deputy inspector for the Department of Homeland Security told a Congressional committee that the nation's critical infrastructure ""are increasingly under attack by a variety of malicious sources,"" and that a majority of the companies in the energy sector had experienced cyber attacks."

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of the few public officials sympathetic toward Edward Snowden, warned the national security leaker on Sunday not to cut deals or cozy up to any government at the risk of losing credibility. ""I do think, for Mr. Snowden, if he cozies up to the Russian government, it will be nothing but bad for his name in history,"" said Paul on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""If he goes to an independent third country like Iceland and if he refuses to talk to any sort of formal government about this, I think there's a chance that he'll be seen as an advocate of privacy. If he cozies up to either the Russian government, the Chinese government, or any of these governments that are perceived still as enemies of ours, I think that will be a real problem for him in history.""Paul's comments came in the midst of a hectic Sunday morning in which Snowden left Hong Kong despite requests from the U.S. Justice Department that that government turn him over for prosecution. Snowden is being charged under the Espionage Act for leaking details of U.S. intelligence operations to various news outlets, mainly the Guardian. Hong Kong officials declined to do so, saying that the extradition request did not fully comply with its law. By the time Paul spoke to CNN, Snowden was reportedly on a plane that had just landed in Moscow. CNN was carrying a live stream of the passenger arrival area in the Moscow airport. Paul has been one of a few public officials to praise Snowden for leaking material on the National Security Agency's surveillance operations. And despite warning Snowden not to work with the Russian or Chinese governments, Paul continued on Sunday to argue that history would judge the leaks kindly. ""I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn't lied to anyone,"" said Paul. ""He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution, and he believes that, when James Clapper came in March, our national director of intelligence came and lied, that he [Snowden] was simply coming forward and telling the truth that your government was lying. This is a big concern of mine, because it makes me doubt the administration and their word to us when they talk to us, because they have now admitted they will lie to us if they think it is in the name of national security."""

""I'm not asking you to take my word for it, read for yourself.""But while the report assessed with ""high confidence"" that the Syrian government had used a nerve agent in the Aug. 21 attack, which U.S. intelligence believes killed at least 1,429 people including 426 children, it stopped short of conclusively demonstrating that Syrian President Bashar Assad himself, as opposed to a more junior officer, had ordered it. Details on what led the intelligence community to its conclusion were slim in the unclassified version of the report released to the public.""We know that for three days before the attack, the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area, making preparations,"" Kerry said.The preparations included, he said, putting on gas masks.""This is what Assad did to his own people,"" Kerry said. If the US and world allowed ""a thug and a murderer like Bashar al-Assad"" to get away with gassing his own people, he added, ""there will be no end to the test of our resolve and the dangers that will flow from those others who believe that they can do as they will.""“We do assess that [Assad] is the decision-maker, and that he's ultimately in charge of deployment,” a senior administration official said in a conference call with reporters on Friday afternoon.The only question remaining in the aftermath of the chemical attack, Kerry said, was, ""what are we and the world going to do about it?"" Presumably referencing a ""red line"" that President Barack Obama drew last August on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, Kerry also said the United States had to act because its credibility and interests were on the line.“Our intelligence community has carefully reviewed and re-reviewed the information regarding this attack,” Kerry said on Friday. “It has done so more than mindful of the Iraq experience, and we will not repeat that moment.”Over the past week, a series of intelligence community leaks have indicated that the evidence behind the chemical attack -- and specifically the question of what role Assad himself played in ordering it -- remains relatively weak. In an Associated Press report on Thursday, one government official was quoted as saying the data was “no slam dunk.”""It's unclear where control lies,"" another U.S. intelligence official told Foreign Policy earlier in the week. ""Is there just some sort of general blessing to use these things? Or are there explicit orders for each attack?""The release by the Obama administration on Friday sought to address those intelligence gaps, although it did not offer specific data on the link between Assad and the attack. Instead, it focused on circumstantial indications: the fact that the chemical-laden rockets were all fired from regime-held areas into rebel-held ones, and an intercepted communication from a senior regime official that apparently confirmed the use of the weapons.The Syrian government's motivation for launching a massive chemical weapons strike that was sure to cross Obama's ""red line"" remained unclear.The intelligence assessment said the regime's ""frustration"" with its inability to clear swaths of the Damascus suburbs home to opposition forces ""may have"" contributed to its decision. Independent analysts were puzzled by the Syrian move, with some suggesting it could have been a mistake by a lower-ranking official.The Obama administration's findings closely mirror those in a similar brief released Thursday by British intelligence just before the U.K. parliament voted down Prime Minister David Cameron's bid to have the country take part in a strike against Syria, by a vote of 285-272.It was a stunning defeat for Cameron, who acknowledged after the vote that ""the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action"" and said that the government would ""act accordingly.""The British assessment concluded that it was “highly likely” that the Syrian regime had been behind the attacks, and that there was “no credible intelligence or other evidence” to support allegations that other forces, such as the rebels themselves, might have carried them out. But it also acknowledged having limited insight into the regime's “precise motivation” for using chemical weapons, particularly at a moment when United Nations chemical-weapons inspectors were staying at a hotel just miles away.The British parliament's rejection of military action in Syria sparked questions on whether the U.S. would ""fly solo"" in its operation, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel also refused her government's assistance for airstrikes in Syria. But French President Francois Hollande expressed his willingness Friday to proceed with plans to strike Syria over its use of chemical weapons. ""The chemical massacre of Damascus cannot and must not remain unpunished,"" Hollande said.The administration's intelligence brief was designed to assuage the concerns of both the public and a deeply uneasy Congress. Polls indicate that the American public is highly skeptical of launching a strike on Syria without congressional backing.Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have urged the president to hold more consultations with members of Congress and not act unilaterally. Many Republicans, joined by a growing number of Democrats, have demanded a vote in Congress to authorize the use of military force.While the White House is unlikely to seek congressional approval, the administration stepped up its deliberations with lawmakers Thursday. Obama called House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), whose office followed up with a statement calling on the president to provide a more robust explanation to both members of Congress and the American public.Top administration officials also held a 90-minute conference call Thursday evening with congressional leaders and the chairs and ranking members of national security committees. During the call, lawmakers were briefed on the administration's approach and rationale for military involvement by Kerry, national security advisor Susan Rice, defense secretary Chuck Hagel, director of national intelligence James Clapper, and Sandy Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said after the call that he would support ""surgical, proportional military strikes,"" but the administration ""would be far better off if they seek [congressional] authorization.""Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, told The Huffington Post that members of Congress who sit on the relevant intelligence committees have ""been continually supplied with classified info.""She added that they will receive the classified version of Friday's chemical weapons assessment ""at some point today,"" and that the administration will hold classified briefings for its staff this afternoon.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a statement on the Thursday briefing in which she said Assad had acted ""outside the realm of basic human rights."" But she added that she agreed with Boehner and other members that the administration must engage in further consultation with Congress and provide greater transparency into the decision-making process and timing.""The case needs to be made to the American people,"" Pelosi said. ""It is clear that the American people are weary of war.""UPDATE: 2:50 p.m. -- Obama addressed reporters at the White House later on Friday, emphasizing that he had not made any decisions about what actions the U.S. will take against Syria but adding that he is considering a ""limited narrow act.""""We're not considering any open ended commitment,"" Obama said. ""We're not considering any boots on the ground approach.""""We are looking at the possibility of a limited, narrow act that would help make sure that not only Syria but others around the world understand that the international community cares about maintaining this chemical weapons ban,"" he said. ""I have not made a final decision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm, but as I've already said, I have had my military and our team look at a wide range of options. We have consulted with allies. We've consulted with Congress.""The president acknowledged that many people, including himself, are ""war weary.""""There is a certain weariness, given Afghanistan. There is a certain suspicion of any military action post-Iraq,"" Obama said, adding that he appreciated the skepticism. ""It’s important for us to recognize that when over a thousand people are killed, including hundreds of innocent children, through the use of a weapon that 98 or 99 percent of humanity says should not be used even in war, and there is no action, then we’re sending a signal … that is a danger to our national security.""Matt Sledge reported from New York, Sabrina Siddiqui reported from Washington, D.C., and Joshua Hersh reported from Beirut, Lebanon."

Snowden revealed his identity in a Guardian piece published on Sunday. After approaching the media with bombshell revelations about the NSA's secret programs, he left the United States for Hong Kong and holed himself up in a hotel room for three weeks.The Washington Post reported that a guest by the name of Edward Snowden had been staying at the Mira Hotel, but checked out Monday. It is unclear whether Snowden is still in Hong Kong. Hong Kong-based correspondents have been trying to hunt him down, staking out a number of hotels that matched the description Snowden gave to the Guardian. The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill reported that ""media scrums"" were forming at hotels in the city, while USA Today described the search as a ""media manhunt."" Snowden told the Guardian that he chose Hong Kong as a refuge for its ""spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent."" In an interview with the Associated Press, The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald said that Snowden fled to Hong Kong because he ""doesn't really trust the judicial system in the United States to give him a fair trial."" The revelation, however, has sparked speculation about whether his choice was a wise one. The current treaty between Hong Kong and the U.S. guarantees extradition unless China believes that doing so would hurt ""defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy"" — an exception that some experts say is rare. The New York Times reported Monday that the government is ""seen as likely to extradite"" Snowden if the U.S. requests it to do so, while New York magazine's Joe Coscarelli predicted that China will do what is necessary to avoid a ""diplomatic crisis."" The New Yorker's Evan Osnos also questioned Snowden's choice, writing that ""going to Hong Kong out of devotion to free speech is a bit like going to Tibet out of a devotion to Buddhism; the people love it, though they live under authorities who intervene when they choose."" Other experts imagined some scenarios where Snowden might be granted asylum. The Global Post's Benjamin Carlson also reported that Hong Kong is currently changing its procedure for reviewing applications for asylum, which might work in Snowden's favor if asylum seekers are allowed to stay in the city until a new procedure is put in place. Ironically, a full-page ad in Monday's New York Times touted ""the Hong Kong advantage"" when it comes to business opportunities in the city. ABC News editor Jon Williams tweeted a picture, writing, ""Ed Snowden hoping so."""

Bradley Manning.Assange said that WikiLeaks paid for Snowden's flight from Hong Kong to Russia on Sunday and that ""there was no advanced communication with Russian officials prior to his departure from Hong Kong.""Claims that Snowden has been debriefed by Russian intelligence agencies are false, Assange said.In general, Assange struck a mysterious tone that left open many questions about when Snowden and WikiLeaks first made contact and what Snowden's status might be now.""In relation to the travel out of Hong Kong, that is a fascinating story that I'm sure will one day be told -- but today is not the day,"" Assange said.According to WikiLeaks, Snowden has applied for asylum in both Iceland and Ecuador, and possibly other countries. Assange himself has been holed up for the past year in the London embassy of Ecuador, which has offered him asylum; he is wanted for questioning on allegations of sexual assault in Sweden and has said he also fears extradition to the U.S. in relation to the ongoing Manning case. Snowden appears to be attempting a somewhat similar maneuver to avoid U.S. prosecution, with stops along the way in Hong Kong, which is a part of China, and Russia. Assange said Snowden traveled from Hong Kong with a refugee document provided by the Ecuadorian government.Asked if there was any disconnect between the human rights records of countries like China and Russia and the transparency for which Snowden has said he is fighting, Assange said no.""I simply don't see the irony,"" Assange said. ""Mr. Snowden has revealed information about mass, unlawful spying which has affected every single one of us. The U.S. administration has issued a series of bellicose, unilateral threats against him and against others who are attempting to support his rights. That is a very serious situation, and any country which assists in upholding his rights must be applauded for doing so."""

""Obviously, our concern at this point is for the safe return of the two U.S. citizens.""Pirate attacks off Nigeria's coast have jumped by a third this year as ships passing through West Africa's Gulf of Guinea, a major commodities route, have come under threat from gangs wanting to snatch cargoes and crews.The U.S.-flagged C-Retriever, a 222-foot (67 metre) vessel owned by U.S. marine transport group Edison Chouest Offshore, was attacked early Wednesday, UK-based security firm AKE and two security sources said. The company was not immediately available for comment.A U.S. defense official said the State Department and FBI were leading the American response to the incident. A second defense official said the U.S. Marine Corps has a small training unit in the region but it was not clear if it would get involved.However, representatives for the Nigerian Navy said they were aware of the incident and taking action. ""We have directed the central Naval Command to see to their rescue. So our men are on top of the situation,"" spokesman Kabiru Aliyu told Reuters.U.S. Navy officials have grown increasingly concerned about piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea and are working with local authorities there to strengthen their ability to patrol the region and better share information.The White House said on Thursday it is increasingly concerned about the rise in piracy off the coast of West Africa.""More broadly, we are concerned by the disturbing increase in the incidence of maritime crime, including incidents of piracy off the coast of West Africa, specifically in the Gulf of Guinea,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at a briefing.Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has called the region a potential ""hot spot"" after a visit to four countries surrounding the gulf in August. He told Defense News in September the Navy was working closely with Gabon, Senegal, Sao Tome and Ghana to help fight an increase in illegal trafficking of drugs, people and arms.""The piracy threat is spreading even further through the waters of West Africa, and the attacks have been mounting, even as global rates of reported piracy are at their lowest since 2006,"" said Michael Frodl of U.S.-based consultancy C-Level Maritime Risks. CONTRAST TO HORN OF AFRICAUnlike the dangerous waters off Somalia and the Horn of Africa on the east coast of Africa, through which ships now speed with armed guards on board, many vessels have to anchor to do business off West African countries with little protection.This makes them targets for criminals and raises insurance costs. Kidnapped sailors and oil workers taken in Nigerian waters are usually released after a ransom is paid.In a separate incident, three Nigerian soldiers were killed on Tuesday when armed robbers attacked a vessel carrying construction workers in the creeks of oil-producing Rivers state, the army said on Thursday.Piracy has regained attention in the U.S. recently since the release of a movie earlier this month chronicling an April 2009 hijacking of a U.S. ship by Somali attackers.The incident involved a cargo ship seized off the Horn of Africa later rescued by the U.S. Navy, which sent two ships and Navy SEALS to intervene."

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of the few public officials sympathetic toward Edward Snowden, warned the national security leaker on Sunday not to cut deals or cozy up to any government at the risk of losing credibility. ""I do think, for Mr. Snowden, if he cozies up to the Russian government, it will be nothing but bad for his name in history,"" said Paul on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""If he goes to an independent third country like Iceland and if he refuses to talk to any sort of formal government about this, I think there's a chance that he'll be seen as an advocate of privacy. If he cozies up to either the Russian government, the Chinese government, or any of these governments that are perceived still as enemies of ours, I think that will be a real problem for him in history.""Paul's comments came in the midst of a hectic Sunday morning in which Snowden left Hong Kong despite requests from the U.S. Justice Department that that government turn him over for prosecution. Snowden is being charged under the Espionage Act for leaking details of U.S. intelligence operations to various news outlets, mainly the Guardian. Hong Kong officials declined to do so, saying that the extradition request did not fully comply with its law. By the time Paul spoke to CNN, Snowden was reportedly on a plane that had just landed in Moscow. CNN was carrying a live stream of the passenger arrival area in the Moscow airport. Paul has been one of a few public officials to praise Snowden for leaking material on the National Security Agency's surveillance operations. And despite warning Snowden not to work with the Russian or Chinese governments, Paul continued on Sunday to argue that history would judge the leaks kindly. ""I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn't lied to anyone,"" said Paul. ""He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution, and he believes that, when James Clapper came in March, our national director of intelligence came and lied, that he [Snowden] was simply coming forward and telling the truth that your government was lying. This is a big concern of mine, because it makes me doubt the administration and their word to us when they talk to us, because they have now admitted they will lie to us if they think it is in the name of national security."""

5116	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/21/obama-iran_n_3966606.html	Opinion	1	None	International News	Positive	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- When a less-gray-haired Sen. Barack Obama declared, early in his first presidential campaign, that he would be willing to meet with the leaders of estranged nations like Iran and Syria without preconditions, he was roundly chastised by both Democrats and Republicans alike for naivete.But now, after six arduous, solitary years of standing by a policy of preferring accord with rogue nations over recourse to full-on war, his approach seems to be on the verge of bearing fruit. In Syria, President Bashar Assad has agreed to open his chemical weapons program to international oversight, and eventual destruction, after a furious round of diplomacy involving Secretary of State John Kerry and top Russian diplomats. And in Iran, a new, moderate president has responded to a personal letter from Obama, engaging in direct communication for the first time in years and hinting that he might be willing to pull back from his country's controversial nuclear program in exchange for a reduction of painful economic sanctions.None of the developments has occurred without context or notes of caution, but it's nevertheless a remarkable turn of events for a president whose foreign policy, even a month ago, appeared to be in hapless disarray. If the diplomatic tracks in Syria and Iran pan out, proponents say they could point the way to the resolution of two of the most significant international crises facing the nation, without any American-caused warfare. ""The administration's willingness to show both strength and smarts is paying off,"" said Joel Rubin, the director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund and a former State Department official, who has worked to promote conflict resolution in the Middle East through discourse.""On Syria, the president demonstrated that there was a clear point that he did not want the regime to pass, and then took a window of opportunity to cut a deal that actually advances American security interests even more,"" Rubin added. ""An ancillary benefit has been that it's demonstrated to the Iranians that the U.S. is thinking before it's shooting, and that's a pretty new trend for the U.S.""Next week, the new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, travels to New York for the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). His arrival brings perhaps the greatest hope for a diplomatic breakthrough between Washington and Tehran in recent memory, and in turn, a possible vindication of Obama's refusal to condone military strikes against the country.The Obama administration has yet to confirm whether any United States officials plan to meet with Iranian counterparts in New York. Nonetheless, the prospect of such a meeting has diplomatic circles buzzing.""If there's a meeting between the United States and Iran on the sidelines of UNGA, that will be huge,"" said a senior Obama administration official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations. Such a meeting would almost certainly be held well below the presidential level, the official said, most likely between the Iranian foreign minister and a senior U.S. diplomat like Wendy Sherman, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, or Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns. It's also possible that a ""chance encounter"" between Obama and Rouhani could be arranged in the halls of the UN. ""Sherman and Burns have the most experience communicating with Iran,"" said the official. ""But whoever it is, it would be a momentous meeting, because this kind of open, direct talks haven't happened in 34 years."" The past week has seen a number of unprecedented overtures from Rouhani, including a rare interview with an American news outlet and writing an op-ed, published Friday in the Washington Post, in which he called for a new era of ""constructive engagement"" between Iran and the West.The Iranian government also released nearly a dozen prisoners ahead of Rouhani's visit to the U.S., something that experts say often happens before international forays, but rarely includes such domestic political detainees as the women's rights activist Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was released on Wednesday.And in his interview with NBC this past week, Rouhani said that his country had no intention of ever developing nuclear weapons, adding that he has ""complete authority"" to negotiate a deal over the peaceful components of the nuclear program.""This is probably the best opportunity that I can think of [for a breakthrough],"" said Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council and a longtime advocate of the U.S. taking a less heavy-handed approach to diplomacy with Iran. ""Right now, Rouhani has unprecedented flexibility.""Skeptics have suggested that Rouhani may have less freedom to maneuver within the hardline elements of his country than he's suggested, especially on the question of the nuclear program. But even some of the most ardent Western dissenters on the regime's capacity to moderate say that the current moment represents one of the greatest openings for dialogue in memory.Jeffrey Feltman, the U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs, and a former top Middle East official in the Bush administration where he often struck a hard line on Iran, said recently that in meetings with the foreign minister in Tehran he has detected an openness to negotiating on Syria.""It's hard for us to imagine any solution in Syria that doesn't somehow have an Iranian role,"" Feltman told CNN last week. ""The Iranians stated that they understand that we need to get to a political solution. I don't think from my conversations that I had in Iran that the Iranians see it in their interest to see the situation [in Syria] continue or deteriorate.""Parsi believes that in winning a surprise electoral victory over conservatives, Rouhani has actually earned himself a brief window of opportunity to make a deal with the West -- but it's one that must be struck quickly.""You have to assume he has six months or so where he can get his way, and where the conservatives will have to be on their best behavior,"" Parsi said. ""This is a moment when he has maximum flexibility -- it will either expand if he gets a deal, or it will be lost if he doesn't. If the U.S. fails to reciprocate, we will be forced to deal with the hardliners six months from now.""Not everyone agrees that Obama deserves full credit for pursuing diplomacy at the expense of other tactics. After all, while he has avoided troops-on-the-ground combat in places like Iran and Syria, he hasn't slowed his deadly policy of drone strikes in hot zones like Yemen and Pakistan.And to some participants in the Obama administration's earlier days, the talk of dialogue and diplomacy in places like Iran was often more talk than practice -- the recent openings from Assad and Rouhani, they argue, have essentially fallen in his lap.""I think he was not looking for diplomacy with Iran or Syria,"" said Vali Nasr, the dean of Johns Hopkins University’s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, and a former State Department policy adviser. ""Now that it has come his way, he will be judged by whether he makes diplomacy work.""Others -- including some of Obama's own advisers -- argue that to the extent Obama deserves credit for the possible breakthroughs, it is instead because he turned against his espoused belief in dialogue, and showed a credible threat against the regimes: For Syria, it was the recent talk of cruise missile strikes, they say; for Iran, it was years of crushing economic sanctions.""It was that threat of force from President Obama that changed the calculus around the chemical weapons issue [in Syria], and allowed for this diplomatic progress,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters on a conference call Friday. But while it's true that Obama hasn't always held true to the ideals of his early campaign days -- first-term talk of engagement ""grounded in mutual respect"" eventually gave way to tough rhetoric about ""painful sanctions"" and nuclear red lines -- he consistently resisted the hardline pull, from hawkish members of Congress and Israeli allies, toward a preventative military strike. ""There is too much loose talk of war,"" Obama said about U.S. and Israeli threats toward Iran, in a powerful 2012 speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.For observers like Parsi, it is actually this softer side that has done the most to earn the present detente with Iran.""What Iranians are largely reacting to now is that Rouhani got a congratulatory letter from Obama. That's not toughness -- that is a huge concession given to the Iranians,"" said Parsi. ""When Iranians are convinced that the other side wants to take military action, the only way they know to respond and try to prevent it is to show how high the costs would be, not to suddenly show flexibility.""It's a notion promoted by some of the sharpest minds in U.S. policy. Earlier this year, Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, told the Los Angeles Times that without the promise of a softer touch, a strong sanctions regime would only harden Iranian interlocutors.“Sanctions are easy to do, and afterwards we can tell ourselves that, ‘by God, we’ve really stuck it to them,’” he said. “But it seems to me that the more you press this regime, the more they dig in.”""Sanctions and pressure are useless if you don't get something for them,"" added Rubin. ""There are going to be some people in Washington who say, 'see, the sanctions are working, let's keep the pedal to the floor and we'll push them over completely and get everything that we want.' But that's not how it works. What the president's saying is, 'let's test them.'""Officials say those tests are likely to come down to technical issues, such as whether Iran is willing to reduce the number of nuclear centrifuges it currently has in operation. Progress on this front could signal ""whether perhaps there's a place for the U.S. and Iran to meet in the middle,"" said the administration official. ""It's going to be technical specifications, not speeches or tweets or op-eds, that will be the crucial components in determining whether or not there will ever be a true thaw between the two countries."" Joshua Hersh reported from Beirut, and Christina Wilkie reported from Washington."
5139	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/05/dea-surveillance-cover-up_n_3706207.html	News	0	Civil Rights	National Security	SomewhatPositive	SomewhatPositive	huffingtonpost.com	"By John Shiffman and Kristina CookeWASHINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.Although these cases rarely involve national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin - not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges.The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to ""recreate"" the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant's Constitutional right to a fair trial. If defendants don't know how an investigation began, they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence - information that could reveal entrapment, mistakes or biased witnesses.""I have never heard of anything like this at all,"" said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 2011. Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling than recent disclosures that the National Security Agency has been collecting domestic phone records. The NSA effort is geared toward stopping terrorists; the DEA program targets common criminals, primarily drug dealers.""It is one thing to create special rules for national security,"" Gertner said. ""Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations.""THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISIONThe unit of the DEA that distributes the information is called the Special Operations Division, or SOD. Two dozen partner agencies comprise the unit, including the FBI, CIA, NSA, Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Homeland Security. It was created in 1994 to combat Latin American drug cartels and has grown from several dozen employees to several hundred.Today, much of the SOD's work is classified, and officials asked that its precise location in Virginia not be revealed. The documents reviewed by Reuters are marked ""Law Enforcement Sensitive,"" a government categorization that is meant to keep them confidential.""Remember that the utilization of SOD cannot be revealed or discussed in any investigative function,"" a document presented to agents reads. The document specifically directs agents to omit the SOD's involvement from investigative reports, affidavits, discussions with prosecutors and courtroom testimony. Agents are instructed to then use ""normal investigative techniques to recreate the information provided by SOD.""A spokesman with the Department of Justice, which oversees the DEA, declined to comment.But two senior DEA officials defended the program, and said trying to ""recreate"" an investigative trail is not only legal but a technique that is used almost daily.A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who received such tips from SOD described the process. ""You'd be told only, 'Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.' And so we'd alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it,"" the agent said.""PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION""After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their investigation began with the traffic stop, not with the SOD tip, the former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as ""parallel construction.""The two senior DEA officials, who spoke on behalf of the agency but only on condition of anonymity, said the process is kept secret to protect sources and investigative methods. ""Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day,"" one official said. ""It's decades old, a bedrock concept.""A dozen current or former federal agents interviewed by Reuters confirmed they had used parallel construction during their careers. Most defended the practice; some said they understood why those outside law enforcement might be concerned.""It's just like laundering money - you work it backwards to make it clean,"" said Finn Selander, a DEA agent from 1991 to 2008 and now a member of a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, which advocates legalizing and regulating narcotics.Some defense lawyers and former prosecutors said that using ""parallel construction"" may be legal to establish probable cause for an arrest. But they said employing the practice as a means of disguising how an investigation began may violate pretrial discovery rules by burying evidence that could prove useful to criminal defendants.A QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY""That's outrageous,"" said Tampa attorney James Felman, a vice chairman of the criminal justice section of the American Bar Association. ""It strikes me as indefensible.""Lawrence Lustberg, a New Jersey defense lawyer, said any systematic government effort to conceal the circumstances under which cases begin ""would not only be alarming but pretty blatantly unconstitutional.""Lustberg and others said the government's use of the SOD program skirts established court procedures by which judges privately examine sensitive information, such as an informant's identity or classified evidence, to determine whether the information is relevant to the defense.""You can't game the system,"" said former federal prosecutor Henry E. Hockeimer Jr. ""You can't create this subterfuge. These are drug crimes, not national security cases. If you don't draw the line here, where do you draw it?""Some lawyers say there can be legitimate reasons for not revealing sources. Robert Spelke, a former prosecutor who spent seven years as a senior DEA lawyer, said some sources are classified. But he also said there are few reasons why unclassified evidence should be concealed at trial.""It's a balancing act, and they've doing it this way for years,"" Spelke said. ""Do I think it's a good way to do it? No, because now that I'm a defense lawyer, I see how difficult it is to challenge.""CONCEALING A TIPOne current federal prosecutor learned how agents were using SOD tips after a drug agent misled him, the prosecutor told Reuters. In a Florida drug case he was handling, the prosecutor said, a DEA agent told him the investigation of a U.S. citizen began with a tip from an informant. When the prosecutor pressed for more information, he said, a DEA supervisor intervened and revealed that the tip had actually come through the SOD and from an NSA intercept.""I was pissed,"" the prosecutor said. ""Lying about where the information came from is a bad start if you're trying to comply with the law because it can lead to all kinds of problems with discovery and candor to the court."" The prosecutor never filed charges in the case because he lost confidence in the investigation, he said.A senior DEA official said he was not aware of the case but said the agent should not have misled the prosecutor. How often such misdirection occurs is unknown, even to the government; the DEA official said the agency does not track what happens with tips after the SOD sends them to agents in the field.The SOD's role providing information to agents isn't itself a secret. It is briefly mentioned by the DEA in budget documents, albeit without any reference to how that information is used or represented when cases go to court.The DEA has long publicly touted the SOD's role in multi-jurisdictional and international investigations, connecting agents in separate cities who may be unwittingly investigating the same target and making sure undercover agents don't accidentally try to arrest each other.SOD'S BIG SUCCESSESThe unit also played a major role in a 2008 DEA sting in Thailand against Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout; he was sentenced in 2011 to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiring to sell weapons to the Colombian rebel group FARC. The SOD also recently coordinated Project Synergy, a crackdown against manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of synthetic designer drugs that spanned 35 states and resulted in 227 arrests.Since its inception, the SOD's mandate has expanded to include narco-terrorism, organized crime and gangs. A DEA spokesman declined to comment on the unit's annual budget. A recent LinkedIn posting on the personal page of a senior SOD official estimated it to be $125 million.Today, the SOD offers at least three services to federal, state and local law enforcement agents: coordinating international investigations such as the Bout case; distributing tips from overseas NSA intercepts, informants, foreign law enforcement partners and domestic wiretaps; and circulating tips from a massive database known as DICE.The DICE database contains about 1 billion records, the senior DEA officials said. The majority of the records consist of phone log and Internet data gathered legally by the DEA through subpoenas, arrests and search warrants nationwide. Records are kept for about a year and then purged, the DEA officials said.About 10,000 federal, state and local law enforcement agents have access to the DICE database, records show. They can query it to try to link otherwise disparate clues. Recently, one of the DEA officials said, DICE linked a man who tried to smuggle $100,000 over the U.S. southwest border to a major drug case on the East Coast.""We use it to connect the dots,"" the official said.""AN AMAZING TOOL""Wiretap tips forwarded by the SOD usually come from foreign governments, U.S. intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. Because warrantless eavesdropping on Americans is illegal, tips from intelligence agencies are generally not forwarded to the SOD until a caller's citizenship can be verified, according to one senior law enforcement official and one former U.S. military intelligence analyst.""They do a pretty good job of screening, but it can be a struggle to know for sure whether the person on a wiretap is American,"" the senior law enforcement official said.Tips from domestic wiretaps typically occur when agents use information gleaned from a court-ordered wiretap in one case to start a second investigation.As a practical matter, law enforcement agents said they usually don't worry that SOD's involvement will be exposed in court. That's because most drug-trafficking defendants plead guilty before trial and therefore never request to see the evidence against them. If cases did go to trial, current and former agents said, charges were sometimes dropped to avoid the risk of exposing SOD involvement.Current and former federal agents said SOD tips aren't always helpful - one estimated their accuracy at 60 percent. But current and former agents said tips have enabled them to catch drug smugglers who might have gotten away.""It was an amazing tool,"" said one recently retired federal agent. ""Our big fear was that it wouldn't stay secret.""DEA officials said that the SOD process has been reviewed internally. They declined to provide Reuters with a copy of their most recent review.

Jeb Bush (R) makes a notable reversal on immigration reform, arguing that creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants would only encourage future unauthorized immigration.""It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences -- in this case, that those who violated the law can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship,"" Bush and lawyer Clint Bolick argue in a new book, Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution. ""To do otherwise would signal once again that people who circumvent the system can still obtain the full benefits of American citizenship."" The book, which The Huffington Post obtained before its Tuesday release, lays out the two men's proposals for comprehensive immigration reform. Both are longtime proponents of reform, and Bush in particular has long beat the drum for the GOP to take a new tone on the matter. But the book's treatment of a pathway to citizenship stands in contrast to Bush's previous statements on immigration reform. And ironically, later in the book Bush argues that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, suffered immense political damage by moving to the right on the issue during the GOP primary. ""Mitt Romney moved so far to the right on immigration issues that it proved all but impossible for him to appeal to Hispanic voters in the general election,"" Bush and Bolick write. ""Although Romney eventually called for comprehensive immigration reform, a platform that hardened the party's stance on immigration hung like an anvil around his candidacy,"" they continue. Bush's reversal doesn't appear as severe as some of the tough rhetoric used by Romney during the primary. Still, it creates a contrast between him and some of Bush's possible 2016 Republican primary opponents, and shows what could be the biggest problem in finding a compromise on immigration reform this year. While some Republicans, including potential 2016 candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), are calling for a pathway to citizenship, most members of the party are arguing for only legalization. Democrats, meanwhile, argue a special road to become citizens is absolutely necessary. The American people for the most part also support such a measure, according to a number of polls. As of June 2012, Bush asserted that he supported a pathway to citizenship.""You have to deal with this issue,"" Bush told CBS' Charlie Rose. ""You can't ignore it, and so either a path to citizenship, which I would support -- and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives -- or ... a path ... to residency of some kind.""In the book, however, Bush and Bolick write that there should be ""two penalties for illegal entry: fines and/or community service and ineligibility for citizenship."" They don't fully rule out citizenship, however, despite what that sentence implies. Although Bush and Bolick state there should be no special pathway, they say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to go through normal channels to naturalize by going to their native country to apply. That process currently requires three- or 10-year bars and no guarantee of return, making it untenable to many undocumented immigrants. ""A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage,"" they write. ""However, illegal immigrants who wish to become citizens should have the choice of returning to their native countries and applying through normal immigration processes that now would be much more open than before."" Bush and Bolick propose a different solution for Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children. They argue citizenship should be granted to people who entered the country under the age of 18, have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, committed no ""significant crimes"" and either graduated from high school, obtained a GED or entered military service. For legal immigration, they argue there must be a better process that makes it less appealing to come to the United States without authorization.""There is one reason above all others that we have millions of illegal immigrants in our country: because under our current immigration system, there is no lawful avenue for them to enter the country. ... So that saying 'they should wait in line like everyone else' is hollow because there is no line in which to wait,"" they write. ""The days in which people could lawfully emigrate to the United States just because they wanted to pursue the American Dream are as much a memory as Ellis Island."" UPDATE: 2:55 p.m. -- Bush defended his stance to the Miami Herald's Marc Caputo after an anonymous Romney adviser accused him of advocating for the same positions that he said tanked the former GOP presidential candidate.""[I] am not advocating self deportation. read the book,"" Bush wrote in an email. The advisor argued to Caputo that it was the same stance. ""Where the hell was this Jeb Bush during the campaign?"" the advisor said. ""He spent all this time criticizing Romney and it turns out he has basically the same position. So he wants people to go back to their country and apply for citizenship? Well, that's self deportation. We got creamed for talking about that. And now Jeb is saying the same thing."""

That's his decision, he is an adult, he is a person who is responsible for his own agency,"" Lon Snowden said, standing beside Kucherena at Sheremetyevo airport.""I am his father, I love my son and I certainly hope I will have an opportunity to see my son,"" Snowden said.Edward Snowden was the source of disclosures about U.S. government surveillance that included details about a program that collected e-mails, chat logs and other types of data from companies such as Google Inc and Facebook Inc.""I really have no idea what his intentions are,"" Lon Snowden said, citing his lack of direct contact with him.But he said he believed Snowden had not been involved in the publication of any information since he arrived in Russia and was ""simply trying to remain healthy and safe"".Directly from the airport, he and the lawyer drove to a state television studio to give an exclusive live interview, indicating the visit was under strong government control.Kucherena, who said he last saw Edward Snowden on Wednesday, expressed hope the former intelligence contractor would soon find a job in Russia - possibly in IT or human rights sector - because he has largely run out of his savings and was living modestly, mainly of donations.He also said the fugitive American lived under security in Russia and was avoiding publicity because of the U.S. chase after him. NO HANDOVERSnowden, who worked as a systems administrator at a U.S. National Security Agency facility in Hawaii, fled to Hong Kong in June and then flew to Moscow. The United States annulled his passport and urged nations in Latin America and elsewhere not to take him in or help him find refuge from U.S. prosecution.President Vladimir Putin rejected repeated American pleas to hand Snowden over to the United States but has denied Russia had any role in Snowden's disclosures or that its intelligence agencies were working with him in any way.Putin has used Snowden's case to accuse the United States of preaching to the world about rights and freedoms it does not uphold at home.After Snowden was granted asylum, on Aug. 1, U.S. President Barack Obama pulled out of a summit with Putin that had been scheduled for early September in Moscow, but then met Putin at a G20 summit in St. Petersburg.Edward Snowden is in the running for the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, a European human rights award whose past winners include Nelson Mandela and Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The winner is to be chosen on Thursday."

A 2010 poll by the group found that 63 percent felt anti-terrorism policies did not go far enough, while just 25 percent said they went too far.The numbers suggest that the revelation of the NSA's telephone and Internet spying programs has caused many Americans to change their opinions of the national security state.Men, by a 54-34 margin, said that policies had gone too far, while women, by a 47-36 margin, said they had not gone far enough, revealing a sizable gender gap.In the new poll, 55 percent of Americans characterized former NSA contractor Edward Snowden as a whistleblower, while 34 percent deemed him a traitor. Forty-nine percent of Democrats, 55 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of independents said he is a whistleblower.The survey reveals that the public disagrees with many lawmakers -- both Democrats and Republicans -- who have called the former NSA contractor a traitor. Snowden is believed to be holed up in the transit zone of a Moscow airport after he leaked classified documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post detailing the agency's massive telephone and Internet spying programs.Nevertheless, other recent surveys have shown that more Americans disapprove than approve of Snowden's actions. A HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 38 percent of Americans thought Snowden had done the wrong thing in leaking the documents, while 33 percent condoned his actions. Twenty-nine percent were unsure. A CNN poll released on June 17 showed that 52 percent disagreed with his actions, and 44 percent agreed.

I spoke up not out of disrespect, however, either for you or our country. No, I spoke up -- and am writing to you now -- to ask that you use your executive order to halt deportations for 11.5 million undocumented immigrant families.My family came to the United States from South Korea when I was 11 years old. Like many immigrants, my mother brought me to this country to seek a better life for her children. I graduated from UC Berkeley, and am now pursuing a Master's degree in Public Administration at San Francisco State University. I have lived in America now for 13 years. I consider this country as my home. During my senior year in high school, however, I learned that my family had overstayed a tourist visa. We are undocumented immigrants.As an American without papers, I was not able to get a job, obtain a driver's license, or receive governmental financial aid. When my mother was sick and in severe pain, she did not visit a doctor because she cannot procure medical insurance. And when my family's home was burglarized, she refused to call the police because she was afraid that our family would be turned over to immigration officials and deported.Like many other undocumented immigrants, I was living in the shadows and living in fear of deportation. However, I have decided to speak out and stand up. Immigration reform is not only a Latino issue, it's also an Asian and Pacific Islander issue -- in fact, it is a human rights issue. Currently, two million of the estimated 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in our country come from Asia. Under your administration, 250,000 undocumented Asian/Pacific Islander immigrants have been deported. While we only make up five percent of the country, we are disproportionately impacted by your immigration policies.Last week, I was formally invited by White House staff to hear your remarks on immigration reform in San Francisco. As I stood in the stands behind you, I was hoping to hear about your plan to address the lives of 11 million undocumented people living in this country, like my family. And while you expressed your support for comprehensive immigration reform, you did not address how an average of 1,100 immigrants are deported every single day under your administration. You did not address how you deported 205,000 parents of U.S. citizens in the last two years. You did not address how, because of your administration's record number of deportations--nearly two million immigrants in five years, a record--families are being torn apart: spouses are being separated from each other, parents are being separated from their children, and our brothers and sisters are being separated from one another. You did not to address how your administration would end the anti-immigration deportation programs like ""Secure Communities."" You've deported more people than any other president in the U.S. history.Interestingly, you talked about Angel Island during your speech. What you did not mention, however, is that more people are detained every single day in detention today than were detained yearly at Angel Island. You recognized Angel Island as a dark period in Chinatown's history, but you failed to recognize that more Asians and Pacific Islanders are in detention today than were in detention under the Chinese Exclusion Act. In fact, your administration detains up to 34,000 people per day, a record number of detainees in U.S. history.Because you failed to address these issues, I was compelled to address the concerns of our community.You claim that the President of the United States has no authority to stop the deportations. And yet, in June 2012, before the 2012 election, which you won with the help of Latino and Asian voters, you implemented Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. With the stroke of a pen, you dramatically changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people like me who can now live without the daily threat of deportation, and can legally work in this country for the first time in our lives.I know that you support comprehensive immigration reform. But I also know that you have the power to stop the deportations, and that you have the power to stop the suffering, fear, and intimidation facing millions of immigrants like my family.Your fellow American,Ju Hong"

A man, identified by local media as Alcibia Rivera, then enters the room and cuts the lights. Through the blurry images, it appears that he then removes the woman from the chair and rapes her on the floor. When the lights turn back on -- apparently because someone tried to enter the room -- the man hops up and the woman appears to move. The lights then turn back off and the man appears to pull up his pants and return the woman to a chair. People return to the room to check on the woman. Toward the end of the video, when she tries to stand up, she falls to the floor.The video was reportedly taken on Dec. 20, after a holiday party at which Rivera and others allegedly drank too much. After being posted on YouTube, local news stations ran with the story this week, and it later appeared on international news sites including Spain’s ABC and the U.S. blog Jezebel.Alcibia Rivera, who belongs to the governing Movement Toward Socialism (MAS, in Spanish) denies wrongdoing and says he’ll cooperate with an investigation, according to Bolivian daily La Razón. “They’re saying that is was rape, but that wasn’t rape,” Alcibia Rivera said, according to La Razón.MAS’s ethics committee kicked Alcibia out of the party, along with legislator Javier Humana, who was involved in the incident. The allegations drew condemnation from Bolivian President Evo Morales, who said Alcibia Rivera had committed a “serious error.” Bolivian prosecutors say they’ll take action against local media for showing the video, saying it endangers the victim.

Civilian Pentagon employees comprise about half the 800,000 federal employees currently furloughed.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said a legal review of the ""Pay Our Military Act,"" signed by President Barack Obama on Monday on the eve of the shutdown, would allow him to bring a still unspecified number of civilians back to work next week.The announcement came as Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives agreed to pay all furloughed employees retroactively once the government reopens. It was a rare moment of cooperation in the House as the two parties were entrenched in their positions on the shutdown. The U.S. Senate is expected to go along.But the actions did not solve the basic problem - the failure of Democrats and Republicans to settle their political differences and agree on a bill to fund and reopen the government.The House measure prompted Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter of New York to suggest that since the employees were going to get their salaries anyway, ""why don't we just let them come back to work?""""This whole thing is crazy,"" she said.Outside the Capitol where Congress was meeting on Saturday, two small children sat at the foot of the stairs holding placards reading: End the shutdown"" and ""Stop acting like children.""As they moved into the second week of a shutdown, members appeared no closer to finding a way to end it, or to head off a possible default by the government on Oct. 17, the deadline for Congress to increase the government's authority to borrow money.Talk of using broader budget deals to bring the standoff to an end has picked up in recent days, but without any visible result.Democrats say bills to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling could be resolved quickly if House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner permitted votes on simple, no-strings-attached measures.But most House Republicans want strings attached, including one aimed at crippling Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare, and Boehner has so far refused to promise votes on either, in part because he could face a revolt that might cost him his job.Democrats have already begun efforts to force a vote on the shutdown using complex and time-consuming parliamentary procedures.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Boehner signed by 195 of 200 House Democrats, demanding a vote on a bill to reopen the government without any rollback in Obamacare.Pelosi said if Boehner did so, they would agree to the Republicans' government funding level for the next six weeks, more stringent than the Democratic level, which has already been approved by the Senate.Democrats are also trying to persuade Boehner to convene a ""conference committee"" with the Senate to discuss broader budget issues, something Boehner has resisted, fearing that Democrats might use arcane House rules to bring other measures to the House floor, such as raising taxes on the wealthy.Pelosi made what she called ""an unprecedented offer."" She said if he would permit a House-Senate conference on funding for the rest of the year, Democrats would surrender their right to use the rules to add items that might embarrass Republicans.Boehner's press secretary, Michael Steel, brushed off Pelosi's offer, saying, ""At this point, it's Senate Democrats and the president who are blocking progress on reopening the government and providing the American people fairness under Obamacare. DEBT CEILINGThe standoff, which began at the start of the new fiscal year on Tuesday and shuttered all but essential government operations, was sparked by Republicans' determination to block or delay implementation of the healthcare law.The law aims to provide healthcare to millions of uninsured Americans. Republicans argue it is a massive government intrusion into private medicine that will cause insurance premiums to skyrocket, put people out of work and eventually lead to socialized medicine.Republicans are also seeking concessions in exchange for raising the nation's $16.7 trillion debt limit. If the borrowing cap is not increased, the United States could go into default, with what officials and economists say would be seriously damaging consequences for the U.S. and global economies.Democrats vow they will make no such concessions on the funding bill or the debt ceiling.Obama said in an interview with the Associated Press released on Saturday that he did not expect to have to take any unusual steps to prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt because he believes Congress will raise the debt ceiling.""I don't expect to get there,"" Obama said. ""There were at least some quotes yesterday that Speaker Boehner is willing to make sure that we don't default,"" he said.""And I'm pretty willing to bet that there are enough votes in the House of Representatives right now to make sure that the United States doesn't end up being a deadbeat,"" Obama said.Republicans blame the White House for the fiscal deadlock, saying the president is refusing to compromise.After the House vote on retroactive pay, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican majority whip, said his party was ready to negotiate with Obama and his fellow Democrats. ""The president is here this weekend, we are here this weekend. Now is the time, since everyone is in town, to pick up the phone and talk,"" he said.Scott Rigell, a Republican representative from Virginia who has called for a ""clean"" vote to fund the government that does not involve Obama's healthcare law, said as far as he knew, there were no behind-the-scenes negotiations between Republicans and Democrats over the shutdown or the debt ceiling.""No one is talking,"" Rigell told Reuters.Facing public anger over the government shutdown, House Republicans have adopted a strategy of voting piecemeal to fund some popular federal agencies - like the Veterans Administration, the National Park Service and the National Institutes of Health - that are partially closed.Democrats have rejected that, arguing Congress has a duty to pass a bill funding the entire government."

Military cuts also will affect spending by civilian and uniformed personnel at businesses near military bases in every state, no matter how big the military industry, he said.“There is a lot to be done coordinating at the state level,"" DiGiovanni told the lieutenant governors. He cited Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown (D) for assembling a group that helped prepare for potential military base cuts in the past, and for having a plan to lobby federal officials to protect military installations in his state. DiGiovanni told the lieutenant governors they also should prepare for overseas military cuts, which will shift more activity to U.S. installations. With 200,000 military personnel returning from full time duty overseas, there will be more training at bases, he said. Those personel will contribute to the local economy, but they may spark increased complaints from base neighbors about noise and traffic. At the same time, DiGiovanni did note that there has been a greater culture of the different military services working together with the budget cuts, including at bases around the country. He said that state leaders can continue to see that going forward. “Sequestration and this whole fiscal environment is going to require the services to work together to accomplish the mission,"" he said. ""The resources they’ve had won’t be there anymore.”Kansas is a role model in protecting the military economy, said Patrick O'Brien, director of the Defense Department Office of Economic Adjustment,. O'Brien said lieutenant governors in the past have headed state planning groups to study the impact of military bases and industries on the state economy and how to have state government serve their needs. The lieutenant governors association has long advocated the flexible nature of state lieutenant governors' offices as a way for the officials to be involved in a variety of areas of policy, including those impacting the military and economic development.

That's it. Two,"" General Ray Odierno told a news conference at the annual conference of the Association of the U.S. Army.Odierno's comments came as he and Army Secretary John McHugh discussed the impact of the recent U.S. government shutdown as well as across-the-board budget cuts that forced the military to slash spending in March, nearly halfway through its fiscal year.McHugh and Odierno both appealed to Congress to find a way to give the military more financial predictability so it can plan effectively. McHugh said that with the way the military is currently funded, budgets that are approved today are based on planning that occurred three years earlier.""You can't run the most important military on the face of the Earth locked into three-year-old budgets,"" McHugh said.The Army was hit particularly hard by the cuts in March, known as sequestration, because of higher-than-projected Afghanistan war costs and the need to make up those funds from its operations accounts, which include money for training.""We had to stop training, basically, in the last six months of the year,"" Odierno said.The ongoing uncertainty with the defense budget could make the situation worse in the fiscal year that began in October. The U.S. government began the year with a shutdown that lasted nearly three weeks and put many federal workers on unpaid leave.The government resumed operations last week under a deal to fund operations at last year's spending levels and priorities.The Army chief said he hoped to be able to devote enough money to training this fiscal year to ensure that seven combat brigades are fully ready by June to respond to a conflict. He said the current lack of training was his biggest concern.A combat brigade team has about 3,500 to 5,000 soldiers.""The worst-case scenario is you ask me to deploy thousands of soldiers somewhere and we have not properly trained them to go because we simply don't have the dollars and money because of the way sequestration is laid out,"" Odierno said.Odierno said that while troops going to Afghanistan had been trained, they were ""trained now to do training and advising only. They're not trained to do combat operations ... because that's not their mission in Afghanistan any more.""The Army grew to about 570,000 uniformed personnel over the past decade. But with the war in Iraq over and the one in Afghanistan winding down, officials plan to reduce the size of the force to 490,000. The number of brigade combat teams is due to fall from a total of 45 currently down to 33.With the Pentagon increasingly likely to face cuts of nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, the Army could be forced to cut further. A management review this summer conducted by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel indicated the Army might have to shrink by up to 70,000 more soldiers, to 420,000.McHugh said that if the across-the-board cuts continue in force, essentially all of the Army's programs will be affected.Odierno also said the Army needs a replacement for its armored fighting vehicles, its workhorse Humvee vehicles and its helicopters. ""The bottom line is we can't afford all of that. And so we're going to have make some tough decisions,"" he said. (Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Will Dunham)"
5410	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/14/sequestration-fixes_n_3276197.html	News	0	Economy	National Security	SomewhatPositive	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Piecemeal efforts to ease the impact of federal sequestration budget cuts are counterproductive and may end up costing taxpayers more, according to a report from congressional Democrats.The report, put together by Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee and their ranking member, Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), is the third installment in a series outlining the impact of sequester-related cuts. The report, provided to The Huffington Post in advance of its Wednesday release, is blunt, arguing that Congress has made the impact of sequestration worse by adjusting individual parts, rather than pursuing a larger fix. ""A few departments and agencies have found ways to mitigate some very specific impacts of sequestration,"" the authors wrote. ""However, these strategies merely replace one set of cuts with cuts to other parts of the same agency. All will have an impact, and nearly all will have to be made up with future appropriations.""""Piecemeal efforts to manage sequestration are counterproductive,"" the report concluded. ""They often require underfunding long-term needs to mitigate short-term pain. In many instances, the annual savings mask increased longer-term costs.""To illustrate this point, the Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee looked at the efforts made by Congress to end the furloughing of air traffic controllers shortly after complaints surfaced over flight delays. While the Federal Aviation Administration was granted flexibility to end those furloughs, it came ""at the expense of another priority,"" the report said. In this case, the FAA can no longer fund construction projects with discretionary funds. Officials estimated the costs of congestion and delays at airports will exceed $34 billion by 2020. Food safety inspectors were also spared the hit of sequestration. But here too, congressional Democrats pointed out that the cost was only moved elsewhere, with funding taking the hit for U.S. Department of Agriculture building maintenance and for a program to upgrade school kitchen equipment. ""Again, sequestration forced a difficult sacrifice of long-term necessities to avoid short-term pain,"" the report concluded. Much of the 26-page report is devoted not to the fixes made to sequestration, but to the impacts to come. Under the sequester, $85 billion will be cut this fiscal year, and an estimated $1 trillion will be cut over the next decade. The report predicted that taxpayers may end up paying more because of the indiscriminate and shortsighted nature of the cuts. Take, for instance, the $50 million reduced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s geostationary weather satellite program. ""The cut will cause a 3-6 month satellite launch delay,"" the report said. ""The delay, as with any construction delay, ends up raising the cost to taxpayers over the next few years, in this case by up to $200 million.""Then there is the case of federal public defenders, facing steep reductions in funding. ""Reductions in the Federal Defender Services account actually cost the taxpayer money in the form of private attorneys,"" the report said. ""If the Federal Defender cannot accept a case due to sequestration (as many are currently experiencing), representation is provided by private panel attorneys, who are paid at a higher cost than Federal Defenders.""Those dreaded flight delays, the authors noted, may still end up a reality. Sequestration cuts to the Transportation Security Administration ""may not currently impact wait times for travelers moving through our nation’s airports, but TSA anticipates an increase in the number of delays during the peak summer travel months,"" the report said. Other highlights in the report:Research projects will feel the budget cuts, with the National Institutes of Health estimating that it will support 1,357 fewer grants in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012.  The Department of Energy will face challenges ""remediating the contamination from the nation’s nuclear weapons development effort"" because of a $430 million cut.  Rural rental assistance for those in need will be hit, with an estimated 15,000 aid recipients expected to get less while an estimated 70,000 children ""will lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start.""  The Forest Service will enter the 2013 firefighting season with 500 fewer firefighters.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will place fewer vaccines, drugs and supplies into the national stockpile used for ""countermeasures needed to respond to bioterrorist attacks."" Sequestration, the report ominously concluded, may hamper the Department of Defense in confronting pressing national security issues. ""In total,"" the report said, ""DoD estimates the shortfall caused by sequestration in the operation and maintenance accounts is $22 billion for the remainder of FY 2013. The significance of degraded readiness is that units, other than those deploying to Afghanistan (e.g., units that may respond to crises in Syria, Iran or the Korean Peninsula), will not have completed the training necessary to conduct the full range of assigned tasks.""

But if he does, the votes appear to be there. The Senate would pass the bill in no time, sending it to be signed by President Barack Obama and ending the shutdown.Read the tally here to see who those House Republicans are, and why they say they're done with trying to force through provisions on Obamacare before agreeing to keep the government running.Of course, we'll update the list when, or if, more come in.This is a developing story and has been updated.

""Congress must deal with immigration directly, and in a compassionate and practical manner.""Cannella was one of 15 lawmakers who signed a letter released Thursday asking the state's Congressional delegation to ""act on reform this year to put this challenge behind us."" A sixteenth lawmaker, state Senator Andy Vidak of Bakersfield, sent his own letter.A landmark immigration overhaul passed by the Democratic-led U.S. Senate in June includes a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants currently living illegally in the United States, but it faces scant chance of passage in its current form in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.The California lawmakers calling for an overhaul - who comprise nearly half of the Republican delegation to the state legislature - are pushing back against the party's national leaders for a variety of reasons. The state relies heavily on its agricultural, construction and hospitality businesses, all of which depend on immigrant labor.The state's demographics also work against a highly conservative approach to immigration: A recent study showed that 7 percent of California's population, or about 2.6 million people, are living in the country illegally.The California Republican party has suffered years of damage politically from prior efforts to crack down on illegal immigration to the state, including backing a 1994 ballot initiative that would have denied public education, health care and other services the undocumented.Simply calling on Congress to pass reform would not erase all those years worth of mistrust and animosity, but it is the right thing to do, Cannella said. 'REPUBLICANS CARE ABOUT YOU'Republican State Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, who represents parts of San Diego County, said he wanted to send Latinos the message that his party understands their concerns.""To the Spanish speakers of California: Republicans care about you,"" Chavez said, before reading somewhat haltingly from a statement in Spanish.Failing to address immigration reform would have economic implications as well as political ones, said Robert Lapsley, president of the Business Roundtable of California, who also spoke at the event.""If we don't get this done, it's going to impact our entire economy,"" Lapsley said.Throughout the nation in recent months, representatives of industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor have been lobbying Republican representatives to support reform.In Minnesota, business executives have peppered Republican U.S. Representative John Kline with questions on immigration at several private events, said Bill Blazar, a vice president at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce.In Colorado, a group of six business executives who collectively donated nearly $500,000 to Republicans in the 2012 election wrote a letter in July to the state's four Republican House members last month urging them to support changes in immigration laws.In Arizona, where state law requires police to question those they stop and suspect of being in the country illegally about their immigration status, business leaders have argued that a hard-line stance is not the political winner it once was.In California, the farm, hospitality and construction businesses could not survive ""without the hard work and skill provided by immigrant communities,"" said State Senator Tom Berryhill, a fourth-generation farmer and the son of a former Secretary of Agriculture.""For Congress to put off once again enacting a policy that allows a reasonable path to citizenship for a group of people that contribute so much to the California economy is just wrong,"" said Berryhill, who represents parts of the Sierra Nevada and the agricultural San Joaquin Valley.

5482	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/obama-gun-policy_n_3105547.html	Opinion	1	Gun Rights Regulation	National Security	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- It ended in a flash. Months of work aimed at revamping the nation's gun laws prompted by one of the worst shooting tragedies in U.S. history met an inglorious conclusion on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Wednesday.  Every single measure pushed by President Barack Obama -- expanded background checks, a strengthened federal gun trafficking statute, limits on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines -- failed to receive the necessary 60 votes to prevent a filibuster. By the time all seven amendments (including those sponsored by Republicans) had been rejected, family members of gun violence victims were left sorrowed, the president was left seething and advocates for the bills were left searching for explanations.   ""I'm going to keep on fighting,"" Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), sponsor of the background check bill, told The Huffington Post in an interview shortly after the votes. ""The only thing I've said is I cannot knowingly put a loophole in a gun show or an Internet sale just for the sake of getting a vote. I cannot do that. But if there is some wording that would prohibit someone from misinterpreting what we are trying to do ... I'm more than willing to listen to that and work with them.""The background check bill, Manchin noted, had been his ""coming out party"" in the Senate -- the first high-profile piece of legislation in his 2 1/2 years in the chamber. That it ended with a thud perplexed him. ""The pressure! Oh, the outside pressures,"" Manchin said of the forces that ultimately felled him. ""I guess sometimes the trappings of being in elected office are overwhelming."" For the West Virginia Democrat and others, there was simply no good answer to the question of what could have been done differently. At least not in the immediate aftermath of the defeat The president had barnstormed the country and lobbied lawmakers on the phone. Allied groups had run ad campaigns and organized in congressional districts. One group had even injected itself into a special election. The administration's gun working group could have moved a bit quicker in making legislative recommendations. But only by weeks.""I’ve heard the theory advanced that if he just moved quickly, Congress would have been forced to act,"" said David Axelrod, Obama's former top aide. ""But I think the forces of delay would have taken hold anyway.""Democrats could have tried to trade the assault weapons ban in negotiations later, rather than discarding it as impossible to pass early on. But, as one leadership aide said, ""No one would take it seriously as a bargaining chip."" In the end, the Senate -- where members from rural areas have just as much sway as their colleagues from heavily-populated states -- proved to be the cooling saucer it has always been, much to the chagrin of those who expected this time to be different. Obama was ""tremendously committed and emotionally engaged"" in the gun debate, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who shepherded Newtown families through the halls of Congress in the days before the vote. And while the debate moved far over the past four months, he added, in the end ""the NRA has exercised a stranglehold.""Speaking in the Rose Garden later Wednesday, Obama was far less courteous with his ire. Word had just come that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) would pull the entire gun bill from the floor on Thursday. Surrounded by family members of gun violence victims, Obama called the outcome ""shameful."" ""There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn’t do this,"" said Obama. ""It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment."" Hours earlier, on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, the scene was somber. Those same family members trickled out of the Senate, their emotions ranging from disappointment to rage.  ""I'm more aware than anyone in this entire world that background checks wouldn't have saved my mom,"" said Erica Lafferty, whose mother Dawn Hochsprung was killed in the Newtown shootings. ""But background checks might make sure that another 27-year-old doesn't have to get buried.""  Lafferty, whose eyes filled with tears as she spoke, was referring to Vicki Soto, a teacher killed in the Newtown shootings. Soto's sister Carlee was on Capitol Hill to watch the vote, too. And although she had conditioned herself for disappointment, she couldn't hide her sorrow over the outcome. Having met with a number of senators in the days leading up to the vote, she couldn't wrap her head around their reasons for opposition.   ""It's too much paperwork. It's too time-consuming,"" Soto said, voice rising, of criticisms over background check legislation. ""Time-consuming? The Newtown shootings took three minutes. You can't take three minutes out of your day to fill out a background check? That's nonsense. And it's disgusting.""  Some people had gripes with specific senators. Pam Simon, a former aide to former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) who was shot two times in the 2011 Tucson massacre, said she was ""extremely proud"" of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for supporting the background checks bill. As for Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a close friend of Giffords who voted against the measure, she had to censor her opinions. Asked what she thought about Flake's vote, Simon only smiled and said, ""That I can say into your microphone?""  ""I reminded him that he has a poster on his office wall of 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,'"" Simon said, adding. ""He needs to re-watch that movie.""  As lawmakers filtered out of the chamber, they commiserated with the disappointed. Soto collapsed in tears into the arms of Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). ""We're not giving up,"" Soto told him. ""We're not going away.""Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) put her hand on Simon's shoulder. ""Don't give up and don't give in,"" she said. ""The gun industry does not control America.""  Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) hugged several of those in attendance. ""This is just the beginning,"" he offered. Giffords, who sat in the Senate during the failed vote, told reporters she was still ""optimistic” about future action. At the White House later, the president pledged to her and others that this wouldn't be the last legislative push for background checks during his term, an administration aide confirmed. Reid left the door open to revisiting the measure too, using a procedural motion that allows him to bring the bill back up if lawmakers want to take another crack it.Still, there was little in the way of encouragement that anyone, even the president, could offer the family members, except the promise to renew the legislative fight later. The Senate was a stubborn institution, they all explained. And it might take changing its membership to pave the way for anything to happen. ""Until people start losing their jobs over these issues it is going to be very hard to defeat the NRA,"" conceded Axelrod.   "

""I hope it will not affect the business-like character of our relations with the U.S. and I hope that our partners will understand that.""U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that though the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, it wants Moscow to comply with common law practices between countries where fugitives are concerned.Putin's staunch refusal to consider Snowden's extradition reflects the Russian president's readiness to further challenge Washington at a time when U.S.-Russian relations are already strained over Syria and a Russian ban on adoptions by Americans.A Kremlin decision to provide even temporary shelter and safe transit to Snowden would embarrass Washington. And despite Putin's denial, analysts believe Russian special services wouldn't miss the chance to question the man who is believed to hold reams of classified U.S. documents.Russia also relished using Snowden's revelations to try to turn the tables on U.S. criticism of Russia's rights record.Putin compared Snowden to WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who has been provided asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, saying that both men were labeled criminals but consider themselves rights activists and champions of freedom of information.""Ask yourself a question: should people like that be extradited so that they put them in prison or not?"" he said. ""In any case, I would prefer not to deal with such issues. It's like shearing a piglet: a lot of squealing and little wool.""In an apparent reference to claims that Moscow could have played a role in Snowden's exit from Hong Kong, he said that his arrival was a ""complete surprise"" and dismissed accusations against Russia as ""ravings and sheer nonsense.""""He doesn't need a visa or any other documents, and as a transit passenger he has the right to buy a ticket and fly wherever he wants,"" Putin said.Russian news media had reported Snowden remained in a transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, but journalists there haven't seen him.Legally, an arriving air passenger ""crosses the border"" after clearing immigration checks.Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected the U.S. push for Snowden's extradition earlier Tuesday, but wouldn't specify his whereabouts, saying only that he hasn't crossed the Russian border.""We consider the attempts to accuse Russia of violating U.S. laws and even some sort of conspiracy, which on top of all that are accompanied by threats, as absolutely ungrounded and unacceptable,"" Lavrov said. ""There are no legal grounds for such conduct by U.S. officials.""U.S. and Ecuadorean officials had said they believed Snowden was still in Russia.Kerry called for ""calm and reasonableness.""""We would hope that Russia would not side with someone who is `a fugitive' from justice,' "" Kerry said at a news conference in Saudi Arabia.The U.S. has revoked Snowden's passport.A representative of WikiLeaks has been traveling with Snowden, and the organization is believed to be assisting him in arranging asylum. Assange, the group's founder, said Monday that Snowden was only passing through Russia and had applied for asylum in Ecuador, Iceland and possibly other countries.A high-ranking Ecuadorean official told The Associated Press that Russia and Ecuador were discussing where Snowden could go, saying the process could take days. He also said Ecuador's ambassador to Moscow had not seen or spoken to Snowden. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, hailed Snowden on Monday as ""a man attempting to bring light and transparency to facts that affect everyone's fundamental liberties.""""We're following all the appropriate legal channels and working with various other countries to make sure that the rule of law is observed,"" President Barack Obama told reporters.The Kremlin has previously said Russia would be ready to consider Snowden's request for asylum.Snowden is a former CIA employee who later was hired as a contractor for the NSA. In that job, he gained access to documents that he gave to newspapers the Guardian and The Washington Post to expose what he contends are privacy violations by an authoritarian government.Snowden also told the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong that ""the NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cellphone companies to steal all of your SMS data."" He is believed to have more than 200 additional sensitive documents in laptops he is carrying.Some observers said in addition to the sensitive data, Snowden's revelations have provided the Kremlin with propaganda arguments to counter the U.S. criticism of Russia's crackdown on opposition and civil activists under Putin.""They would use Snowden to demonstrate that the U.S. government doesn't sympathize with the ideals of freedom of information, conceals key information from the public and stands ready to open criminal proceedings against those who oppose it,"" Konstantin Remchukov, the editor of independent daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, said on Ekho Moskvy radio.Putin has accused the U.S. State Department of instigating protests in Moscow against his re-election for a third term in March and has taken an anti-American posture that plays well with his core support base of industrial workers and state employees.____Huuhtanen reported from from Naantali, Finland.

North Korea deems its nuclear arms a ""treasured sword"" and has vowed never to give them up.Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, ending a trip to the region dominated by concern about North Korea, stressed his interest in a diplomatic solution.""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang,"" he said. ""North Korea must take meaningful steps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of international behavior.""On Sunday evening, Kerry appeared to open the door to talking without requiring the North to take denuclearization steps in advance. Beijing, he said, could be an intermediary.But on Monday White House spokesman Jay Carney said North Korea would have to ""commit itself in a verifiable way to denuclearization"" first, which has long been the U.S. position.""If North Korea shows that it's serious about pursuing that path, then negotiations are the course through which that can be achieved,"" Carney told reporters.Earlier, Kerry said he believed China, the North's sole economic and political benefactor, should put ""some teeth"" in efforts to persuade Pyongyang to alter its policies.The Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, warned on Monday that tensions could get out of control.""It does not matter if it is intentional or accidental, even the smallest thing could cause the situation to change rapidly and perhaps get totally out of control,"" the paper said. ON GUARDSouth Korean and U.S. officials said last week North Korea appeared set to test-launch a medium-range missile as a show of strength linked to Monday's anniversary of the birth of North Korean state founder Kim Il-Sung.North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests but it was not believed to be near weapons capability.South Korea said it remained on guard against any missile launch and it regretted the North's rejection of an offer of talks made last week by President Park Geun-hye. It said the offer would remain on the table.Missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea are both banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions, which were expanded after its third nuclear test, in February.President Barack Obama is under pressure from Republicans in Congress to respond forcefully should North Korea launch a missile.""I maintain that the United States should treat any North Korean missile launch as a threat to our national security and our allies, and that we should shoot it down once it leaves North Korean airspace,"" said Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who is influential on defense issues.The aim of the North's aggressive acts, analysts say, is to bolster the leadership of Kim Jong-un, the 30-year-old grandson of the nation's founder, or to force the United States to hold talks with the North.The North has also been angry about annual military exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces, describing them as a ""hostile"" act. The United States dispatched B52 and B2 stealth bombers from their bases to take part.Yoji Koda, a former commander in chief of the Japanese naval fleet, told Reuters he believed North Korea's threats were part of a ""calculated provocation"", not a prelude to an attack.He said indications the United States was softening a forceful stance to the North had given its leader Kim Jong-un the opportunity to tone things down.""This has enabled North Korea to declare victory and sheathe its swords,"" he said.Kim Il-Sung led his country from its founding in 1948 through the 1950-53 Korean War and until he died in 1994. His son, Kim Jong-il, then took over.KCNA, the North's news agency, reported that people were flocking to a statue of Kim Il-Sung, saying, ""My father, our great leader"".""This sincere expression comes from the bottom of their hearts,"" it said.Kim Jong-un, the third Kim to rule in Pyongyang, attended a midnight celebration of his father's and grandfather's rule with top officials, including his kingmaker uncle Jang Song-thaek.North Korean defectors said army units were expected to contribute for the celebration of Kim's birthday and in turn, the government, which has struggled to feed its people, had handed out extra rations of rice and corn.""People are decorating streets for political events. It's never like war time,"" said Seo Jae-pyoung, a defector who lives in South Korea who spoke last week to an acquaintance in the North. ""The government, which normally can't distribute rice, has already given about one week or two week's special rations.""North Korea has repeatedly stressed that it fears the United States wants to invade it and has manipulated the United Nations to weaken it. During the weekend, the North rejected the overture by new South Korean President Park as a ""cunning"" ploy.""We will expand in quantity our nuclear weapons capability, which is the treasure of a unified Korea ... that we would never barter at any price,"" Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's titular head of state, told a gathering of officials and service personnel applauding the achievements of Kim Il-Sung.

On the way out of the briefing, she said the participants appeared ""evenly divided"" on whether to give Obama approval.None expressed doubts that Syria had engaged in chemical warfare. ""The searing image of babies lined up dead, that's what I can't get out of my mind right now,"" Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz said after the closed-door briefing.But the credibility of the administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important issue than the nature and usefulness of the response.Earlier in the day, Secretary of State John Kerry invoked the crimes of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein and warned of a potential threat to Israel a day after Obama's decision to delay an imminent attack on Syrian targets and allow Congress to vote on it first.Even as Kerry took to the airwaves touting new evidence that deadly sarin gas was used in the Aug. 21 chemical attack near Damascus, the scope of the challenge confronting the administration became apparent.Lawmakers raised a broad array of concerns, including the potential effectiveness of limited strikes, the possible unintended consequence of dragging the United States into another open-ended Middle East conflict, the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden and the war fatigue of the American public.Many in Congress have been able to avoid taking a position on the merits of a military strike, focusing instead on demands that Obama consult them and seek their approval.While Kerry predicted Obama would win the endorsement he wants, a growing cacophony of congressional critics - ranging from liberal Democratic doves to Republican Tea Party conservatives - illustrated just how hard that will be.At the same time, Kerry, the administration's most impassioned voice for intervention in Syria's 2-1/2-year civil war, was left to publicly defend Obama's stunning reversal, a decision that puts any strike on hold for at least nine days.""This is squarely now in the hands of Congress,"" Kerry told CNN, saying he had confidence ""they will do what is right because they understand the stakes.""In a round of television appearances, Kerry declined to say whether Obama would go ahead with military action if Congress rejects the president's request, as Britain's parliament did last week to derail London's role in any Syria military operation.But, echoing Obama's comments in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, he insisted the president had the right to act on his own if he chooses that course.Obama is taking a gamble by putting the brakes on the military assault that he considers essential to maintain U.S. credibility after Assad crossed the ""red line"" set against the use of chemical weapons. MORE EVIDENCEThe consensus on Capitol Hill is that Obama has a good chance of winning approval in the Democratic-led Senate, but the vote appears too close to call in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where the president's opponents rarely miss an opportunity to block him.Acknowledging that the administration has its work cut out for it to persuade some lawmakers, Kerry insisted they could not ""have it both ways"" by demanding a voice in the matter and then abdicating responsibility to uphold the international bans on chemical weapons use.Kerry used the television appearances to provide further evidence backing accusations against the Syrian government.""I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin,"" Kerry told CNN's ""State of the Union.""It was the first time the administration had pinpointed what kind of chemical was used in the attack on a rebel-held area, which U.S. intelligence agencies said killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children.""So this case is building and this case will build,"" Kerry told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" OBAMA'S DILEMMAObama's efforts are sure to be hampered by his dismal relations with congressional Republicans. Another bitter face-off on government spending is looming this autumn.Lawmakers for the most part welcomed Obama's decision to consult them, but looked in no hurry to reconvene early from their summer recess, which lasts until Sept. 9.Comments from leading Republicans and Democrats indicated how complex the debate will be - and raised doubts whether Obama would win their authorization.Underscoring a sense of wariness even from Obama's traditional allies, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said the Vermont Democrat believes that the use-of-force resolution offered by the White House is too broad and that new language will be written for consideration.Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN: ""I think there are some real challenges. I think that at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion. This is a national security issue.""Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, speaking on NBC, took a more skeptical view.While saying he was ""proud"" of Obama for coming to Congress for authority, Paul said, ""It's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down the involvement in the Syrian war.""""I think the Senate will rubber stamp what he wants,"" he said. ""The House will be a much closer vote."" The Senate is controlled by Obama's Democratic Party, the House is in the hands of the Republican Party.Republican Senator John McCain said he was not sure Obama's request would pass, but made clear his view that tougher military action was needed than the limited cruise missile strikes that the Obama administration is preparing.Republican Representative Peter King of New York said it was unclear if lawmakers would sign off on an attack on Syria, but he warned Obama may have to overcome ""the isolationist wing"" of the Republican Party to prevail.Seeking to lay the groundwork for what is expected to be a heated congressional debate, Kerry tipped his hand on one tactic the administration will use - linking the congressional vote to safeguarding U.S. ally Israel from the Syrian chemical weapons threat.""I don't think they will want to vote, ultimately, to put Israel at risk,"" Kerry said.Lawmakers of both major political parties recognize how important it is to be seen as defenders of Israel, especially at election time, when they compete to show voters who is a better friend of the Jewish state.

For nearly five years, she has not lived in the same country as her husband, a career diplomat who specializes in the Middle East and South Asia.After militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Yemen last September, breaking through to the inner building and ripping plaques and lettering from the walls, Feierstein called his wife to tell her he was OK.He had also called her a few years earlier when he was based in Islamabad, Pakistan, and a bomb went off near his residence. He was unhurt in that attack.But when Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - considered by U.S. officials to be al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate - offered 3 kg of gold last December for the killing of Feierstein, it was Mary's turn to call her husband.

FIVE-FOLD INCREASE IN UNACCOMPANIED DIPLOMATSThe State Department says there are about 1,100 U.S. foreign service officers now at posts abroad where they are unaccompanied or there are limits on who can accompany them - usually meaning no children.That is a five-fold increase in unaccompanied American diplomats over the past decade, and represents about 14 percent of U.S. foreign service officers serving overseas.The change began with ""civilian surges"" into the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan to help with stabilization and reconstruction. Over 400 unaccompanied diplomats are in those countries.Then, the Arab Spring uprisings starting in 2011 added many unstable countries to the list where the State Department did not want to send families.The fluctuating list now includes Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya and Tunisia, as well as the new African state of South Sudan, the State Department said.The U.S. embassies in Algeria, Sudan and Lebanon are in the ""limited accompanied"" category as is the U.S. Consulate in Mexico's third-largest city, Monterrey, a focal point for drug-related violence.The risks to diplomats are not all external. A 2007 State Department survey said 17 percent of employees who had served in dangerous posts indicated some symptoms similar to those of post-traumatic stress disorder. The department, following the military's lead, has set up a program to help diagnose and treat PTSD in its employees.Mary Feierstein realized she was one of an expanding group of left-behind relatives when she started attending the year-end holiday parties the State Department throws for them, and noticed the crowd getting bigger every year.She also noticed a lot of small children at those parties, and admitted to thinking, ""At least my kids are grown."" Her children, two daughters and a son, are all in their 20s. Her son has served two tours of duty with the Marines in Iraq.Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the holiday parties, at which some of the unaccompanied diplomats were Skyped in from abroad. Feierstein said she thought Obama should attend too.The president did call Gerald Feierstein to thank him for his service after the Yemen embassy was attacked last Sept. 13, two days after the Benghazi assaults. 'NEW NORM'The United States used to be quicker to evacuate its embassies and consulates when dangers arose, said Susan Johnson, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the official union representing the Foreign Service.These days, Washington tries to manage risks by building up the physical security of posts and increasing diplomatic security personnel, she said.""In the process, we seem to have built a new level of tolerance for the amount of risk our diplomats face,"" Johnson said, adding that unaccompanied tours were increasingly becoming ""a new norm.""There is pressure on diplomats to do the dangerous tours in order to advance. It is perceived to be ""almost mandatory"" to serve at an unaccompanied post and ""punch that ticket"" during a Foreign Service career, she said.The State Department said 20 percent of its current employees had served in Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan.The department offers incentives such as danger pay and shorter tours. Unaccompanied posts can be just 12 months, with several breaks, and families can often be left behind at a previous post to minimize disruption.The State Department has made considerable progress in supporting employees in unaccompanied posts, its inspector general said in a 2010 report.

That suggested Venezuela may help Snowden, who is stranded in Moscow after flying there from Hong Kong on June 23, to find a safe haven.Snowden's bid for Icelandic citizenship hit an impasse earlier on Friday when the country's parliament voted not to debate it before the summer recess.Afterwards, WikiLeaks announced that Snowden had applied to another six countries for asylum, adding to a list of more than a dozen countries which he has already asked for protection.The anti-secrecy organization, which has been supporting Snowden's efforts to find a safe haven since his exit from Hong Kong 12 days ago, said on Twitter it could not reveal the names the countries due to ""attempted U.S. interference"".

Yet the president never mentioned the continuing genocide conducted in several parts of Sudan by President Omar al-Bashir.  There was a time when Mr. Obama expressed outrage over the mass murder and aerial bombardment of civilians in the Darfur region of western Sudan. In 2007, the then-presidential hopeful said the Western world's silence regarding the slaughter in Sudan would leave ""a stain on our souls.""  Now President Obama has joined that silence. These days, to learn about what is transpiring in Sudan, one must turn to Radio Dabanga, broadcasting from Denmark. A recent report described the bombardment of a Darfur village called Abu Tega, which was ""completely burned and the population fled in all directions.""  President Obama's critics have denounced his foreign-policy choices, which they believe have weakened the global credibility of the U.S. But Mr. Obama has managed to avoid scrutiny about his most tragic foreign failure: standing by as Sudan's Islamic regime perpetrates a slaughter against its own citizens who belong to non-Arab ethnic groups. Bashir continues a 10-year annihilation, slaughtering many tens of thousands, and very likely more.  Previous American presidents have betrayed a similar callous disregard for the taking of human life. Most notably Bill Clinton, who did nothing to stop genocidal assaults in Rwanda, where the Hutus slaughtered 800,000 Tutsis in 1994. Mr. Clinton has come to see this inaction as his most historic dereliction of duty. He has since admitted that the international community was complicit in mass murder abroad when the U.S. could have acted to save a few hundred thousand lives.  ""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began,"" Mr. Clinton said on a reconciliation tour in Rwanda in 1998. ""We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. ... We owe to all the people in the world our best efforts to organize ourselves so that we can maximize the chances of preventing these events.""  Mr. Clinton's regrets offer a cautionary tale. President Obama and his current National Security Adviser Susan Rice would agree -- or at least they did when in 2007, they separately condemned the Bush administration for its inaction in Sudan, specifically citing the Clinton administration's failure in Rwanda. Both proclaimed that the U.S. should never again fail to intervene when innocents are being slaughtered.  Mr. Obama has cited humanitarian reasons to intervene in a crisis when politically convenient. He entered Libya ""to prevent a bloodbath,"" despite no mass slaughter of civilians in the country. This disingenuous explanation only damaged his credibility as a humanitarian, though it did placate the international human-rights community.  So why does Sudan not deserve the same consideration? An enormous number of civilian lives are at stake in Darfur. Bashir's assaults against the people of Sudan have escalated in intensity. Some three million people are living -- if you can even call it that -- in refugee camps with wretched conditions. They lack even food, water, sanitation and basic medical attention. Hundreds of thousands of children are growing up malnourished with stunted growth and damaged cognitive abilities. If they survive, they are left without an education to a lifetime of suffering, with many likely eventually succumbing to disease.  And the camps are hardly safe. Bashir's henchmen continue to attack them, and torch villages and fields, indiscriminately murder roughly 10,000 people per month. Still more Darfuris continue to die from disease and other causes at alarming rates, with the dead no longer even counted. The world is unaware of the carnage because the region is closed to the international community and media. Even many key U.N. and humanitarian personnel have been expelled recently.  There is a moral imperative to help the people of Darfur, which President Obama once articulated well. In 2007 he said, ""Today we know what is right, and today we know what is wrong. The slaughter of innocents is wrong. Two million people driven from their homes is wrong. Women gang raped while gathering firewood is wrong. And silence, acquiescence and paralysis in the face of genocide is wrong."" He made his solution clear: ""We've got to have a protective force on the ground.""  Yet those suffering in Darfur can expect no such ""protective force."" For reasons that are unclear, Sudan doesn't meet Mr. Obama's threshold for action. His words at the U.N., including generic rhetoric ""that it is in our interest to see a Middle East and North Africa that is peaceful and prosperous,"" offer little hope if any. Mr. Obama has abandoned his own moral standards and left the people of Darfur to perish.  ______________  Ms. Farrow, an activist and actor, is filming ""The Darfur Archives,"" documenting the cultural traditions of the Darfur tribes targeted for elimination.

The Americans try to play with words and pretend that they've become involved in this case for humanitarian aims,"" Khamenei told a meeting of the Assembly of Experts, a state body.""I believe the Americans are making mistakes in Syria and they have felt the impact and will certainly suffer loss,"" he said in the speech, whose text was published on his official website.Khamenei's words indicate no let-up in Iran's considerable support for Syrian President Bashar al Assad, its closest ally who stands accused by Western powers of launching poison gas into an embattled suburb of Damascus on Aug. 21. Around 1,400 people were killed, according to U.S. officials.On Wednesday, the head of Iran's elite Quds force, Qassem Soleimani, told the Assembly of Experts that the Islamic Republic would ""support Syria to the end"", according to the Fars news agency.But Iran's response to the chemical attack in recent days hints at disagreement within the corridors of power.In contrast to military commanders, the government of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, has condemned the use of chemical weapons and warned against military strikes in Syria, but not apportioned blame for the attack.Assad's government has denied responsibility, blaming what it calls a provocation by Syrian rebel forces aimed at provoking foreign military intervention on their side in the two-and-a-half-year-old conflict.(Reporting by Marcus George; editing by Mark Heinrich)"

On the way out of the briefing, she said the participants appeared ""evenly divided"" on whether to give Obama approval.None expressed doubts that Syria had engaged in chemical warfare. ""The searing image of babies lined up dead, that's what I can't get out of my mind right now,"" Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz said after the closed-door briefing.But the credibility of the administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important issue than the nature and usefulness of the response.Earlier in the day, Secretary of State John Kerry invoked the crimes of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein and warned of a potential threat to Israel a day after Obama's decision to delay an imminent attack on Syrian targets and allow Congress to vote on it first.Even as Kerry took to the airwaves touting new evidence that deadly sarin gas was used in the Aug. 21 chemical attack near Damascus, the scope of the challenge confronting the administration became apparent.Lawmakers raised a broad array of concerns, including the potential effectiveness of limited strikes, the possible unintended consequence of dragging the United States into another open-ended Middle East conflict, the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden and the war fatigue of the American public.Many in Congress have been able to avoid taking a position on the merits of a military strike, focusing instead on demands that Obama consult them and seek their approval.While Kerry predicted Obama would win the endorsement he wants, a growing cacophony of congressional critics - ranging from liberal Democratic doves to Republican Tea Party conservatives - illustrated just how hard that will be.At the same time, Kerry, the administration's most impassioned voice for intervention in Syria's 2-1/2-year civil war, was left to publicly defend Obama's stunning reversal, a decision that puts any strike on hold for at least nine days.""This is squarely now in the hands of Congress,"" Kerry told CNN, saying he had confidence ""they will do what is right because they understand the stakes.""In a round of television appearances, Kerry declined to say whether Obama would go ahead with military action if Congress rejects the president's request, as Britain's parliament did last week to derail London's role in any Syria military operation.But, echoing Obama's comments in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, he insisted the president had the right to act on his own if he chooses that course.Obama is taking a gamble by putting the brakes on the military assault that he considers essential to maintain U.S. credibility after Assad crossed the ""red line"" set against the use of chemical weapons. MORE EVIDENCEThe consensus on Capitol Hill is that Obama has a good chance of winning approval in the Democratic-led Senate, but the vote appears too close to call in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where the president's opponents rarely miss an opportunity to block him.Acknowledging that the administration has its work cut out for it to persuade some lawmakers, Kerry insisted they could not ""have it both ways"" by demanding a voice in the matter and then abdicating responsibility to uphold the international bans on chemical weapons use.Kerry used the television appearances to provide further evidence backing accusations against the Syrian government.""I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin,"" Kerry told CNN's ""State of the Union.""It was the first time the administration had pinpointed what kind of chemical was used in the attack on a rebel-held area, which U.S. intelligence agencies said killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children.""So this case is building and this case will build,"" Kerry told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" OBAMA'S DILEMMAObama's efforts are sure to be hampered by his dismal relations with congressional Republicans. Another bitter face-off on government spending is looming this autumn.Lawmakers for the most part welcomed Obama's decision to consult them, but looked in no hurry to reconvene early from their summer recess, which lasts until Sept. 9.Comments from leading Republicans and Democrats indicated how complex the debate will be - and raised doubts whether Obama would win their authorization.Underscoring a sense of wariness even from Obama's traditional allies, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said the Vermont Democrat believes that the use-of-force resolution offered by the White House is too broad and that new language will be written for consideration.Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN: ""I think there are some real challenges. I think that at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion. This is a national security issue.""Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, speaking on NBC, took a more skeptical view.While saying he was ""proud"" of Obama for coming to Congress for authority, Paul said, ""It's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down the involvement in the Syrian war.""""I think the Senate will rubber stamp what he wants,"" he said. ""The House will be a much closer vote."" The Senate is controlled by Obama's Democratic Party, the House is in the hands of the Republican Party.Republican Senator John McCain said he was not sure Obama's request would pass, but made clear his view that tougher military action was needed than the limited cruise missile strikes that the Obama administration is preparing.Republican Representative Peter King of New York said it was unclear if lawmakers would sign off on an attack on Syria, but he warned Obama may have to overcome ""the isolationist wing"" of the Republican Party to prevail.Seeking to lay the groundwork for what is expected to be a heated congressional debate, Kerry tipped his hand on one tactic the administration will use - linking the congressional vote to safeguarding U.S. ally Israel from the Syrian chemical weapons threat.""I don't think they will want to vote, ultimately, to put Israel at risk,"" Kerry said.Lawmakers of both major political parties recognize how important it is to be seen as defenders of Israel, especially at election time, when they compete to show voters who is a better friend of the Jewish state.

Washington and its allies are intrigued but still wary, making clear they hope to see tangible steps to back up his words.Speaking to the U.S. network at his presidential compound in Tehran, Rouhani said the tone of a letter he had received from President Barack Obama, part of a recent exchange of messages between the leaders, was ""positive and constructive.""""It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,"" Rouhani said six days before he is due to address the U.N. General Assembly, a speech that will be closely watched for fresh diplomatic overtures.Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said that nuclear weapons development would be inconsistent with Islamic values. But a willingness by a newly elected president to rule out nuclear arms could help provide a new opening in long-stalled international nuclear talks.Questions remain about how much bargaining room Khamenei, a staunch promoter of Iran's nuclear program, will give his negotiators, whether in secret talks with Washington or in multilateral discussions with major powers.Comments on Tuesday by Khamenei about the need for ""flexibility"" suggests a new willingness at the highest level to explore a compromise solution to Tehran's dispute with the West. 'COMPLETE AUTHORITY'""This government enters with full power and has complete authority,"" Rouhani said, according to an NBC translation. ""I have given the nuclear negotiations portfolio to foreign ministry. The problem won't be from our side. We have sufficient political latitude to solve this problem.""The White House responded cautiously.""The world has heard a lot from President Rouhani's administration about its desire to improve the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's relations with the international community, and President Obama believes we should test that assertion,"" White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said.""We hope that this new Iranian government will engage substantively in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program.""The United States and its allies suspect Iran is seeking bomb-making capability despite Tehran's insistence that its program has only peaceful aims. Israel, believed to be the Middle East's only nuclear weapons power, has repeatedly called for a credible military threat to halt Iran's nuclear advance.Since Rouhani was elected president in June, the centrist cleric has called for ""constructive interaction"" with the world, a dramatic shift in tone from the strident anti-Western rhetoric of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Obama said in a television interview on Tuesday that he was prepared to test Rouhani's willingness to open a nuclear dialogue, but he did not back away from previous U.S. demands.The United States and Iran cut diplomatic relations in 1980, after students and Islamic militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took American diplomats hostage.Obama ran for president in 2008 in part by vowing to engage with Iran. But Tehran continued its nuclear development and tough sanctions imposed by Washington and the United Nations have taken a severe toll on Iran's economy."

General Assembly to announce Brazil would adopt legislation and technology to protect it from illegal interception of communications.Rousseff last week called off a high-profile state visit to the United States scheduled for October over reports that the U.S. National Security Agency had been spying on Brazil and Rousseff's email.After opening with diplomatic pleasantries and a condemnation of the shopping mall attack in Kenya, Rousseff launched into a blistering attack on U.S. spying, calling espionage among friendly nations ""totally unacceptable.""""Meddling in such a manner in the lives and affairs of other countries is a breach of international law and, as such, it is an affront to the principles that should otherwise govern relations among countries, especially among friendly nations,"" Rousseff told the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.U.S. President Barack Obama was en route to the United Nations while Rousseff spoke. He then followed Rousseff on the podium as the first and second national leaders to address the General Assembly.Postponing the state visit, which as to have included a dinner at the White House, was a rare and diplomatically severe snub by Brazil. No new date has been set.The report by Brazil Globo's news program Fantastico on National Security Agency spying was based on documents that journalist Glenn Greenwald obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Greenwald, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, was one of the journalists to first report Snowden's leaks of classified information on previously secret U.S. telephone and internet surveillance efforts.Rousseff's state visit was conceived to highlight cooperation between the two biggest economies in the Americas and Brazil's emergence over the past decade as a regional power.Rousseff said Brazil will adopt legislation and technology to protect it from illegal interception of communications."

Just like with the Guardian and the Washington Post, I only work with journalists,"" he said in response to a question from The Guardian's Spencer Ackerman.Responding to a similar query, Snowden painted the spy allegations as an attempt to destroy his character:This is a predictable smear that I anticipated before going public, as the US media has a knee-jerk ""RED CHINA!"" reaction to anything involving HK or the PRC, and is intended to distract from the issue of US government misconduct. Ask yourself: if I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly into Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now.Snowden also appeared defiant in the face of calls for his prosecution.""The U.S. government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped,"" he said. He added the government ""immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home,"" by labeling him a traitor, and indicated he would not return to the U.S. voluntarily.Congressional leaders have called Snowden a traitor for revealing once-secret surveillance programs two weeks ago in the Guardian and The Washington Post. The National Security Agency programs collect records of millions of Americans' telephone calls and Internet usage as a counterterror tool. The disclosures revealed the scope of the collections, which surprised many Americans and have sparked debate about how much privacy the government can take away in the name of national security.""It would be foolish to volunteer yourself to"" possible arrest and criminal charges ""if you can do more good outside of prison than in it,"" he said.The Guardian announced its website was hosting an online chat with Snowden, in hiding in Hong Kong, with reporter Glenn Greenwald receiving and posting his questions. The Associated Press couldn't independently verify that the man answering the questions was indeed Snowden.Snowden was working as a contractor for NSA at the time he had access to the then-secret programs. He defended his actions and said he considered what to reveal and what not to, saying he did not reveal any U.S. operations against what he called legitimate military targets, but instead showed the NSA is hacking civilian infrastructure like universities and private businesses.""These nakedly, aggressively criminal acts are wrong no matter the target. Not only that, when NSA makes a technical mistake during an exploitation operation, critical systems crash,"" he said, though he gave no examples of what systems have crashed or in which countries.""Congress hasn't declared war on the countries – the majority of them are our allies – but without asking for public permission, NSA is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people,"" he said. ""And for what? So we can have secret access to a computer in a country we're not even fighting?""Snowden was referring to PRISM, one of the programs he disclosed. The program sweeps up Internet usage data from all over the world that goes through nine major U.S.-based Internet providers. The NSA can look at foreign usage without any warrants, and says the program doesn't target Americans.U.S. officials say the data-gathering programs are legal and operated under secret court supervision.Snowden explained his claim that from his desk, he could ""wiretap"" any phone call or email – a claim top intelligence officials have denied. ""If an NSA, FBI, CIA, DIA, etc. analyst has access to query raw SIGINT (signals intelligence) databases, they can enter and get results for anything they want,"" he wrote in the answer posted on the Guardian site. ""Phone number, email, user id, cell phone handset id (IMEI), and so on – it's all the same.""The NSA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. But Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that the kind of data that can be accessed and who can access it is severely limited.Snowden said the restrictions on what could be seen by an individual analyst vary according to policy changes, which can happen ""at any time,"" and said that a technical ""filter"" on NSA data gathering meant to filter out U.S. communications is ""weak,"" such that U.S. communications often get ingested.Snowden defended U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning for his disclosures of documents to Wikileaks, which he called a ""legitimate journalistic outlet,"" which ""carefully redacted all of their releases in accordance with a judgment of public interest."" He said the Wikileaks release of unredacted material was ""due to the failure of a partner journalist to control a passphrase,"" which led to the charge against Manning that he dumped the documents, which Snowden called an attempt to smear Manning.Manning is currently on trial at Fort Meade – the same Army base where the NSA is headquartered – on charges of aiding the enemy for releasing documents to Wikileaks.Snowden defended his description of his salary as being $200,000 a year, calling that a ""career high,"" but saying he did take a pay cut to take the job at Booz Allen Hamilton, where he worked as a contractor at an NSA facility in Hawaii. When Booz Allen fired him, they said his salary was $122,000.__On the web:Follow Associated Press reporter Kimberly Dozier on Twitter at http://twitter.com/kimberlydozier"

""I hope it will not affect the business-like character of our relations with the U.S. and I hope that our partners will understand that.""U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that though the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, it wants Moscow to comply with common law practices between countries where fugitives are concerned.Putin's staunch refusal to consider Snowden's extradition reflects the Russian president's readiness to further challenge Washington at a time when U.S.-Russian relations are already strained over Syria and a Russian ban on adoptions by Americans.A Kremlin decision to provide even temporary shelter and safe transit to Snowden would embarrass Washington. And despite Putin's denial, analysts believe Russian special services wouldn't miss the chance to question the man who is believed to hold reams of classified U.S. documents.Russia also relished using Snowden's revelations to try to turn the tables on U.S. criticism of Russia's rights record.Putin compared Snowden to WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who has been provided asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, saying that both men were labeled criminals but consider themselves rights activists and champions of freedom of information.""Ask yourself a question: should people like that be extradited so that they put them in prison or not?"" he said. ""In any case, I would prefer not to deal with such issues. It's like shearing a piglet: a lot of squealing and little wool.""In an apparent reference to claims that Moscow could have played a role in Snowden's exit from Hong Kong, he said that his arrival was a ""complete surprise"" and dismissed accusations against Russia as ""ravings and sheer nonsense.""""He doesn't need a visa or any other documents, and as a transit passenger he has the right to buy a ticket and fly wherever he wants,"" Putin said.Russian news media had reported Snowden remained in a transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, but journalists there haven't seen him.Legally, an arriving air passenger ""crosses the border"" after clearing immigration checks.Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected the U.S. push for Snowden's extradition earlier Tuesday, but wouldn't specify his whereabouts, saying only that he hasn't crossed the Russian border.""We consider the attempts to accuse Russia of violating U.S. laws and even some sort of conspiracy, which on top of all that are accompanied by threats, as absolutely ungrounded and unacceptable,"" Lavrov said. ""There are no legal grounds for such conduct by U.S. officials.""U.S. and Ecuadorean officials had said they believed Snowden was still in Russia.Kerry called for ""calm and reasonableness.""""We would hope that Russia would not side with someone who is `a fugitive' from justice,' "" Kerry said at a news conference in Saudi Arabia.The U.S. has revoked Snowden's passport.A representative of WikiLeaks has been traveling with Snowden, and the organization is believed to be assisting him in arranging asylum. Assange, the group's founder, said Monday that Snowden was only passing through Russia and had applied for asylum in Ecuador, Iceland and possibly other countries.A high-ranking Ecuadorean official told The Associated Press that Russia and Ecuador were discussing where Snowden could go, saying the process could take days. He also said Ecuador's ambassador to Moscow had not seen or spoken to Snowden. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, hailed Snowden on Monday as ""a man attempting to bring light and transparency to facts that affect everyone's fundamental liberties.""""We're following all the appropriate legal channels and working with various other countries to make sure that the rule of law is observed,"" President Barack Obama told reporters.The Kremlin has previously said Russia would be ready to consider Snowden's request for asylum.Snowden is a former CIA employee who later was hired as a contractor for the NSA. In that job, he gained access to documents that he gave to newspapers the Guardian and The Washington Post to expose what he contends are privacy violations by an authoritarian government.Snowden also told the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong that ""the NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cellphone companies to steal all of your SMS data."" He is believed to have more than 200 additional sensitive documents in laptops he is carrying.Some observers said in addition to the sensitive data, Snowden's revelations have provided the Kremlin with propaganda arguments to counter the U.S. criticism of Russia's crackdown on opposition and civil activists under Putin.""They would use Snowden to demonstrate that the U.S. government doesn't sympathize with the ideals of freedom of information, conceals key information from the public and stands ready to open criminal proceedings against those who oppose it,"" Konstantin Remchukov, the editor of independent daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, said on Ekho Moskvy radio.Putin has accused the U.S. State Department of instigating protests in Moscow against his re-election for a third term in March and has taken an anti-American posture that plays well with his core support base of industrial workers and state employees.____Huuhtanen reported from from Naantali, Finland.

Rand Paul of Kentucky remains unequivocal in his opposition, tangling with Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday over constitutional powers and the possibility that a U.S. attack will further destabilize the Mideast. The tea party favorite and leading anti-interventionist in the GOP sees only a downside to a U.S. attack.""There's no sentiment in Kentucky, and the people up here are so out of touch,"" Paul told reporters on a conference call after a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing with Kerry and other national security officials. ""These senators who are going to vote for this, they need to go home and talk to their people or look at what their people are saying because people do not want to get involved in Syria and, despite what the people want, their senators are going to vote the opposite way, I have a bad feeling.""Paul didn't rule out a Senate filibuster of a resolution authorizing the president to use military force.""Whether there is an actual standing filibuster, I've got to check my shoes and see if I can hold my water,"" he said. ""We'll see. I haven't made a decision on that.""Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a fierce foe of Syrian President Bashar Assad, expressed frustration with the Obama administration's handling of Syria and skepticism about U.S. involvement.""When America ignores these problems, these problems don't ignore us,"" Rubio told senior administration officials at the Senate hearing. ""Yes, this is a horrible incident where perhaps 1,000 people died, but before this incident 100,000 people had died ... and nothing happened.""The administration says it has proof that the Assad regime used deadly chemical weapons in an attack on Damascus suburbs and must respond. It places the number killed at 1,429 people, including 426 children. However, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the death toll at 502.Potential Republican presidential candidates hardly want to appear weak on national security, an issue that traditionally has been a strength for the GOP. But no one knows whether the United States would be drawn into a protracted conflict or if limited military steps would prove unsuccessful in the 2-year-old civil war.Any Republican who supports the use of force resolution essentially will be siding with Obama, who is despised in conservative circles, and a vote in favor could anger more isolationist Republicans who are wary of getting involved in another military conflict after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.The votes could dog Republican candidates with voters in early primary states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Even the most nuanced explanation for a vote could be undermined by events on the ground.Yet if Republicans oppose the resolution, they could be accused of giving Assad a pass after his regime used chemical weapons.Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, who managed Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, said a vote in favor of the resolution would be the equivalent of ""a purchase of stock over the long term in Obama's decision-making on Syria.""""Any Republican may go into a vote thinking, `I have given authority for a limited scope of action to the president,' but the reality is you're buying stock in the president's current decisions on Syria and also his future actions in any escalation that may occur,"" Schmidt said.Polls show public opposition to U.S. military intervention in Syria, regardless of whether Syria's government used chemical weapons on its people, and doubts about airstrikes across party lines.A war vote can make or break a candidate. Just ask Hillary Rodham Clinton.In the 2008 Democratic primary, Obama used the October 2002 vote for the Iraq war as a cudgel against Clinton, who along with John Edwards voted to give President George W. Bush the broad authority to invade Iraq. Edwards said his vote was a mistake; Clinton stood by her decision - and never recovered with strong anti-war Democratic voters.Clinton, a potential Democratic candidate in 2016, has not spoken publicly about Obama's attempt to win congressional support for a military strike against Syria. But an aide to Clinton said Tuesday that she supports the president's effort in Congress to pursue a targeted response to the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons.In 2004, the first presidential election since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Democratic primary voters rejected the anti-war candidate, Howard Dean, and nominated John Kerry, the decorated Vietnam War veteran who had backed the Iraq war. Kerry was perceived as the stronger candidate on national security against the incumbent president, but he stumbled in explaining his Iraq war votes, saying he voted for an $87 billion war supplemental ""before I voted against it."" Bush prevailed in the election.For Republicans, the debate over Syria foreshadows a fierce argument in the party over the role of U.S. foreign policy and military involvement after Iraq and Afghanistan. The divisions have been simmering for months.Paul conducted a lengthy Senate filibuster in March to raise concerns over the president's use of aerial drones to kill suspected terrorists, rallying libertarians within the party. Some establishment Republicans opposed the filibuster and pushed back against criticism of the National Security Agency's collection of hundreds of millions of U.S. phone records, saying it was needed to keep Americans safe.In July, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the libertarian strain within the GOP a ""very dangerous thought"" more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. Paul responded, saying Christie was worried about the ""dangers of freedom"" instead of being concerned about losing those freedoms.As Obama has pushed for the U.S. to intervene in Syria, the GOP divisions have emerged.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has expressed skepticism about possible intervention, saying the administration has yet to make a forceful case that it would protect U.S. national security interests.The Syria question is easier to avoid outside Washington.Christie, asked about the Syrian conflict Tuesday, told reporters the ""use of chemical weapons is something that just is intolerable for civilized society,"" but he said he would ""let the policymaking be done by the people who are getting the bulk of the briefing on this, which is our federal representatives."""

Members leaving a closed-door meeting said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told them talks with President Barack Obama on how to end the government shutdown and avert the looming Oct. 17 deadline to raise the nation's borrowing cap, had reached a dead end. There was also concern that the White House might strike a deal with Senate Republicans, who presented their own plan to Obama on Friday. Many lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), said it was now up to their colleagues in the Senate to hold firm so that Republicans in both chambers would appear united.""I'm disappointed that the president has rejected the offer that we put on the table,"" Cantor told reporters after the meeting. ""I know that he's trying to see which Republican senator he can pick off in the Senate. I hope that the Senate Republicans stand strong so we can speak with one voice.""House Republicans had put forward a proposal to extend the debt limit for six weeks and work quickly to reopen the government, if the president agreed to a broader framework for deficit reduction. They presented the plan to Obama in a meeting at the White House Thursday evening. Both sides said afterward that discussions would continue, though neither the White House nor GOP leadership said they were close to a deal.Members suggested both sides wanted to keep the appearance of potential for progress, even though Obama rejected their plan in a phone call with Boehner on Friday.Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) paraphrased Boehner's message to the conference as, ""Every offer we've made, they've just turned us down.""He added it was a ""White House talking point"" that the two sides were still talking.""What [Boehner's] really saying is, 'I'm not shutting the door on further discussions, but right now nothing is happening',"" he said.Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) said the White House requested that House leadership ""stick with the line that talks were proceeding."" ""That line was continued, and then late yesterday afternoon, the president called and they declined every part of the offer,"" he said.An aide to Boehner declined comment.Price said while there was concern over Obama's negotiations with Senate Republicans, he didn't think their plan would pass the upper chamber. Sources told The Huffington Post that a bipartisan group of 10 senators, five from each party, are ironing out the details of a plan floated by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). It would reportedly fund the government through March, raise the debt ceiling through January, give federal agencies flexibility to manage across-the-board cuts caused by sequestration, and delay Obamacare's medical device tax by two years.""I think the timing on that is challenging,"" Price said. ""We want to get back to a regular order process where we're doing appropriations bills and putting Congress' stamp of priorities on the spending of this government.""""We hope that our Senate Republican colleagues stand with us united to force the president to have a conversation,"" he added.Conservative House members outright rejected the Collins' plan and were skeptical it would pass the Senate, let alone the House.""The idea that Susan Collins can dictate what happens in the Senate is kind of silly,"" Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) said. ""They can negotiate all day long, but obviously at the end of the day it has to pass the House."" Fleming said the plan was dead on arrival in the House. ""They're not going to get that, because we're not going to support it,"" he said.UPDATE: 2:05 p.m. -- Senate Democratic leadership rejected the Collins plan Saturday afternoon. A senior Democratic aide said the proposal is pretty unpopular among most Democrats, for two reasons: It locks in the current level of sequestration, minus another $20 billion in 2014, and it makes changes to Obamacare.""Why would Dems ever support that?"" asked the aide. ""It's crazy that it got this far.""Negotiations are now in the hands of Senate leaders Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said McConnell requested a meeting with Reid, and that the two sat down with Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn) in Reid's office Saturday morning to hash out a way forward.The contours of a deal were far from apparent, but Jentleson added both the White House and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) office were ""fully engaged"" as talks progressed.Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting."

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleges that FBI agents and Defense Department employees disclosed Kelley's identity to outside parties, including the news media, and violated her privacy while investigating Petraeus' extramarital relationship with Paula Broadwell, the author of a Petraeus biography. Kelley, who frequently hosted Petraeus and his wife at parties, complained to the FBI that Broadwell had sent her threatening emails, and had viewed Kelley as a potential competitor for Petreaus' affections. The FBI later dropped the investigation without charges.The lawsuit, filed by Kelley and her husband, surgeon Scott Kelley, seeks unspecified monetary damages, a formal apology, and an accounting of the information the FBI and Defense Department gathered about them. The complaint details how the Kelleys' lives were turned upside down once their names were publicly linked to the Petraeus scandal. Click here to read the complaint.In addition to the nonstop media attention, the revelation that Jill Kelley had communicated on a regular basis with both Petraeus and Gen. John Allen led to suggestions she may have had romantic relationships with the commanders. Allen abruptly retired after the disclosure. ""There was no legally acceptable reason for the government to disclose confidential information about the Kelleys and thereby make them part of the public scandal,"" the lawsuit says. Details about the Kelleys' personal lives and their financial difficulties was widely reported.""Mrs. Kelley’s reputation is indelibly tainted,"" the complaint says. ""She is consistently referred to as the 'center' of the 'sex scandal' and is often portrayed as the woman who brought down two American generals. As a result, she -- the victim and a participant in none of the bad acts in the sex scandal -- has shouldered the blame as the villain in the generals’ downfall.""The suit describes damage to Jill Kelley's social reputation and connections to those in high places, which it claims were key to her earnings. The scandal caused the revocation of Jill Kelley's honorary consulship to South Korea, which ""deprived her of significant social and financial networking, investment, and business fee finder opportunities, as well as the loss of the tax-free annual stipend for years,"" the suit says. Today, Jill Kelley ""no longer receives prestigious invitations to the diplomatic and distinguished governmental functions."" The complaint adds that ""Dr. Kelley also suffered dramatic financial losses.""The lawsuit is peppered with links to news articles about the Kelleys from late 2012. According to one, the Kelleys were considering legal action as far back as late November, when their attorney at the time, D.C. powerhouse litigator Abbe Lowell, released a slew of emails and phone records intended to prove that Jill Kelley did not exploit her friendship with Petraeus for financial gain. But now, six months later, the issue of potential overreach in a federal investigation has taken on a very different tenor in Washington, a fact likely not lost on Kelley and her attorneys. Public anger has erupted over news that the Department of Justice gathered journalists' phone and email records in leak investigations. This, combined with a scandal at the Internal Revenue Service over the targeting of tea party groups for special tax scrutiny, has put the Obama administration on defense. In the ensuing months, Jill Kelley has emerged as an advocate for greater Internet privacy and received an award from the Electronic Privacy Information Center on Monday. Jill Kelley said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post that her experience ""made me an advocate for privacy rights for every American."" She said she would continue to work to ensure that citizens would ""not have their personal communications improperly and unreasonably searched by overreaching government or any other abuse of government powers.""The Justice Department has 60 days to respond to the lawsuit.

A 2010 poll by the group found that 63 percent felt anti-terrorism policies did not go far enough, while just 25 percent said they went too far.The numbers suggest that the revelation of the NSA's telephone and Internet spying programs has caused many Americans to change their opinions of the national security state.Men, by a 54-34 margin, said that policies had gone too far, while women, by a 47-36 margin, said they had not gone far enough, revealing a sizable gender gap.In the new poll, 55 percent of Americans characterized former NSA contractor Edward Snowden as a whistleblower, while 34 percent deemed him a traitor. Forty-nine percent of Democrats, 55 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of independents said he is a whistleblower.The survey reveals that the public disagrees with many lawmakers -- both Democrats and Republicans -- who have called the former NSA contractor a traitor. Snowden is believed to be holed up in the transit zone of a Moscow airport after he leaked classified documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post detailing the agency's massive telephone and Internet spying programs.Nevertheless, other recent surveys have shown that more Americans disapprove than approve of Snowden's actions. A HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 38 percent of Americans thought Snowden had done the wrong thing in leaking the documents, while 33 percent condoned his actions. Twenty-nine percent were unsure. A CNN poll released on June 17 showed that 52 percent disagreed with his actions, and 44 percent agreed.

""It helps the individual protect his right to privacy and it doesn't allow the employer to impersonate that particular employee when other people are interacting with that person across social media platforms.""While Perlmutter warned of breached privacy and the potential to impersonate employees, as U.S. News & World Report notes, CISPA sponsor Rep.

The Democratic congressman also attempted to tack on such a provision to the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2012 and the earlier version of CISPA, both of which were never passed by the U.S. Senate.After initially introducing the password privacy measure in 2011, Perlmutter explained in a statement:People have an expectation of privacy when using social media like Facebook and Twitter. They have an expectation that their right to free speech and religion will be respected when they use social media outlets. No American should have to provide their confidential personal passwords as a condition of employment. Both users of social media and those who correspond share the expectation of privacy in their personal communications. Employers essentially can act as imposters and assume the identity of an employee and continually access, monitor and even manipulate an employee's personal social activities and opinions. That's simply a step too far. Though CISPA passed the House, 288 to 127, it could very likely be killed in the Senate -- as the first version of the cybersecurity legislation was -- or face a veto from the White House, which has already threatened the controversial legislation.

"" (It) is clearly an invalid and unconstitutional law based on the United States Supreme Court precedent in Roe v. Wade from 1973 ... and the progeny of cases that have followed.""""We have our job to do,"" Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem told The Associated Press. ""We need to convince (Hovland) why the Legislature wanted to enact the law.""Stenehjem said the state will ask the court for a trial and already has hired an attorney to help argue the case.New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the state's lone abortion clinic, Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo, filed the lawsuit in June after the law was passed this year by the North Dakota Legislature. It would outlaw the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before some women even know they are pregnant.Abortion-rights advocates say the measures are an attempt to close North Dakota's lone abortion clinic. Supporters of the so-called fetal heartbeat measure, including Gov. Jack Dalrymple, have said it's a challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion up until a fetus is considered viable, usually at 22 to 24 weeks.Janet Crepps, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the law banning abortions at six weeks ""poses a very immediate threat to virtually all women seeking an abortion in North Dakota.""Red River director Tammi Kromenaker and Crepps said the six-week abortion ban would stop about 90 percent of abortions at the clinic.""This ruling means that women won't have to rush in and make a decision,"" Kromenaker said of the injunction. ""Now they have more time to talk to their loved one, their pastor – whoever they need to talk to – while weighing their decision to have an abortion.""Jeff Zent, a spokesman for Dalrymple, said the governor would not comment on the federal judge's ruling.""It's our standing policy not to comment on litigation,"" he said.The clinic's lawsuit also is challenging another new measure that would make North Dakota the only state to prohibit women from having an abortion because a fetus has a genetic defect, such as Down syndrome.Kromenaker said the clinic wants that law overturned but didn't seek an immediate injunction to block it because abortions are not performed there for that reason.The clinic is not challenging another new North Dakota law that would outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain by then. Texas Gov. Rick Perry last week signed into law a 20-week ban and other abortion restrictions for that state.Kromenaker said the 20-week ban, which she believes is unconstitutional, does not apply to North Dakota because no abortions are performed at the clinic after 16 weeks.Another measure would require a doctor who performs abortions to be a physician with hospital admitting privileges. A lawsuit challenging that law has been combined with another one challenging a 2011 North Dakota law that outlaws one of two drugs used in nonsurgical abortions. A state judge ruled last week that the 2011 law violates the state and U.S. constitutions. A judge hasn't yet issued a ruling on the new law requiring abortion doctors to have hospital admitting privileges.___Follow James MacPherson on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/macphersonja"

Speaking to MSNBC hosts Melissa Harris-Perry, Touré and legal analyst Lisa Bloom, Roberts questioned how minorities in America were treated by fellow citizens:Don’t we need to do a lot more about our social contract with each other in this country when it comes to being others? Because, as we look at this, we can use this as a great pivot point to talk about race relations in this country. But, being an 'other'—whether it’s LGBT, because you’re then suspected of being a pedophile and a rabid disease carrier. And if you are a woman, well you certainly don’t have a right to your own body and your own reproductive health, because if you do, then you’re just a slut who wants to sleep around and use abortion as birth control. And then if you’re Hispanic, well you're just a taker, you're not a maker. And you just want to come here and have anchor babies and you just want to lay off the land.Roberts then challenged MSNBC to sponsor an ""I Am Other"" forum to bring people to discuss what he called ""the social contract we have currently negotiated that is so wrong."" ""It’s supposed to be a melting pot but we're treating each other with such disdain it’s not even funny,"" he said.Roberts is not the only host to react so passionately to the news of the George Zimmerman trial verdict.

""This is 2013 and any legislator that puts forth such a discriminatory bill should be laughed out of office. This is America, not Russia."" He continued, ""You have those that honestly believe our country would be better off turning back the clock to years ago, also known as the 'good-old days,' which weren't all that good for everyone. After suppressing the right to vote, what's next? Are these so-called Representatives going to push for preventing our military, veterans, and women from voting?""When asked by Roll Call about his remarks, Thigpen said he supports requiring voter identification at the polls, but only if steps are taken to make sure the requirement does not discriminate against any individuals.""I do support requiring voters to provide a photo ID in order to vote, as long as there isn’t any undo burden or expense placed on the voter in order to do so,"" he said. ""Otherwise, it’s considered a poll-tax.. I honestly believe that any legislation which may invariably reduce voter turnout is a bad thing and cannot imagine what argument, not discriminatory in some fashion, could be made to purport differently."" North Carolina's law, in addition to requiring identification at the voting booth, reduces early voting time, ends same-day voter registration, eliminates a program to pre-register minors and stops a state-sponsored voter registration drive. The law also scales back the amount of public disclosure required for ""dark money"" groups.Last week, former Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke out against the North Carolina law, saying it would only hurt the Republican Party.""I want to see policies that encourage every American to vote, not make it more difficult to vote,"" Powell said while addressing a Raleigh forum.

""The word racist is truly hurtful,"" he told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ""It's not who I am. It's not who I ever was. It's just not fair. It's just not right.""The Washington Post columnist came under fire on Tuesday for writing that ""people with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children."" He insisted that he was expressing the views of some people within the Tea Party and not his own. ""I didn't write one line, I wrote a column,"" Cohen said. ""The column is about Tea Party extremism and I was not expressing my views, I was expressing the views of what I think some people in the Tea Party held."" And those views are not held by the entire Tea Party. ""I don't think everybody in the Tea Party is like that, because I know there are blacks in the Tea Party,"" he said. ""So they're not all racist, unless I'm going to start doing mind reading about why those black people are there.""When asked if he believed that people who do “have a gag reflex” at the idea of interracial marriage are in fact racist, he said that he did. “I could have picked a better word, but it didn't ring any bells with anybody, it didn't ring any bells with me,” he continued. “But there is a context to the column. You've got to read the whole column and if you read the whole column you can't honestly think that these are my views or I endorse the views that I articulated in the column.” Fred Hiatt, editor of the Washington Post editorial page, said Tuesday that he  should have edited Cohen's ""conventional"" line to prevent misunderstanding.Cohen said that no editors objected to the phrasing the first time around. ""Nobody, not a single one of my editors -- and believe me, they're super sensitive to this sort of stuff -- said, 'Wait a minute.' They all knew what I meant because of the context of the column. I was talking about tea party extremism. And it's clear.""He added, ""Look, maybe the word was inappropriate or maybe I could have used a different word. But you're talking to somebody who has written, I don't know, 100 columns in favor of homosexual rights, many columns in favor of same sex marriage.""Cohen has been criticized for his comments on race in the past. When asked why he thought it was that he keeps getting caught up in racially charged arguments, he said that it's because people view him as a liberal and find some of his positions unconventional. ""Every once in a while I take an unconventional stance as a liberal -- as someone who has always been called a liberal,"" he said. ""If someone on the right wrote this, no one would care. No one would make a big deal about it but because I veer every once in awhile from orthodoxy, or maybe more than once in awhile, I get plastered this way.""ORIGINAL STORY: Richard Cohen is back at it again, this time with incendiary comments about interracial marriage and lesbians. In his November 11 column in the Washington Post entitled ""Christie’s tea-party problem,""  Cohen said that the GOP has had trouble embracing some of the country's cultural shifts. He wrote: Today’s GOP is not racist, as Harry Belafonte alleged about the tea party, but it is deeply troubled — about the expansion of government, about immigration, about secularism, about the mainstreaming of what used to be the avant-garde. People with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children. (Should I mention that Bill de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, used to be a lesbian?) This family represents the cultural changes that have enveloped parts — but not all — of America. To cultural conservatives, this doesn’t look like their country at all.In fact, according to a Gallup poll conducted earlier this year, 87 percent of Americans approve of interracial marriage between blacks and whites.

He noted that a previous speaker ""mentioned something about Hispanics being uninformed or deceived."" ""Well, the same thing is true of the black population,” Cruz said.Cruz also suggested how blacks and Hispanics should vote. “As a matter of fact, if we could communicate the truth, not only to the Hispanics but to the black population, all blacks should be Republican,"" he said.“Highly religious, strongly pro-family, strongly pro-life” values and high military enrollment rates align Hispanics’ principles with the Republican Party’s, said Cruz.Exit polls from the 2012 election, however, indicated that a majority of Latino voters, 59 percent, supported same-sex marriage, while an even larger majority, 66 percent, supported abortion rights. Fifty-two percent of black voters supported same-sex marriage, the polls showed.Cruz has made headlines lately with similarly controversial comments. At an event sponsored by the gun rights advocacy group OK2A and the anti-government Tulsa 9.12 Project in November, Cruz claimed that God ordains capital punishment.“You know, the Bible is so clear,"" he said. ""Go to Genesis Chapter 9 and you will find the death penalty clearly stated in Genesis Chapter 9 ... God ordains the death penalty!”Cruz also argued that the legalization of same-sex marriage would lead to an unjustified outpouring of hate-speech accusations. “You preach Romans Chapter 1 in your church, you’re going to be called before a court for hate speech,” Cruz said.In his February speech, Cruz promoted the abolishment of political correctness. “We have been guilty of following two things that we totally have to throw aside. Number one is political correctness,” Cruz said. “We have been destroyed by political correctness. And we must learn to tell the truth unequivocally.”The 74-year-old tea party icon also attributed “all the civil rights” that African-Americans have achieved to Republicans. “Let’s talk about the black population. All the civil rights that the African Americans have obtained have come from Republicans,” Cruz said. “But you know what, Democrats took the credit.”"

Last year, he made a failed bid for Missouri’s secretary of state, and his group has been doing little besides trying to attract national attention ever since.AMPAC was finally successful on Thursday, when Breitbart News reported on the event, calling it ""tasteless"" and including an unrelated picture of hundreds of Muslims praying in front of the Capitol. Fox News later broke from their coverage of the violent military crackdown in Egypt, which has left nearly 600 dead and thousands injured, to give viewers an ""alert"" on the so-called ""Million Muslim March,"" and going so far as to note that the total supporters of the event could currently be counted on two hands. A Facebook page for the ""Million Muslim March"" -- which previously showed less than 10 people planning to attend -- had been taken down by the time of publish.Organizers of the ""Million Muslim March"" have defended the timing of their event by noting that ""Muslim[s] and Non Muslim[s] alike were traumatized"" on Sept. 11, 2001. True, but beneath the group's insistence that the march will be about civil rights, indefinite detention, and ""slanderous"" statements about Islam, lies a toxic strain of trutherism. That fact led Corey Saylor, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, to tell U.S. News last month that CAIR would definitely not support the event.Most groups and individuals have responded similarly, though the event did reportedly receive some backing last month from other truther groups and at least one Pennsylvania tea party organization.At the time of the U.S. News report, AMPAC had even changed the title of the event to ""Million American March Against Fear,"" perhaps in an effort to get more mainstream support. The name apparently didn't catch on, however, so it looks they've since decided to revert back to the more controversial name."

In this case, the teenager, identified only as ""Anonymous 5,"" is in foster care, but did not want to involve her foster parents out of fear that they would be so angry about her pregnancy that she could lose her placement at their home, according court documents.A girl can bypass the consent provision in certain cases.

When she initially went before Judge Peter Bataillon in July, he ruled that she did not provide evidence she was a victim of abuse, and also ""failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that she is sufficiently mature and well informed.""However, as Slate points out, Anonymous 5 showed some pretty mature reasoning at her appeal last week.According to court documents, she testified that she could not ""be the right mom that [she] would like to be right now"" and could not support a child financially. She also feared her foster parents would likely take out their anger not only on her, but on her child. Finally, she pointed out that putting the baby up for adoption ""would be worse"" for her and her two siblings because of the resentment her foster parents would have towards her. The siblings, ages 7 and 9, are under the care of the same couple.The girl's attorney, Catherine Mahern, declined to tell Omaha.com whether or not the girl, who was 10 weeks pregnant at her first hearing in July, is still pregnant. Mahern did note that there are other ways to circumvent the parental consent law, including traveling to another state. Nebraska is one of eight states that require notarized consent for a minor to obtain an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Thirty-nine states require at least some level of parental involvement. "

Steve King (R-Iowa) in 2012 that he was a huge fan, and now it turns out that the two share a knack for drawing controversial comparisons when it comes to immigration policy.Cuccinelli made his strange remark during a radio interview in 2012. Speaking on the conservative radio show ""The Morning Majority,"" the attorney general launched into a critique of Washington, D.C.'s pest control policies, which he claimed protected rats from being killed.""They have to relocate the rats. And, not only that, that’s actually not the worst part, they cannot break up the families of the rats!"" Cuccinelli said, incorrectly suggesting that the District’s 2010 Wildlife Protection Act forced pest control specialists to dump them across the river in Virginia.Cuccinelli then made his comparison.""So, anyway, it is worse than our immigration policy,"" he said. ""You can't break up rat families. Or raccoons, and all the rest, and you can't even kill 'em. It's unbelievable.""It's unclear what Cuccinelli meant by that -- perhaps that he believes the nation's immigration policy is better because it allows for immigrant families to be broken up -- but the comments come to light as the gubernatorial candidate attempts to finesse his position on immigration reform. In the past week, he's expressed positions that make him sound like both a moderate and a hardliner on the issue, depending on the audience.As for King, one of Cuccinelli's favorite congressmen, he recently drew widespread criticism from both sides of the aisle after suggesting that many undocumented immigrants who had been brought here as children were acting as drug mules. He said they'd developed ""calves the size of cantaloupes"" from their illicit work.King has been one of the most rigid opponents of immigration reform efforts over the past years, a stance that he's developed not just through legislative efforts, but also through divisive comments he's made about immigrants themselves. He recently was forced to explain remarks he made in 2012 in which he compared immigrants to dogs."

""[W]e are frustrated that there was not a bipartisan immigration reform bill introduced prior to the August recess,"" reads the letter from 39 members of the New Democrat Coalition, a 53-member group, including co-chairmen Reps. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.).""Therefore, we write to inform you that if a bipartisan immigration reform package is not introduced in the House of Representatives -- one that includes a pathway to citizenship, helps grow American jobs, and fixes our immigration system once and for all -- by September 30th, we as New Democrats will consider introducing a comprehensive immigration reform bill,"" the letter continues. Read the letter here.Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has said he will not bring up any immigration bill -- particularly the one that passed the Senate in June -- unless a majority of House Republicans support it. Democrats and pro-reform activists think they could get the 218 votes needed for passage of comprehensive immigration reform, if Boehner would allow for a vote, by keeping most Democrats and winning over some Republicans. Members of Congress leave town Friday for the August recess, a month-long break during which they will hear from constituents. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking closer to primaries and the 2014 election year. Democrats have said immigration reform should include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but many Republicans have said it's a no-go. Instead, House Republicans are pursuing a number of smaller bills, such as border security legislation. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) are working on a bill to legalize undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children, but there aren't GOP-led efforts to deal with their parents. A seven-member bipartisan group in the House is working on comprehensive legislation with a path to citizenship, though it has not yet come to a final agreement on legislative language.The New Democrat Coalition letter says Boehner ""can rely on"" its members for support if he brings up a bill with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.“We have the support of the American people,"" it concludes. ""We hope we can count on your support."""

""Our families are separated,"" a young man yelled during remarks in San Francisco at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center. ""Mr. President, please use your executive authority to halt [deportations]. We agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, you have the power to stop deportations."" ""Actually, I don't,"" the president replied, ""and that's why we're here."" Other people in the crowd began to yell as well: ""Stop deportations. Yes, we can."" As Obama delivered a speech calling on House Republicans to press forward with immigration reform, the interruption served as a reminder that many advocates are frustrated and ready for the president to take immediate action. Most have been calling for Obama to slow or halt deportations for months or years, but as progress on legislative reform has slowed, they say there's no more time to wait. This year 1,100 people will be forced out of the country each day if removals continue at the same rate as the previous year. Obama has said that he can't simply halt deportations by executive action, although he did so more narrowly for undocumented young people who entered the U.S. as children. He asked for the hecklers to remain in their seats, and said again that such an action would be illegal. ""What you need to know, when I'm speaking as president of the United States and I come to this community, is that if in fact I could solve all of these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,"" he said. ""But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition."" ""So the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,"" he continued. ""What I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done."" Before the interruption, the president made his pitch to the House GOP to take up immigration reform to deal with a number of different issues, even if they do it through a more piecemeal approach. ""It's Thanksgiving,"" he joked. ""We can carve that bird into multiple pieces.""House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said last week that immigration reform is ""absolutely not"" dead, although without answering questions about the timetable. Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who previously said immigration bills won't go for votes until next year, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that reform ""is going to happen in a step-by-step method."" But so far, it's not clear what pieces House Republicans plan to include. While there are already proposals on border security, high-skilled worker visas and interior enforcement, the GOP has not put any bills on the table to give legal status to undocumented immigrants. House Democrats, joined by three Republicans, introduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill in October and are urging a vote, but House leadership has indicated they won't get one. A poll released Monday from the Public Religion Research Institute found that 63 percent of Americans support allowing undocumented immigrants to eventually become citizens if they meet certain criteria, while 14 percent said they should be given legal residency without a path to citizenship. Only 18 percent said all undocumented immigrants should be deported. Obama said he hopes that Boehner will not let a small minority of immigration reform opponents block the process, and called it ""good news"" that the speaker had repeated his commitment to reform last week.""I believe the speaker is sincere,"" he said. ""I think he genuinely wants to get it done, and that's something we should be thankful for this week."" CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the average number of deportations per day last year. An earlier version listed the daily figure as the total for the year. "

The Change for Trayvon movement will shine the light on stand-your-ground laws across the nation. These laws allow individuals to shoot first and ask questions later.”The site provides PayPal links for those wishing to make contributions, which ""will be used to educate voters, candidates, and elected officials on the impact these laws have on victims and families,"" according to the site. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin’s family, said the committee was formed in response to a growing number of states that have placed Stand Your Ground laws -- which they believe prevented their son’s killer, George Zimmerman, from being immediately arrested -- on ballots for the upcoming November election.“The family is saying straightforward that it is not just about Trayvon; all of our children have the possibility of being a Trayvon and having to face this battle against the Stand Your Ground law and the way it’s written,” Crump told The Huffington Post. “They’re saying its too late for them, we can’t do anything about Trayvon. But it’s not too late for others.”In the wake of Martin’s Feb. 26 killing by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch member in Sanford, Fla., who claims he shot the teen in self-defense, so-called Stand Your Ground laws were scrutinized not only by supporters of Martin’s family, but also by legal experts and advocacy groups who say the laws are written in a way that allows broad interpretation and application and give people wide discretion in the use of deadly force.Sanford police initially said that it would have been against the law and possibley a violation of Zimmerman’s rights to arrest him. But police arrested Zimmerman more than 40 days after the killing, not long after Florida Gov. Rick Scott assigned a special prosecutor to the case.Scott also formed the Task Force on Citizen Safety and Protection to hold town hall meetings, consult with legal experts, and make recommendations for possible changes to the law. The task force has itself been controversial, with critics assailing it and Gov. Scott for appointing supporters of the law to the board, including two of the law's authors.The family’s announcement today comes on the eve of a meeting of the 19-member task force on Tuesday in Jacksonville. “These laws allow people to shoot first and ask questions later,” Tracy Martin, Trayvon’s father, said in a video featured on the Change For Trayvon website.“Worse, under existing Stand Your Ground laws, decisions on shootings are made even before a judge or prosecutor can review the case,” added Sybina Fulton, Martin’s mother. “Stand Your Ground is a solution in search of a problem, and it’s a terrible solution with tragic result, like the death of our son.”The Change For Trayvon website also ups the ante in a media battle between the Martin and Zimmerman camps, as both sides work to drum up moral and financial support.Zimmerman has given exclusive interviews to sympathetic cable news pundits. And his parents, friends and brother have defended him on various television news programs. Meanwhile, Martin's family has made the rounds on the major morning shows and have done countless primetime interviews.The fight for support has also been waged on the Internet.Zimmerman, who remains free on bail pending trial, set up a website early on, which he used to thank supporters and raise funds. That site was later taken down, at which time his defense attorney, Mark O’Mara, launched a new website, gzlegalcase.com, which has been used to publish evidence, court filings and various statements.Zimmerman’s parents also launched a website in support of their son.According to the Change For Trayvon website, laws similar to Florida’s Stand Your Ground law exist in 32 states “and have allowed people to escape responsibility.”In Florida, the bill sailed through the state legislature in 2005 with bipartisan majorities. It was intended to strengthen existing self-defense laws after a series of major hurricanes raised fears of looting. But critics say the law is ambiguously written, which consequently has allowed some misapplication. Recent investigative reports suggest a troubling pattern in the application of the law, which seems to skew along racial lines.Among the more controversial aspects of the debate are the law's possibly biased application, its widespread support among gun rights advocates like the NRA and conservative groups like ALEC, and a number of recent high-profile shootings, including the Trayvon Martin case, in which people have attempted to invoke the law as a legal defense."

""The word racist is truly hurtful,"" he told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ""It's not who I am. It's not who I ever was. It's just not fair. It's just not right.""The Washington Post columnist came under fire on Tuesday for writing that ""people with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children."" He insisted that he was expressing the views of some people within the Tea Party and not his own. ""I didn't write one line, I wrote a column,"" Cohen said. ""The column is about Tea Party extremism and I was not expressing my views, I was expressing the views of what I think some people in the Tea Party held."" And those views are not held by the entire Tea Party. ""I don't think everybody in the Tea Party is like that, because I know there are blacks in the Tea Party,"" he said. ""So they're not all racist, unless I'm going to start doing mind reading about why those black people are there.""When asked if he believed that people who do “have a gag reflex” at the idea of interracial marriage are in fact racist, he said that he did. “I could have picked a better word, but it didn't ring any bells with anybody, it didn't ring any bells with me,” he continued. “But there is a context to the column. You've got to read the whole column and if you read the whole column you can't honestly think that these are my views or I endorse the views that I articulated in the column.” Fred Hiatt, editor of the Washington Post editorial page, said Tuesday that he  should have edited Cohen's ""conventional"" line to prevent misunderstanding.Cohen said that no editors objected to the phrasing the first time around. ""Nobody, not a single one of my editors -- and believe me, they're super sensitive to this sort of stuff -- said, 'Wait a minute.' They all knew what I meant because of the context of the column. I was talking about tea party extremism. And it's clear.""He added, ""Look, maybe the word was inappropriate or maybe I could have used a different word. But you're talking to somebody who has written, I don't know, 100 columns in favor of homosexual rights, many columns in favor of same sex marriage.""Cohen has been criticized for his comments on race in the past. When asked why he thought it was that he keeps getting caught up in racially charged arguments, he said that it's because people view him as a liberal and find some of his positions unconventional. ""Every once in a while I take an unconventional stance as a liberal -- as someone who has always been called a liberal,"" he said. ""If someone on the right wrote this, no one would care. No one would make a big deal about it but because I veer every once in awhile from orthodoxy, or maybe more than once in awhile, I get plastered this way.""ORIGINAL STORY: Richard Cohen is back at it again, this time with incendiary comments about interracial marriage and lesbians. In his November 11 column in the Washington Post entitled ""Christie’s tea-party problem,""  Cohen said that the GOP has had trouble embracing some of the country's cultural shifts. He wrote: Today’s GOP is not racist, as Harry Belafonte alleged about the tea party, but it is deeply troubled — about the expansion of government, about immigration, about secularism, about the mainstreaming of what used to be the avant-garde. People with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children. (Should I mention that Bill de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, used to be a lesbian?) This family represents the cultural changes that have enveloped parts — but not all — of America. To cultural conservatives, this doesn’t look like their country at all.In fact, according to a Gallup poll conducted earlier this year, 87 percent of Americans approve of interracial marriage between blacks and whites.

In early December, it was ""Affluenza"" -- not immediately coded for race, but yet a story with race in the background. A Texas judge sentenced a wealthy white teenager who killed four pedestrians when he lost control of his speeding pick-up truck to probation rather than jail. Although the teen confessed to intoxication manslaughter, the judge accepted the defense argument that the he suffered from ""Affluenza,"" a disease caused by having too much money and too little supervision, which led to his reckless behavior and absolved him of responsibility for his actions. The judge's decision outraged many people because it showed blatant preference for the wealthy. But imagine a different scenario -- a wealthy Black teen facing the same charges. Would ""Affluenza"" be the cause, or would the teen now be the victim of Black men's irresponsibility, which, of course, would leave him fully responsible for his actions?Then came the second big story when Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly assured any kids who happened to be watching her commentary about a Slate.com post on the possibility of a ""Black Santa"" that ""Santa just is white."" She also assured viewers that ""Jesus was a white man too."" Her statements set off a firestorm of criticism and satirical replies (John Stewart and SNL for example). The news commentators on the Boston PBS program ""Beat the Press"" wore black Santa pins to show support for non-white Santas. In an interview with Kelly on ""The Kelly file"" on December 13, political commentator and writer Zirlina Maxwell told her that whiteness is ""not the default identity."" Santa is a fantasy; why shouldn't Christian children of any race or ethnicity imagine that fantasy in their own image? Fern Johnson told a reporter for the Worcester Telegram & Gazette that Kelly's comments were an example of ""white washing"" images that have no firm racial definition. Kelly at least admitted in a later segment that controversy remains about whether Jesus was white. But Santa? The answer is ""white.""Then we hit the trifecta when ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch and star Phil Robertson's anti-gay and anti-Black statements were quoted in a GQ Magazine interview. While he defended his anti-gay statements by quoting scripture, his anti-Black comments were more insidious. Claiming he understood Blacks because he and his family were ""white trash,"" Robertson insisted that Blacks were happier before the civil rights era: ""Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues."" In a few short sentences, Robertson managed to conflate race and social class and declare that he, a white man, knows how Blacks think and feel.  We don't want to add to the debate over whether any of these individuals or their comments was intentionally racist. The issue is more complex than what sounds like a racist comment. The comments each reflect the kind of racial thinking that shapes our understanding of the world in the U.S. Whether it's the belief that wealth corrupts whites while Blacks are born corrupt, or that Santa, like all iconic figures, is white, or that a white person who has some commonality with African-Americans knows what Blacks think or feel, these beliefs each normalize a vision of the world that is not necessarily shared by people of other races or cultural backgrounds. But as long as those of us who are in the dominant culture believe our thinking is natural and normal, we refuse to question it, even in the face of contrary evidence.Yes, many commentators ridiculed the decision of the judge in the Affluenza case and Megyn Kelly's insistence that Santa is white and Phil Robertson's belief that Blacks were happier before the era of civil rights. But for all those who spoke up and questioned these beliefs, many still don't understand why they did. And many of those who did speak up might not know why the incidents reveal racial thinking. Often, we know something is wrong, but we don't know exactly why. Racial thinking is powerful precisely because it's normalized. If mainstream media and the shopping malls in American portray Santa as white, well... he must be white. Same for Jesus of Nazareth. We know these things to be true because these images repeat over and over. Santa is white, white people have money and money corrupts them, Blacks were happy before civil rights. In fact, Black people used to like white people -- after all, didn't Mammy love Scarlett in Gone with the Wind?"

They taunted him as a ""terrorist"" and arrested him for refusing to obey ""an officer's lawful command,"" reports the ACLU.On his March 26th court date, Judge Aubrey Rimes of the Pike County Justice Court ejected him from the courtroom stating that Singh would not be allowed to re-enter unless he removed ""that rag"" from his head.Singh's attorney confirmed that Rimes expelled him due to his turban. However, Singh's faith mandates the covering and he believes that to unwrap it in public would be both sacrilegious and shameful.A subsequent Department of Justice investigation prompted the Pike County Board of Supervisors to revise the County's non-discrimination policy to say that religious discrimination includes, ""requiring an individual to remove a head covering or denying that individual access to a County office, building, program or activity because they are wearing a head covering, if that head covering is worn for religious reasons.""American Sikhs often encounter misunderstandings about their faith, and a Stanford University survey published earlier this month revealed that though almost all turban-wearers in America are Sikh, about 70% of Americans misidentify turban-wearers as Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, or members of the Shinto faith. The survey also discovered that nearly half of Americans think that Sikhism is a sect of Islam, and more associate the turban with Osama bin Laden rather than with the Muslim and Sikh alternative.The letter comes on the heels of yet another incident of Sikh harassment, as Columbia professor Dr. Prabhjot Singh was brutally attacked in Harlem on Saturday night, beaten by a hate mob who called him ""terrorist,"" and ""Osama."""

Although people are allowed to visit congressional offices, they can be removed or arrested for disruptive behavior. Capitol Police public information officer Kimberly Schneider responded to the incident in a statement:We are aware of the incident posted online concerning an unlawful demonstration today on U.S. Capitol Grounds.

In a 25-34 vote, the House rejected the domestic partnership legislation, the first time Wyoming lawmakers formally voted on legislation related to marriage equality. The legislation's defeat comes after the House Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee passed the domestic partnership bill on Monday, while defeating a measure that would have allowed gay marriage. ""Just a sad day for the Equality State,"" state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer (R-Cheyenne) told The Huffington Post. Zwonitzer has been a leading supporter of gay rights in the legislature, including several efforts to kill gay marriage bans since his election in 2004. The debate that predeeded Wednesday night's debate was tamer then Monday's committee hearing, where opponents of the gay marriage bill had contended that gay marriage harms moral and public health. State Rep. Mark Baker (R-Rock Springs) again raised the public health argument in the debate on the House floor, claiming that ""only 1 percent of homosexuals die of old age"" and that domestic partnership would cause higher health care costs for the state, according to a tweet by Trevor Brown, the state government reporter for the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. Brown also tweeted that Baker had said that domestic partnerships were not ""rooted"" in the Wyoming constitution or in the state's tradition. Supporters of the legislation focused on civil rights and equality issues raised by state Rep. Cathy Connolly (D-Laramie), the bill's sponsor, in Monday's committee meeting. Connolly, the state's only openly gay elected official, could not immediately be reached for comment. Baker tweeted that Connolly was ""stoic"" during the vote. The domestic partnership measure had been viewed by supporters as having a better chance of passing than the gay marriage bill, but several legislators may have changed their minds at the last minute. Gov. Matt Mead (R) had indicated that he would sign a domestic partnership bill. The domestic partnership bill had included the ability for heterosexual couples and platonic couples to enter into partnerships. State Sen. Bruce Burns (R-Sheridan), a co-sponsor, told the Corporations Committee on Monday that his aunt has shared a house with another woman for over three decades in a ""platonic relationship"" and the bill would allow them to have domestic partner benefits. He also said it would allow siblings who live together to become domestic partners. State Rep. Lynn Hutchings (R-Cheyenne), an African American, told the committee that gay marriage was not comparable to the civil rights movement because she said people choose to be gay. She told committee members that her ex-fiance had been gay before dating her. Hutchings also said she opposed the bill due to AIDS. "

Read Part 2 here.SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah is one of the reddest and most culturally conservative states in America. The statehouse would seem to be about as fertile ground for reining in the drug war and curbing police abuse as the briny marshes and salt flats just outside the capital. But if anyone can bring Utah's conservatives on board with police reform, it's probably Connor Boyack, a clean-cut Mormon with a Republican background who is also pushing the state to nullify the Affordable Care Act.Boyack, 31, is the founder and president of the Libertas Institute, a state think tank with a libertarian bent. ""Utah politics is basically a debate between conservatives and libertarian-minded conservatives,"" he says. ""We help conservatives hone their free-market ideas, but we also want to persuade them to be more deferential to civil liberties. That I think is our niche.""Boyack wrote about public policy for several years on his personal blog, built up a readership, and in August 2010 was hired to lead the Utah chapter of the Tenth Amendment Center, an advocacy group that pushes returning federal power to the states. The boyish-looking student of political philosophy also worked on the 2010 campaign of Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee. His credentials on the right are sound.But he felt that more could be done on the state level, and in December 2011, he founded Libertas.""One thing I noticed at the Tenth Amendment Center is that while liberty-minded Utah legislators could join arms to push back the federal government, they weren't nearly as skeptical of the government here in Utah,"" Boyack says. ""But if the government violates your rights, you haven't been any less violated if it came from state or local government instead of the federal government. The thing we try to stress at Libertas is consistency.""He ran the organization part-time for about a year, but by January he had attracted enough funding that he was able to commit to it fully.""What makes Connor unique -- and most effective -- is that he's willing to take on issues that the mainstream political right is generally afraid to touch,"" says Michael Boldin, executive director of the Tenth Amendment Center. ""They might even agree with him on the issues, but don't want to upset the status quo, so they do and say nothing. Connor, on the other hand, recognizes that it takes risk to get things done. And he certainly takes risks.""Boyack gradually became interested in police reform as he was exposed to police abuse stories on social media. ""You can't really be active on Twitter or Facebook without seeing these stories, really on a daily basis,"" he says. ""And it isn't just the misconduct, it's that bad police officers are so rarely held accountable.""After law enforcement officials raided the Ogden, Utah, home of Matthew David Stewart in response to a tip that he was growing marijuana plants in his basement, leading to a gun battle that left one officer dead and five others wounded, Boyack watched closely to see whether that type of scenario would play out.""That case really catalyzed my focus. I watched at first from the sidelines -- followed the story closely. I'm not an activist or a protester. I tend to come at things from an education or legislative angle,"" he says.""As it unfolded the way that it did, I was really disappointed. Once again, the police weren't being held accountable. The media narrative was that Matthew was this evil cop-killer. My concern was with the underlying policy, from a legislative standpoint. The police should not have come in to Stewart's house the way they did, all over a few plants. The law just shouldn't allow that to happen.""As Stewart's supporters -- led by members of his family, as well as progressive activist Jesse Fruhwirth -- protested at Ogden city council meetings, Boyack took a broader view.""I think what the protesters were doing was important,"" he says. ""But my thinking was that this wasn't just happening in Ogden. Police militarization is happening everywhere. So we were more interested in looking at the state as a whole.""Boyack began reaching out to legislators, police organizations and activists to craft a bill that would restrict the use of SWAT teams to emergency scenarios, ones in which lives are at risk.The policy he's pushing is relatively straightforward. Currently, police in Utah may forcibly enter any home, at any time, so long as they've obtained a search warrant. Under Boyack's proposal, officers would be permitted to break into a home only when there is an imminent threat of a violent crime.The police would no longer be permitted to use battering rams or ""dynamic entry"" -- the term used to describe forcible entry, the use of flash grenades, and other paramilitary tactics -- to serve drug warrants. In Utah and across the country, drug investigations comprise the overwhelming majority of instances in which such tactics are used.Last August, the Standard-Examiner ran an editorial in support of Boyack's cause. ""Certainly, the use of a battering rams to combat minor offenses is something that should not occur,"" the paper wrote. ""These raids, as conducted now, are too dangerous.""""We're interested in saving lives,"" Boyack says. ""And we're as interested in saving the lives behind the gun as those in front of it.""Boyack uses that line often. It hints at the realpolitik that may help explain why his message is finding a receptive audience. A cop died during the Stewart raid, and several more nearly joined him. Particularly in conservative Utah, saving the lives of police officers is a more effective sales pitch than saving the lives of suspected drug offenders. ""I don't think there's any question about it. If this law had been in place in 2011, both Officer [Jared] Francom and Matthew Stewart would still be alive,"" Boyack says. Stewart committed suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial.Boyack says many of the lawmakers he's talked to about his bill have been supportive. Indeed, several told The Huffington Post that they see the need for police reform, though they would not say so for attribution.""The response has been surprisingly favorable,"" Boyack says. ""I think most lawmakers want to wait to see the final language, though. The bill should be collaborative, rather than combative. Few legislators will support a bill that's seen as anti-cop, but they're generally supportive of the higher idea.""Ideally, Boyack would like to get a conservative lawmaker who otherwise supports the drug war to sponsor the bill.""I think drugs should be decriminalized, but this bill isn't about legalization,"" he says. ""We can still keep drugs illegal, but enforce those laws in a way that doesn't put lives at risk. So I think it would be helpful to get a sponsor for the bill who has drug war bona fides, but understands that sending police officers to break into homes in the middle of the night creates unnecessary danger.""But he worries that many politicians may be reluctant to publicly embrace the bill, even if they think it's the right thing to do, because they fear retribution.""A few years ago, we tried to outlaw DUI checkpoints, which I think are a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and really are more about issuing citations and raising revenue for police departments than keeping the roads safe,"" he says. ""Law enforcement groups came out aggressively against the bill. But they also went after the bill's sponsor, [state Rep.] David Butterfield, when he ran for reelection.""That bill passed the Utah House, but died in the Senate in February 2012. State police groups organized to support Butterfield's primary opponent in the 2012 election, and Butterfield lost.""They got their scalp,"" Boyack says. ""I understand the concern about micromanaging police departments. I do. But everything police officers do is under authority given them by the legislature, through the people. It's the legislature's job to set the terms under which the laws will be enforced, and its the legislature's job to make sure our rights are protected, not just our safety.""Boyack is the bridge-builder in Utah's burgeoning police reform movement. His task is to forge ties between the state's legislators and other policymakers, and activists and the families of those killed by police.""By sticking his neck out and taking on a golden calf, he's able to bridge the divide with traditional political opponents,"" says The Tenth Amendment Center's Boldin.He's also the pragmatist. For the moment, the bill he and his organization have proposed addresses only forced-entry police raids. It would have had no effect on the police shootings, beatings, and other allegations of misconduct around Utah that weren't the result of drug raids.Some activists want to go further. They would like to see police get more training in interacting with the mentally ill, and they have called for the creation of civilian review boards with the teeth to issue subpoenas and force the termination of bad cops. Some, including Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank, think police need more instruction in conflict resolution, and that training and agency policy put too little emphasis on de-escalation, and too much on how and when to use force.But Boyack says that for now, focusing on forced-entry is a more realistic goal.""Our main goal here is to enact substantive reform. We don't just want a token bill that does more in name than in substance,"" Boyack says. ""But we also need a bill that will pass, and that will be reasonable. So for now, I think it makes sense to focus on the one area that will do the most good, and that in my opinion will save the most lives.""Continue to Part 4: An Occupy Activist's New Cause: Drug Raids And Police AbuseHuffPost writer and investigative reporter Radley Balko is also the author of the new book Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces."

So, what happens is that the FBI — if, in fact, it now wants to get content; if, in fact, it wants to start tapping that phone — it’s got to go to the FISA court with probable cause and ask for a warrant.Rose: But has FISA court turned down any request?Obama: The — because — the — first of all, Charlie, the number of requests are surprisingly small… number one. Number two, folks don’t go with a query unless they’ve got a pretty good suspicion.Rose: Should this be transparent in some way?Obama: It is transparent. That’s why we set up the FISA court.Later in the interview, Obama said the program had ""disrupted"" terrorist plots in the United States as well as overseas. The president pointed specifically to the prosecution of Najibullah Zazi, who was arrested in 2009 as part of a plan to bomb the New York City subway system.""Now, we might have caught him some other way. We might have disrupted it because a New York cop saw he was suspicious,"" Obama said. ""Maybe he turned out to be incompetent and the bomb didn’t go off. But at the margins we are increasing our chances of preventing a catastrophe like that through these programs.""While Zazi's name has come up frequently in defense of the NSA, the Associated Press and others have thrown cold water on the talking point, stating that the email the NSA says led to the plot's disruption could have been intercepted without the PRISM program.Obama struck a similar tone during a June 7 speech in San Jose, Calif., saying that Congress has been briefed on the programs' details.""The programs are secret in the sense that they are classified. They are not secret, in that every member of Congress has been briefed,"" he said. ""These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.""White House chief of staff Denis McDonough also stood by the program on Sunday during an appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" insisting that Obama ""does not"" have privacy concerns related to the NSA's phone records collection.""The president is not saying, 'Trust me,'"" he said. ""The president is saying, 'I want every member of Congress, on whose authority we are running this program, to be briefed on it, to come to the administration with questions and to also be accountable for it.'"""

The bill, filed Monday by two GOP lawmakers from Rowan County and backed by nine other Republicans, says each state ""is sovereign"" and courts cannot block a state ""from making laws respecting an establishment of religion."" The legislation was filed in response to a lawsuit to stop county commissioners in Rowan County from opening meetings with a Christian prayer, wral.com reported. The religion bill comes as some Republican-led states seek to separate themselves from the federal government, primarily on the issues of guns and Obamacare. This includes a proposal in Mississippi to establish a state board with the power to nullify federal laws. The North Carolina bill's main sponsors, state Reps. Carl Ford (R-China Grove) and Harry Warren (R-Salisbury), could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, The Salisbury Post reported. Co-sponsors include House Majority Leader Edgar Starnes (R-Hickory). Another is state Rep. Larry Pittman (R-Concord), who in February introduced a state constitutional amendment that would allow for carrying concealed weapons to fight federal ""tyranny."" The bill says the First Amendment only applies to the federal government and does not stop state governments, local governments and school districts from adopting measures that defy the Constitution. The legislation also says that the Tenth Amendment, which says powers not reserved for the federal government belong to the states, prohibits court rulings that would seek to apply the First Amendment to state and local officials. The bill reads:SECTION 1. The North Carolina General Assembly asserts that the Constitution of the United States of America does not prohibit states or their subsidiaries from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.SECTION 2. The North Carolina General Assembly does not recognize federal court rulings which prohibit and otherwise regulate the State of North Carolina, its public schools, or any political subdivisions of the State from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.The North Carolina state constitution disqualifies those who do not believe in God from public office. The provision has been unenforcible since the 1961 Supreme Court decision in Torcaso v. Watkins, which prohibited such bans. "

Thomas A. Garrett (R-Lynchburg) has introduced a bill that would prevent Medicaid from subsidizing abortion services for low-income women in cases ""in which a physician certifies ... that the fetus would be born with a gross and totally incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency."" Women who currently receive Medicaid in Virginia have abortion coverage in cases of rape, incest, severe fetal abnormalities, or when the life of the mother is in danger.Four other abortion- and contraception-related bills have been introduced by Del. Bob Marshall (R-Prince William), the author of the fetal personhood bill that state GOP leadership rejected in November. Three of Marshall's bills would allow insurance providers the option to deny women contraception coverage, and a fourth would impose a criminal ban on doctors who knowingly perform sex-selective abortions.Marshall's abortion ban, reproductive rights advocates argue, will intimidate doctors and violate doctor-patient confidentiality without solving the problem of gender-related abortions. It could also encourage physicians to racially profile women who are seeking abortions, since the practice of sex-selective abortions is most common in South Asian countries that have a cultural preference for boys.""This is a sexist and racist bill,"" said Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, in a conference call with reporters. ""The true purpose under the guise of the concern for gender discrimination is to continue to strip away access to safe legal abortion services.""It will already likely be harder for Virginia women to access abortions in 2013 than in previous years. Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) quietly approved a controversial set of abortion clinic regulations last week that could shut down many of the clinics in the state. The regulations impose strict building standards that were intended for new hospitals, such as specific hallway widths and hands-free sinks, on first-trimester abortion clinics.Republican leaders in Virginia have indicated that they will take a softer stance on abortion in 2013, and Marshall told The Huffington Post in November that his GOP colleagues pressure him ""seven days a week, 52 weeks a year"" to drop his anti-abortion legislative efforts. But those efforts are lost on a principled social conservative, he said.""You're talking about human beings being killed,"" he said. ""What higher considerations do I put out there?"""
6855	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/07/supreme-court-religion_n_4230411.html	News	0	Civil Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"(Repeats with no change in content)By Joan BiskupicWASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - When the U.S. Supreme Court talks about religion, all hell breaks loose.A dispute over an upstate New York town's prayer before council meetings produced an unusually testy oral-argument session on Wednesday that recalled the decades of difficulty Supreme Court justices have had drawing the line between church and state.Court decisions involving freedom of religion tend to be closely decided with many separate opinions rather than clear-cut majority statements. The case of Town of Greece v. Galloway appears to be headed that way.In the case brought by two Greece residents who objected to the overwhelmingly Christian prayers at meetings, the justices appeared likely to allow legislative prayer to continue but not ready to offer new guidance for when government might have gone too far in favoring, for example, Christianity over other faiths. The more liberal of the nine justices appeared sympathetic to the challenge while the conservatives who control the court's majority seemed ready to back the town - but not with a single obvious rationale.At one point during the hourlong session, Justice Stephen Breyer referred to the challenge of setting constitutional rules so people of different religions live ""harmoniously together."" Not soon after, Justice Elena Kagan asserted that, ""Every time the court gets involved in things like this, it seems to make the problem worse rather than better.""Overall, the justices' remarks were more pessimistic than positive regarding a possible consensus. They voiced frustration with the lawyers who appeared before them and with each other as well.When Breyer asked the town's lawyer if officials could take more steps to invite non-Christians and even people who are not religious to offer the equivalent of a prayer, Justice Antonin Scalia mockingly asked what sort of invocation ""somebody who is not religious"" could offer. As lawyer Thomas Hungar, representing the town of Greece, began to suggest a chant ""of guidance and wisdom,"" Breyer interjected with some annoyance toward Scalia, ""Perhaps he's asking me that question and I can answer it later."" ENDURING DILEMMASSuch have been the tensions over one of America's most enduring dilemmas. The U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion while requiring the separation of church and state. Neither dictate is absolute and the court has struggled with religious protections, often leaving lower courts with confusing standards, particularly on the mandate at issue on Wednesday - that government ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion.""Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, often a deciding vote on religion during her 1981-2006 tenure, attended the session in the ornate courtroom. She sat, expressionless, in a front-row spectator seat.The religious makeup of the bench has changed since O'Connor's time. The court has historically been dominated by Protestants but it is now has six Catholic and three Jewish justices. The religious character of the justices, however, is unlikely to control their views. Among the Catholics, for example, are Scalia, a conservative who has voted repeatedly for prayer in public settings, and Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal who seemed more supportive of those challenging the prayer policy in Greece, a suburb of Rochester.The high court heard the case after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled that Greece officials relied on overwhelmingly Christian clergy, appearing to endorse their beliefs. The court noted that prayers at the town's legislative sessions regularly mentioned Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The appeals court differentiated the Greece dispute from a 1983 Supreme Court case allowing non-sectarian prayers in the Nebraska legislature. In that decision, Marsh v. Chambers, the justices relied on the historic nature of legislative prayer.In key Supreme Court cases since 1983, the justices have focused on whether government might be endorsing a particular religion or coercing people to participate in prayer. In a 1989 case, they rejected a Pennsylvania county's courthouse crèche display and in 1992 they struck down a Rhode Island public school district's prayer at graduations.In Greece's appeal, Hungar urged the justices to consider America's history of legislative prayer dating to its 18th century founding. The Obama administration filed a brief in support of the town. ""KEEPING GOVERNMENT NEUTRAL""Douglas Laycock, a lawyer representing town resident Susan Galloway and other challengers to the Greece prayer sessions, countered that the town's practice ""coerces"" people who attend meetings to join Christian invocations. Laycock said he was not arguing against non-denominational, inclusive prayer.""Give me an example of a prayer that would be acceptable to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus,"" Justice Samuel Alito insisted. As Laycock hesitated, Alito kept repeating, ""Give me an example. ... Give me an example.""Chief Justice John Roberts also was skeptical of Laycock's rationale. ""What exactly is coercive in this environment?"" he asked. ""Having to sit and listen to the prayer?""To sharp questioning by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has succeeded O'Connor as a pivotal vote among the nine, Laycock insisted the court could write a rule that would ensure legislative prayers were not exclusively Christian but that did not require excessive screening of prayers by officials.Laycock disagreed with Kagan's remark that the court seems to be making the law worse rather than better.""I don't think that's true,"" Laycock said. ""There are people who distort your decisions. There are people who misunderstand your decisions honestly ... But keeping government neutral as between religions has not been a controversial proposition in this court."" (Reporting by Joan Biskupic; Editing by Howard Goller, Amy Stevens and Bill Trott)"

During the arguments, Roberts asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli if he knew ""which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African-American voter turnout,"" claiming that state is Massachusetts.“I’m calling him out,” Galvin told the Boston Globe. “We have one of the highest voter registrations in the country, so this whole effort to make a cheap-shot point at Massachusetts is deceptive,” Galvin said.Galvin didn't dispute Roberts' point, but said Massachusetts shouldn't be falsely represented in the Chief Justice's argument.“The concept of black communities in Massachusetts not voting is an old slur, and it’s not true,” Galvin said. “I guess the point [Roberts] is trying to make is Mississippi is doing so much better they don’t need the Voting Rights Act. He can still relay that conclusion, but he shouldn’t be using phony statistics. It’s deceptive, and it’s truly disturbing.”Galvin wasn't the only one to question Roberts' comments. Tito Jackson, Boston city councilor and political director for Gov. Deval Patrick's most recent campaign, said Massachusetts has ""seen a great ­increase in voter participation in communities of color, particularly among African-Americans, Latinos, and Asian.""The AP reports a Supreme Court spokeswoman refused to offer supporting evidence of Roberts' comments.Roberts' comments during the hearings weren't the only ones that caused alarm. Questions posed by Justice Anthony Kennedy -- who HuffPost's Ryan Reilly reports ""is likely the only hope that voting rights advocates and the Obama administration have for the Supreme Court to uphold a crucial component of the Voting Rights Act"" -- alarmed progressives."

In 2011, Congress passed a law that effectively reduced the federal government's mandatory penalties for people convicted of crack offenses, but commuting the sentences represents the first time the reform has been applied to those convicted before it was adopted. ""If they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society,"" Obama explained in the statement. Three of the inmates -- Reynolds Wintersmith Jr., Clarence Aaron and Stephanie George -- were featured in a recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union about the thousands of people serving life in prison for nonviolent offenses. The report, which received attention from a range of media outlets, including The Huffington Post, revealed that more than 3,000 inmates were serving life without parole for drug, property and other nonviolent crimes as of 2012, comprising about 6 percent of the total life-without-parole population.Reynolds Wintersmith Jr., 39, has spent half of his life in prison, according to the report. He was arrested at 19 for dealing drugs and declined a plea offer of 10 years, choosing to go to trial. He was a street dealer, but opened himself up to the life-without-parole sentence because he was held accountable for the entire amount of cocaine sold as part of a conspiracy in which he had a small role. Clarence Aaron, 43, was sentenced to three life-without-parole sentences as a college student for playing a minor role in two large, planned drug deals. He wouldn't testify against his co-conspirators, but they testified against him and received reduced sentences. Stephanie Yvette George, 43, was sentenced to life in prison without parole at age 26 after the father of one of her children used her attic to store drugs and cash. The harshness of the sentence was due, in part, to prior convictions for selling small amounts of crack. Though George said she didn't know the drugs were hidden in her home, six cooperating witnesses testified that she was paid to store cocaine. Prior to Thursday, Obama had pardoned only 11 people for drug crimes, and had used his powers of clemency to provide relief to just 40 people in all -- fewer than any other modern president. In recent months, his administration has portrayed the country's tough drug policies as unjust, but his decision to commute these sentences may be the most significant step to curtail the war on drugs. In addition to the eight people convicted of crack offenses, he also pardoned 13 others for various crimes.Vanita Gupta, the deputy legal director of the ACLU, called the decision an ""incredibly important development."" ""The president took the enormous step of giving hope and new life to people who were doomed to die behind bars for nonviolent offenses,"" she said. ""Of course, we know there are thousands who are in similar situations in prison, and so now we really need to do the work to change the laws around the country to prevent these sorts of extreme sentences from taking place on our soil.""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated that the president had commuted the sentences of only 11 drug offenders prior to Thursday; that is in fact the previous number of pardons granted to drug offenders."

Currently, a donor may only give $123,300 in total, made up of sub-limits of $48,600 to candidates and $74,600 to party committees and PACs.The plaintiff, Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon, hopes that the court will eliminate these limits, arguing earlier this year that the issue is ""a very important First Amendment case about freedom of speech.""On Thursday, speaking at an event held by the Constitutional Accountability Center, Warren argued, ""If the court continues in the direction of Citizens United, we may move another step closer to neutering Congress' ability to limit the influence of money in politics and another step closer to unlimited corporate contributions given directly to candidates and political committees.""Warren also endorsed the research of her former academic colleague, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, on the framers of the Constitution's original definition of corruption and on the ways in which Congress has become warped by monied interests.Lessig, who followed Warren Thursday with a presentation on his research, sought to frame the McCutcheon case, and the money-in-politics issue generally, in terms the conservative justices on the Supreme Court would respond to. Lessig and the Constitutional Accountability Center have filed an amicus brief in the McCutcheon case based on his research and arguments.The Supreme Court -- most dramatically in the 2010 Citizens United decision -- has stated that the only type of corruption able to be regulated is quid pro quo, cash-for-votes corruption. But, according to Lessig, this is not the way the framers understood corruption and, thus, neither should the five conservative justices on the court.Two chapters from the Federalist Papers are of particular interest to Lessig. In Federalist 52, James Madison writes that the federal government created by the Constitution should have at least one branch ""dependent upon the people alone."" In Federalist 57, Madison writes that the people on whom that branch depends should be ""not the rich, more than the poor.""Lessig argued that the oversized reliance of members of Congress on their campaign donors is an institutional corruption of the dependence that Congress is supposed to have ""upon the people alone."" The foundation for his argument is a number of statements and writings by the framers concerning corruption of this nature -- evidence a constitutional originalist would take into consideration.Lessig said he had found at least 325 specific instances in which the framers used the term corruption (collected here in a Tumblr blog). Of those, only six explained corruption as a trading of favors, while there were 29 mentions of corruption as an ""improper dependence."" He also found that 57 percent of the mentions of corruption were about institutions, rather than individuals.This argument is designed to paint into a corner the five conservative justices, who commonly favor eliminating campaign finance limits, by suggesting that their efforts conflict with the original intent of the framers.In the McCutcheon case, he argued, the elimination of campaign contribution limits would likely reduce the overall number of donors to campaigns and, thus, make Congress even more dependent upon an even smaller slice of donors, who are not representative of the people. Lessig used research done by National Institute of Money in State Politics executive director Ed Bender that shows that contribution limits expand the number of donors while the elimination of contribution limits reduces the number of donors.""If you eliminate the cap on aggregate contributions, the number of funders in the system will fall even more than it has so far,"" Lessig said. ""And if the number of funders drop, then the dependence corruption within the system, as I've just described it, only gets worse.""But Lessig said he is optimistic that the justices will look at the McCutcheon case and the original definition of corruption used by the framers and form a strong majority to uphold the aggregate campaign contribution limits."

Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) commemorated the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington with an eyebrow-raising list of issues he believes are plaguing the black community.In an address on his radio show billed as ""My Own Dream For America,"" Walsh unleashed a line of racially charged comments, headed by his view that African Americans suffer from ""dependency on the government plantation."" From Walsh's show's website:Of all the commentators who have been asking whether King’s dream has been achieved, FOX News’ Juan Williams seems to be the only one with whom I agree. When asked by Chris Wallace if the dream has been fulfilled, Williams noted that there isn’t, “any question that [African Americans] have come along way,” before importantly pointing out that blacks have to address the problems that are created within their communities. “I think that if you look at the realities of today, you’ve got to talk about things like family breakdown,” Williams said. “You’ve got to talk about the fact that 70 percent of black children today are born out of wedlock. I think Dr. King would cry.” I agree with Juan, but instead of invoking King’s legacy to lament about present problems I’ve decided to share my own dream.I have a dream that all black parents will have the right to choose where their kids attend school.I have a dream that all black boys and girls will grow up with a father.I have a dream that young black men will stop shooting other young black men.I have a dream that all young black men will say ""no"" to gangs and to drugs.I have a dream that all black young people will graduate from high school.I have a dream that young black men won't become fathers until after they're married and they have a job.I have a dream that young unmarried black women will say ""no"" to young black men who want to have sex.I have a dream that today's black leadership will quit blaming racism and ""the system"" for what ails black America.I have a dream that black America will take responsibility for improving their own lives.I have a dream that one day black America will cease their dependency on the government plantation, which has enslaved them to lives of poverty, and instead depend on themselves, their families, their churches, and their communities.Walsh was soundly defeated in November 2012 by Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). The tea party favorite has turned heads with race-related remarks in the past, headed by his belief that President Barack Obama is ""a historic figure"" who was only elected because he is black. ""The country voted for him because of that. It made us feel good about [our]self."" Walsh said in April 2012, according to Think Progress. ""I’ve said it before, it helped that John McCain was about 142 years old. It helped that the economy was tanking. A lot of these things helped. But he never would have gotten there without his historic nature.""(H/T Mother Jones)"

Instead of the Hollywood portrayal of beautiful plantations, benevolent masters, and simple happy slaves, it shows the utterly brutal violence of a systematic attempt to dehumanize an entire race of people -- for economic greed. It reveals how morally outrageous the slave system was, and it is very hard to watch.That's why we have to see it, all of us -- especially all of us white people. You can read the blog series on the film that we have been running in Sojourners, but you must go see it. I say that because many white people, even white people who care about social justice, have told me they don't want to see it. ""Too violent,"" I hear them say, ""Sounds too intense for me."" The enslavement of more than 4 million people of African descent by white Americans was always that violent and too intense for most white people to really accept the truth -- even now.My comment from the panel afterward was that most white people, the vast majority in both the South and the North including our ""founding fathers,"" all accepted slavery. Most white people, white Christians, and white churches tolerated slavery for 246 years. This historically horrendous evil existed because we tolerated it. That's why evil always continues to exist: because we tolerate it.What do we tolerate today, I asked. The film is so breathtaking, I worry that it becomes a museum movie, a film about a horrible past that is gratefully all over now. We did tolerate this gratuitous evil, and still tolerate the devaluing of black lives today. Would we tolerate completely dysfunctional urban schools if they were full of young white children? We tolerate a criminal justice system where the racial disparities between white and black arrests, convictions, and sentencing are abundantly clear, resulting in the mass incarceration of men of color. We tolerate the murder rates for people of color that we would never tolerate for whites. We tolerate the clear racial profiling of young black men, with results that we would never tolerate for our white teenage boys. And we tolerate deliberate and clear political efforts to diminish the votes of minority communities.And it's time to be honest about the deep-seated sense of race in the heart of our national politics. But when people of color speak the truth about the realities of race in our culture and politics, they are always accused of ""playing the race card."" So let me, as a white man and an evangelical Christian, do some truth-telling about race in American politics right now.In only about 30 years, most Americans will come from Africa, Asia, or Latin America. Most Americans will no longer be white, and many white Americans are clearly not ready for that profound demographic change in their country. That white fear of who ""we"" Americans will be is at the heart of resistance to immigration reform. Many older conservative Republican and Tea Party voters are acutely aware of being ""white"" in a country that is becoming increasingly ""minority."" Congressional voting districts have been oddly gerrymandered along racial lines to protect dominant racial majorities. Shutting down a government that they believe to be too generous to minorities becomes an urgent matter. ""Obamacare"" becomes the great threat of government providing medical insurance disproportionately to poor people of color. Giving food stamps to poor families becomes another racial flashpoint for conservative white voters.Finally, a black president becomes the most hated symbol of the demographic changes they most fear for their country.Questioning Barack Obama's birthplace and parentage, calling him a non-Christian Muslim, naming him as a ""foreigner"" and not a ""real American"" are all ways to define this president as ""the other"" and not one of ""us."" The hatred goes far beyond Obama's policies and extends to his personage as the wrong kind of American. Obama shows them they are losing elections, and they fear that means losing ""their"" country.Who will lead in our racially polarized time? Who will help America navigate its changing demographic future? Who will help a new generation create a diverse, multiracial society? Perhaps a community of faith that is intrinsically multiracial and is becoming so more and more.Because of recent events that demonstrate the racial challenges ahead, more than 70 Christian leaders -- white, African American, Hispanic, Asian American, and Native American --are launching a pledge called ""One Church | One Body.""

John Hickenlooper this week blocked the execution of Nathan Dunlap, he called for a statewide conversation about the death penalty. His decision to reprieve the Chuck E. Cheese’s murderer came weeks after Colorado lawmakers killed a bill to abolish capital punishment on grounds that the topic needs more public debate.But no such discussion has yet been planned yet by the politicians. In the meantime, civil rights watchdogs are hoping to advance the conversation in court by continuing to pursue a lawsuit tied to Dunlap’s execution.“Up until two days ago, Colorado was scheduling an execution for this summer. The Governor has taken that execution off the calendar, but he has not taken the death penalty off the public agenda,” Mark Silverstein, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, said Friday. “The public has an interest in learning exactly what the state plans to do the next time an execution [lands on its calendar].”Dunlap was convicted of killing four people in an Aurora Chuck E. Cheese’s restaurant in 1993. He exhausted legal appeals this spring and was scheduled for execution in August. The ACLU sued Colorado’s Department of Corrections on Tuesday seeking access to documentation that would detail how the state planned to put Dunlap to death.Despite Dunlap’s reprieve and the fact that neither of the state’s two other death row inmates are scheduled for execution, the ACLU’s interest in state policies and procedures still stands. The group plans to pursue its legal battle to uncover details about the training, procedures and protocols the corrections department has put in place since executing its last inmate, Gary Davis, in 1997.Of particular concern is how a lethal injection, the state’s method of execution, would be implemented. Davis was killed 15 years ago with three drugs, including a non-lethal dose of barbiturate or anesthetic, followed by a drug that caused paralysis and then a drug that caused death by cardiac arrest. The so-called three-drug cocktail, in which the anesthetic dosage sometimes is too low and doesn’t work, has drawn medical, legal and ethical criticism in several states for causing extreme pain while the prisoner is paralyzed and enduring a heart attack.Colorado law specifically requires lethal injection be carried out by the continuous injection of just one drug.Concerns about the methods to be used in Dunlap’s case heightened last month when corrections officials sent a letter to several pharmacists requesting “sodium thiopental, pentobarbital, pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride, or similar drug or drugs that the CDOC can purchase.” The drug list raised questions about whether corrections officials intended to abide by the one-drug statute, prompting the ACLU to seek copies of communications between the state and pharmacies and a secret document outlining DOC’s execution protocols.Corrections officials refused to disclose those documents. They also declined to comment about the ACLU suit after Dunlap’s reprieve other than to say they intend to conceal the identities of the pharmacists willing to provide the drugs. Officials said they wanted to protect the pharmacists’ privacy and prevent “public pressures” such as protests and boycotts that, as spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson put it, “could interfere with our duty under the statute.”Jacobson said her department is dedicated to carrying out the wishes of its former director Tom Clements, a death penalty opponent who was slain in March and who sought to improve relationships with the ACLU and other groups watchdogging the state prison system. She added that she “doesn’t disagree” that seeking the documents is a way to further the debate about the death penalty in Colorado.“Still, our opinion is that the documents are restricted,” she added. “It looks like we’ll be discussing it in court.”Continued conversation about how exactly Colorado would put inmates to death could affect the likelihood that the state’s two other death row inmates, Sir Mario Owens and Robert Ray, are ever executed. It could also affect sentencing decisions in cases in which the death penalty is being sought, cases such as the one against Edward Montour, whose guilty plea in the 2002 murder of a prison guard was tossed by a judge in April, and James Homes, the alleged shooter in last summer’s Aurora movie theater massacre.The ACLU’s Silverstein says access to the DOC’s secret documents is as relevant as ever.“We’re moving forward. More facts and more details about how executions are carried out will facilitate lots of conversations that need to take place about the death penalty.”Hickenlooper’s announcement Wednesday to block Dunlap’s execution was applauded by dozens of social-justice groups, including the ACLU. Critics have derided Colorado’s capital punishment practices on legal and ethical grounds, including the fact that all three men on death row — Dunlap among them — are African American in a state with a population that’s less than 5 percent black.“Colorado’s system of capital punishment is imperfect and inherently inequitable,” Hickenlooper said in announcing his decision. “Such a level of punishment really does demand perfection.”

But the swollen, chaotic state of California's 33 prisons -- 18 of which operate at more than 180 percent capacity -- may lead to another unconstitutional policy: race-based lockdowns. The California system is currently under fire for managing violence among the massive numbers of inmates by confining whole races of individuals to their cells for 24 hours a day during lockdowns that can last for years.""It's incredible that this is happening in the 21st century,"" said Rebekah Evenson, the attorney for the Prison Law Office, which filed a class action lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation last month on behalf of inmates claiming they were victims of race-based lockdowns. ""The level of violence and level of lockdowns are very closely tied to overcrowding,"" said Evenson. But the overcrowding does not justify controlling populations based on race, Evenson argued. California is the only state in the country to adopt this type of policy, and it imposes approximately one race-based lockdown each day in one of the system's 30 male prisons, the suit alleged. During these types of lockdowns, usually the result of a fight between a gang of one race and a gang of another race, all members of each race are confined to their cells for 24 hours a day, regardless of whether they were involved in the incident. This means that many inmates can find themselves denied exercise, educational programs, family visits and even sunlight for months at a time for merely being the same race as an inmate involved in a fight.The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation denies they have an institutional policy of race-based lockdowns. However, multiple documents from the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations Appeals Branch ""note that the CDCR policy is that when there is an incident involving any race, all inmates of that race are locked up.""""There is no policy,"" said Levance Quinn, public information officer for Sacramento State Prison, where currently about 500 inmates remain on 24-hour lockdown following a riot on Friday. ""But I understand from the outside looking in how someone could confuse that,"" he said. Quinn explained that gang fights happen all the time and that multiple gangs exist within each racial or ethnic group. Those types of fights -- when one white gang fights another white gang, for example -- aren't big security issues. The problem occurs when members of two different racial groups fight, said Quinn, because prison culture dictates that inmates must stick up for their fellow brothers.""If someone from a black gang fights someone from a white gang, then all the blacks and all the whites get involved. So then you have to lock everyone down to make sure it's safe,"" he said.This type of situation occurred last year in Sacramento, leading to a 24-hour lockdown that ran from Jan. 19 to Dec. 11 for every black and southern Hispanic inmate in the prison section known as B Facility, a building that houses 500 inmates in all. (Northern and southern Hispanics are often in opposing gangs, and CDCR sometimes divides the ethnic group into these two categories.) This lockdown ran for so long, the prison arranged for the two groups to make alternate trips to the yard to get exercise. Quinn said that even though black and southern Hispanic inmates who had nothing to do with the fight were on lockdown for nearly a year, it's not indicative of an institutional race-based policy.""It's not based on their race; it's based on these two knuckleheads that got in a fight,"" said Quinn. ""It's really hard to explain to the outside world,"" he added.A blue sign hangs outside the wall of one of Evenson's defendants, Hanif Abdullah, jailed at Solano. It denotes a black inmate, and Abdullah has been confined to his cell for 24-hour lockdowns that applied to all black inmates five times in the last two years, Evenson's suit alleges. Abdullah's cell, which he shares with one other inmate and is so small the two can barely stand up at the same time, has one window that looks into the interior of the dormitory. Each day during his confinement, which lasted a total of approximately six months over the course of two years, Abdullah watched the rest of the prison world go about their business just by virtue of not being black.""He could hear staff announcing the privileges available to other races, 'School release for everyone except those [blacks] on lockdown,' 'Yard release for everyone except those [blacks] on lockdown,'"" the suit reads. ""Mr. Abdullah suffered from the indignity, humiliation, and inhumanity, of the stark race discrimination."" "

The bill, filed Monday by two GOP lawmakers from Rowan County and backed by nine other Republicans, says each state ""is sovereign"" and courts cannot block a state ""from making laws respecting an establishment of religion."" The legislation was filed in response to a lawsuit to stop county commissioners in Rowan County from opening meetings with a Christian prayer, wral.com reported. The religion bill comes as some Republican-led states seek to separate themselves from the federal government, primarily on the issues of guns and Obamacare. This includes a proposal in Mississippi to establish a state board with the power to nullify federal laws. The North Carolina bill's main sponsors, state Reps. Carl Ford (R-China Grove) and Harry Warren (R-Salisbury), could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, The Salisbury Post reported. Co-sponsors include House Majority Leader Edgar Starnes (R-Hickory). Another is state Rep. Larry Pittman (R-Concord), who in February introduced a state constitutional amendment that would allow for carrying concealed weapons to fight federal ""tyranny."" The bill says the First Amendment only applies to the federal government and does not stop state governments, local governments and school districts from adopting measures that defy the Constitution. The legislation also says that the Tenth Amendment, which says powers not reserved for the federal government belong to the states, prohibits court rulings that would seek to apply the First Amendment to state and local officials. The bill reads:SECTION 1. The North Carolina General Assembly asserts that the Constitution of the United States of America does not prohibit states or their subsidiaries from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.SECTION 2. The North Carolina General Assembly does not recognize federal court rulings which prohibit and otherwise regulate the State of North Carolina, its public schools, or any political subdivisions of the State from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.The North Carolina state constitution disqualifies those who do not believe in God from public office. The provision has been unenforcible since the 1961 Supreme Court decision in Torcaso v. Watkins, which prohibited such bans. "

Months of work aimed at revamping the nation's gun laws prompted by one of the worst shooting tragedies in U.S. history met an inglorious conclusion on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Wednesday.  Every single measure pushed by President Barack Obama -- expanded background checks, a strengthened federal gun trafficking statute, limits on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines -- failed to receive the necessary 60 votes to prevent a filibuster. By the time all seven amendments (including those sponsored by Republicans) had been rejected, family members of gun violence victims were left sorrowed, the president was left seething and advocates for the bills were left searching for explanations.   ""I'm going to keep on fighting,"" Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), sponsor of the background check bill, told The Huffington Post in an interview shortly after the votes. ""The only thing I've said is I cannot knowingly put a loophole in a gun show or an Internet sale just for the sake of getting a vote. I cannot do that. But if there is some wording that would prohibit someone from misinterpreting what we are trying to do ... I'm more than willing to listen to that and work with them.""The background check bill, Manchin noted, had been his ""coming out party"" in the Senate -- the first high-profile piece of legislation in his 2 1/2 years in the chamber. That it ended with a thud perplexed him. ""The pressure! Oh, the outside pressures,"" Manchin said of the forces that ultimately felled him. ""I guess sometimes the trappings of being in elected office are overwhelming."" For the West Virginia Democrat and others, there was simply no good answer to the question of what could have been done differently. At least not in the immediate aftermath of the defeat The president had barnstormed the country and lobbied lawmakers on the phone. Allied groups had run ad campaigns and organized in congressional districts. One group had even injected itself into a special election. The administration's gun working group could have moved a bit quicker in making legislative recommendations. But only by weeks.""I’ve heard the theory advanced that if he just moved quickly, Congress would have been forced to act,"" said David Axelrod, Obama's former top aide. ""But I think the forces of delay would have taken hold anyway.""Democrats could have tried to trade the assault weapons ban in negotiations later, rather than discarding it as impossible to pass early on. But, as one leadership aide said, ""No one would take it seriously as a bargaining chip."" In the end, the Senate -- where members from rural areas have just as much sway as their colleagues from heavily-populated states -- proved to be the cooling saucer it has always been, much to the chagrin of those who expected this time to be different. Obama was ""tremendously committed and emotionally engaged"" in the gun debate, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who shepherded Newtown families through the halls of Congress in the days before the vote. And while the debate moved far over the past four months, he added, in the end ""the NRA has exercised a stranglehold.""Speaking in the Rose Garden later Wednesday, Obama was far less courteous with his ire. Word had just come that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) would pull the entire gun bill from the floor on Thursday. Surrounded by family members of gun violence victims, Obama called the outcome ""shameful."" ""There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn’t do this,"" said Obama. ""It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment."" Hours earlier, on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, the scene was somber. Those same family members trickled out of the Senate, their emotions ranging from disappointment to rage.  ""I'm more aware than anyone in this entire world that background checks wouldn't have saved my mom,"" said Erica Lafferty, whose mother Dawn Hochsprung was killed in the Newtown shootings. ""But background checks might make sure that another 27-year-old doesn't have to get buried.""  Lafferty, whose eyes filled with tears as she spoke, was referring to Vicki Soto, a teacher killed in the Newtown shootings. Soto's sister Carlee was on Capitol Hill to watch the vote, too. And although she had conditioned herself for disappointment, she couldn't hide her sorrow over the outcome. Having met with a number of senators in the days leading up to the vote, she couldn't wrap her head around their reasons for opposition.   ""It's too much paperwork. It's too time-consuming,"" Soto said, voice rising, of criticisms over background check legislation. ""Time-consuming? The Newtown shootings took three minutes. You can't take three minutes out of your day to fill out a background check? That's nonsense. And it's disgusting.""  Some people had gripes with specific senators. Pam Simon, a former aide to former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) who was shot two times in the 2011 Tucson massacre, said she was ""extremely proud"" of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for supporting the background checks bill. As for Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a close friend of Giffords who voted against the measure, she had to censor her opinions. Asked what she thought about Flake's vote, Simon only smiled and said, ""That I can say into your microphone?""  ""I reminded him that he has a poster on his office wall of 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,'"" Simon said, adding. ""He needs to re-watch that movie.""  As lawmakers filtered out of the chamber, they commiserated with the disappointed. Soto collapsed in tears into the arms of Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). ""We're not giving up,"" Soto told him. ""We're not going away.""Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) put her hand on Simon's shoulder. ""Don't give up and don't give in,"" she said. ""The gun industry does not control America.""  Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) hugged several of those in attendance. ""This is just the beginning,"" he offered. Giffords, who sat in the Senate during the failed vote, told reporters she was still ""optimistic” about future action. At the White House later, the president pledged to her and others that this wouldn't be the last legislative push for background checks during his term, an administration aide confirmed. Reid left the door open to revisiting the measure too, using a procedural motion that allows him to bring the bill back up if lawmakers want to take another crack it.Still, there was little in the way of encouragement that anyone, even the president, could offer the family members, except the promise to renew the legislative fight later. The Senate was a stubborn institution, they all explained. And it might take changing its membership to pave the way for anything to happen. ""Until people start losing their jobs over these issues it is going to be very hard to defeat the NRA,"" conceded Axelrod.   "

He suggested withdrawing security clearances and imposing other administrative sanctions could suffice in certain cases.“The President agrees with the Justice Department’s recommendation and has directed his team to explore how the Administration could more effectively use alternatives in appropriate cases,” Lehrich told HuffPost.DOJ’s report is available here. The full statement from Lehrich:“The President appreciates the Justice Department’s work to revise their guidelines, and he believes this report is an important step towards finding the balance between dealing with dangerous leaks of classified national security information and protecting the rights of journalists to freely gather and report the news. He also continues to believe that Congress should quickly pass media shield legislation and looks forward to working with them to do so.“Additionally, as the Justice Department states in its report, pursuing a criminal investigation and prosecution is not always the most efficient and effective way to address leaks of classified information. There are circumstances in which leaks are better addressed through administrative means, such as withdrawal of security clearances or imposition of other sanctions. The President agrees with the Justice Department’s recommendation and has directed his team to explore how the Administration could more effectively use alternatives in appropriate cases.”

The letter, he told the committee, said his college ""violated the standards for diversity because we didn't have enough dark ones, I guess, is what they meant."" According to Michigan-focused news site MLive, lawmakers at the meeting immediately criticized Arnn for using “offensive” language, but he did not apologize. Instead, Arnn went on to say: “The State of Michigan sent a group of people down to my campus, with clipboards ... to look at the colors of people’s faces and write down what they saw. We don’t keep records of that information. What were they looking for besides dark ones?"" A Michigan Department of Education spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that officials visited Hillsdale in 1998 for a routine evaluation of the school’s teacher preparation program. During that visit, they noted the ethnicity of the students and faculty members in the program. Several hours after Arnn made his initial statements, Hillsdale College issued an official apology. “No offense was intended by the use of that term except to the offending bureaucrats,"" read the statement, which was published by MLive. It further said that while Arnn was sorry if offense was taken, his greater concern “is the state-endorsed racism the story illustrates.""Located in Hillsdale, Mich., the small liberal arts institution over which Arnn presides was founded in 1844. According to its website, the school ""was the first American college to prohibit in its charter any discrimination based on race, religion or sex, and became an early force for the abolition of slavery.” Hillsdale does not receive state or federal subsidies and avoids “federal mandates and control,” another page on its site says. An alum told MLive he believes Arnn’s comments were misunderstood. “I think this was Dr. Arnn’s way to indicate that he was offended with what they were doing in taking clipboards and walking around campus to record the color of students’ skin,” James Joseph, a 2010 graduate, told the outlet. “He’s a very magnanimous man with a generous and charitable spirit, but he doesn’t stand on public piety.”Hillsdale College is notably conservative. In 2012, the Young America Foundation ranked it one of the most conservative colleges in the country. The Hillsdale Collegian also reported that in 2012, Arnn’s most substantial campaign donation was to tea party favorite Congressman Tim Walberg. "

But the swollen, chaotic state of California's 33 prisons -- 18 of which operate at more than 180 percent capacity -- may lead to another unconstitutional policy: race-based lockdowns. The California system is currently under fire for managing violence among the massive numbers of inmates by confining whole races of individuals to their cells for 24 hours a day during lockdowns that can last for years.""It's incredible that this is happening in the 21st century,"" said Rebekah Evenson, the attorney for the Prison Law Office, which filed a class action lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation last month on behalf of inmates claiming they were victims of race-based lockdowns. ""The level of violence and level of lockdowns are very closely tied to overcrowding,"" said Evenson. But the overcrowding does not justify controlling populations based on race, Evenson argued. California is the only state in the country to adopt this type of policy, and it imposes approximately one race-based lockdown each day in one of the system's 30 male prisons, the suit alleged. During these types of lockdowns, usually the result of a fight between a gang of one race and a gang of another race, all members of each race are confined to their cells for 24 hours a day, regardless of whether they were involved in the incident. This means that many inmates can find themselves denied exercise, educational programs, family visits and even sunlight for months at a time for merely being the same race as an inmate involved in a fight.The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation denies they have an institutional policy of race-based lockdowns. However, multiple documents from the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations Appeals Branch ""note that the CDCR policy is that when there is an incident involving any race, all inmates of that race are locked up.""""There is no policy,"" said Levance Quinn, public information officer for Sacramento State Prison, where currently about 500 inmates remain on 24-hour lockdown following a riot on Friday. ""But I understand from the outside looking in how someone could confuse that,"" he said. Quinn explained that gang fights happen all the time and that multiple gangs exist within each racial or ethnic group. Those types of fights -- when one white gang fights another white gang, for example -- aren't big security issues. The problem occurs when members of two different racial groups fight, said Quinn, because prison culture dictates that inmates must stick up for their fellow brothers.""If someone from a black gang fights someone from a white gang, then all the blacks and all the whites get involved. So then you have to lock everyone down to make sure it's safe,"" he said.This type of situation occurred last year in Sacramento, leading to a 24-hour lockdown that ran from Jan. 19 to Dec. 11 for every black and southern Hispanic inmate in the prison section known as B Facility, a building that houses 500 inmates in all. (Northern and southern Hispanics are often in opposing gangs, and CDCR sometimes divides the ethnic group into these two categories.) This lockdown ran for so long, the prison arranged for the two groups to make alternate trips to the yard to get exercise. Quinn said that even though black and southern Hispanic inmates who had nothing to do with the fight were on lockdown for nearly a year, it's not indicative of an institutional race-based policy.""It's not based on their race; it's based on these two knuckleheads that got in a fight,"" said Quinn. ""It's really hard to explain to the outside world,"" he added.A blue sign hangs outside the wall of one of Evenson's defendants, Hanif Abdullah, jailed at Solano. It denotes a black inmate, and Abdullah has been confined to his cell for 24-hour lockdowns that applied to all black inmates five times in the last two years, Evenson's suit alleges. Abdullah's cell, which he shares with one other inmate and is so small the two can barely stand up at the same time, has one window that looks into the interior of the dormitory. Each day during his confinement, which lasted a total of approximately six months over the course of two years, Abdullah watched the rest of the prison world go about their business just by virtue of not being black.""He could hear staff announcing the privileges available to other races, 'School release for everyone except those [blacks] on lockdown,' 'Yard release for everyone except those [blacks] on lockdown,'"" the suit reads. ""Mr. Abdullah suffered from the indignity, humiliation, and inhumanity, of the stark race discrimination."" "

Why is there more anger, vituperation, and political polarization now than even during Joe McCarthy's anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s, the tempestuous struggle for civil rights in the 1960s, the divisive Vietnam war, or the Watergate scandal?If anything, you'd think this would be an era of relative calm. The Soviet Union has disappeared and the Cold War is over. The Civil Rights struggle continues, but at least we now have a black middle class and even a black president. While the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been controversial, the all-volunteer army means young Americans aren't being dragged off to war against their will. And although politicians continue to generate scandals, the transgressions don't threaten the integrity of our government as did Watergate. And yet, by almost every measure, Americans are angrier today. They're more contemptuous of almost every major institution -- government, business, the media. They're more convinced the nation is on the wrong track. And they are far more polarized.Political scientists say the gap between the median Republican voter and the median Democrat is wider today on a whole host of issues than it's been since the 1920s.Undoubedly, social media play a part -- allowing people to pop off without bearing much responsibility for what they say. And most of us can cocoon within virtual or real communities whose members confirm all our biases and assumptions. Meanwhile, cable news and yell radio compete for viewers and listeners by being ever more strident. Not long ago I debated a Republican economic advisor on a cable TV program. During the brief station-break, the show's producer told me to ""be angrier."" I told her I didn't want to be angrier. ""You have to,"" she said. ""Viewers are surfing through hundreds of channels and will stop for a gladiator contest.""Within this cacophony, we've lost trusted arbiters of truth -- the Edward Murrows and Walter Cronkites who could explain what was happening in ways most Americans found convincing.We've also lost most living memory of an era in which we were all in it together -- the Great Depression and World War II -- when we succeeded or failed together. In those years we were palpably dependent on one another, and understood how much we owed each other as members of the same society.But I think the deeper explanation for what has happened has economic roots. From the end of World War II through the late 1970s, the economy doubled in size -- as did almost everyone's income. Almost all Americans grew together. In fact, those in the bottom fifth of the income ladder saw their incomes more than double. Americans experienced upward mobility on a grand scale.Yet for the last three and a half decades, the middle class has been losing ground. The median wage of male workers is now lower than it was in 1980, adjusted for inflation.In addition, all the mechanisms we've used over the last three decades to minimize the effects of this descent -- young mothers streaming into paid work in the late 1970s and 1980s, everyone working longer hours in the 1990s, and then borrowing against the rising values of our homes -- are now exhausted. And wages are still dropping -- the median is now 4 percent below what it was at the start of the so-called recovery.Meanwhile, income, wealth, and power have become more concentrated at the top than they've been in ninety years.As a result, many have come to believe that the deck is stacked against them. Importantly, both the Tea Party and the Occupier movements began with the bailouts of Wall Street -- when both groups concluded that big government and big finance had plotted against the rest of us. The former blamed government; the latter blamed Wall Street.Political scientists have also discovered a high correlationbetween inequality and political divisiveness.The last time America was this bitterly divided was in the 1920s, which was the last time income, wealth, and power were this concentrated.When average people feel the game is rigged, they get angry. And that anger can easily find its way into deep resentments -- of the poor, of blacks, of immigrants, of unions, of the well-educated, of government. This shouldn't be surprising. Demagogues throughout history have used anger to target scapegoats -- thereby dividing and conquering, and distracting people from the real sources of their frustrations.Make no mistake: The savage inequality America is experiencing today is deeply dangerous.ROBERT B.

They taunted him as a ""terrorist"" and arrested him for refusing to obey ""an officer's lawful command,"" reports the ACLU.On his March 26th court date, Judge Aubrey Rimes of the Pike County Justice Court ejected him from the courtroom stating that Singh would not be allowed to re-enter unless he removed ""that rag"" from his head.Singh's attorney confirmed that Rimes expelled him due to his turban. However, Singh's faith mandates the covering and he believes that to unwrap it in public would be both sacrilegious and shameful.A subsequent Department of Justice investigation prompted the Pike County Board of Supervisors to revise the County's non-discrimination policy to say that religious discrimination includes, ""requiring an individual to remove a head covering or denying that individual access to a County office, building, program or activity because they are wearing a head covering, if that head covering is worn for religious reasons.""American Sikhs often encounter misunderstandings about their faith, and a Stanford University survey published earlier this month revealed that though almost all turban-wearers in America are Sikh, about 70% of Americans misidentify turban-wearers as Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, or members of the Shinto faith. The survey also discovered that nearly half of Americans think that Sikhism is a sect of Islam, and more associate the turban with Osama bin Laden rather than with the Muslim and Sikh alternative.The letter comes on the heels of yet another incident of Sikh harassment, as Columbia professor Dr. Prabhjot Singh was brutally attacked in Harlem on Saturday night, beaten by a hate mob who called him ""terrorist,"" and ""Osama."""

Now another statement from the interview -- this time about the black community during the pre-civil rights era -- is stirring more controversy. GQ's Drew Magary sat down with the ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch for a candid interview about his road to fame. The 67-year-old journeyed from substance abuse to devotion to God to small-screen celebrity, all in the backwoods of Louisiana. According to Robertson, growing up in those Louisiana backwoods in the pre-civil rights era was not bad for black people. “I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person,"" Robertson is quoted in GQ. ""Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I’m with the blacks, because we’re white trash. We’re going across the field.... They’re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.”Before the civil rights movement of the 1950s, Jim Crow laws enforced a system of subjugating African-Americans in the South by upholding racial barriers for years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The cultural climate in the Southern states was one of ""disenfranchisement, segregation and various forms of oppression, including race-inspired violence,"" History.com notes. The Human Rights Campaign and the NAACP wrote a joint letter to the president of A&E, expressing deep concern over Robertson's remarks: We want to be clear why Phil Robertson’s remarks are not just dangerous but also inaccurate. Mr. Robertson claims that, from what he saw, African Americans were happier under Jim Crow. What he didn’t see were lynching and beatings of black men and women for attempting to vote or simply walking down the street. And his offensive claims about gay people fly in the face of science. In fact, it’s important to note that every single leading medical organization in the country has said that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being [lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender] -- it’s not a choice, and to suggest otherwise is dangerous. Robertson called homosexuality a sin and juxtaposed it with bestiality. After his homophobia made news, A&E released a statement announcing Robertson's indefinite suspension from ""Duck Dynasty."" The network emphasized that his beliefs are in contrast to those of the network.  "

In all of the cases, the men were arrested under the state's anti-sodomy law, which was struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2003 ruling in Lawrence v. Texas.Technically invalid yet still on the books, the state's ""Crime Against Nature"" law prohibits “unnatural carnal copulation by a human being with another of the same-sex or opposite-sex or with an animal” along with “solicitation by a human being of another with the intent to engage in any unnatural carnal copulation for compensation,” according to Louisiana legislature.“This is a law that is currently on the Louisiana books, and the sheriff is charged with enforcing the laws passed by our Louisiana Legislature,” Casey Rayborn Hicks, a Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman, told the Baton Rouge Advocate. “Whether the law is valid is something for the courts to determine, but the sheriff will enforce the laws that are enacted.”However, the Advocate also revealed that none of these cases had been prosecuted by District Attorney Hillar Moore III, whose office could find no evidence of any crime being committed by any of the arrested men.While Hicks argued that the fact that the men agreed to sex in a public park made their actions illegal, Equality Louisiana’s Bruce Parker told MSNBC.com that this claim carried little legitimacy as no sex ever actually happened in the park and most of the men intended to have sex at a private residence.“They started a conversation and the officer invited him back,"" Parker said. ""That’s a conversation that could happen anywhere. It’s the equivalent of me asking you out in a Post Office.” As outrage from advocates for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community grew over the weekend, the East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office posted two statement on its Facebook page. The first was a defense of the policy, which claimed that department was not trying to target or embarrass any particular community. ""When we receive calls from the public about lewd activity near our children, we have to respond,"" the statement reads. ""Our park operations, conducted at the specific request of the BREC Park’s Ranger, were an attempt to deter or stop lewd activity occurring in the park near children... The deputies used a statute that they felt fit the situation in order to remedy the concerns of the parents and park officials.""However, one hour and several Facebook comments later the department posted a second, more conciliatory status: The goal of our statement was to express our intent to the public, which was to keep the parks safe. We admit, however, the approach needs to change. We are not making excuses, simply stating we will learn from this, make changes and move forward. We will be working with all branches of government to find a better solution for keeping our parks safe. Thanks to all for their input.While it appears that law enforcement in Louisiana may be rethinking any further application of the anti-sodomy statutes, ThinkProgress notes that similar laws remain on the books in over a dozen other states. In fact, two years ago a Michigan sheriff’s office was revealed to be executing similar stings against gay men in the area.UPDATE on July 29 at 2:45pm ET: The East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff’s office has released a statement with an apology which note, ""While sections of La. R.S. 14:89, Crimes Against Nature, have not been removed from the Louisianalaw code, they have been deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional. The Sheriff’s Office will not use these unconstitutional sections of the law in future cases."" Read more at The New Civil Rights Movement.(h/t Raw Story)"

In this case, the teenager, identified only as ""Anonymous 5,"" is in foster care, but did not want to involve her foster parents out of fear that they would be so angry about her pregnancy that she could lose her placement at their home, according court documents.A girl can bypass the consent provision in certain cases. Minors do not need parental permission in cases of medical emergencies, if they are victims of abuse, or if they can prove they are mature and well-informed enough to make the decision alone. When she initially went before Judge Peter Bataillon in July, he ruled that she did not provide evidence she was a victim of abuse, and also ""failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that she is sufficiently mature and well informed.""However, as Slate points out, Anonymous 5 showed some pretty mature reasoning at her appeal last week.According to court documents, she testified that she could not ""be the right mom that [she] would like to be right now"" and could not support a child financially. She also feared her foster parents would likely take out their anger not only on her, but on her child. Finally, she pointed out that putting the baby up for adoption ""would be worse"" for her and her two siblings because of the resentment her foster parents would have towards her.

From what has been reported in the Associated Press, Dolan also said that the Catholic Church has been ""caricatured as being anti-gay.""No Cardinal Dolan, the Catholic Church hierarchy hasn't been 'outmarketed' on gay marriage, nor have you been 'caricatured' as anti-gay. The hard truth is that, while right on so many of the most important issues of our time, the Catholic Church leadership in America is wrong on the question of gay marriage and someday (probably centuries from now) you will have to own up to it. First of all, marketing isn't the problem. We know where the Catholic Church bishops stand on the issue as they have been engaged in a full on anti-gay marriage campaign including a recent exorcism against gay marriage in Illinois and using communion as a hostage against same sex marriage in New Jersey, not to mention the firing of a lesbian teacher from a Catholic school in Arkansas after her same sex marriage. The logic of the Catholic position against gay marriage seems to go something like this -- marriage is ultimately, and most importantly about procreation, if you can't naturally procreate, you shouldn't get married. This, of course, doesn't sit that well with heterosexuals who don't want, or are unable, to have children. And of course it is an intentional non-starter with homosexuals who have the wrong body parts. Stability, life long commitment, fidelity and love are not as crucial to the idea of marriage as procreation which is elevated above all else. For instance, the love between Edie Windsor and Thea Spyer that lasted over 40 years and including a final 30 years of Windsor caring for Spyer through her debilitating multiple sclerosis is demoted and diminished in the 'procreation' argument. Their life together, and love for each other doesn't rise to the level of marriage. What is happening with increasing speed is that Americans do understand the Catholic Church's position but that people just don't agree with its conclusions. In fact, even Catholics themselves don't agree with the Bishops position as polls show a majority of them are for gay marriage. In fact Catholics in the pews are more in favor of gay marriage than the national average.The other Cardinal Dolan comment that requires a response is that the church has been ""caricatured as being anti-gay."" The hard reality that Cardinal Dolan and all Christians need to face up to is that the Catholic Church along with every other church whether Orthodox, Protestant or Catholic has been horrifically, persistently and vehemently anti-gay for almost all of its history. This is a fact. There is no 'caricature' needed. The Church has inspired deep hatred of the LGBT community, and the fact that many of us who are LGBT still feel called to participate in the Church is perhaps the most powerful testimony to the presence of Christ that one can find in the world today. But for one to deny that the Church is anti-gay in one sentence and then to maintain a stance against gay marriage in the next adds injury to insult. Let's just be very clear here -- if you are against marriage equality you are anti-gay. Done. You can not say you are supportive of me as a gay man, and then say but you are against my marriage to my partner Brad. It just doesn't work that way. If you are against gay marriage you are against gay married people. In the future, if you want to know if your actions or words are anti-gay -- try asking a gay person. We'll be glad to let you know. The truth is, the Catholic Church, along with most religious traditions will eventually have to change their positions on LGBT people. It will take a long, long time. I certainly don't expect to live to see the Catholic Church hierarchy change official dogma on the issue. But I have faith that they will. And then a simple 'we're sorry' would be appreciated."

On Wednesday afternoon, Loretta Fuddy, the director of Hawaii's Department of Health, died in a small, commercial plane crash off the coast of the Hawaiian island Molokai. Fuddy, who had been director of Hawaii's health department since March 2011, was the official who verified and approved the release of President Obama's birth certificate. Fuddy said then that the records ""further prove the fact that he was born in Hawaii.""Early reports indicate that the plane, a 2002 Cessna Grand Caravan, suffered catastrophic engine failure. The other eight passengers on board were rescued. According to Rev. Patrick Killilea who met with the survivors, Fuddy was wearing her life jacket in the water and was holding hands with deputy director Keith Yamamoto when she let go. Tweets, comments, and web posts from the birther movement quickly insinuated that the tragedy was no accident. Some implied that the White House was ""tying up loose ends,"" while others commented ""that anyone with any connection to Obama or his background has a tendency to have a 'shortened' life span.""And, of course, Donald Trump weighed in: Despite the media whirlwind around the birther conspiracies, Fuddy's life and numerous successes are being celebrated. Just yesterday, a report published by the United Health Foundation, American Public Health Association and the Partnership for Prevention, confirmed that Hawaii is the country's healthiest state. According to Hawaii House Speaker Joe Souki, Fuddy, 65, “was especially passionate about the most vulnerable in our communities, a champion for mothers, newborns, and early childhood care. Her warm, caring spirit for the people of Hawaii will truly be missed.”“Our hearts are broken,” Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a statement. “Loretta was deeply loved and respected. She was selfless, utterly dedicated, and committed to her colleagues in the Department of Health and to the people of Hawaii. Her knowledge was vast; her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience.”In August, Fuddy told Honolulu's Midweek magazine, ""I'm a child of the '60s, the Kennedy era of 'ask what you can do for your country' public service and Catholic values."""

Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said. ""Shame on this Congress for allowing this to happen.""But the cut, which will reduce monthly benefits for all 47 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by roughly 7 percent, is happening thanks mainly to Democratic votes that hastened the demise of a benefit increase from the 2009 stimulus bill. Each of the representatives at Tuesday's presser voted with their party for a pair of 2010 spending bills that set the cuts in motion.The first bill took money allocated for future food stamp use and used it instead to prevent states from laying off teachers. Democrats supported the bill grudgingly, lamenting that it would cause a food stamp cut in 2014. When it came time to support a second bill that raided future food stamp funds once again, pushing the cut to November 2013, they protested -- at least at first. ""This is one of the more egregious cases of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and is a vote we do not take lightly,"" more than 100 Democrats wrote in an August 2010 letter to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). But then President Barack Obama smoothed things over in a meeting at the White House, because the bill in question was the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act -- a priority of the first lady's. The measure provided free lunches and updated nutrition standards for schools.""I am very pleased we were able to work together with the president and his team to address concerns regarding cuts to the food stamp program that are included in the child nutrition bill,"" Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in a statement at the time. On Tuesday, Lee told HuffPost the president had pledged to support replacing the SNAP funds, a vow he fulfilled in subsequent budget blueprints that didn't become law. Congress and the White House have been otherwise silent about the issue for the past three years.On Tuesday, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) defended the 2010 tradeoff. ""It was a piece of legislation that said let's change nutrition standards, let's get junk foods out of our schools, and let's make sure that our kids can have those fruits and vegetables,"" DeLauro told HuffPost. ""There was no money for it. The price of it was $2.2 billion. That came from the food stamp program and all of us here complained. And we were opposed to that but we knew that it was a good first step in getting the Hunger-Free Kids Act.""Friday's cut is happening thanks to the expiration of a 13.6 percent food stamp boost from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus bill. Originally, lawmakers had planned to let SNAP's annual inflation adjustments catch up to the increase sometime after 2015. Canceling the enhanced benefits this November means the government will spend $5 billion less on nutrition assistance next year -- an annual SNAP spending cut 25 percent larger than what House Republicans are seeking in farm bill negotiations starting this week. DeLauro pivoted from November's food stamp decrease to Republican demands that food stamps be reduced by 5 percent, or $40 billion over 10 years, though the two things are completely separate. ""This is about people wanting to make a $40 billion cut in the food stamp program,"" DeLauro said, ""not to put in place a Hunger-Free Kids Act, but in fact to take food out of the mouths of our children, or seniors, and the disabled. A much different time, a much different place, and a much different set of circumstances."" "

""Hi handsome,"" the reported transcript begins. ""I couldn't bear the idea of sitting down to write you another note.

Nowadays, he sees people on Twitter who don't even know the difference between ""your"" and ""you're."" (To which the actor asked: ""How the f--k did we become a society where mediocrity is acceptable?"")

Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison followed by three years probation by a federal judge in Washington on Wednesday for misusing about $750,000 in campaign funds.Jackson's wife, Sandra, was also sentenced Wednesday. She will serve one year in prison and was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, after pleading guilty to a related charge of filing false tax returns. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is not related to the Jacksons, allowed the couple to stagger their sentences so their children would have at least one parent at all times. Jackson Jr. will go to prison first, followed by Sandra.Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty in February to using campaign funds to purchase an array of personal items, including Bruce Lee memorabilia, a $43,000 Rolex watch and a mink cashmere cape.Jackson, the son of the civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, made an emotional plea to the judge Wednesday, wiping his eyes and blowing his nose as he asked the judge for some leniency. He apologized to his constituents and his family.""If probation is not available to her, give me her time,"" Jackson said, referring to his wife. He said he needed to be ""as far away from everybody for a while that I could be.""Reid Weingarten, Jackson's defense attorney, asked for an 18-month sentence for his client and argued that there were ""not widows and orphans surrounding the courthouse"" wanting Jackson's head. Weingarten said that there was a time when members of Congress could treat their campaign funds as retirement accounts. ""This is not Madoff, this is not a ponzi scheme,"" Weingarten said.But a federal prosecutor handling the case called Jackson's fraud one of the most significant abuses of the campaign system that has ever been documented and prosecuted. The government asked for four years in prison.U.S. District Judge Jackson said the Jacksons used the campaign as a ""personal piggybank,"" but said she was confident that ""there will be another chapter"" for Jackson Jr. But the judge said that while Jackson did not pose a threat to society, a significant jail sentence was necessary to serve as a deterrent to other politicians who might consider raiding their campaign coffers for personal gain.""The ethical standard has got to be simply higher than unindicted,"" Judge Jackson said. She said she would have trouble explaining a probation sentence to the donors whose campaigns funds the couple misused.Judge Jackson said that the fact that the couple had two young children did not mean that Sandra Jackson could get off with just probation. ""It is not the court that put your children in this position,"" Judge Jackson said. ""It is not the government that put your children in this position,"" she added, calling the prison sentence ""survivable.""Jackson Jr. will have to forfeit $750,000, but Judge Jackson ruled against a government request that the Chicago Democrat additionally pay $750,000 to the defunct campaign fund. The DOJ's request, Judge Jackson said, made no sense and served no purpose, calling the plan ""impractical and unworkable"" to create a ""new campaign from scratch"" without any clear goal.“Jesse Jackson Jr.’s journey from the halls of Congress to federal prison is a tragedy of his own making,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen said in a statement. “Jackson’s political potential was unlimited, but he instead chose to treat his campaign account as a personal slush fund, stealing from the people who believed in him so he could live extravagantly. He squandered his great capacity for public service through outright theft. The prison sentence imposed today should serve as a wake-up call to other public officials who believe there are no consequences for betraying the public trust.”Jackson Jr. made brief comments to reporters and cameras waiting outside the federal courthouse. ""I still believe in the power of forgiveness. I believe in the power of redemption. Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways, and I still believe in the resurrection,"" Jackson Jr. said before boarding an awaiting SUV.This story has been updated following the Jacksons' sentencing."

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who waged a 13-hour filibuster on Wednesday over Obama's secret use of drones to carry out targeted killings. Throughout the effort, Paul, along with a dozen other Republican senators, demanded to know whether Obama believed he had the right to order drone strikes on U.S. citizens on U.S soil.Carney said the answer is no.""It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the president have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?,'"" Carney read aloud. ""The answer to that question is no.""The administration sparked a furor over the matter earlier this week when, in another letter to Paul, Holder said the administration could technically use military force to kill an American on U.S. soil in an ""extraordinary circumstance"" but has ""no intention of doing so."" Republican outrage peaked with Paul's hours-long filibuster of John Brennan's Senate confirmation to the CIA. The White House stayed mum throughout the filibuster, as did most Senate Democrats.Carney said Holder's latest letter should ease the ""great deal of confusion"" over the president's authority over drones in the United States, which is ultimately regulated by the Constitution.""The president has not and would not use drone strikes against Americans citizens on American soil,"" Carney said. ""The legal authorities that exist to use lethal force are bound by, constrained by, the law and the Constitution. The issue here isn't the technology .... Whether it's a drone strike or a gun shot, the law and the Constitution apply in the same way.""Paul said later that Holder's letter had satisfied his concerns and that he was prepared to let Brennan's nomination vote proceed.""Hooray!"" Paul said on Fox News, where he learned of the letter and its contents. ""For 13 hours yesterday, we asked him that question. So there is a result and a victory. Under duress, and under public humiliation, the White House will respond and do the right thing.""Shortly after, Paul said during a CNN appearance that he is ""quite happy"" with Holder's response, and that he only wished it didn't take so long to get an answer.""I'm disappointed it took a month and a half and a root canal to get it,"" he said.This article was updated after publication with comments from Rand Paul."

""The best way to stop left-wing extremists from killing jobs is to vote against their hand-picked candidate Pete Gallego.""The group that put out the mailer, A Better America Now, reported to the Federal Election Commission it had spent about $65,000 for the mailer and TV advertising in the hard-fought race to represent Texas' 23rd district.But in a tax return recently filed with the IRS, the group claimed it did not spend any money at all on ""direct or indirect political campaign activities.""The tax return is signed under the penalty of perjury by the group's president, Bob Portrie, and the accounting firm LBA Group. Neither responded to requests for comment.We first reported on A Better America Now earlier this year, showing it had told the IRS in a 2011 application for nonprofit status that it did not plan to spend any money on elections. (That document was sent to ProPublica last year by the IRS, even though the application was still pending and thus not supposed to be released.)""This type of inaccurate reporting by electioneering nonprofit groups has a long history,"" says Public Citizen's Craig Holman, when asked about the group's most recent filing. ""It is rooted in the fact that the IRS almost never holds these groups accountable for such false declarations.""A Better America Now was a bit player in the elections. But it's also an example of the kind of increasingly common outside groups that inject anonymous money into political campaigns.Such social welfare nonprofits are not supposed to have political campaign activity as their primary purpose 2014 but the ambiguities around how the IRS measures such activity and how it screens the groups are at the center of the recent investigations of the IRS's treatment of Tea Party groups.ProPublica has documented how nonprofits that spent millions of dollars on ads in the 2010 elections failed to report or underreported that political spending to the IRS. The tax form that the groups are required to file with the IRS specifically asks for details on any campaign spending.One of the curious things about A Better America Now is that, though the group spent money in a congressional and a state legislative race in southwest Texas, it is based a few miles off the beach near Jacksonville, Florida. The president of A Better America Now, Portrie, is also the head of a consulting firm, the Fenwick Group. The two groups are listed at the same address. Fenwick's website says it works with ""organizations across the healthcare, financial services, insurance, retail and investment sectors.""Portrie and Fenwick were also linked to ads run by another Florida-based social welfare nonprofit, America is Not Stupid, in last year's U.S. Senate race in Montana. Ads by America is Not Stupid featured a talking baby complaining about alleged cuts to Medicare by President Obama, and referring to the baby's stinking diaper.In 2010, the New York Times reported on links between the Fenwick Group and yet another politically active nonprofit, the Coalition to Protect Seniors. Ads by that group featured the same talking baby ad.In last year's race in Texas, which attracted a lot of outside spending on both sides, the Democrat, Gallego, prevailed over Republican incumbent Quico Canseco."

He recalled that while the committee was investigating the connection between the assassination, the Mafia and plots against Cuban President Fidel Castro, two of the three main figures involved were also killed.

Maheu; Giancana, Al Capone's Chicago mob successor; and Santo Trafficante Jr., a mobster involved in Cuban operations, to unsuccessfully poison Castro with pills. Roselli disappeared soon after testifying before the Church committee, and his body was found inside an oil drum near North Miami Beach. Giancana was found dead at his Chicago home before he could testify to the Church committee. While alive, Giancana and Roselli also reportedly communicated with Kennedy. In a 1988 interview with People Magazine, Judith Campbell Exner claimed she had an affair with the president, and that during that relationship she served as a courier between the president and Roselli and Giancana. The president's brother, Robert Kennedy -- then-attorney general -- called for an investigation on Giancana. The deaths of Roselli and Giancana in 1975 and 1976 occurred amid the Church committee's ongoing investigations surrounding Kennedy's assassination. That coincidence, Hart said, was suspicious enough to warrant press attention, and he was surprised that the press didn't jump on the story.""I was always amazed in that particular instance of the CIA-Mafia connection and the Cuban connection 12 years -- coming up 12 years -- after Kennedy was killed that somebody didn't go after that story,"" he said. ""New York Times, Washington Post; anybody. And they didn't. They reported the deaths and that was it, and the strange quirky coincidence, you know, but nothing more.""For Hart, the uncanny series of events roughly 12 years after Kennedy's death was less of a coincidence than an indication that people -- including Giancana -- knew more than they were letting on. ""You don't have to be a genius to believe that they knew something about the coincidence of events -- Cuba, Mafia, CIA and Kennedy -- that somebody didn't want that out in the public 12 years later,"" Hart said.At a time when his Church committee was uncovering plots against the Cuban president and the CIA's use of the Mafia in those plots, Hart was privy to other peculiarities as well. According to Hart, the Warren Commission -- the presidential commission charged with investigating Kennedy's assassination that concluded  Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone -- remained unaware of the connections between Cuba, the CIA, the Mafia and Kennedy. Only then-CIA director Allen Dulles, who was on the commission, knew, according to Hart, but Dulles said nothing to the other members. Hart also heard from William Robert Plumlee -- a former CIA contract pilot who gave classified testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then chaired by John Kerry, in the '90s -- about how he believed Kennedy was really killed. Plumlee told Hart that he'd flown a plane to Texas days before the president's assassination and had later come to believe that several people on board were connected to the murder. A report by TV producer Robert Vernon claimed that Plumlee testified that the flight -- with Roselli on board -- was an attempt to thwart the Kennedy assassination. Hart tried to uncover the truth about the Kennedy assassination and the ""big unanswered questions."" He said he worked with fellow Church committee member and former Sen. Richard Schweiker (R-Penn.), but ultimately ran out of resources and leads. During an ill-fated presidential bid in the 1980s, Hart vowed he'd reopen the Kennedy investigation if elected. In retrospect, he said it ""was probably a stupid thing to do,"" citing death threats he received. Fifty years later, the danger of digging into cases such as Kennedy's assassination is not lost on Hart. In his chiding of the press and its failure to seize the opportunity to reveal the truth about Kennedy's death, he admits that revealing such a truth -- even as a journalist -- could have dire consequences. ""You risk your life because whoever killed these two guys is still out there,"" Hart said. "

Pryor and Begich are up for reelection in 2014.What effect the letter by the Republican-turned-independent mayor may have on Democratic donors is not yet clear. But it is another effort by Bloomberg to attach a political cost to voting against gun legislation -- something that the National Rifle Association has long done on the opposite side of the issue. It also marks an escalation between Bloomberg and national Democrats, who have worried that targeting vulnerable members of the party could backfire and lead to Republicans winning. That worry has not deterred Bloomberg, whose group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, spent $350,000 on an ad asking Pryor to reconsider his ""no"" vote on background checks.

On Wednesday afternoon, Loretta Fuddy, the director of Hawaii's Department of Health, died in a small, commercial plane crash off the coast of the Hawaiian island Molokai. Fuddy, who had been director of Hawaii's health department since March 2011, was the official who verified and approved the release of President Obama's birth certificate. Fuddy said then that the records ""further prove the fact that he was born in Hawaii.""Early reports indicate that the plane, a 2002 Cessna Grand Caravan, suffered catastrophic engine failure. The other eight passengers on board were rescued. According to Rev. Patrick Killilea who met with the survivors, Fuddy was wearing her life jacket in the water and was holding hands with deputy director Keith Yamamoto when she let go. Tweets, comments, and web posts from the birther movement quickly insinuated that the tragedy was no accident. Some implied that the White House was ""tying up loose ends,"" while others commented ""that anyone with any connection to Obama or his background has a tendency to have a 'shortened' life span.""And, of course, Donald Trump weighed in: Despite the media whirlwind around the birther conspiracies, Fuddy's life and numerous successes are being celebrated. Just yesterday, a report published by the United Health Foundation, American Public Health Association and the Partnership for Prevention, confirmed that Hawaii is the country's healthiest state. According to Hawaii House Speaker Joe Souki, Fuddy, 65, “was especially passionate about the most vulnerable in our communities, a champion for mothers, newborns, and early childhood care. Her warm, caring spirit for the people of Hawaii will truly be missed.”“Our hearts are broken,” Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a statement. “Loretta was deeply loved and respected. She was selfless, utterly dedicated, and committed to her colleagues in the Department of Health and to the people of Hawaii. Her knowledge was vast; her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience.”In August, Fuddy told Honolulu's Midweek magazine, ""I'm a child of the '60s, the Kennedy era of 'ask what you can do for your country' public service and Catholic values."""

This is a willful act of intimidation intended to discourage a point of view,"" said Becky Gerritson, president of a Tea Party group in Wetumpka, Alabama.She tearfully described how she and her husband had to seek legal counsel when confronted with questionnaires about their donors, communications with legislators and their voter education activities.""I'm not interested in scoring political points.

7704	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/12/obama-impeachment-poll_n_2669820.html	News	1	Democrat Scandals	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- It should come as no surprise to anyone that most Republicans aren't members of the Barack Obama fan club. According to one recent survey, a significant majority of Republicans in one state not only dislike the president but want to see him impeached. As a new HuffPost/YouGov national poll shows, however, questions about impeachment are a tricky business, and simply asking whether people support or oppose it may produce results that overstate their support. A January survey of Texas voters conducted by Public Policy Polling found that 67 percent of Texas Republicans, and 39 percent of Texas voters overall, said they favor impeaching Obama. The survey asked, ""Would you support or oppose impeaching President Obama?"" But that relatively straightforward question leaves open several possibilities for interpreting what respondents meant when they said they favor impeachment. For example, the question contained no definition of impeachment, so that some respondents may have misunderstood what impeachment entails, even if they grasped that it functions as some kind of reprimand. Some respondents could have been just expressing an unfavorable opinion of Obama (virtually all Republicans rate him unfavorably) or endorsing a more generic reprimand, rather than advocating a process that could remove the president from office after trial for ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""To help better parse levels of support for impeaching the president, The Huffington Post and its polling partner YouGov conducted a survey experiment to see how question wording might affect that support. Between Jan. 30 and Feb. 2, a total of 3,000 respondents nationally were randomly assigned to answer one of three questions about impeaching the president, including the original question asked by PPP and two alternative questions. The results showed both that a simple support/oppose question may overstate the number favoring impeachment and that support for impeachment remains surprisingly high among Republicans even when they are asked a more explanatory question. One set of respondents answered the same question that was asked on the PPP poll. Similar results were found nationally to those that PPP found in Texas, particularly among Republicans. In the new survey, 35 percent of Americans overall and 66 percent of Republicans said they would support impeaching Obama. The first alternative question asked respondents to choose between two options: Obama should be ""impeached and removed from office"" or he ""hasn't committed crimes that would justify impeachment."" The second alternative question allowed respondents to say they like Obama and think he should not be impeached, to say they think Obama should be impeached, or to say they dislike Obama but don't think he should be impeached. Support for impeachment varied by 9 percentage points among the three questions, from 35 percent among those asked the original question to 26 percent of those asked the first alternative question. Support for impeachment among Republicans varied even more widely, from 66 percent of those asked the original question to 51 percent of those asked the first alternative.The lowest support for impeachment, both among respondents overall and among Republicans specifically, came from the first alternative question, which made clear both that impeachment is a process to remove a president from office and that it is spurred by crimes committed by the president, rather than a more general reprimand or distaste for his policies. Even so, one-quarter of respondents and half of Republican respondents persisted in saying that Obama should be impeached and removed from office. And those asked the second alternative question, which did not mention crimes but did ask if Obama should be ""impeached and removed from office"" and also gave respondents the option of expressing dislike of the president without calling for his impeachment, found a slightly higher 29 percent of respondents overall and 57 percent of Republicans would support impeachment.The results of these polls, both on the state level and nationally, reflect the extreme dislike for Obama among Republicans. A recent YouGov/Economist poll found that nearly three-quarters of Republicans strongly disapprove of the job that the president is doing. Moreover, the desire to impeach a president of an opposing party isn't limited to Republicans: For example, a Time magazine poll conducted in November 2006 (and accessed through the Roper Center's iPoll database) found that 48 percent of Democrats were then in favor of impeaching George W. Bush, while an equal number were opposed. More than anything, surveys finding support for impeachment show just how divided Americans are today along party lines and how strongly rank-and-file members of each party dislike presidents from the opposing party.The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Jan. 30-Feb. 2 among 3,000 U.S. adults, of whom 1,000 were randomly assigned to answer each question (no respondent was shown more than one of the questions). The poll used a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

She will serve one year in prison and was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, after pleading guilty to a related charge of filing false tax returns. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is not related to the Jacksons, allowed the couple to stagger their sentences so their children would have at least one parent at all times. Jackson Jr. will go to prison first, followed by Sandra.Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty in February to using campaign funds to purchase an array of personal items, including Bruce Lee memorabilia, a $43,000 Rolex watch and a mink cashmere cape.Jackson, the son of the civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, made an emotional plea to the judge Wednesday, wiping his eyes and blowing his nose as he asked the judge for some leniency. He apologized to his constituents and his family.""If probation is not available to her, give me her time,"" Jackson said, referring to his wife. He said he needed to be ""as far away from everybody for a while that I could be.""Reid Weingarten, Jackson's defense attorney, asked for an 18-month sentence for his client and argued that there were ""not widows and orphans surrounding the courthouse"" wanting Jackson's head. Weingarten said that there was a time when members of Congress could treat their campaign funds as retirement accounts. ""This is not Madoff, this is not a ponzi scheme,"" Weingarten said.But a federal prosecutor handling the case called Jackson's fraud one of the most significant abuses of the campaign system that has ever been documented and prosecuted. The government asked for four years in prison.U.S. District Judge Jackson said the Jacksons used the campaign as a ""personal piggybank,"" but said she was confident that ""there will be another chapter"" for Jackson Jr. But the judge said that while Jackson did not pose a threat to society, a significant jail sentence was necessary to serve as a deterrent to other politicians who might consider raiding their campaign coffers for personal gain.""The ethical standard has got to be simply higher than unindicted,"" Judge Jackson said. She said she would have trouble explaining a probation sentence to the donors whose campaigns funds the couple misused.Judge Jackson said that the fact that the couple had two young children did not mean that Sandra Jackson could get off with just probation. ""It is not the court that put your children in this position,"" Judge Jackson said. ""It is not the government that put your children in this position,"" she added, calling the prison sentence ""survivable.""Jackson Jr. will have to forfeit $750,000, but Judge Jackson ruled against a government request that the Chicago Democrat additionally pay $750,000 to the defunct campaign fund. The DOJ's request, Judge Jackson said, made no sense and served no purpose, calling the plan ""impractical and unworkable"" to create a ""new campaign from scratch"" without any clear goal.“Jesse Jackson Jr.’s journey from the halls of Congress to federal prison is a tragedy of his own making,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen said in a statement. “Jackson’s political potential was unlimited, but he instead chose to treat his campaign account as a personal slush fund, stealing from the people who believed in him so he could live extravagantly. He squandered his great capacity for public service through outright theft. The prison sentence imposed today should serve as a wake-up call to other public officials who believe there are no consequences for betraying the public trust.”Jackson Jr. made brief comments to reporters and cameras waiting outside the federal courthouse. ""I still believe in the power of forgiveness. I believe in the power of redemption. Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways, and I still believe in the resurrection,"" Jackson Jr. said before boarding an awaiting SUV.This story has been updated following the Jacksons' sentencing."

7796	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-carlsen/how-legalizing-marijuana_b_777837.html	Opinion	1	Drugs	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"In the months leading up to today's vote on California's Proposition 19 to legalize recreational use of marijuana, opponents of legalization have issued a barrage of confused and contradictory arguments. Their aim is to somehow debunk the common-sense fact that legal sourcing erodes the black-market profits of organized crime.The most recent argument thrown out in the anti-Prop. 19 campaign, claims that the California marijuana market is insignificant to Mexican drug traffickers. That argument was blown out of the water on October 18 when the Mexican Army and police seized 134 tons of marijuana, wrapped and ready to be smuggled from Tijuana across the border. The huge cache was estimated to be worth at least $338 million dollars on the street. Mexican authorities guessed that it was owned by the nation's most powerful drug-trafficking organization, the Sinaloa Cartel. Even if much of that is distributed to other states, the sheer size of the potential shipment shows that the U.S. marijuana market for Mexican traffickers, calculated at $20 billion a year, is well worth fighting for. Since before Prop. 19 came along, reports showed that Mexico's drug cartels were concerned about how U.S. production and legalization of medical marijuana cut into their profits. Prohibition creates the underground market that generates their economic, political and military strength. With the drop in income from marijuana sales, cartels have less money for buying arms and politicians, or recruiting young people into the trade.The drug cartels also consider the marijuana black market worth killing for. Just days after the historic bust, thirteen young men were massacred at a drug rehabilitation center. An anonymous voice came over police radio saying the act was ""a taste of Juarez"" and that up to 135 people could be murdered in retaliation for the bust--one per ton. Although calculating Mexican cartel earnings from marijuana sales will always be a guessing game, it's indisputable that as long as it's illegal every penny of those earnings goes into the pockets of organized crime. From the peasant who converts his land from corn to pot to feed his family, to the truckdriver who takes on a bonus cargo, to the Mexican and U.S. border officials who open ""windows"" in international customs controls, to the youth gangs who sell in U.S. cities--all are sucked into a highly organized and brutal system of contraband. Legalization in part of the world's leading market would take a huge chunk out of this transnational business.The government of Mexican president Felipe Calderon, along with Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos, has redoubled efforts in U.S. media and international forums to oppose the California legalization measure. This is not surprising. These two nations are deeply entrenched in a military-model drug war that has channeled a combined total of nearly $9 billion dollars in U.S. government funds to their governments. As in any war, powerful political and economic interests are at stake in perpetuating the drug war.It's interesting to see what they say though. Neither President Santos nor Calderon argue that legalization will strengthen drug cartels. Instead, both complain that legalization will erode their drug war by heightening the contradiction between violent crackdowns on growers and traffickers in their countries and the lax attitude toward consumption of marijuana in the United States.At a recent meeting of the Tuxtla Dialogue in Cartagena, Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos said, ""It's confusing for our people to see that, while we lose lives and invest resources in the fight against drug trafficking, in consuming countries initiatives like California's referendum are being promoted."" It's about time that contradiction was exposed. But the way to resolve it is not to increase fumigation operations that destroy peasant livelihoods and the environment and seizures of marijuana shipments that lead to the deaths of innocent civilians, while further criminalizing consumption in the U.S. The way to resolve it is to halt ineffective measures to stop marijuana use, and focus scarce resources on attacking the financial and violent aspects of transnational organized crime, and providing employment and services for vulnerable sectors. Legalization of marijuana, in addition to reducing the economic base of the cartels, frees up resources to do just that.In a report from the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy former presidents of Mexico, Colombia, Brazil called for discussion on legalizing marijuana, noting, ""Prohibitionist policies based on the eradication of production and on the disruption of drug flows as well as on the criminalization of consumption have not yielded the expected results. We are farther than ever from the announced goal of eradicating drugs."" They add that corruption and violence have increased throughout the region as result of the strategy. The war on drugs launched by President Felipe Calderon has led to more than 30,000 drug-related deaths since late 2006 and the skyrocketing of human rights violations committed by security forces. Last week an international Forum against militarization and violence in Ciudad Juarez, the epicenter of the drug war, was disrupted when police shot a peace protester.As Calderon insists that there is ""no alternative"" to the militarized drug war, a recent survey shows that three-fourths of Mexicans polled believe the drug war is failing. Particularly in border towns, grassroots organizations have formed to protest the violence and high social costs. Meanwhile, the government has largely bypassed non-violent ways to reduce the power of cartels, such as legalization, anti-money laundering efforts and social programs to strengthen affected communities in favor of the military/police model supported by the U.S. government. Organized crime is a business. Reducing demand through providing legal sources hurts that business. Hardline rhetoric and wars of statistics cannot change that fundamental equation. "

Yet between 2001 and 2010, there were over 8 million pot arrests in the U.S. What's worse, the authorities making the arrests were targeting black Americans far more than whites.According to a new study from the American Civil Liberties Union, which tracked marijuana arrests by race and county in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, black and white Americans use marijuana at about the same rate. However, blacks were nearly four times as likely than whites to be arrested on charges of marijuana possession in 2010. In Washington D.C., Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois, blacks were 7.5 to 8.5 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possessing pot.Most of the people being arrested weren't drug kingpins. Fifty-two percent of all drug arrests in 2010 were for marijuana, and according to the ACLU's analysis, most of the arrestees were in possession of small amounts of the drug.Having a black president hasn't eased this racial disparity, either. During President Barack Obama’s first three years in office, the arrest rate for marijuana possession was about 5 percent higher than the average rate under President George W. Bush, The New York Times reported.Obama's first term in office was also marked by an economic recession, a soaring deficit (due to the cost of the Bush tax cuts and two wars) and numerous budget battles that threatened to cause state and federal government shutdowns. In the midst of this, the costs of the War on Marijuana continued to rise.In 2010, states spent an estimated $3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws, which was a 30 percent increase from a decade earlier. Such a large amount of funding provides a strong financial incentive for police to make arrests and boost their crime-fighting statistics, the ACLU reported. In fact, that same year, more people were arrested for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.""In the past 75 years we have seen mounting evidence of the benign nature of the marijuana plant, and its tremendous potential for medical development,"" Amanda Reiman, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance said in 2012. ""But the rampant misinformation about the effects of marijuana USE is dwarfed by the lifetime of suffering that a marijuana CONVICTION can bring.""Click here to download the full report. "

He says his company is joining forces with a Washington state chain of medical marijuana dispensaries run by John Davis, the Northwest Patient Resource Center, as well as dispensaries in Colorado and California.Shively's planned investment will total $100 million over three years, according to the Stranger. ""This historic step today is to be observed and evaluated closely by all of us, because it is a game changer,"" Fox said. ""I applaud this group that has the courage to move ahead. They have the vision, they are clear where they're going, and I'm sure they're going to get there.""Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who was Mexico's president from 2000-06, specified that he's not involved in the venture. He appeared at Shively's invitation. The two first met 13 years ago, when a company Shively used to run was opening a computer center in Sinaloa and Fox appeared at the inauguration, Shively said.Shively described grand visions for his pot brand – hundreds of millions of dollars in investments, tens of millions of customers, more than 1,000 jobs just at Diego Pellicer's Seattle headquarters.""Yes, we are Big Marijuana,"" he announced.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last March, the company wrote that it had raised $125,000 of an anticipated $625,000. Shively suggested those numbers were outdated, but did not provide different figures.Washington and Colorado expect to begin allowing marijuana sales to adults over 21 at state-licensed stores beginning next year, but marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and the Justice Department has repeatedly said it can continue to prosecute large-scale, privately owned marijuana operations even when they comply with state law.It isn't clear how Shively's plans for a national marijuana brand might be accomplished without running afoul of federal laws regarding the distribution of an illegal substance or conspiracy to distribute an illegal substance. He and Davis said no money from their business will travel interstate, nor will the marijuana itself, but neither of those factors would necessarily shield them from arrest.Shively insisted that his deals with the dispensaries are structured in such a way as to minimize any risk of federal prosecution, but neither he nor Davis would explain how. Shively said he had acquired certain ""rights"" related to the dispensaries, and made the plan sound like a marketing agreement by which the stores, beginning next month, would be re-branded as Diego Pellicer.""Neither Diego Pellicer nor our investors are exposed to any significant risk, in terms of criminal risk,"" Shively said. ""In terms of criminal risk, that is vastly mitigated. ... We're making strategic investments, but we're making them in such a way that they are not in violation of either federal or state law.""Asked how his plan didn't constitute a federal conspiracy to distribute marijuana, Shively described his operation as ""a conspiracy to obey the law.""His securities lawyer, Mike Moyer of the prominent Seattle firm of Dorsey and Whitney LLC, declined to elaborate.Fox urged the reporters present to maintain a focus on the important issues at hand: the failure of the drug war, the thousands of lives lost, and the better alternative offered by legalization. He noted he'd rather be sitting at a table next to Shively than the notorious cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.""This is a much better option, no doubt,"" he said.___Johnson can be reached at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle"

Thousands of federal employees are facing unpaid time off as agencies determine that they will have to furlough workers to absorb the cuts. But other workers -- including some in the private sector -- are losing their jobs altogether, underscoring just how much daily life for many people is tied to a functioning government. Some examples: On Monday, 250 workers at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state received pink slips, while another 2,500 others found out they're facing furloughs. Approximately 9,000 people work at the nation's most contaminated nuclear site, and the Associated Press reports that ""cleanup is likely to be slowed"" because of the budget cuts. Continental Maritime, a contractor that repairs U.S. Navy ships, expects to lay off 185 employees, effective April 12. Other contractors have issued conditional layoff notices -- meaning that jobs are safe if Congress restores some funding to the Defense Department -- to thousands of employees.Four-hundred eighteen contract workers tied to the Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania are losing their jobs due to sequestration. Two-hundred sixteen people will be dismissed on April 15 and 107 on April 30, the Morning Call of Allentown, Pa., reports. The paper noted that the Tobyhanna Army Depot is losing 35 percent -- $309 million -- of its government funding through the end of the fiscal year, and that more than 5,100 of the people who work there are being forced to take 22 furlough days.At least eight municipal employees in Monterey County, Calif., are losing their jobs as a result of a decrease in the number of military contracts. In early March, 23 people who work with the parks and recreation and maintenance departments in Tooele County, Utah, were laid off in order to grapple with the federal budget cuts. ""I have four kids. This is my livelihood,” said Scott Chance, a 12-year employee. ""It pays my health insurance. It gives me my house.""Engineering Services Network is an engineering and technology company and one of the top Latino-owned companies in Virginia. President and CEO Raymond Lopez Jr. told NBC Latino that he has ""lost about 20 employees through sequestration.""The Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas, announced in February that it was cutting 414 jobs -- about 10 percent of its workforce. ""I don't know how we're going to make it,"" Raymond Wyrick, whose last day was scheduled to be March 9, told CNN Money.While people around the country deal with these furloughs, job losses and a reduction in government services like unemployment benefits and funding for domestic violence prevention, much of the debate in Washington continues to center around the fact that the White House is no longer offering tours and the Easter Egg Roll could be called off. Congress is now working on a continuing resolution to keep the government running when the current funding runs out on March 27. It's expected to keep in place the $85 billion in sequestration cuts -- meaning workers may still face furloughs -- although federal agencies will likely get more flexibility in how to absorb those cuts. *** HuffPost Readers: Have the federal budget cuts kicking in this month had an impact on you specifically or on your community?

President Obama proposed raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour during his State of the Union address last week. While many on the right say that raising the minimum wage could make it more difficult for employers to hire people and therefore cause higher unemployment, Krugman argued in his post that this simply is not the case. ""There just isn’t any evidence that raising the minimum wage near current levels would reduce employment,"" Krugman wrote, citing a report by John Schmitt from the Center for Economic Policy and Research. This opinion is a hotly contested one. A 2011 study from the London School of Economics found that higher minimum wages do correlate with an increase in unemployment.That said, there are a number of ways the labor market could respond to an increase in the minimum wage that do not involve cutting jobs. The Washington Post's Wonkblog has a great summary of these effects, which you can check out here. The federal minimum wage hasn't increased since 2009. According to a 2012 study from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the minimum wage would actually be $21.72 an hour if it kept pace with increases in worker productivity.The same CEPR study found that if the minimum wage kept up with inflation since it peaked in real value in 1968, it would now be $10.52 per hour.Even if the U.S. raised the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, the nation would still have a lower minimum wage than many countries around the world.

This was met by a positive response by congressional Republicans who have long wanted changes to entitlement programs.Ellison, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, also told The Huffington Post on Tuesday after Obama's SOTU speech that he was concerned about possible changes to entitlements. ""I think there are things that can be done to reform social insurance, such as to engage in competitive bidding for prescription drug prices. But he didn't mention that. He just sort of raised the issue, which raised a lot of questions about what did he have in mind,"" said Ellison, who added that he liked the overall speech's focus on income inequality and concern for low-wage workers.

Republicans have said the forthcoming measure, which will combine stricter eligibility standards with new work requirements, will reduce Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program spending by $40 billion over 10 years.""House Republican leaders haven’t formally released the language of their plan, but the information they have made available makes clear that the proposal will be very harsh, denying SNAP to at least four million to six million low-income people, including some of the nation’s poorest adults, as well as many low-income children, seniors, and families that work for low wages,"" the CBPP's Dottie Rosenbaum, Stacy Dean, and Robert Greenstein said in a report published Monday. A key part of the new legislation would stop states from waiving SNAP's work requirements for able-bodied childless adults, something more than 45 states currently do because of high unemployment. Working-age Americans without kids would have to either work 20 hours a week or engage in ""work activities"" that could include training or volunteering. ""The House will consider common-sense measures, such as work requirements and job training requirements for able-bodied adults without children receiving assistance, that enjoy broad public support,"" Doug Heye, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), said in an email on Monday.The Center on Budget claims it's inaccurate to say the forthcoming proposal includes work requirements. ""In reality, they would terminate basic food assistance to people who would take any job or job training opportunity offered but cannot find one; the proposal doesn’t require states to provide jobs or job training and includes no added funds for these activities,"" the report's authors said. The percentage of SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without children has risen from 6.6 percent in 2007 to 9.7 percent in 2010, or nearly 4 million people. Altogether 47 million Americans, most of them either children, elderly or disabled, receive SNAP benefits each month. A recent Fox News poll found 94 percent of respondents were okay with food stamps going to a ""laid-off worker who wants a job and doesn’t have the money to feed his family"" but 91 percent opposed food stamps for an ""unemployed musician who doesn’t want to take a regular job which will pay him enough to live on."" A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in June found 40 percent of Americans favored cutting food stamps. The House voted down a bill in June that would have reduced SNAP spending by $20 billion, denying benefits to nearly 2 million people. House Republican leaders are coming back with deeper cuts in a bid to get the bill through the lower chamber with a majority of Republican votes. Any SNAP cuts approved by the House would have to be merged with Senate legislation that has much more modest reductions. Automatic benefits cuts for all SNAP recipients are scheduled to take effect in November, regardless of whether Congress passes new cuts, thanks to the expiration of a benefit increase from the 2009 stimulus bill."

This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012.“The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year” said Economic Policy Institute’s Elise Gould. “We’re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.”While the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 — nearly half that of Maryland’s.Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. “We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don’t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.”States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did.Employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state’s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state’s household income. “When we’re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it’s about jobs.” Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed.“There’s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,” Danziger said. “Even when manufacturers haven’t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.”To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2012, as well as 2012 ACS data on health insurance coverage, employment and poverty.Here are America's richest states, according to 24/7 Wall St.

It's absurd,"" Obama said in a press conference. The president also responded directly to Republicans who continue to argue that increasing the nation's borrowing limit only contributes to Washington's spending problem. He repeatedly emphasized that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize any new spending but simply allows the government to continue to pay for obligations to which Congress has already agreed.House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Saturday said a failure to raise the debt ceiling would result in ""financial disaster,"" but reiterated demands that the president agree to spending cuts before a vote. On Monday, Obama maintained that increasing the debt limit would not represent a concession by Republicans to Democrats, and said he simply would not give in to any demands in exchange for an extension.""They will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the economy,"" Obama said. ""The full faith and credit of the United States economy is not a bargaining chip. And they better choose quickly because time is running short. The last time Republicans in Congress even flirted with this idea, our AAA credit rating was down for the first time in our history.""The president highlighted some of the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling: a delay in Social Security checks and veterans' benefits and the inability to pay U.S. troops or honor contracts for small business owners, air traffic controllers and food inspectors. If the country failed to meet these obligations, Obama argued, investors around the world would question the credibility of the United States. ""We are not a deadbeat nation,"" Obama said. ""So there's a very simple solution to this: Congress authorizes us to pay our bills."" Republican leaders responded immediately to the president's press conference, signaling they will not relent on demands for spending cuts as part of debt ceiling talks.""The President and his allies need to get serious about spending, and the debt-limit debate is the perfect time for it,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in a statement. ""I do know that the most important issue confronting the future of our country is our deficit and debt. So we are hoping for a new seriousness on the part of the President with regard to the single biggest issue confronting the country and we look forward to working with him to do something about this huge, huge problem.""Boehner issued a similar statement, calling on Obama to reduce government spending.""The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation’s obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same,"" Boehner said.Last week, Senate Democratic leaders urged Obama to bypass Congress on raising the debt ceiling in the event of political gridlock. But the White House has been reluctant to consider a unilateral action, maintaining that the 14th Amendment -- one such proposed option -- does not give the president the authority to ignore the debt ceiling."

Fred Upton (R-Mich.) to allow individuals to keep their health care plans fits in with that strategy. ""Remember the strategy for stopping Obamacare we laid out to you back in July. It had two components: Aggressive, coordinated oversight, and targeted legislative strikes aimed at shattering the legislative coalition the president has used to force his law on the nation,” Boehner said, closely following his earlier comments. ""That plan is being executed as we speak.""The statements signal how much of a reversal of fortune Republicans have enjoyed since the Obamacare exchange glitches and cancellations of individual health insurance plans. The shutdown failed to make any changes to Obamacare, while the cancellations have caused even Senate Democrats -- including liberals such as Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) -- to sign onto a bill to allow individuals to keep their health insurance plans.The White House opposes the Upton bill. However, Roll Call reported Monday that the White House is exploring an ""administrative fix"" to cancellations.

Do you know what people think of you guys?""""I told her that Washington needs to work more like Delaware,"" said Carper, a former governor of the state. ""In Delaware, Democrats and Republicans work together.""They have not worked together in Washington. And so the across-the-board cuts of the so-called ""sequester"" - which both Republicans and Democrats have said they oppose - took effect Friday night after President Barack Obama and Republican leaders failed to agree on a way to replace them with targeted spending reductions.Up until the final few days before Friday, when the reductions began because of a law enacted in 2011, constituents urged, some begged, lawmakers to avert them.The cuts threaten the U.S. economic recovery, could disrupt federal services from airports to national parks, and may force furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and employees of federal contractors, the administration says.""They want to kill us all,"" Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said of his constituents.Laura Zayner, a senior officer with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, was among 400 federal workers facing possible furloughs who came to Washington last week to lobby Congress.""We consider the furlough a slap in the face. We take it personally,"" Zayner said. ""We are not picking sides, Democrats or Republicans. But we want them to do their jobs and stop the cuts.""John Kelshaw, who works with the Internal Revenue Service, came to town from New Jersey. He and a few other federal workers met with Republican Representative John Runyan.""We told him that a lot of our people live paycheck to paycheck. We said, 'Give us a break,'"" Kelshaw said. He said Runyan, of New Jersey, listened but made no commitments. WHO'S TO BLAME?Polls so far show most Americans blame Republicans rather than Obama and his Democrats for the standoff. But that could change.Republicans insist that any deficit-reduction replacement deal include only spending cuts. Democrats want a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.According to a February 28 Gallup survey, 56 percent of those polled thought the cuts will damage the economy. The feeling crossed party lines, Gallup reported, with 64 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of Democrats agreeing they would inflict economic pain.Democratic Senator Mark Pryor said his constituents in Arkansas routinely ask him, ""'Why can't you guys work it out?'""Pryor said he tells them, ""Nobody has clean hands on this.""Both sides seem to size up any issue on a basis of who gets the political advantage, he said. ""If someone suddenly came up with a cure to cancer, the question in Washington would be, 'Is this good or bad for Obama?'""The president on Friday said of the cuts, ""This is not a win for anybody. This is a loss for the American people.""Hatch, of Utah, said he recently told his state legislature that he expected the federal government to impose the sweeping cuts. ""A number of them stood up and said maybe that's the only way we are going get any real reduction in spending,"" he said.On the other side, Representative Luis Gutierrez, a Chicago Democrat who won an 11th term last year with more than 80 percent of the vote, said his constituents ""tell me 'Keep on fighting, Luis, keep on fighting.'""Representative Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican whose district includes the shipbuilding yards in Newport News that are likely to be hit hard by cuts in military spending, was dismayed by the untargeted reductions.Rigell got a letter from a constituent last month that read in part, ""My husband, a project manager for the defense industry, went to work this morning to lay off half of his workforce because of sequestration.""In an interview, Rigell said, ""When I think they (shipyard workers) could lose their jobs because of the dysfunction in Washington ... this is not acceptable to me.""""I've been at that shipyard.

North Carolina has more than 400,000 jobless workers, making its 9.2 percent unemployment rate higher than the national average of 7.9 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.""Hundreds of thousands of jobless workers thrown out of work through no fault of their own will face deepening poverty as a result of this decision,"" the North Carolina Justice Center, a social justice advocacy group, said in a statement after the bill signing on Tuesday.""North Carolina's legislature and governor chose to permanently cut benefits, reduce employers' contributions over time, and reject $700 million in federal extended benefits,"" the center said.About 170,000 long-term unemployed workers in North Carolina will lose out on extra federal funds under the new law, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.Copyright 2013 Thomson Reuters.

The measure would reduce the maximum weekly benefit from $530 to $350 per person. If it passes, North Carolina workers will no longer receive long-term compensation starting in July, since states cannot remain eligible for federal unemployment insurance if local lawmakers cut weekly benefit amounts. An estimated 80,000 people would miss out on federal extended benefits, according to the North Carolina Justice Center, a worker advocacy nonprofit. At $25 million per week, the total loss over time amounts to more than $600 million.Policy experts said the move would be unprecedented. ""It is pretty amazing,"" the center's Alexandra Sirota said in an interview. ""As far as we know, no other state has rejected federal dollars to push that level of benefit cuts.""Sirota stressed that the benefits not only help the workers who receive them, but they also contribute to the state's economy, since recipients spend the money on things like food, rent and groceries.The Republicans pushing the unemployment cuts, however, say unemployment taxes hurt the state's economy more than anything else. North Carolina businesses are paying higher federal taxes because the state has been slow to repay $2.5 billion it borrowed from Washington to pay benefits in recent years. The legislation will increase state business taxes and reduce state spending on benefits in order to repay the loan more quickly. The sooner the federal government gets its money back, the sooner federal taxes will come down. “It will cause North Carolina to repay the debt to the federal government back in about six years less time,"" State Rep. Harry Warren (R-Rowan County) told the Salisbury Post. The bill's supporters, including Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, don't seem to mind that the state would lose federal unemployment insurance as a result of the legislation. The extended federal benefits are set to expire at the end of the year anyway, but the bill would kill them six months early.""I will not support the extension of unemployment beyond July of this year,"" McCrory said last week, according to WRAL.com. ""I think we need to now draw the line."" The bill's opponents, however, see it differently. ""Reducing benefits in a way that causes us to disqualify for those federal funds is extraordinarily shortsighted and philosophically driven,"" State Sen. Floyd McKissick (D-Durham) told HuffPost. ""I think it's really horrendous.""The bill passed the state House of Representatives on Tuesday and a state Senate committee on Wednesday. Republicans rebuffed Democratic efforts to delay the measure's implementation and prevent the loss of federal benefits. McKissick said he expected the bill to land on McCrory's desk soon. States typically pay 26 weeks of unemployment insurance to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, and during recessions Congress routinely gives workers additional weeks of benefits. The North Carolina proposal, in addition to cutting the amount of state benefits, would also reduce their maximum duration to 20 weeks. The benefits could last for as few as 12 weeks when the state's unemployment rate declines. Florida and Georgia have recently adopted similar policies. North Carolina's jobless rate stands tall at 9.2 percent, well above the national average of 7.9 percent. George Wentworth, a staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project, said the bill would launch North Carolina into the upper tier of cheapskate states.""With one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, North Carolina will offer its jobless workers 20 weeks of unemployment insurance or less while unemployed workers in other states will qualify for anywhere from 40 to 73 weeks of benefits,"" Wentworth said.   Wentworth also said the loss of federal benefits would undermine the state's economy.""This will be an economic catastrophe that could easily be averted by simply delaying the state benefit cuts until January,"" he said.

Automatic benefits cuts for all SNAP recipients are scheduled to take effect in November, regardless of whether Congress passes new cuts, thanks to the expiration of a benefit increase from the 2009 stimulus bill."
8211	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/23/raise-minimum-wage_n_4493673.html	News	1	Economy	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Minimum wage workers in a handful of states will be ringing in the new year with an automatic pay raise. As Congress considers legislation that would boost the federal minimum wage, at least 13 states will be raising the wage floor on their own next week. They're led once again by Washington state, which will continue to have the highest state minimum wage in the nation, at $9.32 per hour.A few cities and counties around the country will be raising their minimum wages as well, including San Francisco, which will set its at $10.74. San Francisco's base will no longer be the highest municipal minimum wage in the country, however, after voters in SeaTac, Wash., approved a ballot measure setting a $15 wage floor for an estimated 6,000 airport workers. The SeaTac minimum wage is set to go into effect Jan. 1, although it's currently being challenged in court.Most of next week's increases will come courtesy of an inflation index. Ten states have tied their minimum wages to the index, guaranteeing that they rise with the cost of living each year. Other states, such as New Jersey and Connecticut, passed legislation in 2013 that will nominally raise their minimum wages. (California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the state's minimum wage to $10 by 2016, but the first increase, to $9, won't come until July.) The federal minimum wage prevails in the 31 states that don't currently mandate a higher one. The federal rate hasn't been raised since 2009, after the last of a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush took effect. The federal minimum wage is not tied to an index, but Democrats in Congress, as well as President Barack Obama, have said that it should be. The minimum wage bill put forth by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 and peg it to inflation. Obama, who previously suggested raising the wage floor to $9 and indexing it, has since gotten on board with the $10.10 proposal from Harkin and Miller.The annual minimum wage raises in states and cities are routinely praised by low-wage worker advocates and panned by business-friendly groups. The Employment Policies Institute, a vocal critic of higher minimum wages, argued in a press release Monday that raises like the ones that will go into effect next week have ""disastrous results for the most vulnerable jobseekers."" Republicans on Capitol Hill have shown party-line opposition to the Harkin-Miller proposal, with leadership declaring a minimum wage increase a job-killer.Most voters, however, don't seem persuaded by the critics' economic arguments, as they continue to approve higher minimum wages on the local level. The idea of raising the minimum wage tends to poll extremely well, including among Republicans who are not members of Congress. Most polls show that around two-thirds of respondents support raising the federal minimum wage. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, half of Republicans who responded said it should be raised.Here are the state and local increases that will go into effect next week, as compiled by the Employment Policies Institute: Arizona: $7.80 to $7.90  Colorado: $7.78 to $8.00  Connecticut: $8.25 to $8.70  Florida: $7.79 to $7.93  Missouri: $7.35 to $7.50  Montana: $7.80 to $7.90  New Jersey: $7.25 to $8.25  New York: $7.25 to $8.00 Ohio: $7.85 to $7.95  Oregon: $8.95 to $9.10  Rhode Island: $7.75 to $8.00  Vermont: $8.60 to $8.73  Washington State: $9.19 to $9.32  Albuquerque, N.M.: $8.50 to $8.60  Bernalillo County, N.M.: $8.00 to $8.50 San Francisco, Calif.: $10.55 to $10.74  San Jose, Calif.: $10.00 to $10.15 SeaTac, Wash.: $9.19 to $15.00"

The average household's monthly benefit from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will drop by $20 or $25, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington think tank. ""The general public doesn't realize it,"" Celia Cole, CEO of the Texas Food Bank Network, told The Huffington Post on Monday. ""We certainly know the low income people on SNAP don't know the cut is coming."" Cole's organization is publicizing the cut with a countdown clock. On Monday the clock indicated there are 94 days ""until every SNAP (food stamps) household in America gets a little hungrier.""But Congress has little appetite for intervention, as the consensus among lawmakers is not whether food stamps should be reduced, but by how much. The November reduction is happening separately from the debate over cutting food stamps as part of a broader farm bill. The cut is set to kick in because a 13 percent benefit boost from the 2009 stimulus bill is expiring. Initially, the plan was to let inflation catch up with the increase so that SNAP recipients would never see a month-to-month dollar decline.But in 2010, Senate Democrats and the Obama administration needed money to offset the cost of a series of spending bills. They said at the time they would replace the money later, but they never did. Congressional attitudes toward food stamp recipients have only gotten less generous since then. The $668 maximum monthly benefit for a family of four will fall to $643, according to the Center on Budget's Stacy Dean and Dottie Rosenbaum. (The average household's monthly benefit is $287.)""This cut will be the equivalent of taking away 14 meals per month for a family of four, or 11 meals for a family of three,"" Dean and Rosenbaum wrote in a May report. The pair said that states should make sure recipients know when the cut is around the corner. First and foremost, Cole said her mission is to get the word out in Texas. Her organization represents 21 food banks serving all parts of the state. Cole also wants members of Congress to feel some pressure. ""I want them to not be able to do it without feeling the shame that they're doing something wrong,"" she said.  "

But because Congress and the White House failed to agree on an alternative deficit-reduction plan, they did. Shortly after sequestration hit, Capitol police announced that entrance closures and modifications around Capitol Hill would go into effect on March 11. A HuffPost reader who works as a House staffer sent along a document outlining entrance closures and changes due to sequestration. View it here.And while some congressional staffers may be facing long lines -- or having to tell constituents that they can't tour the White House -- the pain across the country is more severe: the loss of tuition assistance for members of the military, job losses, lack of funding for food assistance programs, reductions in funding for natural disaster recovery and more.

But those cuts, along with a slew of other fiscal measures enacted by Congress, amounted to a year of fiscal austerity that took money out of the economy, slowed GDP growth and cut the number of jobs that could have been created.The tightening began on the first of the year, when the ""fiscal cliff"" deal passed both houses of Congress and was signed by President Barack Obama. While the deal did stop some sharp tax increases that would have put a real drag on economic growth, it allowed the payroll tax holiday to expire, meaning all workers got less money in their paychecks. Predictions made around the time the deal was crafted estimated it would shave between 0.4 and 0.6 percent off of GDP growth in 2013.That deal delayed sequestration cuts for two months, and they began on March 1. The plan mandated $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts until Oct. 1. The cuts damaged the public defender system, stalled cancer research and cut scientific research. The cuts also hit programs for the most vulnerable, including Head Start and Meals on Wheels.The economic effects of these policies are tangible. According to the most recent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, made in early 2013, sequestration was expected to cost around 750,000 jobs that would have been created or retained if not for the cuts. CBO also estimated that sequestration along with fiscal tightening would cost about 1 ¼ percentage points in growth from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013. The CBO also estimated that without sequestration, the economy would have been expected to grow faster in 2013 by about 0.6 of a percentage point.Independent research firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimated in October that budget tightening had reduced annual GDP growth by 0.7 of a percentage point since 2010 and raised the unemployment rate by 0.8 percent.Repealing the sequester would create economic dividends. Canceling sequestration would increase third quarter GDP in 2014 by 0.7 percent and increase payrolls by 0.9 million, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate from July. The budget deal signed by President Barack Obama this week replaces about a third of these draconian cuts that were scheduled -- eliminating $63 billion out of an estimated $180 billion in cuts in 2014 and 2015.On Oct. 1, Congress did not pass an appropriations bill, and the government shut down for 17 days. During that time, more than 800,000 federal workers were furloughed without pay, and nonessential federal offices were closed.Congress passed an appropriations bill funding the government at current levels on Oct. 17. Federal workers received back pay, and the government reopened. However, the shutdown had economic costs. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, it shaved off an estimated 0.25 percent of annualized GDP growth in the fourth quarter, or about $10 billion.On Nov. 1, food stamp benefits were cut by $5 billion when legislation from 2010 that reallocated funding went into effect. The cut affected 47 million Americans, and reduced the maximum benefit from 11 to 36 dollars, depending on family size. With the cut came a jump in the need at soup kitchens and food banks.The costs to the economy could be more than $5 billion -- Moody's Analytics has estimated that every additional dollar spent on food stamps generates about $1.74 in economic activity. JPMorgan Chase Chief Economist Michael Feroli estimated that the cuts could shave 0.1 of a percentage point off the annual growth rate of the nation's GDP in 2013.Despite the cuts, the economy grew at a relatively fast pace of 4.1 percent in the third quarter of 2013, up from 1.1 and 2.5 percent in the quarters before. However, the growth rate may not reflect true economic activity. As Slate's Matt Yglesias points out, real gross domestic income -- an alternative measure for GDP measuring all incomes of an economy -- grew by a much lower 1.8 percent. Plus, with all of the cuts enacted by Congress, many Americans hardly feel like the economy is getting better. Moreover, the economy remained about 3.1 percent below its potential output in 2013, according to OECD, and about 5 million jobs short of full employment, according to CBO.The cuts will continue into 2014. On Saturday, 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits, as Congress failed to extend the benefits before adjourning for the year. Federal benefits tend to kick in after state ones expire, which in most places is 26 weeks. Congress could reinstate the benefits retroactively once it returns at the beginning of next year, but recipients will at least face a lapse. The White House Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that not extending the benefits would cost 240,000 jobs in 2014. Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and JP Morgan have pegged the cost to GDP growth at 0.2 to 0.4 percent."

Panelists testifying on the problem and its potential solutions spoke only to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the committee's vice-chair, for the beginning of the roughly 90-minute session.The all-but-complete absence of congressional interest was first documented by National Journal reporter Niraj Chokshi, who tweeted a photo of the hearing. Shortly after the photo was posted, several other lawmakers did trickle in to participate. Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.) arrived eight minutes into the hearing. Once the hearing had been under way for 35 minutes, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) was also in attendance, according to Chokshi. Eventually Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) also joined, bringing the crowd to four.More than 4.6 million Americans have been jobless for at least 27 weeks, according to the latest job figures, a rate of 3.0 percent. That's higher than at any point since World War II, including the 2.6-percent peak during the recession of the early 1980s. The official unemployment rate currently stands at 7.6 percent, down from 10.0 percent at the recession's darkest moments, although much of the reduction has been due to people leaving the workforce -- simply giving up hope of finding a job.Jobs advocates have continually chastised Congress for focusing on the federal budget deficit instead of the shortage of employment in the U.S., which still features more than four job seekers for every open position in the country.Senators who did not attend the hearing included Sens. Robert Casey (D-Pa.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Reps. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), John Campbell (R-Calif.), Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.), Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) also did not attend.The Joint Economic Committee is one of only a handful of congressional panels that features members of both the House and Senate. Its hearings are thinly attended at times, but the contrast between Thursday's hearing and a March 14 hearing on ""Solving The Federal Debt Crisis"" is revealing. That hearing on debt opened with five members of Congress in attendance, including three Democrats and two Republicans. Over the course of the nearly two-hour session, several other members of the committee filed in.Kevin Hassett, the author of Dow 36,000, which predicted a fantastic rise in equities before two subsequent crashes, said he wasn't surprised. ""There are often moments like that at hearings. Very few are ever heavily attended. People came in late, after the picture, I suppose,"" he told HuffPost.At the hearing, Klobuchar presented a study indicating that long-term unemployment is disproportionately affecting young workers, black and Hispanic workers, and workers with lower levels of education. The study is in keeping with other work that shows the economic recovery has been far better for some groups than others. The wealthiest 1 percent of households have received 106 percent of the gains since the recession bottomed out.Dr. Harry J. Holzer, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, said by the time he testified at about 11 a.m., two senators -- Klobuchar and Murphy -- were in the room. ""There were people in the audience,"" he said, noting that Klobuchar sounded motivated on the subject. ""That can make it worth it,"" he added. ""If one senator sponsors a bill with some of your information, that's a pretty big reward for your effort.""Holzer testified about the various hardships that the long-term unemployed faced and the differences between older unemployed citizens and younger unemployed citizens. He proposed wage insurance for people who transition from manufacturing jobs to jobs with lesser pay, having the federal government pitch in to make up the difference. Holzer said he has testified before Congress 15 times over the years, and there is always a risk of a low turnout.Keith Hall, a senior research scholar at the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center, is a former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner who testified at the hearing. ""It's disappointing, I have to say,"" he told HuffPost about the attendance. ""It is a little bit disappointing, because you'd really like to see a more engaged discussion, and it would be nice to see that both sides were there and both sides were talking."" Hall said that attendance was low probably because Congress isn't doing anything about long-term unemployment. With no bills to choose from, there's little value in becoming educated on the issue. The lack of interest may also be a consequence of the slow start to the year for the House of Representatives, which held just one markup session legislation on any topic in the first eight weeks of 2013.""They're talking about the problem and they're looking for solutions, but there's really no hard proposal on the table,"" said Hall, ""so while this is informative and helpful, they're not dealing with some proposal where they're close to working on something.""Congress is a long way off, Hall said. ""I think it's good this is hitting their radar screen, but there's a lot of work to go to get the economy back in shape and get the long-term unemployed back in shape, and they need more than just a hearing a two,"" he said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article indicated that Sen. Klobuchar had been alone for the first half hour of the session. She was joined by Sen. Murphy after 8 minutes alone."

""You have to spend a majority of your money on social welfare and a minority of your resources on political activity.""Rove, a career political strategist, raised hundreds of millions of dollars during the 2012 election and spent them on political advertisements designed to influence the presidential and congressional races. Rove's Crossroads GPS is one of hundreds of essentially political organizations that receive tax-exempt status designed for ""social welfare"" groups.While many have called for reforms to the law allowing such groups to receive tax breaks, Rove insisted that the exemption is justified, and that organizations that support the Democratic Party have been working the statute longer.""What happened is the Democrats had this for decades, for literally decades, and no criticism at all. Then Republicans began in 2010 to say, wait a minute, if it's good enough for them, we'll duplicate that structure as well. Then suddenly we get what we get, which is a huge bunch of activity aimed at conservative groups.""The Bush administration probed the NAACP's tax-exempt status between 2004 and 2006, and ultimately allowed the group to maintain its classification.Rove's organizations do not provide the counseling, legal assistance and other support functions that the NAACP provides on civil rights.Federal agencies frequently target smaller players who may be abusing the system to avoid lengthy legal battles with more prominent companies or organizations. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) on Sunday criticized the IRS for targeting small Tea Party groups while allowing bigger fish, like Rove's Crossroads GPS, to pass through with little scrutiny.  ""It's outrageous that the IRS went after these small tea party groups when Karl Rove is out there saying that he wants to use these groups to change the outcome of the election,"" Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said on ABC's ""This Week."""

The measure would reduce the maximum weekly benefit from $530 to $350 per person. If it passes, North Carolina workers will no longer receive long-term compensation starting in July, since states cannot remain eligible for federal unemployment insurance if local lawmakers cut weekly benefit amounts. An estimated 80,000 people would miss out on federal extended benefits, according to the North Carolina Justice Center, a worker advocacy nonprofit. At $25 million per week, the total loss over time amounts to more than $600 million.Policy experts said the move would be unprecedented. ""It is pretty amazing,"" the center's Alexandra Sirota said in an interview. ""As far as we know, no other state has rejected federal dollars to push that level of benefit cuts.""Sirota stressed that the benefits not only help the workers who receive them, but they also contribute to the state's economy, since recipients spend the money on things like food, rent and groceries.The Republicans pushing the unemployment cuts, however, say unemployment taxes hurt the state's economy more than anything else. North Carolina businesses are paying higher federal taxes because the state has been slow to repay $2.5 billion it borrowed from Washington to pay benefits in recent years. The legislation will increase state business taxes and reduce state spending on benefits in order to repay the loan more quickly. The sooner the federal government gets its money back, the sooner federal taxes will come down. “It will cause North Carolina to repay the debt to the federal government back in about six years less time,"" State Rep. Harry Warren (R-Rowan County) told the Salisbury Post. The bill's supporters, including Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, don't seem to mind that the state would lose federal unemployment insurance as a result of the legislation. The extended federal benefits are set to expire at the end of the year anyway, but the bill would kill them six months early.""I will not support the extension of unemployment beyond July of this year,"" McCrory said last week, according to WRAL.com. ""I think we need to now draw the line."" The bill's opponents, however, see it differently. ""Reducing benefits in a way that causes us to disqualify for those federal funds is extraordinarily shortsighted and philosophically driven,"" State Sen. Floyd McKissick (D-Durham) told HuffPost. ""I think it's really horrendous.""The bill passed the state House of Representatives on Tuesday and a state Senate committee on Wednesday. Republicans rebuffed Democratic efforts to delay the measure's implementation and prevent the loss of federal benefits. McKissick said he expected the bill to land on McCrory's desk soon. States typically pay 26 weeks of unemployment insurance to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, and during recessions Congress routinely gives workers additional weeks of benefits. The North Carolina proposal, in addition to cutting the amount of state benefits, would also reduce their maximum duration to 20 weeks. The benefits could last for as few as 12 weeks when the state's unemployment rate declines. Florida and Georgia have recently adopted similar policies. North Carolina's jobless rate stands tall at 9.2 percent, well above the national average of 7.9 percent. George Wentworth, a staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project, said the bill would launch North Carolina into the upper tier of cheapskate states.""With one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, North Carolina will offer its jobless workers 20 weeks of unemployment insurance or less while unemployed workers in other states will qualify for anywhere from 40 to 73 weeks of benefits,"" Wentworth said.   Wentworth also said the loss of federal benefits would undermine the state's economy.""This will be an economic catastrophe that could easily be averted by simply delaying the state benefit cuts until January,"" he said.

The limit is expected to be reached Oct. 17, but the House bill would push the debt ceiling back to around Thanksgiving.""What we want to do is offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, an agreement to go to conference on the budget, for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government, and start to deal with America's pressing problems,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""I would hope that the president will look at this as an opportunity and a good-faith effort on our part to move halfway, halfway to what he's demanding in order to have these conversations,"" he continued.Several lawmakers said the debt bill could move as soon as Friday if Obama agrees to open up talks on other topics.Yet reaction from the White House was not very positive, although press secretary Jay Carney said that if a clean debt ceiling bill actually reaches the president's desk, Obama would sign it.Still, Carney reiterated the administration position that the White House doesn't see the debt ceiling being raised or the government being opened as any sort of concession, but as part of Congress' job.""Our position is clear: they ought to turn on the lights, they ought to pay our bills,"" Carney said. ""The logic here is that they would harm the American economy and the American people in order to try to extract concessions from the president and their counterparts on Capitol Hill. That's an unsustainably bad proposition.""Similarly, Senate Democrats did not seem impressed by the deal.""Republicans may let one hostage go, but they are keeping a gun to the head of the other, while reserving the right to kidnap the first one again in a few weeks,"" an aide to Senate leadership told HuffPost on background, because the House's formal legislation has yet to be released. It remains unclear if the Senate would go along with a short-term bill. Democrats introduced a measure in the upper chamber that would extend the debt limit for more than a year.Ahead of a Thursday afternoon meeting between two-dozen Republicans and the White House, one Republican agreed that all the proposal does is essentially move the goal posts.""We haven't changed our position, only the timeline,"" said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.). ""There won't be a vote on a temporary extension of the debt limit unless the president agrees this afternoon to sit down and talk with us.""Yet even GOP reaction to the House plan seemed mixed coming out of the Republicans' closed-door meeting Thursday morning. After leaders presented the plan to members, many echoed Boehner in saying it was a show of good faith to the White House. But hard-line conservatives like Iowa Rep. Steve King said he was not ""enthusiastic"" about the deal, and others said they would only back the bill if the president pledges to begin negotiations on broader fiscal issues.Although a half-dozen lawmakers leaving the meeting said the House's proposed debt-ceiling hike has no riders, The Wall Street Journal reported there was one possible wrinkle that would permanently ban the sorts of ""extraordinary measures"" that Treasury secretaries have long used to keep bills paid during debt limit debates.The United States actually began brushing up against the debt limit in May, and since then the Treasury has essentially been borrowing from itself and raising pension funds to meet obligations. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said that while he thought the House bill was ""clean,"" he was concerned about how it deals with the measures Treasury has already taken. A six-week measure would add about $90 billion to the debt, but undoing all the steps taken going back to May could make the tab more like $300 billion, he said. ""If it says a date certain [six weeks], how do you take into account reimbursement of the federal government and our creditors for the extraordinary measures that the Treasury Department has been using since May?"" he said.With Carney repeating the position that the president will not negotiate on opening the government, it seemed unlikely that the White House meeting would prove fruitful.However, if Boehner's offer of a conference committee comes through, negotiations with the White House might not be required. Congress has the ability to work out its differences on its own through such a committee, with members from both chambers sitting down to craft a spending plan, as they have so far failed to do.This is a developing story and has been updated."

Of course, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put such a bill on the floor in the first place. But if he did, the votes appear to be there for passage, at which point the bill would sail through the Senate and be signed by President Barack Obama, ending the shutdown.HuffPost has been keeping a running tally of which Republicans have said they're done trying to force through provisions to delay or defund Obamacare in order to keep the government running. That list is below.But as of Tuesday, Oct. 8, we're adding another category: Republicans in that group who have since changed their minds and say they will no longer support a bill that simply reopens the government without extra provisions. Four Republicans have flip-flopped as of Oct. 8, which means the total number of GOP members who publicly support a clean continuing resolution is back down to 25.----------House Republicans Who Support A 'Clean' Funding Bill:1.

I don't think the economy is overheating,"" he said. Financial markets were again encouraged by Bernanke's remarks, with stocks rallying for a second day on the Fed chief's signal of continued stimulus combined with enthusiasm over strong figures on business investment plans.""He is going to be refilling the punchbowl for a very long time,"" said Keith Bliss, senior vice-president at Cuttone & Co in New York.In response to the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-2009, the Fed slashed official borrowing costs to effectively zero and bought more than $2.5 trillion in mortgage and Treasury securities to keep long-term rates low.It is currently buying $45 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage bonds per month, a policy Fed officials backed in an 11-1 vote in January. However, minutes of that meeting released last week showed many officials had concerns over the risks presented by the central bank's policy course.Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who is among the minority of so-called hawks at the central bank, said later on Wednesday that he would like the Fed to immediately taper the purchases because the U.S. housing market is on sounder footing.""The fact that the housing market gears have now begun to mesh is why I believe we are running the risk of overkill by continuing our mortgage-backed securities purchase program at the current pace, and I have suggested that we begin tapering those purchases,"" Fisher said at Columbia University.""Personally I would begin tapering Treasuries as well,"" he later told reporters. ""I would like to start now. I just don't think the benefits are worth the costs.""But most Fed officials are eager to continue the extraordinarily easy policies given the high jobless rate and the fact that inflation is below their 2 percent target, and they do not want to derail a recovery that has faltered in each of the last three years.Bernanke argued the Fed's policy easing deserves at least some credit for the ongoing economic recovery, even if growth remains fragile and vulnerable to looming short-run spending cuts from the U.S. government.Indeed, he argued that current plans for abrupt short-term deficit reduction could be counterproductive, even for the purposes of reducing government debt levels.""I'm still concerned about the short-run impact on jobs,"" he said. ""(You) don't get as much benefit as you think because if you slow the economy that hurts your revenues and that means your deficit reduction is not as big as you think it is.""A number Republicans on the House committee said they also were concerned about the Fed's actions.""For diminishing marginal benefits, the Federal Reserve's unconventional strategy creates considerable risks,"" said Representative Jeb Hensarling, the panel's chairman. ""If the (Fed's) balance sheet is not unwound at the right time and at the right pace, we could be looking at another deep recession, soaring inflation or skyrocketing interest rates.""Bernanke tried to soothe such worries, expressed by a number of lawmakers, that the central bank was so far into uncharted policy territory that an exit could be problematic.Admitting the Fed would face an unprecedented task, Bernanke nonetheless said the central bank has the right tools to exit when the time comes, adding that those measures have been tested and used in other countries."

It passed the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee on a party-line vote, with majority Democrats in support.""This bill goes to the heart of economic security,"" testified Mitch Seaman of the California Labor Federation. ""For workers, the minimum wage is all that's keeping you from sinking further down as the economy moves on without you.""Eighteen states have a minimum wage above the federal level of $7.25 an hour, led by Washington at $9.19 an hour and then Oregon at $8.95. Ten of those states provide for annual, inflation-adjusted increases.California's wage ranks fifth-highest in the country and also trails the minimum required in Vermont and Nevada, although employers in Nevada can pay $1 an hour less than their state's $8.25 minimum if they provide health insurance benefits to workers.The California bill, which now advances to the Assembly floor, would raise the minimum wage to $8.25 in 2014, $8.75 in 2015 and $9.25 in 2016. Each year after, it would go up based on the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index.The bill is opposed by all the state's major employer organizations, including the California Restaurant Association, Western Growers Association, California Grocers Association and state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Businesses.Another opponent, the California Chamber of Commerce, has placed the bill on its annual ""job killer"" list, which includes legislation it most aggressively seeks to defeat.Matt Sutton of the restaurant association said an increase in the minimum wage would benefit only its employees who earn tips, as the added cost would force operators to hold down wages for hourly employees to absorb the mandated increases for tipped workers.""A minimum-wage increase is going to do nothing but harm my business,"" testified Joe Thompson, a Sacramento restaurant operator.Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas, the bill's author, countered that no evidence shows that higher minimum wages have done economic harm in Oregon or in San Francisco, which has a citywide minimum of $10.24.""There's been no adverse impact to jobs,"" he said.Alejo said the state's failure to increase its minimum wage for six years has led communities to begin taking matters into their own hands. In addition to San Francisco, San Jose implemented a $10 per hour minimum wage last month, and Sacramento is considering similar action.Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez, D-Los Angeles, said that his parents worked ""four to five jobs a week"" to make ends meet and always impressed upon their children the importance of having a job to avoid becoming a burden on the government.That philosophy falls apart when a job pays so little that it does not ""fulfill its purpose"" of allowing workers to get by without government subsidies or programs, he said.Assemblyman Jeff Gorell, R-Camarillo, is the only legislator on the committee who represents any part of Ventura County. He cast one of the two no votes on the measure. (c)2013 Ventura County Star (Camarillo, Calif.)Visit Ventura County Star (Camarillo, Calif.) at www.vcstar.comDistributed by MCT Information Services"

It can be difficult to objectively assess the quality of a state’s management. The economy and standard of living can be affected by decisions made decades ago, forces outside the control of the state’s government and administrators, as well as the government’s own actions.Every year, 24/7 Wall St. tries to answer this question by conducting an extensive survey of every state. To determine how well states are managed, we examined their financial data, as well as the services they provide and their residents’ standard of living. This year, North Dakota is the best-run state in the country for the second year in a row, while California is the worst-run for the third year in a row.CLICK HERE TO SEE THE BEST AND WORST RUN STATES. Identifying appropriate criteria to compare the 50 states can be challenging because they vary so much. Some states have abundant natural resources, while others rely on services or innovation. A few have been burdened by struggling industries. Some are more rural, while others are more urban. Because of such differences, a spending or tax policy that can be beneficial in one state can be disastrous in another.Many of the best-run states in the nation benefit from an abundance of natural resources. North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, and Texas, among the best-run states, are all among the states with the greatest concentration of GDP in the mining industry, which includes activities such as oil and natural gas extraction, as well as coal mining. The presence of this industry benefits states in several ways. North Dakota and Texas led the nation in real GDP growth in 2012, while Alaska has used its oil revenue to establish a permanent fund that pays residents an annual dividend.The housing crisis has had a major negative impact on a number of the worst-run states. It caused a drastic decline in construction employment in states like Arizona, California, and Nevada. Many of these lost jobs have yet to be replaced. In the hardest-hit states, this has resulted not only in worsening unemployment, but increased poverty and budget shortfalls. Although the economies of these states have largely improved, the residual effects of the housing crisis remain.While these can be considered extenuating circumstances, the fact is that each state must deal with the cards it is dealt. Governments must plan for worst-case scenarios, including the collapse of an industry. Several resource-rich states have squandered their advantages and rank poorly on our list. Good governance involves raising and spending enough to provide for the well-being of the population without risking the state’s long-term stability.To determine how well the states are run, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed hundreds of data sets from dozens of sources. We looked at each state’s debt, revenue, expenditure, and deficit to determine how well it was managed fiscally. We reviewed taxes, exports, and GDP growth, including a breakdown by sector, to identify how each state was managing its resources. We looked at poverty, income, unemployment, high school graduation, violent crime and foreclosure rates to assess the well-being of the state’s residents.While each state is different, the best-run states share certain characteristics, as do the worst run. For example, the populations of the worse-off states tended to have lower standards of living. Violent crime rates in these states were usually higher and residents were much less likely to have a high school diploma.The worst-run states also tended to have weak fiscal management reflected in higher budget shortfalls and lower credit ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poors.The better-run states tended to display stable fiscal management. Pensions were more likely to be fully funded, debt was lower, and budget deficits smaller. Credit ratings agencies also were much more likely to rate the well-run states favorably. Only two poorly run states received a perfect credit rating from either agency. California and Illinois, which are ranked worst and third worst, received the lowest ratings from both agencies.The states that were well-managed also tended to have lower unemployment rates. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates ranked as the best-run states. California, Illinois, and Nevada — the states with the highest unemployment rates as of 2012 — were among the five worst-run states.Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that worst-run states tended to have better fiscal management. They have weak fiscal management.These are the worst-run states in America, according to 24/7 Wall St.
8417	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/25/food-stamp-cuts_n_3653633.html	News	1	Economy	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Republicans in the House of Representatives removed food stamps from broader farm legislation in hopes that doing so would make it easier to pass a separate bill cutting nutrition assistance. But now there's a chance the House won't vote on a food stamp bill at all. House Agriculture Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) told the Oklahoma Farm Report Wednesday that so far, House Republican leaders have been unable to muster the votes they need to pass a bill reforming the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. ""Right now that equation is not there, and discussions are still going on,"" Lucas said. ""My friends on the left don’t want to have any reforms and my friends on the right want dramatically more reforms than probably are achievable in this environment.""For decades, rural and urban lawmakers have joined forces to pass farm bills that include both agribusiness subsidies and nutrition assistance for poor people. That arrangement has broken down with the rise of tea party Republicans who are hostile to the food stamp status quo, as the Great Recession pushed the program's enrollment to 47 million people. Last month, a traditional farm bill collapsed on the House floor largely because Democrats willing to accept modest cuts withdrew their support in the wake of a Republican amendment seeking to make the cuts harsher. This month, House Republicans passed a ""farm only"" farm bill without any Democratic support. Lucas started preliminary negotiations with Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) about how the fractured House bill might be combined with the traditional farm legislation that passed the Senate earlier this year. Lucas said he doesn't want to wait for the House to pass SNAP legislation to begin the formal conference committee process with members of the Senate.""My personal goal is by some point next week, if it’s quite clear that consensus cannot be achieved, if it’s just not achievable, then I think we need to recognize that fact and move on conferencing the bill that the Senate’s passed and the House has passed and see what evolves from that,"" Lucas told the Farm Report. ""But right now [we're] still trying to achieve consensus. That consensus is at the very least elusive. It might even be impossible. But I’m still trying.""A House Republican leadership aide suggested that House Republicans wouldn't hurry to conference with the Senate. “We are still moving forward with member discussions to develop SNAP reforms that have consensus and get these programs back on track so they can be there for the most vulnerable,"" the aide told HuffPost. ""Those discussions will likely continue into August and we will readdress it when we return back after recess.""If House leaders appoint conferees without approving nutrition legislation first, those lawmakers would probably have less leverage to push for food stamp cuts in the conference committee. Both chambers would have to approve the committee's eventual compromise legislation. The Senate bill cut nutrition assistance by $4 billion, or less than 1 percent of the program's $800 billion cost over 10 years. Before it was amended, the House bill would have cut SNAP by $20 billion. Without new legislation, the food stamp program would likely continue with no cuts at all -- an outcome Lucas has tried to warn his colleagues about. "

One Republican lawmaker walked a group of reporters through how this might happen on Thursday afternoon, and said that he thinks a deal will be reached by the Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling.""I think we'll avoid default. I think we'll stumble toward a larger deal that will continue to narrow the deficit,"" said the lawmaker. ""I don't think it will be as grand as the grand bargain.""In short, the GOP member, who spoke on the condition he not be quoted by name in order to speak more frankly, said during an hour talk that members of his party might be willing to vote to end some or all of the sequester, in exchange for changes to Social Security and Medicare.The sequester was the result of the last budget showdown, and it cut discretionary spending across the board. Because neither party is happy with the sequester cuts, they could become another key bargaining chip in a deal to pass a funding bill and end the government shutdown. Republicans could possibly seek the changes to entitlement spending, and in turn vote to restore funding in other areas -- all within negotiations over a deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.""Sequester is a very blunt instrument,"" the GOP member said. ""It's a pretty common view among Republicans that we've done way too much. So some of the spending can be restored. ... Then the president's going to get some of what he wants, for domestic initiatives, Head Start and whatever.""The lawmaker said non-discretionary spending, or mandatory spending that's locked in each year and not appropriated by Congress, could ""hold the savings of the sequester,"" while Republicans could ""let the belt out a couple notches on the discretionary side of the budget.""The changes the GOP is aiming for, he said, would include ""at least chained CPI and at least means testing."" In other words, a different measure of inflation would be used to calculate Social Security benefits, leading to lower increases over time, and lower-income Americans would receive more generous Social Security and Medicare benefits than those in high-income brackets.One Democratic congressional source noted that Obama has signaled in the past -- including in his budget this year -- that he is willing to support using chained CPI. And a Republican leadership aide said this week that Republican hopes for a deal are based in part on their understanding that Obama wants very badly to get rid of the sequester cuts.The Democratic source laid out a way a deal could proceed so that the president could claim to have won a ""clean"" government funding bill and a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase, but changes to the sequester and entitlements would be tied to these actions.""The political appeal of this kind of approach ... is that it offers each party a way out of the corner it’s in,"" wrote conservative policy expert Yuval Levin, editor of National Affairs and an informal adviser to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), in National Review Online. Levin laid out in detail how a deal such as the one described by the Republican lawmaker to reporters would work.The Republican member said that if a such a deal is reached, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) can move forward even if his right flank in the House, and tea party lawmakers in the Senate like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), oppose it. ""If it's a real bargain and the president and the speaker come to the deal, that way you make the left wing and the right wing irrelevant, because deals have votes from both sides,"" he said. ""The irony of this is that the guys who got us into this mess won't be there to cut the deal that gets us out. And they will attack the people that actually come to the deal, and profit by it politically,"" he said. ""This is more about political position for a few members. For most of them I don't question their motives.""As for Cruz, the GOP lawmaker said: ""I tell you one thing: He's never played team sports in his life.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the president's position on the chained CPI."

That's up from 43 percent in December 2012, during the last fiscal standoff. The figure is the first time a majority thought Republican control was bad for the country since CNN started asking in December 2010. Sixty-three percent of respondents want Boehner replaced, but by another Republican, which would not change GOP control of the House.The poll is yet another sign that the government shutdown has hurt the Republican party. An NBC/WSJ poll taken during the shutdown showed that 24 percent of people approved of the party, a record low. Gallup measured another record low for the GOP, with 28 percent approving. A poll released Sunday funded by Moveon.org and conducted by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling showed that incumbent Republicans trailed generic Democrats in 15 of 25 competitive House districts.Congress as a whole has a measly 12 percent approval rating, while 86 percent disapprove, according to the CNN/ORC International poll. President Barack Obama received a 44 percent approval rating, while 52 percent said they disapprove -- a number virtually unchanged since June. Forty-four percent are more confident that Obama can handle problems facing the U.S., versus 31 percent who said they think Republicans can. Twenty-one percent said they were confident in neither.

Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said. ""Shame on this Congress for allowing this to happen.""But the cut, which will reduce monthly benefits for all 47 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by roughly 7 percent, is happening thanks mainly to Democratic votes that hastened the demise of a benefit increase from the 2009 stimulus bill. Each of the representatives at Tuesday's presser voted with their party for a pair of 2010 spending bills that set the cuts in motion.The first bill took money allocated for future food stamp use and used it instead to prevent states from laying off teachers. Democrats supported the bill grudgingly, lamenting that it would cause a food stamp cut in 2014. When it came time to support a second bill that raided future food stamp funds once again, pushing the cut to November 2013, they protested -- at least at first. ""This is one of the more egregious cases of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and is a vote we do not take lightly,"" more than 100 Democrats wrote in an August 2010 letter to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). But then President Barack Obama smoothed things over in a meeting at the White House, because the bill in question was the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act -- a priority of the first lady's. The measure provided free lunches and updated nutrition standards for schools.""I am very pleased we were able to work together with the president and his team to address concerns regarding cuts to the food stamp program that are included in the child nutrition bill,"" Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said in a statement at the time. On Tuesday, Lee told HuffPost the president had pledged to support replacing the SNAP funds, a vow he fulfilled in subsequent budget blueprints that didn't become law. Congress and the White House have been otherwise silent about the issue for the past three years.On Tuesday, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) defended the 2010 tradeoff. ""It was a piece of legislation that said let's change nutrition standards, let's get junk foods out of our schools, and let's make sure that our kids can have those fruits and vegetables,"" DeLauro told HuffPost. ""There was no money for it. The price of it was $2.2 billion. That came from the food stamp program and all of us here complained. And we were opposed to that but we knew that it was a good first step in getting the Hunger-Free Kids Act.""Friday's cut is happening thanks to the expiration of a 13.6 percent food stamp boost from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus bill. Originally, lawmakers had planned to let SNAP's annual inflation adjustments catch up to the increase sometime after 2015. Canceling the enhanced benefits this November means the government will spend $5 billion less on nutrition assistance next year -- an annual SNAP spending cut 25 percent larger than what House Republicans are seeking in farm bill negotiations starting this week. DeLauro pivoted from November's food stamp decrease to Republican demands that food stamps be reduced by 5 percent, or $40 billion over 10 years, though the two things are completely separate. ""This is about people wanting to make a $40 billion cut in the food stamp program,"" DeLauro said, ""not to put in place a Hunger-Free Kids Act, but in fact to take food out of the mouths of our children, or seniors, and the disabled. A much different time, a much different place, and a much different set of circumstances."" "

I don't think the economy is overheating,"" he said. Financial markets were again encouraged by Bernanke's remarks, with stocks rallying for a second day on the Fed chief's signal of continued stimulus combined with enthusiasm over strong figures on business investment plans.""He is going to be refilling the punchbowl for a very long time,"" said Keith Bliss, senior vice-president at Cuttone & Co in New York.In response to the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-2009, the Fed slashed official borrowing costs to effectively zero and bought more than $2.5 trillion in mortgage and Treasury securities to keep long-term rates low.It is currently buying $45 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage bonds per month, a policy Fed officials backed in an 11-1 vote in January. However, minutes of that meeting released last week showed many officials had concerns over the risks presented by the central bank's policy course.Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who is among the minority of so-called hawks at the central bank, said later on Wednesday that he would like the Fed to immediately taper the purchases because the U.S. housing market is on sounder footing.""The fact that the housing market gears have now begun to mesh is why I believe we are running the risk of overkill by continuing our mortgage-backed securities purchase program at the current pace, and I have suggested that we begin tapering those purchases,"" Fisher said at Columbia University.""Personally I would begin tapering Treasuries as well,"" he later told reporters. ""I would like to start now. I just don't think the benefits are worth the costs.""But most Fed officials are eager to continue the extraordinarily easy policies given the high jobless rate and the fact that inflation is below their 2 percent target, and they do not want to derail a recovery that has faltered in each of the last three years.Bernanke argued the Fed's policy easing deserves at least some credit for the ongoing economic recovery, even if growth remains fragile and vulnerable to looming short-run spending cuts from the U.S. government.Indeed, he argued that current plans for abrupt short-term deficit reduction could be counterproductive, even for the purposes of reducing government debt levels.""I'm still concerned about the short-run impact on jobs,"" he said. ""(You) don't get as much benefit as you think because if you slow the economy that hurts your revenues and that means your deficit reduction is not as big as you think it is.""A number Republicans on the House committee said they also were concerned about the Fed's actions.""For diminishing marginal benefits, the Federal Reserve's unconventional strategy creates considerable risks,"" said Representative Jeb Hensarling, the panel's chairman. ""If the (Fed's) balance sheet is not unwound at the right time and at the right pace, we could be looking at another deep recession, soaring inflation or skyrocketing interest rates.""Bernanke tried to soothe such worries, expressed by a number of lawmakers, that the central bank was so far into uncharted policy territory that an exit could be problematic.Admitting the Fed would face an unprecedented task, Bernanke nonetheless said the central bank has the right tools to exit when the time comes, adding that those measures have been tested and used in other countries."

The agency said that Walmart intimidated, surveilled or punished workers in 14 different states, violating U.S. labor law.The agency also said that Walmart illegally threatened workers in statements made in two news broadcasts. That charge appears to refer in part to an interview that Walmart spokesperson David Tovar gave to CBS Evening News last year, saying ""there could be consequences"" for workers who are expected to show up for work and don't.Brooke Buchanan, a Walmart spokeswoman, said the company disagreed with the general counsel's position. ""This is just a procedural step and we will pursue our options to defend the company because we believe our actions were legal and justified,"" she said. “The fact is, we provide good jobs and unparalleled opportunities for our associates. This is our busiest time of the year and we're focused on serving our customers and helping them have a great holiday season.""The labor board said it found no merit in some of the other charges that workers filed, with the backing of the United Food and Commercial Workers, a longtime Walmart foe. The NLRB dismissed one claim that Walmart violated employees' rights by pushing protesters off of store property, and another that Walmart illegally changed employees' work schedules in retaliation for striking.The general counsel's charge amounts to an allegation by a prosecutor -- not a ruling by the board. Such cases are often resolved before the board actually moves to prosecute a company, usually through a settlement to which the parties agree. If Walmart and the workers' representatives can't come to terms, then the labor board will file its complaints. In a call with reporters before the NLRB's announcement Monday, Joseph Hansen, president of UFCW, said the charges were evidence that ""workers who've joined together to improve conditions have been targeted.""""Walmart is on their heels,"" Hansen said. ""Does Walmart treat its workers fairly? It is a debate that we welcome, and one that we plan on winning.""An estimated 400 Walmart workers took part in Black Friday strikes last year, arguing that the company provides unlivable wages, scant benefits and erratic scheduling. The UFCW and its non-union Walmart affiliate, OUR Walmart, say they're planning more strikes this holiday shopping season, although they wouldn't estimate on Monday how many workers might take part.This wouldn't be the first time that the NLRB pursued charges against a company for statements it made in the media. In one highly politicized charge made in 2011, the board's general counsel accused Boeing executives of illegally threatening workers in the press for having gone on strike in the past. That case was eventually settled.This story has been updated with comment from Walmart."

Following the announcement, Club For Growth said it would oppose the deal and include it on its congressional scorecard.""They're using our members and they're using the American people for their own goals. This is ridiculous,"" Boehner said loudly. ""Listen, if you're for more deficit reduction, you're for this agreement.""The deal reached by House Budget Chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) modestly raises spending levels from $967 billion to $1.014 trillion by 2015, counteracting approximately one-third of sequestration cuts. It also reduces the deficit by $20 to $23 billion by hiking airline fees and requiring federal workers and military personnel to kick in more for their pensions.Boehner's tone toward the conservative groups was unusually aggressive, a further signal that he wants the deal to pass the House Republican caucus, where the groups hold sway among members.Levi Russell, Director of Public Affairs for Americans For Prosperity, responded to Boehner's comments. ""AFP stood with House Republicans earlier this spring when they passed modest spending limits set by the sequester,"" Russell said. ""That bipartisan agreement was signed by President Obama and set spending levels at $967 billion. It’s disappointing to see leadership give up even those modest gains with nothing to show for it.""“Americans are deeply concerned about the direction of the country. Over the next few days, lawmakers will have to explain to their constituents, many of whom are our members, what they’ve achieved by increasing spending, increasing taxes and offering up another round of promises waiting to be broken. That will be a really tough sell back home,"" said Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action.Club For Growth released a statement as well. ""We stand with Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Tom Coburn, Rand Paul, members of the Republican Study Committee and every other fiscal conservative who opposes the Ryan-Murray deal,” said the group's president, Chris Chocola. “After carefully reviewing the budget deal, on which we never commented until it was complete, we determined that it would increase the size of government. We support pro-growth proposals when they are considered by Congress. In our evaluation, this isn’t one of those.”"

But what is sequestration exactly? Set to begin March 1 at 11:59 p.m., the sequester is a set of automatic spending cuts put into law by the Budget Control Act. Signed by President Barack Obama in August 2011, that legislation raised the debt ceiling and sought to apply pressure on Congress to come up with a longer term plan for deficit reduction.The $1.2 trillion in budget cuts would be spread over nine years and are equally divided between domestic and defense-related spending. During the remainder of the 2013 fiscal year, $85 billion worth of cuts are set to go into effect. The budget cuts would end in 2021. Why is the sequester happening? When the debt limit was raised in 2011, Republicans demanded that budget cuts be included in the legislation. The Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction -- or the ""super committee"" put in charge of figuring out how to implement the cuts called for in the Budget Control Act -- ultimately proved unable to reach a bipartisan agreement on cutting $1.2 trillion from the deficit. With the threat of automatic sequestration still looming, Congress was tasked with finding those cuts. No luck so far. So, while sequestration was never intended to actually go into effect, it now most likely will.What funding will the sequester affect? The sequester will affect government spending across the board. The military will see $550 billion in cuts, drawing funds away from national security and military operations. On the domestic side, cuts will affect health care, education, law enforcement, disaster relief, unemployment benefits, non-profit organization funds, scientific research and more. Will any funding not be affected? The sequester stipulates certain areas of government spending that will see no cuts. No money will be drawn from spending on wars and military personnel. Funding allocated for Medicaid, Social Security, Pell grants, veterans' benefits and some low-income programs will not be affected, either. Have lawmakers tried to stop the sequester? Both Democrats and Republicans are trying to figure out how to stop the sequester from going into effect, but the two parties can't agree on a plan. Senate Democrats introduced a plan titled the American Family Economic Protection Act, which identified $120 billion in savings that would replace sequester cuts until the end of December 2013. Republicans weren't in agreement on their own solution, but eventually came forward with a counterproposal that would have kept the sequester in place, but given Obama control in implementing the cuts. Both plans were ultimately voted down. This post has been updated.For more information on specific sequester cuts, see the slideshow below: "

He knows the issues. Very importantly, he has the trust of the president,"" former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, a Republican, said on Wednesday in a speech at the Wilson Center, a foreign policy think tank.Froman was approved in a 93-4 vote. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, was among the few senators to vote against him, citing what she called a lack of transparency in U.S. trade negotiations, a complaint many civil society groups have made in the past.""Many people are deeply interested in tracking the trajectory of trade negotiations, but if they do not have reasonable access to see the terms of the agreements under negotiation, then they can't have real input,"" Warren said.Froman got strong words of support from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, and Senator Orrin Hatch, the panel's top Republican.""I have every confidence this man is going to be an excellent leader ... He is highly qualified,"" Hatch said.The Senate action came just days after Obama and leaders of the European Union opened talks on what would be the world's biggest free-trade agreement, the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership pact.Froman now will be able to preside over the first round of those negotiations, set for the week of July 8 in Washington.The United States also is negotiating a free-trade agreement with Japan and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact that it hopes to finish by the end of this year.Froman's legacy will rest on whether he can bring those two big negotiations to agreements and win their approval in Congress. To secure the Asia-Pacific pact and win new export opportunities for U.S. business and farmers, Froman may have to make politically difficult decisions that would open the U.S. market to more auto, dairy, sugar and textile imports.The United States and the EU want to finish their trade talks by the end of 2014, requiring compromise on tough issues like Europe's restrictions on imports of genetically modified crops and other food safety barriers that Washington says are not based on scientific evidence.Froman also faces an early test in Congress to win approval of trade promotion authority, a piece of legislation that many of Obama's fellow Democrats have opposed in the past.That legislation, which expired in 2007, allows the White House to submit trade deals to Congress for straight up-or-down votes without any amendments.Approval of the bill would signal strong congressional backing for the Asia-Pacific and the EU agreements, helping to bring them to a close.Concern in Congress about the massive U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a record $315 billion in 2012, also puts pressure on Froman to make progress on that front.In addition, many lawmakers are increasingly frustrated with Indian policies that block U.S. imports and invalidate patent protections for valuable U.S. pharmaceuticals.In December, Froman will head to Bali for the ninth ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization amid gloom over that body's continuing viability as a negotiating forum.With the 12-year-old Doha round of world trade talks at an impasse, WTO members are striving to reach agreement on a small package of trade deals to show they can produce results.

Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), is the third installment in a series outlining the impact of sequester-related cuts. The report, provided to The Huffington Post in advance of its Wednesday release, is blunt, arguing that Congress has made the impact of sequestration worse by adjusting individual parts, rather than pursuing a larger fix. ""A few departments and agencies have found ways to mitigate some very specific impacts of sequestration,"" the authors wrote. ""However, these strategies merely replace one set of cuts with cuts to other parts of the same agency. All will have an impact, and nearly all will have to be made up with future appropriations.""""Piecemeal efforts to manage sequestration are counterproductive,"" the report concluded. ""They often require underfunding long-term needs to mitigate short-term pain. In many instances, the annual savings mask increased longer-term costs.""To illustrate this point, the Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee looked at the efforts made by Congress to end the furloughing of air traffic controllers shortly after complaints surfaced over flight delays. While the Federal Aviation Administration was granted flexibility to end those furloughs, it came ""at the expense of another priority,"" the report said. In this case, the FAA can no longer fund construction projects with discretionary funds. Officials estimated the costs of congestion and delays at airports will exceed $34 billion by 2020. Food safety inspectors were also spared the hit of sequestration. But here too, congressional Democrats pointed out that the cost was only moved elsewhere, with funding taking the hit for U.S. Department of Agriculture building maintenance and for a program to upgrade school kitchen equipment. ""Again, sequestration forced a difficult sacrifice of long-term necessities to avoid short-term pain,"" the report concluded. Much of the 26-page report is devoted not to the fixes made to sequestration, but to the impacts to come. Under the sequester, $85 billion will be cut this fiscal year, and an estimated $1 trillion will be cut over the next decade. The report predicted that taxpayers may end up paying more because of the indiscriminate and shortsighted nature of the cuts. Take, for instance, the $50 million reduced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s geostationary weather satellite program. ""The cut will cause a 3-6 month satellite launch delay,"" the report said. ""The delay, as with any construction delay, ends up raising the cost to taxpayers over the next few years, in this case by up to $200 million.""Then there is the case of federal public defenders, facing steep reductions in funding. ""Reductions in the Federal Defender Services account actually cost the taxpayer money in the form of private attorneys,"" the report said. ""If the Federal Defender cannot accept a case due to sequestration (as many are currently experiencing), representation is provided by private panel attorneys, who are paid at a higher cost than Federal Defenders.""Those dreaded flight delays, the authors noted, may still end up a reality. Sequestration cuts to the Transportation Security Administration ""may not currently impact wait times for travelers moving through our nation’s airports, but TSA anticipates an increase in the number of delays during the peak summer travel months,"" the report said. Other highlights in the report:Research projects will feel the budget cuts, with the National Institutes of Health estimating that it will support 1,357 fewer grants in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012.  The Department of Energy will face challenges ""remediating the contamination from the nation’s nuclear weapons development effort"" because of a $430 million cut.  Rural rental assistance for those in need will be hit, with an estimated 15,000 aid recipients expected to get less while an estimated 70,000 children ""will lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start.""  The Forest Service will enter the 2013 firefighting season with 500 fewer firefighters.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will place fewer vaccines, drugs and supplies into the national stockpile used for ""countermeasures needed to respond to bioterrorist attacks."" Sequestration, the report ominously concluded, may hamper the Department of Defense in confronting pressing national security issues. ""In total,"" the report said, ""DoD estimates the shortfall caused by sequestration in the operation and maintenance accounts is $22 billion for the remainder of FY 2013. The significance of degraded readiness is that units, other than those deploying to Afghanistan (e.g., units that may respond to crises in Syria, Iran or the Korean Peninsula), will not have completed the training necessary to conduct the full range of assigned tasks.""

The seamy details of this lobbying effort are found in a new study by the reform advocacy group Public Citizen. It is arguably one of the least-surprising studies in the history of studies, right up there with research confirming that popes tend to wear large hats. But it makes for depressing, eye-opening reading nonetheless.For one thing, there is the chart that leads off the study, showing how corporate profits have soared to all-time highs as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product, while corporate taxes are near record lows. (Story continues after Chart Of Anger, courtesy of Public Citizen.)This state of affairs exists largely because the biggest U.S. corporations have for years lobbied Congress for loopholes that allow them to keep much of their profits out of the clutches of the IRS, including an estimated $1.7 trillion in cash held offshore.Apple Inc. has been public face of this issue lately, with its CEO Tim Cook hauled before a Senate panel to explain why his company is keeping more than $100 billion offshore. Apple spent $2 million on lobbying last year and could double that this year, Reuters reported recently. The company has managed to avoid paying taxes, in perfectly legal ways, on $74 billion in profits since 2009, according to a recent Senate investigation.As you may have heard, the U.S. government has found itself in a bit of a fiscal pickle recently and could use some of this cash. That has led some lawmakers to try to find ways to close some of these loopholes. Two bills, the Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes Act and the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, have aimed to do just that. A third bill, the Wall Street Trading and Speculators Tax Act, would slap taxes on some financial transactions -- not a loophole-closing bill, exactly, but one that would help address the fact that the U.S. financial sector currently makes up 30 percent of total corporate profits, but only coughs up 18 percent of total corporate tax revenues to the government.Some reform-minded groups are lobbying in favor of these bills, notes Public Citizen. But they are being drowned out by the lobbying in the other direction.Of the 383 lobbyists working over lawmakers on these bills, 331 were from companies or corporate trade groups opposed to them, by Public Citizen's count.Meanwhile, the companies and groups lobbying on these bills are represented by 46 different political action committees that donated money to lawmakers in the 2012 election cycle, according to Public Citizen. Of that group, 40 PACs represented corporate America and spent $20 million on their favorite candidates. The top three money-donating PACs in this group were the National Association of Realtors, the Credit Union National Association and the American Bankers Association. Individual corporate PACs included AT&T, General Electric, Pfizer and Microsoft.It's a free country, of course, and companies, like people, have the right to free speech in the form of campaign donations. But all that free speech is expensive, and these companies have a lot more money to make their case than the rest of us taxpayers -- who will almost certainly keep ending up paying the cost.

Analysts had forecast a 2.5 percent gain.Growth was held back as government spending fell across all levels of government and as businesses outside the farm sector stocked their shelves at a slower pace.Washington has been tightening its belt for several years but ramped up austerity measures in 2013, hiking taxes in January and slashing the federal budget in March.Still, economic growth has been surprisingly resilient, supported by the Federal Reserve's low interest rate policies. Most economists expect growth will slow mid-year as budget cuts come into effect.Government spending fell even more sharply in the fourth quarter, and economists speculate that government agencies pulled back in anticipation of budget cuts initially due to begin in January but which took effect in March.In the first quarter, government spending dropped at a 4.9 percent annual rate, faster than the 4.1 percent rate initially estimated. Spending fell at federal, state and local government offices, though the majority of the downward revision in Thursday' report came at the county and city level.The drag from government and inventories was partially offset by an upward revision to consumer spending, which rose at a 3.4 percent annual rate, up two tenths of a point from the government's previous estimate.However, a cloud hung over that category, as most of the upward revision was due to higher sales of gasoline. Higher prices at the pump are a burden on consumers, leaving them less money to spend on other things. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.After-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the quarter, the first decline in a year.Total imports grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than initially estimated, moderating the drag on growth from net trade.Excluding the volatile inventories component, GDP rose at an upwardly revised 1.8 percent rate, slightly higher than analysts had forecast.

There were financial scandals, a new Supreme Court case, laws rewritten and the anticipation of more money than ever before. Below are 10 of the biggest campaign finance stories of the year.10. Big money took over North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory (R) won election in late 2012 with huge support from the political network funded by wealthy conservative activist Art Pope and immediately announced that Pope would be his budget director. In the ensuing year, the state enacted highly divisive right-wing legislation along the lines long proposed by Pope's outside network of think tanks and political organizations. North Carolina became example number one of how a single donor can influence the political direction of an entire state in the post-Citizens United world.9. Get ready for the most expensive midterm election ever. More than $815 million has been raised or spent on the 2014 midterm elections and 2013 special elections already. Spending by independent groups like super PACs and ""dark money"" nonprofits is ahead of the 2012 pace, when these groups laid out nearly $1 billion.Next year's Kentucky Senate race, pitting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) against both a tea party primary challenger and a very well-financed Democratic candidate, is also well ahead of the fundraising pace set by the two most expensive Senate campaigns in history. The 2012 Massachusetts race cost candidates Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren a combined $82 million, and the 2000 New York race between Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio topped $70 million. The Kentucky candidates have raised nearly $20 million and that's just through September 2013.8. Are Democrats winning the super PAC war? Just one year after conservative independent groups outspent liberal groups 2.5 to 1, the spending pattern has reversed. Liberal independent groups doled out $16.5 million in 2013, compared to $9 million from conservative groups, and liberal super PACs outraised their conservative counterparts 2 to 1 in the first half of the year.These numbers, however, are somewhat deceiving. Most of the money was spent in special elections that were highly favorable to Democrats, so major conservative groups sat out those contests. The financial comparison also does not account for ""issue"" advertising that masks an electoral purpose. Conservative groups have already spent millions on this form of independent spending that doesn't have to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission.7. OFA turned into a dark money nonprofit. Following another successful electoral campaign, the Obama for America machinery, with its troves of data desired by practically every Democratic candidate in the country, sought a new home. The group transformed itself into the 501(c)(4) nonprofit Organizing for Action, the exact type of dark money group that the president had lambasted during his 2012 reelection.It may have become a bit trite, even if true, to mock the president for his repeated hypocrisy on the issue, but the transformation of his campaign organization into a nonprofit relying on voluntary disclosure -- the group does disclose its donors, but only as it sees fit -- solidified that hypocrisy for many advocates of openness and campaign finance reform.6. Obama bundlers were nominated to be ambassadors. Again, after promising to change the culture of Washington, President Barack Obama continued the tried and true practice of nominating his biggest campaign fundraisers to jobs as overseas diplomats. According to the Center for Public Integrity, Obama has nominated 23 campaign bundlers for ambassadorships since January.The American Foreign Service Association, which represents active and retired Foreign Service officers, has called for an end to this practice: ""Now is the time to end the spoils system and the de facto 'three-year rental' of ambassadorships. The United States is alone in this practice; no other major democracy routinely appoints non-diplomats to serve as envoys to other countries.""5. California officials tore back the curtain on dark money in their state. The state's investigation into an $11 million contribution to a ballot campaign committee late in 2012 revealed the inner workings of the dark-money nonprofit network connected to the billionaire Koch brothers. Due to poorly redacted documents released during the investigation, many of the original donors were uncovered, including the owners of the Gap clothing brand, investor Charles Schwab, casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and real estate developer Eli Broad, who had publicly supported the ballot initiative even as his money funded the opposition.The success of the inquiry propelled Ann Ravel, then head of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, into the vice chairmanship of the FEC.4. The Republican Party faces civil strife. This tea party vs. big business battle is apparently a real thing. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce plans to dump $50 million into supporting primary candidates from the GOP's establishment wing -- even if those candidates don't differ much on policy from the tea partiers they oppose.The key contests to watch are the Senate primary races in Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia and the House primaries in Michigan's 3rd and 11th districts and Idaho's 2nd District.3. The Supreme Court debates maybe the next Citizens United. In October, the justices heard arguments on another potentially groundbreaking campaign finance case, McCutcheon v. FEC -- this time challenging the aggregate contribution limits that restrict overall giving by an individual donor.Following the 2010 Citizens United decision, which upended politics by freeing independent groups to spend unlimited sums of money, including corporate and union funds, campaign finance cases have been watched very closely. Some observers have even worried that the Supreme Court could use the McCutcheon case to roll back all contribution limits, although legal experts consider this unlikely.A ruling in favor of plaintiff Shaun McCutcheon would free the wealthiest donors to give millions more to candidates and political parties than they give now. An end to aggregate limits could also allow a political party's multiple committees to evade ordinary contribution limits by shifting money amongst each other. The Huffington Post has previously written about the dozens of donors who broke the aggregate limits in 2012 and showed how Mitt Romney's presidential campaign used state party committees to evade those limits.2. IRS scandal led to proposed clearer rules for nonprofits. If you think the public relations rollout for Obamacare has been bad, remember how the Internal Revenue Service slowly admitted that it had improperly targeted conservative groups for heightened review. After repeatedly denying any such misdeed, IRS official Lois Lerner apologized for doing precisely that in response to a planted question at a meeting of nonprofit tax lawyers. Months of howling by conservatives and hours of congressional testimony ensued until it was revealed that the IRS had targeted not just conservative groups but also liberal groups and other nonpolitical organizations.The scandal did bring about greater scrutiny of the agency's oversight of political groups, particularly dark money nonprofits that aren't required to disclose their donors. These groups have proliferated over the last several years following the Supreme Court's rulings in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life and the Citizens United case. In November, the IRS proposed new regulations for political activity by such nonprofits. The draft regulations, which were criticized from all sides, will take months, if not years, to wend their way through the regulatory process. Nonetheless, they mark a step toward greater transparency for political spending by nonprofits and, potentially, less abuse of the nonprofit tax code to hide donors' identities.1. States raised contribution limits. After the Citizens United ruling, proposals were put forward across the country to increase disclosure, rein in rampant independent spending and pass constitutional amendments to reverse the decision. The most popular idea -- among politicians, at least -- was to increase the amount of money they can raise to even the playing field.Nine states -- Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina and Wyoming -- increased their campaign contribution limits in 2013. The feat was accomplished by state legislatures run both by Republicans and by Democrats.Minnesota state Rep. Ryan Winkler (D) told The Huffington Post earlier this year, ""Increasing the money flowing directly through candidates from individuals is a better system. It might not be a perfect world, but we have to live in the world that the Supreme Court created for us and do the best we can.""The multiple bills to raise contribution limits highlight the gulf between the public, which sees far too much money in politics and supports the reversal of Citizens United, and the lawmakers, who simply want as much money as the independent groups empowered by that decision. Expect even more states to adopt hike their limits in the coming years.Permanent honorable mention: The FEC is an ongoing disaster."

President Obama proposed raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour during his State of the Union address last week. While many on the right say that raising the minimum wage could make it more difficult for employers to hire people and therefore cause higher unemployment, Krugman argued in his post that this simply is not the case. ""There just isn’t any evidence that raising the minimum wage near current levels would reduce employment,"" Krugman wrote, citing a report by John Schmitt from the Center for Economic Policy and Research. This opinion is a hotly contested one. A 2011 study from the London School of Economics found that higher minimum wages do correlate with an increase in unemployment.That said, there are a number of ways the labor market could respond to an increase in the minimum wage that do not involve cutting jobs. The Washington Post's Wonkblog has a great summary of these effects, which you can check out here. The federal minimum wage hasn't increased since 2009. According to a 2012 study from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the minimum wage would actually be $21.72 an hour if it kept pace with increases in worker productivity.The same CEPR study found that if the minimum wage kept up with inflation since it peaked in real value in 1968, it would now be $10.52 per hour.Even if the U.S. raised the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, the nation would still have a lower minimum wage than many countries around the world. Check out this list of 9 countries with a higher minimum wage than the U.S. below:"

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republican Party leaders have staked their party's future on a false premise. They say the wealthy are already providing for everyone else, and middle class families need to sacrifice for a change while millionaires reap the benefits.This year's Ryan budget is a product of this assumption. It treats the government to which Rep. Ryan has been elected as something between a nuisance and a menace, with no role in helping the economy except to transfer more wealth upward.Plenty of people have pointed out that these ideas lost in November. What they often forget is that a more positive vision also won that election: a vision of an America that helps us all achieve more than we could individually, a government that acts when the moment calls for it.The Congressional Progressive Caucus, which we're proud to co-chair, introduced its Back to Work Budget on March 13 because we know that putting Americans back to work, not cutting investments, is the answer to our nation's problems. We put 7 million people back to work in the first year and reduce the deficit $4.4 trillion over the next decade. Good jobs and fair pay, not favors for a lucky few, are what make this country run. The magic elixir Rep. Ryan and his colleagues are selling - blank checks to the Pentagon, tax cuts for the wealthy, subsidies for fossil fuels, less opportunity for the rest of us - has simply failed to help our economy. We need to rebuild this country by cutting tax loopholes we don't need and investing in the things we do: roads, bridges, schools, health care, infrastructure, and other basics of a prosperous nation. That's what our budget does.There is no question which approach the American people support. A Gallup poll released this week found that 72 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, support putting people back to work repairing our infrastructure. The same percentage supports investment to create jobs.We're not afraid of the contrasts our budget suggests with conservative ideology. Instead of closing the Department of Education, as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called for at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, we believe in building schools and putting more teachers on the job. Instead of continued tax breaks for large corporations, such as the $112 billion we will give away to wealthy fossil fuel companies in the next decade, we end preferential treatment for perks like corporate jets and put the money back into job creation for the American people.Two years ago, Rep. Ryan's blueprint was greeted with cheers by conservative activists and considerable deference by the pundits. This year, his plan is being treated as what it is: a radical transformation of the American experience. If he got his way, Medicaid would wither, Medicare as we know it would cease to exist, and the decades of progress we've made in fighting hunger and poverty would be wiped out.We agree with the American people who made their preference known in November: we can do better. The right-wing myth of makers and takers has had a pernicious effect on our politics and will take some time to fade away. In the meantime, we need to get our national conversation back on track. It's time for a serious effort to get America working again.The House Republican majority didn't pass our budget in last Wednesday's vote, but after two years of ignoring the jobs crisis, we hope our plan starts a new conversation that can continue past budget season. All we've heard from Republicans is the same exhausted line about cutting everything in sight, retrenching, reining in the American dream, and foreclosing on any positive government role in our nation's future. It's time for jobs to be the priority for Washington that it already is for the American people.Grijalva and Ellison are co-chairmen of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

The October jobs report, which was originally scheduled to be released on Nov. 1, was delayed a week by the 16-day government shutdown last month.The AP reports:The Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate rose to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent in September, likely because furloughed federal workers were counted as unemployed. The report noted that the shutdown did not affect total jobs.Employers also added 60,000 more jobs in the previous two months than earlier estimated.The figures show hiring has picked up in the fall. Employers added an average of 202,000 jobs from August through October, up from 146,000 from May through July.Stock futures fell after the report was released at 8:30 a.m. EDT, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose. That suggests investors are worried that the better job numbers will prompt the Federal Reserve to pull back on its stimulus efforts sooner than expected.One troubling detail in the report: the percentage of Americans working or looking for work fell to a fresh 35-year low. But that figure was likely distorted by the shutdown, too.About 800,000 government workers were furloughed for all or part of the shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 through Oct. 16. Many were counted as unemployed and on temporary layoff for purposes of the unemployment rate.But the furloughed workers were still counted as employed by the government's survey that counts jobs because they were ultimately paid for their time off. Federal government jobs fell only 12,000 last month.Some reports have hinted that hiring was improving. Retail stores, shipping companies, and other services firms stepped up hiring in October, according to private survey of service firms.And the number of people seeking unemployment benefits has fallen back to pre-recession levels after four weeks of declines. Unemployment benefit applications are a proxy for layoffs. The steady decline suggests companies are cutting fewer jobs.Economic growth accelerated in the July-September quarter to an annual rate of 2.8 percent, the government said Thursday. That's up from 2.5 percent in the April-June quarter.But greater restocking by businesses drove much of the increase, a trend that may not be sustainable. Consumers and businesses both cut back on spending over the summer. Check back for additional updates.

Civilian Pentagon employees comprise about half the 800,000 federal employees currently furloughed.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said a legal review of the ""Pay Our Military Act,"" signed by President Barack Obama on Monday on the eve of the shutdown, would allow him to bring a still unspecified number of civilians back to work next week.The announcement came as Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives agreed to pay all furloughed employees retroactively once the government reopens. It was a rare moment of cooperation in the House as the two parties were entrenched in their positions on the shutdown. The U.S. Senate is expected to go along.But the actions did not solve the basic problem - the failure of Democrats and Republicans to settle their political differences and agree on a bill to fund and reopen the government.The House measure prompted Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter of New York to suggest that since the employees were going to get their salaries anyway, ""why don't we just let them come back to work?""""This whole thing is crazy,"" she said.Outside the Capitol where Congress was meeting on Saturday, two small children sat at the foot of the stairs holding placards reading: End the shutdown"" and ""Stop acting like children.""As they moved into the second week of a shutdown, members appeared no closer to finding a way to end it, or to head off a possible default by the government on Oct. 17, the deadline for Congress to increase the government's authority to borrow money.Talk of using broader budget deals to bring the standoff to an end has picked up in recent days, but without any visible result.Democrats say bills to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling could be resolved quickly if House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner permitted votes on simple, no-strings-attached measures.But most House Republicans want strings attached, including one aimed at crippling Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare, and Boehner has so far refused to promise votes on either, in part because he could face a revolt that might cost him his job.Democrats have already begun efforts to force a vote on the shutdown using complex and time-consuming parliamentary procedures.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Boehner signed by 195 of 200 House Democrats, demanding a vote on a bill to reopen the government without any rollback in Obamacare.Pelosi said if Boehner did so, they would agree to the Republicans' government funding level for the next six weeks, more stringent than the Democratic level, which has already been approved by the Senate.Democrats are also trying to persuade Boehner to convene a ""conference committee"" with the Senate to discuss broader budget issues, something Boehner has resisted, fearing that Democrats might use arcane House rules to bring other measures to the House floor, such as raising taxes on the wealthy.Pelosi made what she called ""an unprecedented offer."" She said if he would permit a House-Senate conference on funding for the rest of the year, Democrats would surrender their right to use the rules to add items that might embarrass Republicans.Boehner's press secretary, Michael Steel, brushed off Pelosi's offer, saying, ""At this point, it's Senate Democrats and the president who are blocking progress on reopening the government and providing the American people fairness under Obamacare. DEBT CEILINGThe standoff, which began at the start of the new fiscal year on Tuesday and shuttered all but essential government operations, was sparked by Republicans' determination to block or delay implementation of the healthcare law.The law aims to provide healthcare to millions of uninsured Americans. Republicans argue it is a massive government intrusion into private medicine that will cause insurance premiums to skyrocket, put people out of work and eventually lead to socialized medicine.Republicans are also seeking concessions in exchange for raising the nation's $16.7 trillion debt limit. If the borrowing cap is not increased, the United States could go into default, with what officials and economists say would be seriously damaging consequences for the U.S. and global economies.Democrats vow they will make no such concessions on the funding bill or the debt ceiling.Obama said in an interview with the Associated Press released on Saturday that he did not expect to have to take any unusual steps to prevent the United States from defaulting on its debt because he believes Congress will raise the debt ceiling.""I don't expect to get there,"" Obama said. ""There were at least some quotes yesterday that Speaker Boehner is willing to make sure that we don't default,"" he said.""And I'm pretty willing to bet that there are enough votes in the House of Representatives right now to make sure that the United States doesn't end up being a deadbeat,"" Obama said.Republicans blame the White House for the fiscal deadlock, saying the president is refusing to compromise.After the House vote on retroactive pay, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican majority whip, said his party was ready to negotiate with Obama and his fellow Democrats. ""The president is here this weekend, we are here this weekend. Now is the time, since everyone is in town, to pick up the phone and talk,"" he said.Scott Rigell, a Republican representative from Virginia who has called for a ""clean"" vote to fund the government that does not involve Obama's healthcare law, said as far as he knew, there were no behind-the-scenes negotiations between Republicans and Democrats over the shutdown or the debt ceiling.""No one is talking,"" Rigell told Reuters.Facing public anger over the government shutdown, House Republicans have adopted a strategy of voting piecemeal to fund some popular federal agencies - like the Veterans Administration, the National Park Service and the National Institutes of Health - that are partially closed.Democrats have rejected that, arguing Congress has a duty to pass a bill funding the entire government."

""If these people were still getting paychecks, they would have spent them, and that would have employed people elsewhere in the economy,"" the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research told The Huffington Post. He estimated that government job cuts have cost the economy more than 1 million jobs total.The unemployment rate rose to 7.9 percent in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, not much lower than a year ago. In contrast, the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent just before the recession, according to BLS.The government has cut 719,000 jobs since President Barack Obama took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some economists said this has stymied jobs growth, since the government is a major employer, and its employees' spending provides income to other workers.""The stimulus was helpful, but it wasn't nearly enough,"" said Baker, who also blogs for The Huffington Post. The government now is focused on deficit reduction instead of helping put people back to work, he said. ""No one is talking about how we shouldn't be cutting the deficit; we really need more jobs and that means larger deficits. No one prominent in the debate is saying that.""The government reduced the maximum duration of unemployment benefits last year. But instead of boosting hiring, this only led some jobless workers to give up looking for work, according to a statement from Baker. (Receiving unemployment benefits is contingent on searching for a job.) The average duration of unemployment has declined over the past year from 40 weeks to 35 weeks, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The government is scheduled to soon slash spending even more. The government recently postponed but did not eliminate the sequestration, across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to kick in starting on March 1 after a congressional committee formed in response to the debt ceiling crisis failed in 2011 to agree on a deficit reduction plan. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that sequestration would eliminate 689,000 jobs in 2013 and cut GDP growth by 0.6 percentage points. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former Obama administration economic adviser, who also blogs for HuffPost, said that letting the sequestration go into effect probably would send the unemployment rate up to 8.2 percent. ""While the government's fiscal policy was adding to growth back in 2009 and 2010, at this point it's subtracting from growth,"" Bernstein said, pointing to the end of the stimulus and payroll tax cut. ""If state and local employment had held up instead of falling so quickly, the unemployment rate would easily be a point lower than it is today [6.9 percent]."""
8989	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/18/democratic-campaign-contributions_n_4461786.html	News	1	Economy	None	Positive	Negative	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Sharon Caliendo of Norman, Okla., worked for home state Republican Sens. Tom Coburn and Jim Inhofe. She worked for Republican Gov. Mary Fallin. She worked for Sen. John McCain's (R-Ariz.) last Senate campaign. But ever since the tea party gained a dominant hold on the GOP agenda, Caliendo has taken both her vote and her small campaign contributions to the Democrats.""They've gone so hard right,"" Caliendo, who calls herself a Colin Powell Republican, said. ""They have no common sense left.""In 2012, Caliendo began making small donations to the reelection campaign of President Barack Obama. After the election, she gave to the chief political arm of congressional Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. She has now made more than 13 contributions totaling $376.In the first 10 months of 2013, the DCCC dominated its Republican counterpart in fundraising. It did so in no small part by attracting new donors like Caliendo, frustrated with the Republican-led House of Representatives. ""The tea party, more than anything, and their growing influence in Congress,"" said Mike Snider, who works on a Navy base in southern Maryland, when asked why he has made at least 17 contributions to the DCCC totaling $513 this year.That may not seem like much when the most expensive 2014 House race has already topped $9 million in fundraising. But Democrats have been remarkably successful at tapping huge numbers of small donors like Snider and Caliendo, who give over and over. That success may translate beyond money in next year's elections. As Caliendo noted, ""Smaller donors are where the votes are at.""More than 15 percent of the DCCC's $65.2 million in fundraising through October -- or $10.1 million -- came from more than 11,700 donors who did not make a contribution in the 2012 election cycle, according to a review of Federal Election Commission records by The Huffington Post. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $5.7 million from more than 4,200 donors who did not give in 2012. Through October, the NRCC had raised $52.4 million.More than half of the new DCCC donors made more than one contribution. Nearly 700 individuals made 10 or more donations. These repeat donors accounted for $3.4 million of the new donor money raised by the committee. That may only be one-third of the total raised from new donors, but these repeat donors are far more likely to keep giving through Election Day 2014.While the DCCC is successfully getting new donors to pony up multiple times, the NRCC is struggling. Just 28 percent of new NRCC donors made more than one contribution. Only 19 individual donors made more than 10 contributions.The NRCC, heavily reliant on big donors, received more than half of its new money from donors giving $10,000 or more. Donors giving $1,000 or more accounted for 90 percent of all new contributions to the Republican committee.The NRCC did not respond to a request for comment.Big donors also played a huge role for the DCCC, with 47 percent of its new donor funds coming from those giving $10,000 or more. Two-thirds of the new money came from donors making a contribution of $1,000 or more.But donors giving less than $1,000 accounted for one-third of the new DCCC money. The NRCC raised 10 percent from that category of donors. These donors do not include those giving less than $200, the threshold for public disclosure of a donor's name and amount they gave.Controversy has aided the Democrats' fundraising successes. The committee's two best fundraising months, among both overall and new donors, came during the 16-day government shutdown in October and the political standoff that led up to it. ""Mainly my giving works when [Republicans have] done something really stupid, made a really stupid remark, and the [DCCC] comes out with their thing saying can you give $5,"" Caliendo explained. ""In one week I think I gave like $250 because I was so mad. That was leading into the shutdown.""The elevation of Democrats' enemies, like the austerity-promoting House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), also helped rake in money. The DCCC's third-best fundraising month came in March, after the House passed Ryan's budget, which would have cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.“Every time House Republicans denigrate women, double down on millionaires over the middle class or push their agenda to hurt seniors, our grassroots supporters step up -- and, needless to say, it’s happened a lot this year,"" DCCC digital director Brandon English said.These strategies are at the heart of the DCCC's successful digital fundraising program. The committee has carefully tailored its appeals to Democratic partisans, angry at the tea party and the Koch brothers. This is done through a stream of emails to the DCCC's massive list of supporters.""Once you've given once, if you give them your email, you get lots of emails,"" Snider said.Some help the DCCC raise more money. Randall Redmon, a bagger and janitor at a Kroger supermarket in Versailles, Ky., has made more than 56 contributions totaling $370. He posts every fundraising email he gets from the DCCC to Facebook and Twitter to try to help raise more money than he can give himself.""If they say that Republicans are trying to steal something or take away something, I'm trying to get as many people as I can to help stop them,"" Redmon said. ""That's what I do. I spread the word.""Supporters can set up a recurring donation to keep their support flowing, as Caliendo, Snider and Redmon, among many others, have done.The DCCC also raises money through an online store, a tactic pioneered by the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. ""Sometimes I buy stuff from their store and that's like a contribution, too,"" Redmon said. ""Sweaters and stuff, and shirts.""These new Democratic donors will likely continue to pile on contributions whenever the DCCC amplifies the actions of House Republicans. But there are always some important factors that could lead some to cut off their giving.""It depends on how things are going with polls and my finances and my job,"" Snider said.Aaron Bycoffe contributed reporting. This story has been updated to include comment from the DCCC."

The White House responded Friday night to a petition on its website urging construction of a Death Star for job creation and national defense purposes by 2016.Here's why, according to Paul Shawcross, chief of the Science and Space Branch of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote an epic response to the petition and its nearly 35,000 signatories:The construction of the Death Star has been estimated to cost more than $850,000,000,000,000,000. We're working hard to reduce the deficit, not expand it. The Administration does not support blowing up planets. Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a Death Star with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship?Shawcross did take the opportunity to explain what is being done already, instead of the government spending the the estimated $852 quadrillion (in case you were wondering what the above number was) to build the ultimate planet-destroying machine.There's the International Space Station (which doesn't destroy planets). There's the two rovers on Mars (""one wielding a laser""). Oh yeah, here's the president wielding a light saber! Who knew -- the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is even ""supporting research"" on building Luke Skywalker's arm.Shawcross closed by plugging a big initiative of the Obama administration: science, technology, engineering and math education:If you do pursue a career in a science, technology, engineering or math-related field, the Force will be with us! Remember, the Death Star's power to destroy a planet, or even a whole star system, is insignificant next to the power of the Force.Sorry, ""Star Wars"" fans, it seems the gravitational pull of Washington's budget battles was too much to make a $852 quadrillion investment."

The limit is expected to be reached Oct. 17, but the House bill would push the debt ceiling back to around Thanksgiving.""What we want to do is offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, an agreement to go to conference on the budget, for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government, and start to deal with America's pressing problems,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""I would hope that the president will look at this as an opportunity and a good-faith effort on our part to move halfway, halfway to what he's demanding in order to have these conversations,"" he continued.Several lawmakers said the debt bill could move as soon as Friday if Obama agrees to open up talks on other topics.Yet reaction from the White House was not very positive, although press secretary Jay Carney said that if a clean debt ceiling bill actually reaches the president's desk, Obama would sign it.Still, Carney reiterated the administration position that the White House doesn't see the debt ceiling being raised or the government being opened as any sort of concession, but as part of Congress' job.""Our position is clear: they ought to turn on the lights, they ought to pay our bills,"" Carney said. ""The logic here is that they would harm the American economy and the American people in order to try to extract concessions from the president and their counterparts on Capitol Hill. That's an unsustainably bad proposition.""Similarly, Senate Democrats did not seem impressed by the deal.""Republicans may let one hostage go, but they are keeping a gun to the head of the other, while reserving the right to kidnap the first one again in a few weeks,"" an aide to Senate leadership told HuffPost on background, because the House's formal legislation has yet to be released. It remains unclear if the Senate would go along with a short-term bill. Democrats introduced a measure in the upper chamber that would extend the debt limit for more than a year.Ahead of a Thursday afternoon meeting between two-dozen Republicans and the White House, one Republican agreed that all the proposal does is essentially move the goal posts.""We haven't changed our position, only the timeline,"" said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.). ""There won't be a vote on a temporary extension of the debt limit unless the president agrees this afternoon to sit down and talk with us.""Yet even GOP reaction to the House plan seemed mixed coming out of the Republicans' closed-door meeting Thursday morning. After leaders presented the plan to members, many echoed Boehner in saying it was a show of good faith to the White House. But hard-line conservatives like Iowa Rep. Steve King said he was not ""enthusiastic"" about the deal, and others said they would only back the bill if the president pledges to begin negotiations on broader fiscal issues.Although a half-dozen lawmakers leaving the meeting said the House's proposed debt-ceiling hike has no riders, The Wall Street Journal reported there was one possible wrinkle that would permanently ban the sorts of ""extraordinary measures"" that Treasury secretaries have long used to keep bills paid during debt limit debates.The United States actually began brushing up against the debt limit in May, and since then the Treasury has essentially been borrowing from itself and raising pension funds to meet obligations. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said that while he thought the House bill was ""clean,"" he was concerned about how it deals with the measures Treasury has already taken. A six-week measure would add about $90 billion to the debt, but undoing all the steps taken going back to May could make the tab more like $300 billion, he said. ""If it says a date certain [six weeks], how do you take into account reimbursement of the federal government and our creditors for the extraordinary measures that the Treasury Department has been using since May?"" he said.With Carney repeating the position that the president will not negotiate on opening the government, it seemed unlikely that the White House meeting would prove fruitful.However, if Boehner's offer of a conference committee comes through, negotiations with the White House might not be required. Congress has the ability to work out its differences on its own through such a committee, with members from both chambers sitting down to craft a spending plan, as they have so far failed to do.This is a developing story and has been updated."

Bob McDonnell (R) introduced an amendment to the state's health insurance exchange implementation bill that would prevent insurance plans in the new health exchange from covering abortion. While similar bills introduced in other states would allow a woman to buy a policy rider for abortion coverage, McDonnell's proposed amendment late Monday night would ban that as well. ""No qualified health insurance plan that is sold or offered for sale through an exchange established or operating in the Commonwealth shall provide coverage for abortions, regardless of whether such coverage is provided through the plan or is offered as a separate optional rider thereto,"" the amendment reads, adding that women who have become pregnant from rape or incest or whose lives are in danger would be exempt from the ban. Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia estimates that the ban on abortion coverage in Virginia will affect about 50,000 women in Virginia -- the estimated number who will be using state-based health benefits exchange. NARAL, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights advocacy groups condemned the amendment because it could prevent many low-income women from being able to access abortion care. “With this amendment, Governor McDonnell has launched yet another effort to intrude in women’s health care decisions and block Virginians access to comprehensive reproductive health care,"" said Caroline O’Shea, deputy director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, in a statement. ""Coverage for safe, legal abortion care -- a procedure one in three women will access in their lifetimes - is a basic benefit that most insurance plans currently include. By banning women from using their own funds to purchase plans that include this common benefit, Gov. McDonnell is restricting Virginians’ personal economic decisions as well as their access to comprehensive care.""McDonnell's office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.Anti-abortion advocacy groups and state lawmakers have been lobbying McDonnell for weeks to propose the abortion coverage amendment. Virginia delegate Bob Marshall (R), who has introduced several anti-abortion bills in the House of Delegates this year that have not gone to a vote, sent out an aggressive email blast to his supporters last week.""The Governor and Republican House and Senate leaders completely ignored any new legislative efforts to protect preborn children in the 2013 session because they wanted to avoid controversy in an election year,"" he wrote. ""If Gov. McDonnell does not hear from many principled pro-lifers like yourself, he may continue to do nothing to protect our conscience from the HHS Mandate or to prohibit abortion coverage in health exchanges."""

Contrary to Boehner's claim, several House Republicans have signaled willingness to pass a bill to fund the government with no strings attached to Obamacare's funding and implementation. The Huffington Post's Jennifer Bendery reported:As of Wednesday afternoon, the number of those Republicans hit 21 -- surpassing the magic 17 votes needed to pass a clean funding bill if all 200 Democrats stick together and team up with them. Of course, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put that bill on the floor in the first place. But if he did, the votes appear to be there for passage, at which point the bill would sail through the Senate and be signed by President Barack Obama, ending the shutdown.In the ABC interview, Boehner pushed back on the vote estimates for the bill, saying negotiations still needed to happen. ""The American people expect in Washington when we have a crisis like this, that the leaders will sit down and have a conversation,"" Boehner said. ""I told my members the other day — there may be a back room somewhere, but there's nobody in it.""Boehner criticized President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for their unwillingness to budge on the CR, saying Reid is demanding ""complete surrender."" Turning toward the looming debt ceiling deadline, the House Speaker said his chamber would not pass a measure to raise the limit without an Obamacare-related provision. ""We are not going to pass a clean debt limit [bill],"" Boehner said. ""The votes are not in the House.. We are not going down that path."" Boehner added that he had no indication of when the standoff would end. ""If I knew, I'd tell you,"" he said. "

Analysts had forecast a 2.5 percent gain.Growth was held back as government spending fell across all levels of government and as businesses outside the farm sector stocked their shelves at a slower pace.Washington has been tightening its belt for several years but ramped up austerity measures in 2013, hiking taxes in January and slashing the federal budget in March.Still, economic growth has been surprisingly resilient, supported by the Federal Reserve's low interest rate policies. Most economists expect growth will slow mid-year as budget cuts come into effect.Government spending fell even more sharply in the fourth quarter, and economists speculate that government agencies pulled back in anticipation of budget cuts initially due to begin in January but which took effect in March.In the first quarter, government spending dropped at a 4.9 percent annual rate, faster than the 4.1 percent rate initially estimated. Spending fell at federal, state and local government offices, though the majority of the downward revision in Thursday' report came at the county and city level.The drag from government and inventories was partially offset by an upward revision to consumer spending, which rose at a 3.4 percent annual rate, up two tenths of a point from the government's previous estimate.However, a cloud hung over that category, as most of the upward revision was due to higher sales of gasoline. Higher prices at the pump are a burden on consumers, leaving them less money to spend on other things. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.After-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the quarter, the first decline in a year.Total imports grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than initially estimated, moderating the drag on growth from net trade.Excluding the volatile inventories component, GDP rose at an upwardly revised 1.8 percent rate, slightly higher than analysts had forecast.

Goldman shares sank more than 2 percent.That court let the NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund, which owned some mortgage-backed certificates underwritten by Goldman, sue on behalf of investors in certificates it did not own, but which were backed by mortgages from the same lenders.Goldman and other banks have faced thousands of lawsuits by investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage securities.The bank has said that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand could cost Wall Street tens of billions of dollars.Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally had no immediate comment, saying the bank's lawyers had yet to review the order.Lawyers for the NECA-IBEW fund were not immediately available for comment.Fred Isquith, a lawyer specializing in class action and securities litigation who is not involved in the case, said Monday's order is important because of the amount of mortgage litigation in the 2nd Circuit, home to Wall Street, but said the fallout might be less than Goldman fears.""If you expand the number of securities, you expand the amount of potential damages,"" said Isquith, a partner at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz and former president of the National Association of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys. ""How much more? I'm willing to bet dollars to donuts that when it comes down to dealing with actual damages, it will be less than they argued.""Goldman shares were down $3.43, or 2.2 percent, at $151.41 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.""VEXATIOUS"" LITIGATION FEAREDAt issue was whether the NECA-IBEW fund, a Decatur, Illinois, electrical workers' union pension fund that bought certificates from two of 17 trusts under a 2007 registration statement, could sue on behalf of investors in all 17 offerings.The 2nd Circuit let the fund sue over seven of the offerings: the two it invested in, plus five others that also contained loans from GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, later part of Capital One Financial Corp, and Wells Fargo & Co. It said the other 10 offerings were too different.Theodore Olson, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher representing Goldman, warned in court papers that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand ""will effectively increase by tens of billions of dollars the potential liability that financial institutions face in this and similar class actions.""Goldman said the case also merited review because it conflicted with a decision by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals involving Japan's Nomura Holdings Inc.But Darren Robbins, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing the NECA-IBEW fund, said both decisions ensure that class representatives have ""a genuine stake in establishing liability on all of the claims asserted.""The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported Goldman, saying the 2nd Circuit decision encouraged ""vexatious, abusive litigation and coercive multi-million or billion dollar settlements to the detriment of the nation's economy.""The case is Goldman Sachs & Co et al v.

The delays, said Gainer, were a result of sequestration's budget cuts that have reduced the time that U.S. Capitol Police officers are able to work. ""Many of you have contacted me about the long lines and trouble getting into our Senate buildings over the past three days,"" Gainer wrote. ""I regret the inconvenience and continue to explore ways to mitigate the delays. However, given the budget constraints all of us are experiencing, I do not expect substantial relief.""He added that Capitol police were exploring ways to reduce the wait time.""However, the police staffing impact and concomitant costs are significant,"" wrote Gainer. ""Remember, if we are able to relieve the pressure in the morning by opening additional doors it requires police officer overtime, and the costs still must be recovered from some USCP service. Figuring out where to relieve the pressure is the hard part. Something has to give.""Sequestration's $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts were never meant to go into effect. But because Congress and the White House failed to agree on an alternative deficit-reduction plan, they did. Shortly after sequestration hit, Capitol police announced that entrance closures and modifications around Capitol Hill would go into effect on March 11. A HuffPost reader who works as a House staffer sent along a document outlining entrance closures and changes due to sequestration. View it here.And while some congressional staffers may be facing long lines -- or having to tell constituents that they can't tour the White House -- the pain across the country is more severe: the loss of tuition assistance for members of the military, job losses, lack of funding for food assistance programs, reductions in funding for natural disaster recovery and more.

Remember, if we are able to relieve the pressure in the morning by opening additional doors it requires police officer overtime, and the costs still must be recovered from some USCP service. Figuring out where to relieve the pressure is the hard part. Something has to give. I respectfully request your assistance: you can make a difference. As you make appointments with visitors or otherwise communicate with the public, please emphasize that the process of entering the building has changed. Remind visitors that there are fewer entrances available, and perhaps recommend to them the appropriate door to use. Most important, and much like our shared experience at airports after 9-11, more time is needed to get into the buildings. The sociologist in me hopes visitors and staff, armed with current information, will adjust patterns and past practices.We will continue to adjust signs, add signs, and use way finders to help. Your personal communication with expected visitors is critical. Notifying us or the USCP about particular needs, early meetings, large gatherings, committee hearings, and social functions might also ease the pain. Please be assured that we understand the issue and will work with you as we adjust to a few new realities.Respectfully, Terry"

New-home sales rose at their fastest pace in five years.Though fewer exports have hurt manufacturing, factories did field more orders in May. And a measure of business investment rose for the third straight month.A stronger second half fueled by continued job gains might be enough for the Fed to begin tapering its stimulus. Chairman Ben Bernanke said last month that the Fed would slow its bond purchases later this year and end them next year if the economy continued to strengthen.But Bernanke added that if the economy weakens, the Fed could delay its pullback or even step up its bond purchases again. Several Fed members have since tried to clarify Bernanke's remarks by saying any tapering of the bond purchases would depend on the strength of the economy.

As that didn't happen, reporters instead got to watch House Republicans smack a tennis ball into a brick wall, over and over again until everyone just hung it up for the night.But there was a brief moment where everything threatened to actually get interesting.I speak, of course, of Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), who is what passes for a ""moderate"" House Republican in this day and age. Days ago, King criticized the legislative meanderings of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and called Cruz a ""fraud,"" which ensured that King's office would spend the rest of the day fielding calls from Cruz's fanbase. Their comments featured ""vile, profane, obscene language,"" the likes of which King had never heard, and we remind you that he represents part of Long Island.As a result, King went on ""Morning Joe"" and told their Zoo Crew, “I’m not saying Ted Cruz is responsible for all his supporters, but he has tapped into a dark strain here in the American political psyche here, and again, the most obscene, profane stuff you can imagine all from people who say they support the Constitution."" So King was primed to be one of those ""mad as hell/not gonna take it anymore"" types as Monday's deliberations began, and as the sun set in the west, it looked for all the world like he was going to finally foment a revolt. As the National Review's Jonathan Strong reported Monday evening, ""Republican moderates have apparently had enough."" King wanted a ""clean"" continuing resolution, and he was going to damn well keep the rest of the GOP caucus from adding rules to the bill by leading a gang of moderate Republicans into the breach:In what is by far their boldest stand since the GOP took control of the House in 2010, a group of them are threatening to bring down a vote on the rule for the government-funding bill scheduled for 6:30 p.m.New York representative Peter King is leading the charge, and his fellow New Yorker [Representative] Michael Grimm is close behind him. The group told leadership on Saturday they have 25 members who are willing to bring down the rule.This was a significant rump, taking this ""boldest stand."" As Politico reported, ""If no Democrats vote for the rule, [Speaker of the House John] Boehner can only lose 17 Republicans to sink the plan."" And so, the battle was joined, and as night fell across the District of Columbia, everyone who wanted the insanity to end turned their hopeful eyes to the vote count in the House. Would King bring 25 votes against dirtying up the continuing resolution?As it turns out, King overestimated the number in his band of brothers by... you know, about 23 people:The size of a bloc of GOP moderates ready to bring down a vote on the House floor over the government-funding bill shriveled from 25 lawmakers on Saturday to just two when the House voted just now to pass the rule.New York representative Peter King and Pennsylvania representative Charlie Dent, two key moderates, voted no, while four hardline conservatives, including Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, voted no because the bill didn’t draw a hard enough line against Obamacare.Well done, lads. Ha, ha, remember that whole ""fellow New Yorker Michael Grimm is close behind him"" part? That was really neat.There's not a whole lot to say about a plan that nobody should have believed was going to come to fruition anyway. But it's worth pointing out that when the political media holds forth on the ideological landscape of Congress, and games out what they believe is possible in terms of bargains and compromises, just about everything in their conceptual framework is premised on the notion that a lot of moderate Republicans exist, and that the resting state of Capitol Hill is ""center-right.""As it turns out, all of those premises are wrong. There aren't a lot of ""moderate Republicans"" in Congress. And those who exist are very timid and nearly useless when the chips are down. The government is shut down right now, but the notion that ""moderate Republicans"" were capable of steering a debate somewhere sensible went by the boards a long time ago.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

Chairman Ben Bernanke said last month that the Fed would slow its bond purchases later this year and end them next year if the economy continued to strengthen.But Bernanke added that if the economy weakens, the Fed could delay its pullback or even step up its bond purchases again. Several Fed members have since tried to clarify Bernanke's remarks by saying any tapering of the bond purchases would depend on the strength of the economy.

Panelists testifying on the problem and its potential solutions spoke only to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the committee's vice-chair, for the beginning of the roughly 90-minute session.The all-but-complete absence of congressional interest was first documented by National Journal reporter Niraj Chokshi, who tweeted a photo of the hearing. Shortly after the photo was posted, several other lawmakers did trickle in to participate. Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.) arrived eight minutes into the hearing. Once the hearing had been under way for 35 minutes, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) was also in attendance, according to Chokshi. Eventually Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) also joined, bringing the crowd to four.More than 4.6 million Americans have been jobless for at least 27 weeks, according to the latest job figures, a rate of 3.0 percent. That's higher than at any point since World War II, including the 2.6-percent peak during the recession of the early 1980s. The official unemployment rate currently stands at 7.6 percent, down from 10.0 percent at the recession's darkest moments, although much of the reduction has been due to people leaving the workforce -- simply giving up hope of finding a job.Jobs advocates have continually chastised Congress for focusing on the federal budget deficit instead of the shortage of employment in the U.S., which still features more than four job seekers for every open position in the country.Senators who did not attend the hearing included Sens. Robert Casey (D-Pa.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Reps. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), John Campbell (R-Calif.), Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.), Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) also did not attend.The Joint Economic Committee is one of only a handful of congressional panels that features members of both the House and Senate. Its hearings are thinly attended at times, but the contrast between Thursday's hearing and a March 14 hearing on ""Solving The Federal Debt Crisis"" is revealing. That hearing on debt opened with five members of Congress in attendance, including three Democrats and two Republicans. Over the course of the nearly two-hour session, several other members of the committee filed in.Kevin Hassett, the author of Dow 36,000, which predicted a fantastic rise in equities before two subsequent crashes, said he wasn't surprised. ""There are often moments like that at hearings. Very few are ever heavily attended. People came in late, after the picture, I suppose,"" he told HuffPost.At the hearing, Klobuchar presented a study indicating that long-term unemployment is disproportionately affecting young workers, black and Hispanic workers, and workers with lower levels of education. The study is in keeping with other work that shows the economic recovery has been far better for some groups than others. The wealthiest 1 percent of households have received 106 percent of the gains since the recession bottomed out.Dr. Harry J. Holzer, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, said by the time he testified at about 11 a.m., two senators -- Klobuchar and Murphy -- were in the room. ""There were people in the audience,"" he said, noting that Klobuchar sounded motivated on the subject. ""That can make it worth it,"" he added. ""If one senator sponsors a bill with some of your information, that's a pretty big reward for your effort.""Holzer testified about the various hardships that the long-term unemployed faced and the differences between older unemployed citizens and younger unemployed citizens. He proposed wage insurance for people who transition from manufacturing jobs to jobs with lesser pay, having the federal government pitch in to make up the difference. Holzer said he has testified before Congress 15 times over the years, and there is always a risk of a low turnout.Keith Hall, a senior research scholar at the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center, is a former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner who testified at the hearing. ""It's disappointing, I have to say,"" he told HuffPost about the attendance. ""It is a little bit disappointing, because you'd really like to see a more engaged discussion, and it would be nice to see that both sides were there and both sides were talking."" Hall said that attendance was low probably because Congress isn't doing anything about long-term unemployment. With no bills to choose from, there's little value in becoming educated on the issue. The lack of interest may also be a consequence of the slow start to the year for the House of Representatives, which held just one markup session legislation on any topic in the first eight weeks of 2013.""They're talking about the problem and they're looking for solutions, but there's really no hard proposal on the table,"" said Hall, ""so while this is informative and helpful, they're not dealing with some proposal where they're close to working on something.""Congress is a long way off, Hall said. ""I think it's good this is hitting their radar screen, but there's a lot of work to go to get the economy back in shape and get the long-term unemployed back in shape, and they need more than just a hearing a two,"" he said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article indicated that Sen. Klobuchar had been alone for the first half hour of the session. She was joined by Sen. Murphy after 8 minutes alone."

The president pitched a refinancing plan for mortgages, a long-term fix to student loans, worker training programs, and a renewed focus on manufacturing jobs and infrastructure repair. Speaking at Knox College, he called on Congress to offer constructive input on all these fronts.""Over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse.

""The good news is, a growing number of Republican senators are trying to get things done, like an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars.

America, he added, had to make new investments such as ""rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, [and] upgrading our transportation and information networks.""The speech, which is one of several that the White House has planned, was pitched as a pivot of sorts back to economic issues after months of focus on other items -- from the legislative (gun control) to the headline-grabbers (the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS). The setting itself was meant to be an emotional springboard. The president had delivered the commencement address at Knox College as a senator in 2005, an address that he and his advisers have routinely cited as the best distillation of his economic principles.But it was impossible to not place the speech in a broader political context. It was being delivered, in part, to pre-frame upcoming fights, rather than help win current ones. The late summer months have been a notoriously tough part of the political calendar for the president -- from health care town halls in 2009, to the lead-up of the 2010 elections, to the debt ceiling standoff in 2011. And advisers to the president acknowledge that they are keen to avoid getting caught flat-footed again. Their efforts have even greater urgency considering that several major battles with congressional Republicans are on the horizon.The government must pass a budget by the end of September. Lawmakers must also figure out what to do with the spending cuts caused by sequestration or risk having them become even larger in the next fiscal year. Negotiations on the latter are virtually non-existent, while both sides remain far apart on the former. As The New York Times reported on Wednesday, congressional Republicans are crafting spending bills that would ""gut"" the president's top priorities.The most ominous legislative showdown, however, appears to once again involve the raising of the debt ceiling. A small number of Senate Republicans have insisted that there be no increase if it includes any money whatsoever to fund the president's health care law.So far, other Republicans have declined to join that chorus. ""I don't support that,"" Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told MSNBC on Wednesday. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), meanwhile, has warned his colleagues not to play political games with the faith and credit of the U.S. government.But the pressure is mounting. The Club for Growth, a top conservative campaign group, asked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to sign on to a letter promising not to fund Obamacare as part of any debt ceiling agreement.Over in the House, meanwhile, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has said that he will not ""raise the debt ceiling without real cuts in spending,"" a mantra that preceded a similar showdown in 2011. Boehner has alternatively said he would not allow the country to default -- making it hard to gauge how serious a threat this truly is -- but Politico, citing Republican sources, reported Tuesday night that ""there are loads of GOP lawmakers who are perfectly willing to gamble with default.""""We’ve seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest they wouldn’t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up – a fiasco that harmed a fragile recovery in 2011, and one we can’t afford to repeat,"" Obama said. ""Then, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel – by cutting programs we don’t need, fixing ones we do, and making government more efficient – this same group has insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that has cost jobs, harmed growth, hurt our military, and gutted investments in American education and scientific and medical research that we need to make this country a magnet for good jobs.""The latest estimates have the debt ceiling being hit roughly around the end of October.

While it remains to be seen whether the bill will make it through Congress, many states are not waiting to take action.Five states have passed measures to raise the minimum wage this year, according to data published by the National Conference of State Legislators. Only one of these states, California, has passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the states with the highest minimum wages.(Click here to read the eight states with the highest minimum wages)Whether or not a higher minimum wage is good for the economy continues to be the subject of debate. The National Employment Law Project (NELP), which advocates raising the minimum wage, maintains that the decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage “has contributed to the growth of income inequality over the past three decades.”Other groups maintain that raising the minimum wage is bad for business and jobs. The Heritage Foundation notes that if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, the combined costs of wages, employer penalties for not paying health insurance and taxes “would raise the minimum cost of hiring a full-time worker to $12.71 per hour.”24/7 Wall St. A state’s cost of living may influence its minimum wage. The cost of living in six of the eight states with a minimum wage over $8 an hour is higher than the nationwide cost of living. In Connecticut, where the minimum wage is currently $8.25, the cost of living is the fourth highest in the nation. The cost of living is similarly high in California, Massachusetts and Vermont.Another factor keeping the minimum wage high in these states likely involves labor representation. Among these eight states, only Nevada is a “right to work state,” meaning workers cannot be required to join a union or pay for a union’s costs as a condition of employment.Many states where current minimum wages are among the nation’s highest also have high union membership. In Washington, which currently has the nation’s highest minimum wage, 18.5% of workers are union members, fourth highest nationally. Among private sector workers, five of the eight states had among the 10 highest union membership.Based on information provided by the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the eight states with a minimum wage above $8 per hour. Additional figures on the cost of living in various states are from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC). Data on union membership by state are from the Union Membership and Coverage Database for 2012. Figures on poverty, income and income inequality as of 2012 are from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Unemployment rates are as of October 2013, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.These are the eight states with the highest minimum wages, according to 24/7 Wall St.:

The October jobs report, which was originally scheduled to be released on Nov. 1, was delayed a week by the 16-day government shutdown last month.The AP reports:The Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate rose to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent in September, likely because furloughed federal workers were counted as unemployed. The report noted that the shutdown did not affect total jobs.Employers also added 60,000 more jobs in the previous two months than earlier estimated.The figures show hiring has picked up in the fall. Employers added an average of 202,000 jobs from August through October, up from 146,000 from May through July.Stock futures fell after the report was released at 8:30 a.m. EDT, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose. That suggests investors are worried that the better job numbers will prompt the Federal Reserve to pull back on its stimulus efforts sooner than expected.One troubling detail in the report: the percentage of Americans working or looking for work fell to a fresh 35-year low. But that figure was likely distorted by the shutdown, too.About 800,000 government workers were furloughed for all or part of the shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 through Oct. 16. Many were counted as unemployed and on temporary layoff for purposes of the unemployment rate.But the furloughed workers were still counted as employed by the government's survey that counts jobs because they were ultimately paid for their time off. Federal government jobs fell only 12,000 last month.Some reports have hinted that hiring was improving. Retail stores, shipping companies, and other services firms stepped up hiring in October, according to private survey of service firms.And the number of people seeking unemployment benefits has fallen back to pre-recession levels after four weeks of declines. Unemployment benefit applications are a proxy for layoffs. The steady decline suggests companies are cutting fewer jobs.Economic growth accelerated in the July-September quarter to an annual rate of 2.8 percent, the government said Thursday. That's up from 2.5 percent in the April-June quarter.But greater restocking by businesses drove much of the increase, a trend that may not be sustainable. Consumers and businesses both cut back on spending over the summer. Check back for additional updates.

9311	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/08/gop-wall-street-bill_n_3542999.html	News	1	Economy	None	SomewhatPositive	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved an agriculture budgeting bill last month that would significantly restructure the U.S. bank regulatory regime as part of a GOP effort to protect Wall Street's offshore trading in derivatives -- the complex financial products at the heart of the 2008 economic meltdown.Republicans in Congress have been pressuring regulators for years to exempt derivatives that U.S. companies sell overseas from the new rules set by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. For much of 2013, the deregulatory drive enjoyed bipartisan support in the House, with lawmakers casting their efforts as an attempt to harmonize U.S. law with international regulations. But financial reform advocates have attacked the initiative for padding Wall Street profits at the expense of important public protections, and Democratic support has eroded.In June, the House passed a bill that would completely exempt from U.S. oversight derivatives sold through the nine most popular foreign derivatives jurisdictions. The legislation is occasionally derided as the ""London Whale Loophole Act"" on Capitol Hill -- a reference to the overseas trades that cost JPMorgan Chase more than $6 billion in 2012. London was the epicenter of much of the derivatives trading by U.S. financial firms leading up the 2008 crash, including AIG's infamous Financial Products division. If banks can simply route trades through loosely regulated overseas affiliates, financial reform advocates warn, the most critical aspects of Dodd-Frank will be effectively nullified.The ""London Whale Loophole Act"" faces opposition from Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama, so it's unlikely to be signed into law. But June's House Agriculture Committee funding bill has much stronger prospects for passage, since it's tied to approximately $19 billion in other spending. That bill would require the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -- the agency with responsibility for more than 90 percent of the derivatives market -- to negotiate its regulations with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the remainder of the derivatives business.Big banks have railed against the CFTC guidelines for taking a broad view of what constitutes an American firm. The SEC's proposed rule, by contrast, would bar American regulators from overseeing many offshore partnerships run by U.S. firms, and many trades between U.S. firms and overseas companies. Forcing the CFTC to negotiate with the SEC would almost certainly introduce loopholes into the CFTC's rules, and may shut down the rulemaking process altogether.  ""The House bill is nothing more than a backdoor way of killing derivatives reform,"" said Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets. ""It's Christmas in July for Wall Street.""  Prior to Dodd-Frank, derivatives trades were essentially secret deals between two companies, with no market or regulatory scrutiny. The 2010 law required companies to trade through a third party that guaranteed each side’s ability to make good on its bets. To buttress the guarantee, each side of the trade was required to post margin -– a small upfront deposit just in case the trade went bad. An offshoring loophole would allow firms to evade these requirements, provided they meet the technical definitions of the loophole.  While Wall Street has pursued multiple avenues to derail the CFTC’s rule, some Senate Democrats cautioned that even the more aggressive regulatory interpretation may ultimately undermine the essence of Dodd-Frank.  Eight Democratic senators, organized by Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.), on Wednesday signed a letter to CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and SEC Chairman Mary Jo White stating that both the CFTC and the SEC have failed to deal with shadowy financial entities “sponsored” by U.S. banks without any explicit legal guarantee for their obligations.  This type of arrangement was common in the years leading up to the 2008 crash. Citigroup held nearly $50 billion in complex derivatives off its official balance sheet in so-called structured investment vehicles, and Bear Stearns operated risky hedge funds that it officially had no financial obligations to. The financial crisis began in August 2007 when two such Bear Stearns funds failed, and the company decided to pay off its investors rather than take the damage to its reputation from leaving clients out to dry. By the fall of 2008, Citi had decided to suck up its losses on structured investment vehicles, rather than signal to the market it was incapable of doing so.""A U.S.-based firm should not be able to escape U.S.-mandated swaps oversight simply because its swaps trading is conducted through an offshore affiliate or branch,"" the letter from the Democratic senators reads.

But it erupted in public view on the Senate floor this week as Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) revealed their displeasure with their junior colleagues.The tea partiers -- primarily Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Rand Paul (Ky.), Mike Lee (Utah) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) -- are blocking the Senate from appointing conferees to a conference committee with the House to work out the radical differences between the two budgets each side has passed.That is often done in the Senate by unanimous consent. Other times, there are votes instructing conferees on how to try to shape the final bill. But the conservative cohorts want more. They are demanding that the Senate bar the conference members from doing anything that would raise the federal debt limit -- a demand that McCain lambasted for much of the week as unprecedented.The debate intensified Wednesday, when McCain charged that the tea party members' opposition amounted to distrust of the House GOP leadership. And Cruz admitted it did. ""Let me be clear. I don't trust the Republicans,"" he said, lumping them in with Democrats.But McCain has held his ground, suggesting on Thursday that senators who object to conference negotiations don't understand ""how business has been done"" in Congress. Moreover, McCain asserted that most GOP senators agree with him that it's time to stop stalling and go to conference.Most senators asked by The Huffington Post said they do agree with McCain.""I think it's a good idea to get a commitment not to raise the debt limit, but I trust the normal course of business -- that we're not going to use reconciliation to raise the debt limit,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told HuffPost. ""We can have a motion to instruct our conferees not to raise the debt limit by 51 votes, so I'm fine with going to conference.""""People have strong feelings, and that's what it's all about,"" Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) explained of the tea party conservatives. ""But myself personally, I would very much like to see this resolved very quickly so that we can go to conference. I would like to see us appoint conferees.""Even Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), a deficit hawk and the top Republican on the Budget Committee who said he understood the concerns over raising the debt limit, pointed out that the ultimate goal was to iron out differences through regular order.""I think the right thing to do is get ourselves to conference,"" Sessions told HuffPost. ""Eventually we need to go forward and reach an agreement, the president needs to be engaged, and a conference provides an opportunity to do that.""""I think there ought to be discussion, but ultimately we have to go to conference,"" said Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.).Some senators said they found the stall tactics to be political grandstanding.""It's all a political game,"" Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) told HuffPost, adding that he supported regular order. ""This is a slowdown because the House wants a slowdown. As soon as the House doesn't want the slowdown, it will get released.""Coburn's comments are oddly in line with recent arguments used by Democrats in the budget fight. House Republicans spent four years calling for regular order while berating the Senate for failing to pass a budget. When the Senate finally passed its budget resolution in March, Republicans were suddenly reluctant to convene a conference committee, even though without one, there can be no formal federal budget for the fifth year in a row.Indeed, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Thursday he's had ""private conversations this week on how we might move ahead, but we've not made any decisions at this point.""Even some kindred conservatives in the House, however, said they would like to see the budget finished.""These guys are blood brothers. I love 'em. In fact I would suggest to you, in all deference to Sen. McCain, they're far more in line with the rank-and-file members of the House than Sen. McCain is,"" Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost. ""That's probably an understatement.""But Franks suggested that the best way to convince people in the long run was play by the rules, and keep making the argument. House leaders, he said, had to keep their eye on the bigger picture of what is possible, even if Franks disagrees.""I understand the equation they're dealing with is almost untenable, mathematically,"" Franks said. ""If they do what people like me would like them to do, sometimes we end up, because we're so outnumbered, not being able to sustain that.""And even though the tea partiers' fears may be realized, Franks said he thinks the process should proceed.""What we have to do, still in a regular order situation, is to get the strongest thing that we can from the Senate that's the best for the country possible and do the same in the House, and then hope that the respective leaderships appoint the people that can sustain the best outcome possible,"" Franks said. ""If we have the right people on our conference side, I wouldn't be afraid of that at all.""McCain said he couldn't speak for his colleagues in the House, but pointed out that the same group of senators threatened to filibuster the debate on gun control legislation and were ultimately convinced not to block debate.""Any small group of senators can object to moving to conference on any piece of legislation because they object to their provision not being included in it?"" McCain said in a brief hallway interview. ""That would be a dreadful precedent to set in the United States Senate.""Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate GOP conference, was confident the matter would be resolved. He told HuffPost his colleagues had a ""legitimate fear"" over the debt limit, but stressed the need to figure out a path forward.""Obviously we want to see a continued debate about the budget,"" Thune said. ""I think that's good for us, because we've been talking about debt, spending and taxes. I think those are good arguments for Republicans."""

The average household's monthly benefit from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will drop by $20 or $25, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington think tank. ""The general public doesn't realize it,"" Celia Cole, CEO of the Texas Food Bank Network, told The Huffington Post on Monday. ""We certainly know the low income people on SNAP don't know the cut is coming."" Cole's organization is publicizing the cut with a countdown clock. On Monday the clock indicated there are 94 days ""until every SNAP (food stamps) household in America gets a little hungrier.""But Congress has little appetite for intervention, as the consensus among lawmakers is not whether food stamps should be reduced, but by how much. The November reduction is happening separately from the debate over cutting food stamps as part of a broader farm bill. The cut is set to kick in because a 13 percent benefit boost from the 2009 stimulus bill is expiring. Initially, the plan was to let inflation catch up with the increase so that SNAP recipients would never see a month-to-month dollar decline.But in 2010, Senate Democrats and the Obama administration needed money to offset the cost of a series of spending bills. They said at the time they would replace the money later, but they never did. Congressional attitudes toward food stamp recipients have only gotten less generous since then. The $668 maximum monthly benefit for a family of four will fall to $643, according to the Center on Budget's Stacy Dean and Dottie Rosenbaum. (The average household's monthly benefit is $287.)""This cut will be the equivalent of taking away 14 meals per month for a family of four, or 11 meals for a family of three,"" Dean and Rosenbaum wrote in a May report. The pair said that states should make sure recipients know when the cut is around the corner. First and foremost, Cole said her mission is to get the word out in Texas. Her organization represents 21 food banks serving all parts of the state. Cole also wants members of Congress to feel some pressure. ""I want them to not be able to do it without feeling the shame that they're doing something wrong,"" she said.  "

The GOP wants to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program so that more recipients must be working or in training to qualify for food stamps. ""Newscasts tell stories of young surfers who aren’t working, but cash their food stamps in for lobster,"" the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) has said in background documents explaining the proposals to reporters.The newscasts in question are two Fox News stories about one 29-year-old California food stamp recipient who harbors no ambition to get a job. “This is the way I want to live and I don’t really see anything changing,” the man said in the stories, copies of which Fox distributed to Capitol Hill offices. “It’s free food; it’s awesome.”Just wanting a job wouldn't be awesome enough to satisfy Republicans' proposed rules, however. While merely seeking work fulfills a requirement of unemployment insurance, SNAP recipients would have to do better. ""If you’re looking for work but can’t find it, and you can’t find a place in a work or training program -- something only a few states make available to all of these individuals -- you will lose SNAP after three months,"" Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget Priorities said in a Wednesday blog post. The Center on Budget has been the foremost critic of the legislation outside of Congress. Able-bodied adults without children would be eligible for only three months of benefits under the GOP plan unless they're working, training, or volunteering 20 hours per week -- a pre-existing requirement that most states have waived because of high unemployment. Republicans have cited Congressional Research Service data showing that able-bodied adults without dependents had risen to 10.2 percent of the overall SNAP population in 2011, up from 6.6 percent in 2007. Overall SNAP enrollment surged to 47 million in 2012 because the Great Recession and its aftermath made more Americans poor enough to qualify. Republicans prefer to blame liberal policy for the increase, so their bill would take the waivers away.Republicans also want states to be able to require working-age SNAP recipients with children older than one year to obey the work requirements outlined in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, meaning at least 20 hours per week at a job, volunteering, or participating in a state-run training or work-search program. But the legislation doesn't require states to make space available to SNAP recipients in such a program. Since it would allow states to keep half the savings from reduced enrollment, critics like Greenstein say the bill essentially pays states to kick people off food stamps.Despite slacker stereotypes, the share of food stamp recipients who work has risen over time. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 30 percent of SNAP recipients worked in 2010, up from fewer than 20 percent in 1990. Most of the rest are either elderly, children, or disabled.The CBO has estimated that the Republican legislation would result in 3.8 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps next year and would save $39 billion over 10 years. But House Republicans are unlikely to get their way -- even if the bill passes the House on Thursday afternoon, the Democratic Senate is unlikely to accept most of its provisions, and the White House has already threatened a veto. Even without new legislation, all food stamp beneficiaries will see an across-the-board drop in the value of their benefits this November thanks to the expiration of a boost from the 2009 stimulus bill. Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) have introduced a long-shot bill to prevent the drop. The surfer in the news reports, Jason Greenslate, did not respond to a request for comment on serving as the latest in a long line of examples of no-good food stamp recipients."

Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Rep. John F. Tierney (D-Mass.), is asking Obama to fill the director spot at the FHFA with a person who will consider a loan principal reduction program to aid ""underwater"" homeowners -- those who owe more on their mortgage than their property is worth. The agency oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and is currently run by acting director Edward DeMarco.The signatories noted that there are “approximately 10.9 million residential borrowers” who are underwater on their mortgages.“It is imperative that we have a strong leader at FHFA to take on these challenges, strengthen the housing market, and promote our nation’s continued economic recovery,” the members of Congress wrote.The letter is likely to reignite calls in Washington for Obama to fire DeMarco, who assumed his position when the president’s nominee to head the agency was blocked from confirmation by the U.S. Senate.“In the three and a half years since Edward J. DeMarco was designated Acting Director of FHFA,” the press release announcing the letter noted, “questions have persisted about his repeated failure to utilize the authorities available to FHFA to promote a healthy housing finance market.”The members of Congress further painted the acting director in the letter as someone who “is not interested in obtaining real-world evidence that might contradict his pre-established views.”Last summer, DeMarco rankled administration officials and others working to stanch the national foreclosure rate when he refused a request from the Treasury Department to implement a principal reduction and debt forgiveness program for certain underwater homeowners.At the time, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner wrote DeMarco that he was “concerned by [his] continued opposition to allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) to use targeted principal reduction in their loan modification programs.” Geithner added that he did not ""believe it is the best decision for the country.""Some analysts expected that Obama would replace DeMarco through a December recess appointment. In October, the Financial Times reported that the Obama administration was ""quietly telling housing industry activists"" that there is a plan to replace DeMarco. "

The seamy details of this lobbying effort are found in a new study by the reform advocacy group Public Citizen. It is arguably one of the least-surprising studies in the history of studies, right up there with research confirming that popes tend to wear large hats. But it makes for depressing, eye-opening reading nonetheless.For one thing, there is the chart that leads off the study, showing how corporate profits have soared to all-time highs as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product, while corporate taxes are near record lows. (Story continues after Chart Of Anger, courtesy of Public Citizen.)This state of affairs exists largely because the biggest U.S. corporations have for years lobbied Congress for loopholes that allow them to keep much of their profits out of the clutches of the IRS, including an estimated $1.7 trillion in cash held offshore.Apple Inc. has been public face of this issue lately, with its CEO Tim Cook hauled before a Senate panel to explain why his company is keeping more than $100 billion offshore. Apple spent $2 million on lobbying last year and could double that this year, Reuters reported recently. The company has managed to avoid paying taxes, in perfectly legal ways, on $74 billion in profits since 2009, according to a recent Senate investigation.As you may have heard, the U.S. government has found itself in a bit of a fiscal pickle recently and could use some of this cash. That has led some lawmakers to try to find ways to close some of these loopholes. Two bills, the Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes Act and the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, have aimed to do just that. A third bill, the Wall Street Trading and Speculators Tax Act, would slap taxes on some financial transactions -- not a loophole-closing bill, exactly, but one that would help address the fact that the U.S. financial sector currently makes up 30 percent of total corporate profits, but only coughs up 18 percent of total corporate tax revenues to the government.Some reform-minded groups are lobbying in favor of these bills, notes Public Citizen. But they are being drowned out by the lobbying in the other direction.Of the 383 lobbyists working over lawmakers on these bills, 331 were from companies or corporate trade groups opposed to them, by Public Citizen's count.Meanwhile, the companies and groups lobbying on these bills are represented by 46 different political action committees that donated money to lawmakers in the 2012 election cycle, according to Public Citizen. Of that group, 40 PACs represented corporate America and spent $20 million on their favorite candidates. The top three money-donating PACs in this group were the National Association of Realtors, the Credit Union National Association and the American Bankers Association. Individual corporate PACs included AT&T, General Electric, Pfizer and Microsoft.It's a free country, of course, and companies, like people, have the right to free speech in the form of campaign donations. But all that free speech is expensive, and these companies have a lot more money to make their case than the rest of us taxpayers -- who will almost certainly keep ending up paying the cost.

But what is sequestration exactly? Set to begin March 1 at 11:59 p.m., the sequester is a set of automatic spending cuts put into law by the Budget Control Act. Signed by President Barack Obama in August 2011, that legislation raised the debt ceiling and sought to apply pressure on Congress to come up with a longer term plan for deficit reduction.The $1.2 trillion in budget cuts would be spread over nine years and are equally divided between domestic and defense-related spending. During the remainder of the 2013 fiscal year, $85 billion worth of cuts are set to go into effect. The budget cuts would end in 2021. Why is the sequester happening? When the debt limit was raised in 2011, Republicans demanded that budget cuts be included in the legislation. The Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction -- or the ""super committee"" put in charge of figuring out how to implement the cuts called for in the Budget Control Act -- ultimately proved unable to reach a bipartisan agreement on cutting $1.2 trillion from the deficit. With the threat of automatic sequestration still looming, Congress was tasked with finding those cuts. No luck so far. So, while sequestration was never intended to actually go into effect, it now most likely will.What funding will the sequester affect? The sequester will affect government spending across the board. The military will see $550 billion in cuts, drawing funds away from national security and military operations. On the domestic side, cuts will affect health care, education, law enforcement, disaster relief, unemployment benefits, non-profit organization funds, scientific research and more. Will any funding not be affected? The sequester stipulates certain areas of government spending that will see no cuts. No money will be drawn from spending on wars and military personnel. Funding allocated for Medicaid, Social Security, Pell grants, veterans' benefits and some low-income programs will not be affected, either. Have lawmakers tried to stop the sequester? Both Democrats and Republicans are trying to figure out how to stop the sequester from going into effect, but the two parties can't agree on a plan. Senate Democrats introduced a plan titled the American Family Economic Protection Act, which identified $120 billion in savings that would replace sequester cuts until the end of December 2013. Republicans weren't in agreement on their own solution, but eventually came forward with a counterproposal that would have kept the sequester in place, but given Obama control in implementing the cuts. Both plans were ultimately voted down. This post has been updated.For more information on specific sequester cuts, see the slideshow below: "

It's absurd,"" Obama said in a press conference. The president also responded directly to Republicans who continue to argue that increasing the nation's borrowing limit only contributes to Washington's spending problem. He repeatedly emphasized that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize any new spending but simply allows the government to continue to pay for obligations to which Congress has already agreed.House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Saturday said a failure to raise the debt ceiling would result in ""financial disaster,"" but reiterated demands that the president agree to spending cuts before a vote. On Monday, Obama maintained that increasing the debt limit would not represent a concession by Republicans to Democrats, and said he simply would not give in to any demands in exchange for an extension.""They will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the economy,"" Obama said. ""The full faith and credit of the United States economy is not a bargaining chip. And they better choose quickly because time is running short. The last time Republicans in Congress even flirted with this idea, our AAA credit rating was down for the first time in our history.""The president highlighted some of the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling: a delay in Social Security checks and veterans' benefits and the inability to pay U.S. troops or honor contracts for small business owners, air traffic controllers and food inspectors. If the country failed to meet these obligations, Obama argued, investors around the world would question the credibility of the United States. ""We are not a deadbeat nation,"" Obama said. ""So there's a very simple solution to this: Congress authorizes us to pay our bills."" Republican leaders responded immediately to the president's press conference, signaling they will not relent on demands for spending cuts as part of debt ceiling talks.""The President and his allies need to get serious about spending, and the debt-limit debate is the perfect time for it,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in a statement. ""I do know that the most important issue confronting the future of our country is our deficit and debt. So we are hoping for a new seriousness on the part of the President with regard to the single biggest issue confronting the country and we look forward to working with him to do something about this huge, huge problem.""Boehner issued a similar statement, calling on Obama to reduce government spending.""The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation’s obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same,"" Boehner said.Last week, Senate Democratic leaders urged Obama to bypass Congress on raising the debt ceiling in the event of political gridlock. But the White House has been reluctant to consider a unilateral action, maintaining that the 14th Amendment -- one such proposed option -- does not give the president the authority to ignore the debt ceiling."

This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012.“The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year” said Economic Policy Institute’s Elise Gould. “We’re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.”While the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 — nearly half that of Maryland’s.Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. “We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don’t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.”States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did.Employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state’s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state’s household income. “When we’re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it’s about jobs.” Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed.“There’s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,” Danziger said. “Even when manufacturers haven’t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.”To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2012, as well as 2012 ACS data on health insurance coverage, employment and poverty.Here are America's richest states, according to 24/7 Wall St.

And it would be a stupid idea if Obama just gave back his entire salary. Which, by the way, he could do. It's not like he needs the money. In fact, the chances that the United States of America will ever elect a president who authentically needs a salary of any kind is approximately ""the null set"" for the foreseeable future.And as Alex Pareene points out, the decision to part with a small portion of a salary really doesn't make any sense from a political standpoint: ""If you are trying to convince Republicans to reverse savage government spending cuts that they have all decided that they are fine with, and you are also someone Republicans hate, cutting your own salary seems like an odd negotiating strategy,"" Pareene writes.Nevertheless, we know the impetus for this salary-giveback comes from being shouted at for months and months and months by Beltway Centrist Hacks, who honestly and authentically believe that Obama needs to make more magical gestures to secure a ""Grand Bargain."" These pundits want the GOP to give on revenues, and they're even willing to admit that Republicans are being intransigent, but they believe that this is Obama's problem to solve, and that he must solve it with a series of powerful displays of sentimental force. Obama is trying to bridge the gap by offering up substantial cuts to earned benefit programs that would impoverish elderly Americans. Impoverishing elderly Americans is also something that the Centrist Hack set desires, rather badly, but they know that this is a deal Obama would rather not have to make. And that's a huge problem for them -- Obama should want to bargain away Medicare and Social Security, with a smile on his face and a song in his heart. And until he does that, he is not showing ""leadership.""Naturally, I do not expect even this group of pundit nimrods to look with favor upon Obama's slight gesture of returning 5 percent of his salary. We can all agree that it is woefully insufficient as a means to move legislation of any kind. But it's better in one sense than anything else the ""Leadership Surrealists"" have come up with: actual money ends up in the U.S. Treasury.Looks like we are back to having a series of really awesome steak dinners to secure a ""Grand Bargain"" that will likely screw most Americans in the short pants, I guess![Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

The GOP wants to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program so that more recipients must be working or in training to qualify for food stamps. ""Newscasts tell stories of young surfers who aren’t working, but cash their food stamps in for lobster,"" the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) has said in background documents explaining the proposals to reporters.The newscasts in question are two Fox News stories about one 29-year-old California food stamp recipient who harbors no ambition to get a job. “This is the way I want to live and I don’t really see anything changing,” the man said in the stories, copies of which Fox distributed to Capitol Hill offices. “It’s free food; it’s awesome.”Just wanting a job wouldn't be awesome enough to satisfy Republicans' proposed rules, however. While merely seeking work fulfills a requirement of unemployment insurance, SNAP recipients would have to do better. ""If you’re looking for work but can’t find it, and you can’t find a place in a work or training program -- something only a few states make available to all of these individuals -- you will lose SNAP after three months,"" Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget Priorities said in a Wednesday blog post. The Center on Budget has been the foremost critic of the legislation outside of Congress. Able-bodied adults without children would be eligible for only three months of benefits under the GOP plan unless they're working, training, or volunteering 20 hours per week -- a pre-existing requirement that most states have waived because of high unemployment. Republicans have cited Congressional Research Service data showing that able-bodied adults without dependents had risen to 10.2 percent of the overall SNAP population in 2011, up from 6.6 percent in 2007. Overall SNAP enrollment surged to 47 million in 2012 because the Great Recession and its aftermath made more Americans poor enough to qualify. Republicans prefer to blame liberal policy for the increase, so their bill would take the waivers away.Republicans also want states to be able to require working-age SNAP recipients with children older than one year to obey the work requirements outlined in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, meaning at least 20 hours per week at a job, volunteering, or participating in a state-run training or work-search program. But the legislation doesn't require states to make space available to SNAP recipients in such a program. Since it would allow states to keep half the savings from reduced enrollment, critics like Greenstein say the bill essentially pays states to kick people off food stamps.Despite slacker stereotypes, the share of food stamp recipients who work has risen over time. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 30 percent of SNAP recipients worked in 2010, up from fewer than 20 percent in 1990. Most of the rest are either elderly, children, or disabled.The CBO has estimated that the Republican legislation would result in 3.8 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps next year and would save $39 billion over 10 years. But House Republicans are unlikely to get their way -- even if the bill passes the House on Thursday afternoon, the Democratic Senate is unlikely to accept most of its provisions, and the White House has already threatened a veto. Even without new legislation, all food stamp beneficiaries will see an across-the-board drop in the value of their benefits this November thanks to the expiration of a boost from the 2009 stimulus bill. Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) have introduced a long-shot bill to prevent the drop. The surfer in the news reports, Jason Greenslate, did not respond to a request for comment on serving as the latest in a long line of examples of no-good food stamp recipients."

Thousands of federal employees are facing unpaid time off as agencies determine that they will have to furlough workers to absorb the cuts. But other workers -- including some in the private sector -- are losing their jobs altogether, underscoring just how much daily life for many people is tied to a functioning government. Some examples: On Monday, 250 workers at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state received pink slips, while another 2,500 others found out they're facing furloughs. Approximately 9,000 people work at the nation's most contaminated nuclear site, and the Associated Press reports that ""cleanup is likely to be slowed"" because of the budget cuts. Continental Maritime, a contractor that repairs U.S. Navy ships, expects to lay off 185 employees, effective April 12. Other contractors have issued conditional layoff notices -- meaning that jobs are safe if Congress restores some funding to the Defense Department -- to thousands of employees.Four-hundred eighteen contract workers tied to the Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania are losing their jobs due to sequestration. Two-hundred sixteen people will be dismissed on April 15 and 107 on April 30, the Morning Call of Allentown, Pa., reports. The paper noted that the Tobyhanna Army Depot is losing 35 percent -- $309 million -- of its government funding through the end of the fiscal year, and that more than 5,100 of the people who work there are being forced to take 22 furlough days.At least eight municipal employees in Monterey County, Calif., are losing their jobs as a result of a decrease in the number of military contracts. In early March, 23 people who work with the parks and recreation and maintenance departments in Tooele County, Utah, were laid off in order to grapple with the federal budget cuts. ""I have four kids. This is my livelihood,” said Scott Chance, a 12-year employee. ""It pays my health insurance. It gives me my house.""Engineering Services Network is an engineering and technology company and one of the top Latino-owned companies in Virginia. President and CEO Raymond Lopez Jr. told NBC Latino that he has ""lost about 20 employees through sequestration.""The Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas, announced in February that it was cutting 414 jobs -- about 10 percent of its workforce. ""I don't know how we're going to make it,"" Raymond Wyrick, whose last day was scheduled to be March 9, told CNN Money.While people around the country deal with these furloughs, job losses and a reduction in government services like unemployment benefits and funding for domestic violence prevention, much of the debate in Washington continues to center around the fact that the White House is no longer offering tours and the Easter Egg Roll could be called off. Congress is now working on a continuing resolution to keep the government running when the current funding runs out on March 27. It's expected to keep in place the $85 billion in sequestration cuts -- meaning workers may still face furloughs -- although federal agencies will likely get more flexibility in how to absorb those cuts. *** HuffPost Readers: Have the federal budget cuts kicking in this month had an impact on you specifically or on your community?

Werfel, who currently serves as the controller of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also worked with the Bush administration.""Throughout his career working in both Democratic and Republican administrations, Danny has proven an effective leader who serves with professionalism, integrity and skill,"" Obama said in an emailed statement. ""The American people deserve to have the utmost confidence and trust in their government, and as we work to get to the bottom of what happened and restore confidence in the IRS, Danny has the experience and management ability necessary to lead the agency at this important time.""WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will appoint a new acting commissioner to the Internal Revenue Service this week, a senior administration official confirmed to The Huffington Post.The news comes a day after the president announced the departure of acting commissioner Steven Miller, as the tax agency has become engulfed in scandal for targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status leading up to the 2012 election. ""It is important to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward,"" Obama said Wednesday in a statement. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew requested Miller's resignation after a Treasury Department inspector general's report released earlier this week found that lower-level IRS staff acted out of incompetence by subjecting groups applying for 501(c)(4) status to greater scrutiny if they had words like ""tea party"" in their names. The report also found that the targeting was not politically motivated, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for a firm response from the president.Obama said he had directed Lew to continue investigating the IRS and pledged to ""work with Congress as it performs its oversight role"" in the process.Some Republicans have argued that dismissing Miller is not enough, given that the acting commissioner had already been planning to leave his post in June. Nonetheless, it was influential Republican lawmakers such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) who initially demanded Miller's resignation.At a press conference Thursday, the president rejected calls for a special counsel to investigate the agency.""I think that it's going to be sufficient for us to be working with Congress. They've got a whole bunch of committees,"" Obama said, pointing out the IG had produced a report and conducted an audit. He added that Attorney General Eric Holder had also announced a criminal investigation into what happened. ""Between those investigations, I think we're going to be able to figure out exactly what happened, who was involved, what went wrong, and we're going to be able to implement steps to fix it,"" Obama said. ""That, ultimately, is the main priority that I have, but also I think the American people have.""Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the second-ranking Democrat in the House, told HuffPost on Wednesday that the administration had acted swiftly and appropriately amid the controversy. ""It was good the president said there's going to be accountability and responsibility,"" Hoyer said. ""And the guy who's the head, like the coach, takes the responsibility. I think it was the appropriate action.""Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.This article has been updated with information about events leading up to Miller's resignation, and with comment from Hoyer and further comment from the president."

Members leaving a closed-door meeting said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told them talks with President Barack Obama on how to end the government shutdown and avert the looming Oct. 17 deadline to raise the nation's borrowing cap, had reached a dead end. There was also concern that the White House might strike a deal with Senate Republicans, who presented their own plan to Obama on Friday. Many lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), said it was now up to their colleagues in the Senate to hold firm so that Republicans in both chambers would appear united.""I'm disappointed that the president has rejected the offer that we put on the table,"" Cantor told reporters after the meeting. ""I know that he's trying to see which Republican senator he can pick off in the Senate. I hope that the Senate Republicans stand strong so we can speak with one voice.""House Republicans had put forward a proposal to extend the debt limit for six weeks and work quickly to reopen the government, if the president agreed to a broader framework for deficit reduction. They presented the plan to Obama in a meeting at the White House Thursday evening. Both sides said afterward that discussions would continue, though neither the White House nor GOP leadership said they were close to a deal.Members suggested both sides wanted to keep the appearance of potential for progress, even though Obama rejected their plan in a phone call with Boehner on Friday.Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) paraphrased Boehner's message to the conference as, ""Every offer we've made, they've just turned us down.""He added it was a ""White House talking point"" that the two sides were still talking.""What [Boehner's] really saying is, 'I'm not shutting the door on further discussions, but right now nothing is happening',"" he said.Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) said the White House requested that House leadership ""stick with the line that talks were proceeding."" ""That line was continued, and then late yesterday afternoon, the president called and they declined every part of the offer,"" he said.An aide to Boehner declined comment.Price said while there was concern over Obama's negotiations with Senate Republicans, he didn't think their plan would pass the upper chamber. Sources told The Huffington Post that a bipartisan group of 10 senators, five from each party, are ironing out the details of a plan floated by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). It would reportedly fund the government through March, raise the debt ceiling through January, give federal agencies flexibility to manage across-the-board cuts caused by sequestration, and delay Obamacare's medical device tax by two years.""I think the timing on that is challenging,"" Price said. ""We want to get back to a regular order process where we're doing appropriations bills and putting Congress' stamp of priorities on the spending of this government.""""We hope that our Senate Republican colleagues stand with us united to force the president to have a conversation,"" he added.Conservative House members outright rejected the Collins' plan and were skeptical it would pass the Senate, let alone the House.""The idea that Susan Collins can dictate what happens in the Senate is kind of silly,"" Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) said. ""They can negotiate all day long, but obviously at the end of the day it has to pass the House."" Fleming said the plan was dead on arrival in the House. ""They're not going to get that, because we're not going to support it,"" he said.UPDATE: 2:05 p.m. -- Senate Democratic leadership rejected the Collins plan Saturday afternoon. A senior Democratic aide said the proposal is pretty unpopular among most Democrats, for two reasons: It locks in the current level of sequestration, minus another $20 billion in 2014, and it makes changes to Obamacare.""Why would Dems ever support that?"" asked the aide. ""It's crazy that it got this far.""Negotiations are now in the hands of Senate leaders Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said McConnell requested a meeting with Reid, and that the two sat down with Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn) in Reid's office Saturday morning to hash out a way forward.The contours of a deal were far from apparent, but Jentleson added both the White House and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) office were ""fully engaged"" as talks progressed.Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting."
9749	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/federal-minimum-wage_n_3641162.html	News	0	Economy	None	Positive	Negative	huffingtonpost.com	WASHINGTON -- Workers toiling in low-wage jobs marked a dispiriting anniversary on Wednesday: It's now been four years since the last time the federal minimum wage was raised.The minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour, and it prevails in the 30 states that don't already mandate a higher one. The last time it saw a boost was on July 24, 2009, when it was raised from $6.55. That 70-cent raise marked the last in a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush.Since then, the legal wage floor has held steady, even as the cost of living has continued to rise. A full-time worker earning the minimum wage now pulls in a salary of about $15,000 per year, far below a living wage in most parts of the country.President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats have proposed raising the minimum wage and pegging it to inflation, though House Republicans are unlikely to go along with such a hike any time soon. Bills to raise the minimum wage, introduced in the House and Senate earlier this year, have not been voted on by their respective committees. Republican leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), have deemed a minimum-wage raise a job killer. (House Republicans have already voted down a version of the minimum wage raise that was inserted as an amendment to a workforce training bill.)Labor groups supporting a minimum wage boost planned demonstrations in an estimated 30 cities across the country on Wednesday, calling the four-year lapse reason alone for a raise. According to organizers, the protests would target low-wage employers who've seen employee strikes in recent months, including Walmart and McDonald's. A group of companies that back the Democratic proposal, called Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, launched a petition Wednesday for businesses to pledge their support for a raise. Over the decades, the minimum wage has gone for spells longer than four years before seeing a raise, according to the Labor Department. The wage floor remained stagnant for a full 10 years leading up to the first increase late in Bush's tenure, in 2007. And during the early 1990s, the minimum wage stood at $4.25 for more than five years before being raised under President Bill Clinton.But if Congress doesn't send Obama legislation to sign by the end of his second term, he will be the first president since Ronald Reagan who didn't raise the minimum wage at all.Back on the campaign trail in 2008, Obama stumped for hiking the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011 and pegging it to inflation in perpetuity. That raise never came, however, and the president proposed a more modest boost to $9.00 during his State of the Union address earlier this year. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) soon rolled out their own, more ambitious proposal, which by 2015 would raise the minimum wage to $10.10, closer to its historical high in the late 1960s.The proposals by both the president and congressional Democrats include one pivotal measure -- the tying of the minimum wage to an inflation index. Ten states have already undertaken this change, choosing to automatically reset the minimum wage each year rather than wrangle politically over a new raise every few years. If Congress adopted an inflation index, the purchasing power of the minimum wage wouldn't erode as it has for the past four years.According to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, Americans broadly support the idea of raising the minimum wage and pegging it to inflation, with 62 percent of Americans saying it should be boosted to $9. Obama's proposal was supported by a huge majority of Democrats in the poll (86 percent to 6 percent) and a majority of independents (56 percent to 28 percent). Fifty-two percent of Republicans, however, opposed the proposal, compared to 36 percent who supported it.

Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, on Friday.Rogers, whose committee is effectively short-circuited by the three-month stopgap bill, said almost nothing about the Affordable Care Act, but House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) made clear that the main point of the measure is to block the health care law.""This resolution will also protect the working middle class from the devastating effects of Obamacare,"" said Cantor. ""Let's defund this law now, and protect the American people from the economic calamity that we know Obamacare will create.""The vote marked the 42nd time that the House Republican conference has said yes to gutting Obamacare. While some tweaks have been made to the program, the Senate has ignored nearly everything the House has pushed for.Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.), who faces reelection in a district that Obama carried in 2012, was the only Republican to vote against the bill. Rigell has bucked his party on fiscal matters before; he appeared with the president at an event in February opposing sequestration and even took a ride aboard Air Force One.Rigell released a statement in which he said he agreed that Obamacare should be defunded, but couldn't support a bill that would set government spending levels at sequester levels.""This [continuing resolution] fails to address the sequester that is negatively impacting those who wear our nation’s uniform and is the result of Congress' inability to pass the 12 appropriations bills necessary to properly fund the government on time,"" Rigell said. ""What is needed is a comprehensive solution to our nation’s fiscal challenges, including a replacement for sequestration."" On the Democratic side, Reps. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.) were the only two lawmakers to vote in favor of the bill. The blue dog Democrats have often voted across party lines in the past.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) slammed the bill in a floor speech ahead of the vote, saying that the measure ""was designed to shut down the government.""""It could have no other intent. Its purpose is clear,"" Pelosi said. ""It is a wolf in wolf's clothing.""""Either you don't know what you are doing, or this is one of the most intentional acts of brutality that you have cooked up, with stiff competition for that honor,"" she added, while underscoring the damaging effects the bill would have on a program that provides health insurance to more than 8 million moderate-income children.The continuing resolution would not only permanently strip the Affordable Care Act of its funding, but would lock in government spending at sequester levels that conflict with the budget passed in the Senate. It also sets up another potentially even more consequential showdown over the nation's debt limit, by including the so-called Full Faith and Credit Act, a measure that Republicans say would allow the Treasury Department to still pay the nation's creditors, and therefore avoid a default, if the debt limit, now at $16.7 trillion, is not raised sometime next month.Democrats have dubbed that measure the ""Pay China First Act,"" pointing out that it would prioritize payments to U.S. bondholders, which include many foreign governments like China, while obligations such as Medicare and military benefits would be placed on the backburner.While leaders such as Cantor insisted that the legislation was responsible, many members of his own party, including more than a dozen senators, have called the move ""foolish"" and ""dumb.""Even Rogers seemed aware of the potential pitfalls of the stratagem.""I'd like to remind my colleagues … both in the House and the other body that a government shutdown is a political game in which everyone loses,"" Rogers said. ""It shirks one of our most basic duties as members of Congress, and it puts our national security at stake. To be clear, if this legislation is not enacted and we embark on a government shutdown, the consequences are severe.""""Our brave men and women in uniform don't get paid, our recovering economy will take a huge hit,"" he added. ""A government shutdown, even the illusion of the threat of a shutdown, says to the American people that this Congress does not have their best interests at heart.""This story has been updated with the names of those House lawmakers who did not vote with their party on the stopgap funding bill."

The last one, as I understand it, was yesterday,"" Reid told reporters on Tuesday.""All they talk about is, Mr President, what are you going to do?"" Reid said. ""He's already done things a number of people in my caucus, they're not wild about. But he's put forward his proposal. The Republicans refuse to come up with anything in writing.""Obama has offered Republicans a change in the way cost-of-living increases are calculated, using a less-generous measure of inflation, but has demanded additional tax increases on the wealthy. Many Democrats have balked at the proposal because it would effectively reduce Social Security payments to seniors in future years. TAX REVENUE ROADBLOCKMcDonough and other members of Obama's economic team are continuing to meet with the Republican group, which also includes Senators Kelly Ayotte, John Hoeven, Lindsey Graham, Bob Corker, John McCain and Tom Coburn, a senior administration official said.The official said the talks would continue, despite not yielding any results so far. To date the Republican senators have not offered specific proposals and have not agreed to put revenues on the table.""Obviously the challenge is that the administration wants $583 billion in higher taxes and that just doesn't work for us,"" said Hoeven, of North Dakota. ""Revenues should come through economic growth, not higher taxes. That's the stumbling block.""He said, however, that Obama's cost-of-living proposal shows there is room for agreement in some areas to reform benefit programs known as entitlements.A more immediate problem for Congress, however, will be reconciling deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans over spending on discretionary programs ranging from education to the military, and replacing the across-the-board sequester cuts with savings elsewhere.If these issues can't be resolved before the end of September, the government faces a strong risk of shutting down over lack of funding as the new fiscal year gets underway on Oct. 1.Time is already running short, as Congress starts a five-week recess on Friday, and has scheduled only nine legislative days in September.Reid said Democrats were ready to negotiate any size fiscal agreement - ""a big deal, a middle-sized deal, any kind of a deal. But you can't do it unless Republicans agree.""On Wednesday, Obama will come to Capitol Hill to meet with Democrats in both the House and Senate to discuss his plans for tax reform, job growth and budget issues.

They're led once again by Washington state, which will continue to have the highest state minimum wage in the nation, at $9.32 per hour.A few cities and counties around the country will be raising their minimum wages as well, including San Francisco, which will set its at $10.74. San Francisco's base will no longer be the highest municipal minimum wage in the country, however, after voters in SeaTac, Wash., approved a ballot measure setting a $15 wage floor for an estimated 6,000 airport workers. The SeaTac minimum wage is set to go into effect Jan. 1, although it's currently being challenged in court.Most of next week's increases will come courtesy of an inflation index. Ten states have tied their minimum wages to the index, guaranteeing that they rise with the cost of living each year. Other states, such as New Jersey and Connecticut, passed legislation in 2013 that will nominally raise their minimum wages. (California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the state's minimum wage to $10 by 2016, but the first increase, to $9, won't come until July.) The federal minimum wage prevails in the 31 states that don't currently mandate a higher one. The federal rate hasn't been raised since 2009, after the last of a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush took effect. The federal minimum wage is not tied to an index, but Democrats in Congress, as well as President Barack Obama, have said that it should be. The minimum wage bill put forth by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 and peg it to inflation. Obama, who previously suggested raising the wage floor to $9 and indexing it, has since gotten on board with the $10.10 proposal from Harkin and Miller.The annual minimum wage raises in states and cities are routinely praised by low-wage worker advocates and panned by business-friendly groups. The Employment Policies Institute, a vocal critic of higher minimum wages, argued in a press release Monday that raises like the ones that will go into effect next week have ""disastrous results for the most vulnerable jobseekers."" Republicans on Capitol Hill have shown party-line opposition to the Harkin-Miller proposal, with leadership declaring a minimum wage increase a job-killer.Most voters, however, don't seem persuaded by the critics' economic arguments, as they continue to approve higher minimum wages on the local level. The idea of raising the minimum wage tends to poll extremely well, including among Republicans who are not members of Congress. Most polls show that around two-thirds of respondents support raising the federal minimum wage. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, half of Republicans who responded said it should be raised.Here are the state and local increases that will go into effect next week, as compiled by the Employment Policies Institute: Arizona: $7.80 to $7.90  Colorado: $7.78 to $8.00  Connecticut: $8.25 to $8.70  Florida: $7.79 to $7.93  Missouri: $7.35 to $7.50  Montana: $7.80 to $7.90  New Jersey: $7.25 to $8.25  New York: $7.25 to $8.00 Ohio: $7.85 to $7.95  Oregon: $8.95 to $9.10  Rhode Island: $7.75 to $8.00  Vermont: $8.60 to $8.73  Washington State: $9.19 to $9.32  Albuquerque, N.M.: $8.50 to $8.60  Bernalillo County, N.M.: $8.00 to $8.50 San Francisco, Calif.: $10.55 to $10.74  San Jose, Calif.: $10.00 to $10.15 SeaTac, Wash.: $9.19 to $15.00"

""There are not votes in the House to pass a clean CR,"" Boehner said in an interview with ABC's ""This Week."" Contrary to Boehner's claim, several House Republicans have signaled willingness to pass a bill to fund the government with no strings attached to Obamacare's funding and implementation. The Huffington Post's Jennifer Bendery reported:As of Wednesday afternoon, the number of those Republicans hit 21 -- surpassing the magic 17 votes needed to pass a clean funding bill if all 200 Democrats stick together and team up with them. Of course, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put that bill on the floor in the first place. But if he did, the votes appear to be there for passage, at which point the bill would sail through the Senate and be signed by President Barack Obama, ending the shutdown.In the ABC interview, Boehner pushed back on the vote estimates for the bill, saying negotiations still needed to happen. ""The American people expect in Washington when we have a crisis like this, that the leaders will sit down and have a conversation,"" Boehner said. ""I told my members the other day — there may be a back room somewhere, but there's nobody in it.""Boehner criticized President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for their unwillingness to budge on the CR, saying Reid is demanding ""complete surrender."" Turning toward the looming debt ceiling deadline, the House Speaker said his chamber would not pass a measure to raise the limit without an Obamacare-related provision. ""We are not going to pass a clean debt limit [bill],"" Boehner said. ""The votes are not in the House.. We are not going down that path."" Boehner added that he had no indication of when the standoff would end. ""If I knew, I'd tell you,"" he said. "

But those cuts, along with a slew of other fiscal measures enacted by Congress, amounted to a year of fiscal austerity that took money out of the economy, slowed GDP growth and cut the number of jobs that could have been created.The tightening began on the first of the year, when the ""fiscal cliff"" deal passed both houses of Congress and was signed by President Barack Obama. While the deal did stop some sharp tax increases that would have put a real drag on economic growth, it allowed the payroll tax holiday to expire, meaning all workers got less money in their paychecks. Predictions made around the time the deal was crafted estimated it would shave between 0.4 and 0.6 percent off of GDP growth in 2013.That deal delayed sequestration cuts for two months, and they began on March 1. The plan mandated $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts until Oct. 1. The cuts damaged the public defender system, stalled cancer research and cut scientific research. The cuts also hit programs for the most vulnerable, including Head Start and Meals on Wheels.The economic effects of these policies are tangible. According to the most recent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, made in early 2013, sequestration was expected to cost around 750,000 jobs that would have been created or retained if not for the cuts. CBO also estimated that sequestration along with fiscal tightening would cost about 1 ¼ percentage points in growth from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013. The CBO also estimated that without sequestration, the economy would have been expected to grow faster in 2013 by about 0.6 of a percentage point.Independent research firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimated in October that budget tightening had reduced annual GDP growth by 0.7 of a percentage point since 2010 and raised the unemployment rate by 0.8 percent.Repealing the sequester would create economic dividends. Canceling sequestration would increase third quarter GDP in 2014 by 0.7 percent and increase payrolls by 0.9 million, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate from July. The budget deal signed by President Barack Obama this week replaces about a third of these draconian cuts that were scheduled -- eliminating $63 billion out of an estimated $180 billion in cuts in 2014 and 2015.On Oct. 1, Congress did not pass an appropriations bill, and the government shut down for 17 days. During that time, more than 800,000 federal workers were furloughed without pay, and nonessential federal offices were closed.Congress passed an appropriations bill funding the government at current levels on Oct. 17. Federal workers received back pay, and the government reopened. However, the shutdown had economic costs. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, it shaved off an estimated 0.25 percent of annualized GDP growth in the fourth quarter, or about $10 billion.On Nov. 1, food stamp benefits were cut by $5 billion when legislation from 2010 that reallocated funding went into effect. The cut affected 47 million Americans, and reduced the maximum benefit from 11 to 36 dollars, depending on family size. With the cut came a jump in the need at soup kitchens and food banks.The costs to the economy could be more than $5 billion -- Moody's Analytics has estimated that every additional dollar spent on food stamps generates about $1.74 in economic activity. JPMorgan Chase Chief Economist Michael Feroli estimated that the cuts could shave 0.1 of a percentage point off the annual growth rate of the nation's GDP in 2013.Despite the cuts, the economy grew at a relatively fast pace of 4.1 percent in the third quarter of 2013, up from 1.1 and 2.5 percent in the quarters before. However, the growth rate may not reflect true economic activity. As Slate's Matt Yglesias points out, real gross domestic income -- an alternative measure for GDP measuring all incomes of an economy -- grew by a much lower 1.8 percent. Plus, with all of the cuts enacted by Congress, many Americans hardly feel like the economy is getting better. Moreover, the economy remained about 3.1 percent below its potential output in 2013, according to OECD, and about 5 million jobs short of full employment, according to CBO.The cuts will continue into 2014. On Saturday, 1.3 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits, as Congress failed to extend the benefits before adjourning for the year. Federal benefits tend to kick in after state ones expire, which in most places is 26 weeks. Congress could reinstate the benefits retroactively once it returns at the beginning of next year, but recipients will at least face a lapse. The White House Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that not extending the benefits would cost 240,000 jobs in 2014. Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and JP Morgan have pegged the cost to GDP growth at 0.2 to 0.4 percent."

""That's not the case here.""In an interview with The Huffington Post, Vilsack said House Republican leadership's failure to move a farm bill, which included nearly $80 billion per year in food stamp subsidies, could pose major harm to the agriculture community.He also predicted that the GOP was harming itself politically, having spent the last election lambasting President Barack Obama as the ""Food Stamp President"" to no success.""I think the reason why they haven't been particularly successful with this argument is that maybe the American people recognize these food assistance programs are helping people who are struggling through no fault of theirs,"" Vilsack said, ""or who have worked their entire lives but are now living on a very small and meager Social Security check, or dealing with a disability that makes it very difficult if not impossible for them to work. I think Americans have understanding and compassion for these people.""Republicans in Congress disagree. Last month, GOP leadership brought to the floor a bill that would have cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by more than $20 billion and given states leeway to drug test recipients. To the surprise of leadership itself, the measure failed to pass, as conservative Republicans argued the cuts weren't deep enough and that the rest of the bill represented a giveaway to agribusiness. Democrats, for their part, said the food stamp cuts went too far and only a handful of them ended up supporting the legislation. It's the second consecutive year the traditional alliance between urban and rural lawmakers has failed to get a farm bill through the House. With lawmakers now at an impasse, Republicans are entertaining the idea of splitting the bill in two, and attempting to pass agricultural subsidies and food stamp payments separately.""I'd be very concerned if I were a farmer or rancher or producer if these bills were split,"" Vilsack said, adding that food stamps don't need congressional reauthorization to continue. ""On the other hand, some of these farm programs, they come up every five years and historically the way they get passed is for that coalition between urban suburban and rural legislators understanding that there's something in this bill that speaks to their constituents.""Vilsack said that if Republicans wanted to reform nutrition assistance or crop subsidies, keeping them together in a farm bill is their best chance to do so. Agriculture and nutrition advocacy lobbyists generally agree that the nutrition and farm assistance should stay together.The top Democrat in the House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), argued a twin-bill package would fail to make it through the lower chamber. (He himself said he would vote against the food stamp portion of such a package, arguing the cuts would be too deep.) Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), meanwhile, urged House leadership to simply take up the Senate's version of the farm bill, pledging that he would not support a stopgap fix like the one-year extension that was passed last year.Vilsack said that if current agriculture laws are allowed to expire at the end of September it would have damaging effects, both globally, by harming trade relations, and locally, by raising milk prices.""We spend a lot less on our food as a percentage of our income than most people around the world do,"" Vilsack said. ""It gives us a lot of flexibility with our paychecks that sometimes we fail to recognize or appreciate farmers for what they get to us."" "
9903	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/federal-minimum-wage_n_3641162.html	News	1	Economy	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	WASHINGTON -- Workers toiling in low-wage jobs marked a dispiriting anniversary on Wednesday: It's now been four years since the last time the federal minimum wage was raised.The minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour, and it prevails in the 30 states that don't already mandate a higher one. The last time it saw a boost was on July 24, 2009, when it was raised from $6.55. That 70-cent raise marked the last in a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush.Since then, the legal wage floor has held steady, even as the cost of living has continued to rise. A full-time worker earning the minimum wage now pulls in a salary of about $15,000 per year, far below a living wage in most parts of the country.President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats have proposed raising the minimum wage and pegging it to inflation, though House Republicans are unlikely to go along with such a hike any time soon. Bills to raise the minimum wage, introduced in the House and Senate earlier this year, have not been voted on by their respective committees. Republican leaders, including House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), have deemed a minimum-wage raise a job killer. (House Republicans have already voted down a version of the minimum wage raise that was inserted as an amendment to a workforce training bill.)Labor groups supporting a minimum wage boost planned demonstrations in an estimated 30 cities across the country on Wednesday, calling the four-year lapse reason alone for a raise. According to organizers, the protests would target low-wage employers who've seen employee strikes in recent months, including Walmart and McDonald's. A group of companies that back the Democratic proposal, called Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, launched a petition Wednesday for businesses to pledge their support for a raise. Over the decades, the minimum wage has gone for spells longer than four years before seeing a raise, according to the Labor Department. The wage floor remained stagnant for a full 10 years leading up to the first increase late in Bush's tenure, in 2007. And during the early 1990s, the minimum wage stood at $4.25 for more than five years before being raised under President Bill Clinton.But if Congress doesn't send Obama legislation to sign by the end of his second term, he will be the first president since Ronald Reagan who didn't raise the minimum wage at all.Back on the campaign trail in 2008, Obama stumped for hiking the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011 and pegging it to inflation in perpetuity. That raise never came, however, and the president proposed a more modest boost to $9.00 during his State of the Union address earlier this year. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) soon rolled out their own, more ambitious proposal, which by 2015 would raise the minimum wage to $10.10, closer to its historical high in the late 1960s.The proposals by both the president and congressional Democrats include one pivotal measure -- the tying of the minimum wage to an inflation index. Ten states have already undertaken this change, choosing to automatically reset the minimum wage each year rather than wrangle politically over a new raise every few years. If Congress adopted an inflation index, the purchasing power of the minimum wage wouldn't erode as it has for the past four years.According to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, Americans broadly support the idea of raising the minimum wage and pegging it to inflation, with 62 percent of Americans saying it should be boosted to $9. Obama's proposal was supported by a huge majority of Democrats in the poll (86 percent to 6 percent) and a majority of independents (56 percent to 28 percent). Fifty-two percent of Republicans, however, opposed the proposal, compared to 36 percent who supported it.

""Time passes. You get a little gray.""The president is a Christian who was born in Hawaii, but he included some material for so-called ""birthers"" who falsely assert he was born abroad.""I'm also hard at work on plans for the Obama Library, and some have suggested that we put it in my birthplace, but I'd rather keep it in the United States,"" he said.Obama made light of his own rapid rise to power by comparing himself to Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Hispanic from Florida who is touted as a potential presidential candidate in 2016.""One senator who has reached across the aisle recently is Marco Rubio, but I don't know about 2016. I mean, the guy has not even finished a single term in the Senate and he thinks he's ready to be president,"" Obama joked. ""Kids these days.""Obama began running for president during his first term as a U.S. senator from Illinois.In a room filled with journalists, the president saved some of his most biting jokes for the press.""I know CNN has taken some knocks lately, but the fact is I admire their commitment to cover all sides of a story, just in case one of them happens to be accurate,"" he said, drawing applause.""Some of my former advisors have switched over to the dark side. For example, David Axelrod now works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod.""Axelrod was the chief strategist for Obama's re-election campaign and a former White House adviser.

Most people don't choose to be on food stamps. Most people want a job,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) ""Most people want to go out and be productive so that they can earn a living, so that they can support a family, so that they can have hope for a more prosperous future. They want what we want.""While most proponents of the bill similarly argued that they were just promoting work, there was also an undercurrent of accusation that many Americans are abusing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to sponge off taxpayers.""If you're a healthy adult and don't have someone relying on you to care for them, you ought to earn the benefits you receive,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). ""Look for work. Start job training to improve your skills or do community service. But you can no longer sit on your couch or ride a surfboard like Jason in California and expect the federal taxpayer to feed you.""That would be Jason Greenslate, the California food stamp recipient who likes to surf and play rock music but not look for work. Fox News profiled him last month in a segment that said America has been on an epic ""food stamp binge."" The network made sure everyone in Congress saw the segment.The House vote sets up a showdown with the Democratic-controlled Senate, which previously approved a much more modest reduction in food stamp spending as part of a broader bill that included agricultural subsidies. A traditional ""farm bill"" likewise combining the two issues failed in the House during the summer, at which point House Republicans set nutrition aside and passed a bill with just the agribusiness subsidies. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) almost seemed desperate to get the measure passed, noting that it was only part of the process of passing the normally noncontroversial farm bill.""I admit to you, this has been an unusual process. But it remains my goal to get a five-year farm bill enacted. I'm doing everything possible to make sure that happens this year,"" Lucas said, emphasizing the ""everything.""Before the earlier attempt to pass a farm bill failed, Lucas had worked hard to accommodate conservatives by allowing an amendment that made the food stamp provisions harsher. Nearly all of them voted against the bill anyway, and the amendment cost Democratic supporters.""We have a responsibility to get this done, and quite simply, and I repeat, quite simply, it shouldn't be this hard to pass a bill that ensures all of us in this economy has enough to eat,"" Lucas said. ""And that's what a farm bill does.""Members from each chamber will have to reconcile the differences between their separate pieces of legislation in a conference committee this fall. The White House has repeatedly said it would veto the House GOP's food stamp demands. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the House legislation would deny benefits to 3.8 million Americans next year and save $39 billion over 10 years, or roughly 5 percent of the SNAP program's cost in that time. Enrollment doubled to 47 million in the wake of the Great Recession as incomes plummeted and more Americans qualified for benefits, which average $133 per month. Most beneficiaries are children, elderly or disabled.The bill is packed with changes to SNAP: It would require more beneficiaries to pass income and asset tests to prove their poverty. It would allow states to require drug tests. It would allow states to deny benefits to able-bodied adults who don't work or enroll in training for at least 20 hours per week.""Work is not a penalty,"" Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) said, citing the Book of Genesis. ""Work is a blessing.""Regardless of what President Obama ultimately signs into law, benefits will drop for all SNAP beneficiaries in November after the expiration of a 13 percent benefits increase that had been granted by the 2009 stimulus bill. Democrats called the House measure a useless assault on the poor.""Today's exercise is nothing more than a waste of our time and an insult to every American in need,"" said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio). ""The fact that we are considering this legislation makes me question whether the Republican leadership even wants a farm bill.""She added that the bill ""guts nutrition for those most in need and says to the poor, to hungry children, to the disabled, seniors and our veterans, 'You don't matter, you are not worthy of our help.' They deserve better.""Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) asked Lucas if he would try to spare veterans from the cuts in the probable conference committee, saying they deserve special support ""in these economic times."" Lucas argued that veterans were already protected.However, a recent Huffington Post review of military records found military families rely on more than $100 million in food stamps a year. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated that 170,000 veterans would feel the pinch from the bill."

Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Rep. John F. Tierney (D-Mass.), is asking Obama to fill the director spot at the FHFA with a person who will consider a loan principal reduction program to aid ""underwater"" homeowners -- those who owe more on their mortgage than their property is worth. The agency oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and is currently run by acting director Edward DeMarco.The signatories noted that there are “approximately 10.9 million residential borrowers” who are underwater on their mortgages.“It is imperative that we have a strong leader at FHFA to take on these challenges, strengthen the housing market, and promote our nation’s continued economic recovery,” the members of Congress wrote.The letter is likely to reignite calls in Washington for Obama to fire DeMarco, who assumed his position when the president’s nominee to head the agency was blocked from confirmation by the U.S. Senate.“In the three and a half years since Edward J. DeMarco was designated Acting Director of FHFA,” the press release announcing the letter noted, “questions have persisted about his repeated failure to utilize the authorities available to FHFA to promote a healthy housing finance market.”The members of Congress further painted the acting director in the letter as someone who “is not interested in obtaining real-world evidence that might contradict his pre-established views.”Last summer, DeMarco rankled administration officials and others working to stanch the national foreclosure rate when he refused a request from the Treasury Department to implement a principal reduction and debt forgiveness program for certain underwater homeowners.At the time, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner wrote DeMarco that he was “concerned by [his] continued opposition to allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) to use targeted principal reduction in their loan modification programs.” Geithner added that he did not ""believe it is the best decision for the country.""Some analysts expected that Obama would replace DeMarco through a December recess appointment. In October, the Financial Times reported that the Obama administration was ""quietly telling housing industry activists"" that there is a plan to replace DeMarco. "

""It's a different time and a different Congress,"" Kelley told HuffPost. ""There are too many people who remember [1995 and 1996] or were told about it by someone and I want them to know that is not a guarantee.""""I'm telling employees not to assume they would be paid,"" Kelley continued, ""and that adds to the frustration and the anger. They're tired of being caught in the middle of this.""Last week, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill that ties government funding to the defunding of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Of course, the White House and Senate Democrats have refused to neuter the president's landmark health care reform law at the behest of Republicans. Barring a resolution, funding for government services will expire next week.Many workers employed in national security roles, like Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officers, would be exempted from furloughs and keep working even if the government goes into shutdown mode. In that case, they would get paid retroactively for their service, but not until Congress passes the new spending legislation.For other workers, the shutdown would lead to an unknown number of furlough days. Congress could later choose to pay workers for the furlough period -- or not. After the mid-'90s shutdowns, Congress passed legislation compensating workers for the wages they lost.According to J. David Cox, head of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, the looming government shutdown would amount to ""involuntary servitude"" for federal workers who continue clocking in even if government operations go unfunded by Congress.Cox, whose union represents 670,000 workers across federal agencies, told HuffPost that union members were ""unnerved"" by the possibility of a shutdown, especially after many have already taken unpaid furlough days this year due to sequestration.""They've lost a whole week's pay,"" Cox said of many federal employees. ""Now you're talking about a government shutdown. In many instances employees will be required to go to work but won't get paid on payday.""""This is no way to run a country,"" Cox added.The threat of a government shutdown has become more common amid Congress' ongoing budget battles. In addition to facing furlough days, many federal employees have also been under a three-year pay freeze as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for belt-tightening. (Although many workers have still received merit raises, they have not been eligible for their traditional cost-of-living increases each year.)Cox said the union has been in close contact with the offices of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) on the possibility of a shutdown. Kelley said her union has asked all its members to pressure their representatives to strike a deal.""I don't think anyone is willing to accept it as the new normal, because it's no way to run any operation, much less the federal government,"" Kelley said."

In fact, there are a number of positive things that can be said about raising the minimum wage. Here are 10 things minimum wage haters don't want to acknowledge:

But it erupted in public view on the Senate floor this week as Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) revealed their displeasure with their junior colleagues.The tea partiers -- primarily Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Rand Paul (Ky.), Mike Lee (Utah) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) -- are blocking the Senate from appointing conferees to a conference committee with the House to work out the radical differences between the two budgets each side has passed.That is often done in the Senate by unanimous consent. Other times, there are votes instructing conferees on how to try to shape the final bill. But the conservative cohorts want more. They are demanding that the Senate bar the conference members from doing anything that would raise the federal debt limit -- a demand that McCain lambasted for much of the week as unprecedented.The debate intensified Wednesday, when McCain charged that the tea party members' opposition amounted to distrust of the House GOP leadership. And Cruz admitted it did. ""Let me be clear. I don't trust the Republicans,"" he said, lumping them in with Democrats.But McCain has held his ground, suggesting on Thursday that senators who object to conference negotiations don't understand ""how business has been done"" in Congress. Moreover, McCain asserted that most GOP senators agree with him that it's time to stop stalling and go to conference.Most senators asked by The Huffington Post said they do agree with McCain.""I think it's a good idea to get a commitment not to raise the debt limit, but I trust the normal course of business -- that we're not going to use reconciliation to raise the debt limit,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told HuffPost. ""We can have a motion to instruct our conferees not to raise the debt limit by 51 votes, so I'm fine with going to conference.""""People have strong feelings, and that's what it's all about,"" Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) explained of the tea party conservatives. ""But myself personally, I would very much like to see this resolved very quickly so that we can go to conference. I would like to see us appoint conferees.""Even Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), a deficit hawk and the top Republican on the Budget Committee who said he understood the concerns over raising the debt limit, pointed out that the ultimate goal was to iron out differences through regular order.""I think the right thing to do is get ourselves to conference,"" Sessions told HuffPost. ""Eventually we need to go forward and reach an agreement, the president needs to be engaged, and a conference provides an opportunity to do that.""""I think there ought to be discussion, but ultimately we have to go to conference,"" said Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.).Some senators said they found the stall tactics to be political grandstanding.""It's all a political game,"" Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) told HuffPost, adding that he supported regular order. ""This is a slowdown because the House wants a slowdown. As soon as the House doesn't want the slowdown, it will get released.""Coburn's comments are oddly in line with recent arguments used by Democrats in the budget fight. House Republicans spent four years calling for regular order while berating the Senate for failing to pass a budget. When the Senate finally passed its budget resolution in March, Republicans were suddenly reluctant to convene a conference committee, even though without one, there can be no formal federal budget for the fifth year in a row.Indeed, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Thursday he's had ""private conversations this week on how we might move ahead, but we've not made any decisions at this point.""Even some kindred conservatives in the House, however, said they would like to see the budget finished.""These guys are blood brothers. I love 'em. In fact I would suggest to you, in all deference to Sen. McCain, they're far more in line with the rank-and-file members of the House than Sen. McCain is,"" Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost. ""That's probably an understatement.""But Franks suggested that the best way to convince people in the long run was play by the rules, and keep making the argument. House leaders, he said, had to keep their eye on the bigger picture of what is possible, even if Franks disagrees.""I understand the equation they're dealing with is almost untenable, mathematically,"" Franks said. ""If they do what people like me would like them to do, sometimes we end up, because we're so outnumbered, not being able to sustain that.""And even though the tea partiers' fears may be realized, Franks said he thinks the process should proceed.""What we have to do, still in a regular order situation, is to get the strongest thing that we can from the Senate that's the best for the country possible and do the same in the House, and then hope that the respective leaderships appoint the people that can sustain the best outcome possible,"" Franks said. ""If we have the right people on our conference side, I wouldn't be afraid of that at all.""McCain said he couldn't speak for his colleagues in the House, but pointed out that the same group of senators threatened to filibuster the debate on gun control legislation and were ultimately convinced not to block debate.""Any small group of senators can object to moving to conference on any piece of legislation because they object to their provision not being included in it?"" McCain said in a brief hallway interview. ""That would be a dreadful precedent to set in the United States Senate.""Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate GOP conference, was confident the matter would be resolved. He told HuffPost his colleagues had a ""legitimate fear"" over the debt limit, but stressed the need to figure out a path forward.""Obviously we want to see a continued debate about the budget,"" Thune said. ""I think that's good for us, because we've been talking about debt, spending and taxes. I think those are good arguments for Republicans."""

One Republican lawmaker walked a group of reporters through how this might happen on Thursday afternoon, and said that he thinks a deal will be reached by the Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling.""I think we'll avoid default. I think we'll stumble toward a larger deal that will continue to narrow the deficit,"" said the lawmaker. ""I don't think it will be as grand as the grand bargain.""In short, the GOP member, who spoke on the condition he not be quoted by name in order to speak more frankly, said during an hour talk that members of his party might be willing to vote to end some or all of the sequester, in exchange for changes to Social Security and Medicare.The sequester was the result of the last budget showdown, and it cut discretionary spending across the board. Because neither party is happy with the sequester cuts, they could become another key bargaining chip in a deal to pass a funding bill and end the government shutdown. Republicans could possibly seek the changes to entitlement spending, and in turn vote to restore funding in other areas -- all within negotiations over a deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.""Sequester is a very blunt instrument,"" the GOP member said. ""It's a pretty common view among Republicans that we've done way too much. So some of the spending can be restored. ... Then the president's going to get some of what he wants, for domestic initiatives, Head Start and whatever.""The lawmaker said non-discretionary spending, or mandatory spending that's locked in each year and not appropriated by Congress, could ""hold the savings of the sequester,"" while Republicans could ""let the belt out a couple notches on the discretionary side of the budget.""The changes the GOP is aiming for, he said, would include ""at least chained CPI and at least means testing."" In other words, a different measure of inflation would be used to calculate Social Security benefits, leading to lower increases over time, and lower-income Americans would receive more generous Social Security and Medicare benefits than those in high-income brackets.One Democratic congressional source noted that Obama has signaled in the past -- including in his budget this year -- that he is willing to support using chained CPI. And a Republican leadership aide said this week that Republican hopes for a deal are based in part on their understanding that Obama wants very badly to get rid of the sequester cuts.The Democratic source laid out a way a deal could proceed so that the president could claim to have won a ""clean"" government funding bill and a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase, but changes to the sequester and entitlements would be tied to these actions.""The political appeal of this kind of approach ... is that it offers each party a way out of the corner it’s in,"" wrote conservative policy expert Yuval Levin, editor of National Affairs and an informal adviser to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), in National Review Online. Levin laid out in detail how a deal such as the one described by the Republican lawmaker to reporters would work.The Republican member said that if a such a deal is reached, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) can move forward even if his right flank in the House, and tea party lawmakers in the Senate like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), oppose it. ""If it's a real bargain and the president and the speaker come to the deal, that way you make the left wing and the right wing irrelevant, because deals have votes from both sides,"" he said. ""The irony of this is that the guys who got us into this mess won't be there to cut the deal that gets us out. And they will attack the people that actually come to the deal, and profit by it politically,"" he said. ""This is more about political position for a few members. For most of them I don't question their motives.""As for Cruz, the GOP lawmaker said: ""I tell you one thing: He's never played team sports in his life.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the president's position on the chained CPI."
10083	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/25/food-stamp-cuts_n_3653633.html	News	0	Economy	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Republicans in the House of Representatives removed food stamps from broader farm legislation in hopes that doing so would make it easier to pass a separate bill cutting nutrition assistance. But now there's a chance the House won't vote on a food stamp bill at all. House Agriculture Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) told the Oklahoma Farm Report Wednesday that so far, House Republican leaders have been unable to muster the votes they need to pass a bill reforming the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. ""Right now that equation is not there, and discussions are still going on,"" Lucas said. ""My friends on the left don’t want to have any reforms and my friends on the right want dramatically more reforms than probably are achievable in this environment.""For decades, rural and urban lawmakers have joined forces to pass farm bills that include both agribusiness subsidies and nutrition assistance for poor people. That arrangement has broken down with the rise of tea party Republicans who are hostile to the food stamp status quo, as the Great Recession pushed the program's enrollment to 47 million people. Last month, a traditional farm bill collapsed on the House floor largely because Democrats willing to accept modest cuts withdrew their support in the wake of a Republican amendment seeking to make the cuts harsher. This month, House Republicans passed a ""farm only"" farm bill without any Democratic support. Lucas started preliminary negotiations with Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) about how the fractured House bill might be combined with the traditional farm legislation that passed the Senate earlier this year. Lucas said he doesn't want to wait for the House to pass SNAP legislation to begin the formal conference committee process with members of the Senate.""My personal goal is by some point next week, if it’s quite clear that consensus cannot be achieved, if it’s just not achievable, then I think we need to recognize that fact and move on conferencing the bill that the Senate’s passed and the House has passed and see what evolves from that,"" Lucas told the Farm Report. ""But right now [we're] still trying to achieve consensus. That consensus is at the very least elusive. It might even be impossible. But I’m still trying.""A House Republican leadership aide suggested that House Republicans wouldn't hurry to conference with the Senate. “We are still moving forward with member discussions to develop SNAP reforms that have consensus and get these programs back on track so they can be there for the most vulnerable,"" the aide told HuffPost. ""Those discussions will likely continue into August and we will readdress it when we return back after recess.""If House leaders appoint conferees without approving nutrition legislation first, those lawmakers would probably have less leverage to push for food stamp cuts in the conference committee. Both chambers would have to approve the committee's eventual compromise legislation. The Senate bill cut nutrition assistance by $4 billion, or less than 1 percent of the program's $800 billion cost over 10 years. Before it was amended, the House bill would have cut SNAP by $20 billion. Without new legislation, the food stamp program would likely continue with no cuts at all -- an outcome Lucas has tried to warn his colleagues about. "
10167	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/01/government-unemployment_n_2598224.html	News	0	Economy	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"The January jobs numbers released earlier on Friday show that while the private sector added 166,000 jobs, the  government shed 9,000 positions in January.Those job losses have ripple effects throughout the economy, economist Dean Baker explained. ""If these people were still getting paychecks, they would have spent them, and that would have employed people elsewhere in the economy,"" the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research told The Huffington Post. He estimated that government job cuts have cost the economy more than 1 million jobs total.The unemployment rate rose to 7.9 percent in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, not much lower than a year ago. In contrast, the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent just before the recession, according to BLS.The government has cut 719,000 jobs since President Barack Obama took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some economists said this has stymied jobs growth, since the government is a major employer, and its employees' spending provides income to other workers.""The stimulus was helpful, but it wasn't nearly enough,"" said Baker, who also blogs for The Huffington Post. The government now is focused on deficit reduction instead of helping put people back to work, he said. ""No one is talking about how we shouldn't be cutting the deficit; we really need more jobs and that means larger deficits. No one prominent in the debate is saying that.""The government reduced the maximum duration of unemployment benefits last year. But instead of boosting hiring, this only led some jobless workers to give up looking for work, according to a statement from Baker. (Receiving unemployment benefits is contingent on searching for a job.) The average duration of unemployment has declined over the past year from 40 weeks to 35 weeks, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The government is scheduled to soon slash spending even more. The government recently postponed but did not eliminate the sequestration, across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to kick in starting on March 1 after a congressional committee formed in response to the debt ceiling crisis failed in 2011 to agree on a deficit reduction plan. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that sequestration would eliminate 689,000 jobs in 2013 and cut GDP growth by 0.6 percentage points. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former Obama administration economic adviser, who also blogs for HuffPost, said that letting the sequestration go into effect probably would send the unemployment rate up to 8.2 percent. ""While the government's fiscal policy was adding to growth back in 2009 and 2010, at this point it's subtracting from growth,"" Bernstein said, pointing to the end of the stimulus and payroll tax cut. ""If state and local employment had held up instead of falling so quickly, the unemployment rate would easily be a point lower than it is today [6.9 percent]."""

Marshall, doomsday might be just around the corner.That's why the Prince William County Republican wants to prepare Virginia for the impact of a major financial meltdown, caused by hyperinflation, cyberattacks on banks and the Federal Reserve's increasing control over the nation's money supply.What if your credit or debit cards won't work tomorrow and you have no access to your money? How do you continue to conduct commerce in these emergency situations?To protect Virginians and their assets, Marshall has drafted legislation with the goal to give Virginia its own currency.House Joint Resolution 590, which passed by a two-thirds vote in the House of Delegates last week, would establish a 10-member joint subcommittee consisting of eight legislators and two non-legislative Virginia residents who would study the feasibility ""of a metallic-based monetary unit.""Marshall said the new currency would not replace but compete with the U.S. dollar.""It would be an additional vehicle of trade and commerce,"" he said.The study's projected $17,440 cost would justify the means, he added.""That's very cheap, just about what one delegate makes a year,"" he said.His concern that the dollar might not always be available prompted him to introduce this measure, Marshall said.""There are sniper attacks going on right now from foreign powers on our financial institutions,"" he said. ""If they succeed, you're not going to be able to buy gas with a credit card. If you are on Medicaid, you won't get a debit card to buy food at the grocery store. A whole bunch of transactions are going to cease.""A simple way around this, Marshall said, would be to require at least the 81 state-chartered banks to issue checks to all account holders ""so they can carry on commerce, so they can buy food, gasoline, pay their rent and electricity.""Marshall's idea isn't new. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, a passionate advocate for the abolishment of the Federal Reserve -- who has run for president as a Libertarian and as a Republican -- previously introduced his ""Free Competition in Currency Act"" in Congress.The measure, which would have allowed states to introduce their own currencies, was never signed into law but was reintroduced last month by Georgia Rep. Paul C. Broun, a Republican.The proposals have gained support, especially among some Republicans and tea party groups nationwide, who worry about the Fed's continuing infusions of cash into the economy and who are pushing for a return to the ""gold standard"" that would require the U.S. dollar to be backed by gold reserves.The guarantee of the convertibility of dollars into gold on demand was first established in 1944 at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce under the Bretton Woods Agreement. But in 1971, the measure was abandoned under Republican President Richard Nixon.Since President Barack Obama's first election in 2008, several states have pursued legislative efforts for currency creation. These efforts face legal challenges, because while individual localities are permitted to issue their own currency -- as long as it is distinguishable from U.S. dollars -- the Constitution bans states from printing their own paper money or issuing their own paper currency.But Article 1, Section 10 also leaves states the option to mint coins to be used for debt service -- a loophole that some use as a step toward currency creation.At least 13 other states -- Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Washington -- have explored the option of issuing their own currency.To date, only Utah has passed such legislation, recognizing gold and silver coins issued by the U.S. Mint, like Silver Eagles and American Gold, as a legal form of payment.Marshall introduced legislation in 2011 that authorized the governor to direct the state treasurer to mint ""gold, platinum and silver coins for commemorative use that bear the seals of the commonwealth."" The bill passed in both houses and was signed into law.Two years ago, Marshall complained that his bill had been mischaracterized as an attempt to mint a separate currency for Virginia -- bringing criticism that he offered an alternative to the Federal Reserve. ""Some hysterical comments,"" he said.That was then. But now, Marshall is serious about taking that next step.""Virginia has to do this, we need to be prepared,"" he said. ""We have to anticipate this so we don't descend into social chaos. When you got massive inflation, you are setting up the stage for dictatorships. We don't need that in this country.""But experts say Marshall's fears are not grounded in reality.""There is no chance whatsoever that hyperinflation will happen in the United States,"" said Michael Smitka, professor of economics at Washington and Lee University. ""Only countries that are on the brink of a complete political breakdown ever face this.""Smitka said Japan, a country with an economic system most similar to that of the U.S., has never experienced hyperinflation after its 1991 economic meltdown.""After all this time, what they have is outright deflation, not inflation, much less hyperinflation,"" he said. But slight, one-digit inflation, as the U.S. experiences, is manageable, he said.Cyberattacks are even less likely to cause serious damage, Smitka said.""Banks are very careful with their Internet systems. Anyone suggesting that a cyberattack can bring down an entire centralized system has no understanding of how it works,"" he said.A system that can be trusted is already in place, Smitka said.""Who are they going to put in to run the Virginia monetary system? I'd fear the competence of a state-level monetary board and state-level financial regulation more than the federal level,"" he said.The Fed is prepared for national emergencies, Smitka said.""The Federal Reserve in Richmond has multiple billions in cash reserves that can be infused into the Virginia economy if needed,"" he said.Democrats also slammed Marshall's proposal.""House GOP put on tin foil hats in late-night session,"" was the headline of a statement released by the Virginia House Democratic Caucus last week. Caucus chairman Mark D. Sickles, D-Fairfax, called the debate over this legislation ""political theatrics.""Marshall stands by his measure, which the state Senate has referred to the Rules Committee.""It's a serious effort dealing with a serious problem,"" he said.But Marshall -- who suggested in 2011 to name a Virginia currency ""Ginny"" -- said he has not given any thought to whose head he would want to grace the commonwealth's coin.""We are not at that point yet,"" he said. ""But it won't be mine.""mschmidt@timesdispatch.com(804) 649-6537 ___(c)2013 the Richmond Times-Dispatch (Richmond, Va.)Visit the Richmond Times-Dispatch (Richmond, Va.) at www.timesdispatch.comDistributed by MCT Information Services"

Of course, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put such a bill on the floor in the first place.

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republican Party leaders have staked their party's future on a false premise. They say the wealthy are already providing for everyone else, and middle class families need to sacrifice for a change while millionaires reap the benefits.This year's Ryan budget is a product of this assumption. It treats the government to which Rep. Ryan has been elected as something between a nuisance and a menace, with no role in helping the economy except to transfer more wealth upward.Plenty of people have pointed out that these ideas lost in November. What they often forget is that a more positive vision also won that election: a vision of an America that helps us all achieve more than we could individually, a government that acts when the moment calls for it.The Congressional Progressive Caucus, which we're proud to co-chair, introduced its Back to Work Budget on March 13 because we know that putting Americans back to work, not cutting investments, is the answer to our nation's problems. We put 7 million people back to work in the first year and reduce the deficit $4.4 trillion over the next decade. Good jobs and fair pay, not favors for a lucky few, are what make this country run. The magic elixir Rep. Ryan and his colleagues are selling - blank checks to the Pentagon, tax cuts for the wealthy, subsidies for fossil fuels, less opportunity for the rest of us - has simply failed to help our economy. We need to rebuild this country by cutting tax loopholes we don't need and investing in the things we do: roads, bridges, schools, health care, infrastructure, and other basics of a prosperous nation. That's what our budget does.There is no question which approach the American people support. A Gallup poll released this week found that 72 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, support putting people back to work repairing our infrastructure. The same percentage supports investment to create jobs.We're not afraid of the contrasts our budget suggests with conservative ideology. Instead of closing the Department of Education, as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called for at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, we believe in building schools and putting more teachers on the job. Instead of continued tax breaks for large corporations, such as the $112 billion we will give away to wealthy fossil fuel companies in the next decade, we end preferential treatment for perks like corporate jets and put the money back into job creation for the American people.Two years ago, Rep. Ryan's blueprint was greeted with cheers by conservative activists and considerable deference by the pundits. This year, his plan is being treated as what it is: a radical transformation of the American experience. If he got his way, Medicaid would wither, Medicare as we know it would cease to exist, and the decades of progress we've made in fighting hunger and poverty would be wiped out.We agree with the American people who made their preference known in November: we can do better. The right-wing myth of makers and takers has had a pernicious effect on our politics and will take some time to fade away. In the meantime, we need to get our national conversation back on track. It's time for a serious effort to get America working again.The House Republican majority didn't pass our budget in last Wednesday's vote, but after two years of ignoring the jobs crisis, we hope our plan starts a new conversation that can continue past budget season. All we've heard from Republicans is the same exhausted line about cutting everything in sight, retrenching, reining in the American dream, and foreclosing on any positive government role in our nation's future. It's time for jobs to be the priority for Washington that it already is for the American people.Grijalva and Ellison are co-chairmen of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

He knows the issues. Very importantly, he has the trust of the president,"" former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, a Republican, said on Wednesday in a speech at the Wilson Center, a foreign policy think tank.Froman was approved in a 93-4 vote. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, was among the few senators to vote against him, citing what she called a lack of transparency in U.S. trade negotiations, a complaint many civil society groups have made in the past.""Many people are deeply interested in tracking the trajectory of trade negotiations, but if they do not have reasonable access to see the terms of the agreements under negotiation, then they can't have real input,"" Warren said.Froman got strong words of support from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, and Senator Orrin Hatch, the panel's top Republican.""I have every confidence this man is going to be an excellent leader ... He is highly qualified,"" Hatch said.The Senate action came just days after Obama and leaders of the European Union opened talks on what would be the world's biggest free-trade agreement, the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership pact.Froman now will be able to preside over the first round of those negotiations, set for the week of July 8 in Washington.The United States also is negotiating a free-trade agreement with Japan and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact that it hopes to finish by the end of this year.Froman's legacy will rest on whether he can bring those two big negotiations to agreements and win their approval in Congress. To secure the Asia-Pacific pact and win new export opportunities for U.S. business and farmers, Froman may have to make politically difficult decisions that would open the U.S. market to more auto, dairy, sugar and textile imports.The United States and the EU want to finish their trade talks by the end of 2014, requiring compromise on tough issues like Europe's restrictions on imports of genetically modified crops and other food safety barriers that Washington says are not based on scientific evidence.Froman also faces an early test in Congress to win approval of trade promotion authority, a piece of legislation that many of Obama's fellow Democrats have opposed in the past.That legislation, which expired in 2007, allows the White House to submit trade deals to Congress for straight up-or-down votes without any amendments.Approval of the bill would signal strong congressional backing for the Asia-Pacific and the EU agreements, helping to bring them to a close.Concern in Congress about the massive U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a record $315 billion in 2012, also puts pressure on Froman to make progress on that front.In addition, many lawmakers are increasingly frustrated with Indian policies that block U.S. imports and invalidate patent protections for valuable U.S. pharmaceuticals.In December, Froman will head to Bali for the ninth ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization amid gloom over that body's continuing viability as a negotiating forum.With the 12-year-old Doha round of world trade talks at an impasse, WTO members are striving to reach agreement on a small package of trade deals to show they can produce results.

While it remains to be seen whether the bill will make it through Congress, many states are not waiting to take action.Five states have passed measures to raise the minimum wage this year, according to data published by the National Conference of State Legislators. Only one of these states, California, has passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the states with the highest minimum wages.(Click here to read the eight states with the highest minimum wages)Whether or not a higher minimum wage is good for the economy continues to be the subject of debate. The National Employment Law Project (NELP), which advocates raising the minimum wage, maintains that the decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage “has contributed to the growth of income inequality over the past three decades.”Other groups maintain that raising the minimum wage is bad for business and jobs. The Heritage Foundation notes that if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, the combined costs of wages, employer penalties for not paying health insurance and taxes “would raise the minimum cost of hiring a full-time worker to $12.71 per hour.”24/7 Wall St. A state’s cost of living may influence its minimum wage. The cost of living in six of the eight states with a minimum wage over $8 an hour is higher than the nationwide cost of living. In Connecticut, where the minimum wage is currently $8.25, the cost of living is the fourth highest in the nation. The cost of living is similarly high in California, Massachusetts and Vermont.Another factor keeping the minimum wage high in these states likely involves labor representation. Among these eight states, only Nevada is a “right to work state,” meaning workers cannot be required to join a union or pay for a union’s costs as a condition of employment.Many states where current minimum wages are among the nation’s highest also have high union membership. In Washington, which currently has the nation’s highest minimum wage, 18.5% of workers are union members, fourth highest nationally. Among private sector workers, five of the eight states had among the 10 highest union membership.Based on information provided by the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the eight states with a minimum wage above $8 per hour. Additional figures on the cost of living in various states are from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC). Data on union membership by state are from the Union Membership and Coverage Database for 2012. Figures on poverty, income and income inequality as of 2012 are from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Unemployment rates are as of October 2013, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.These are the eight states with the highest minimum wages, according to 24/7 Wall St.:

The new standards were developed with input from officials in 26 states –- including Kentucky –- and are part of an effort to make science curricula more uniform across the country. While supporters feel the standards will help beat back scientific ignorance, some religious groups take issue because the standards treat evolution as fact and talk about the human role in climate change.The Kentucky Board of Education adopted the standards in June and held hearings to get public feedback on the standards last week before they were presented to the state legislature for official approval. Matt Singleton, a Baptist minister, is one of the opponents who spoke to the board about why the standards should not be adopted, according to The Courier-Journal. “Outsiders are telling public school families that we must follow the rich man’s elitist religion of evolution, that we no longer have what the Kentucky Constitution says is the right to worship almighty God,” Singleton said. “Instead, this fascist method teaches that our children are the property of the state.”Another opponent, Dena Stewart-Gore, suggested that the standards will make religious students feel ostracized. “The way socialism works is it takes anybody that doesn’t fit the mold and discards them,” she said, per the The Courier-Journal. “We are even talking genocide and murder here, folks.”Supporters of the standards contended that opponents’ fears are unfounded and that the standards’ curriculum is based on evidence. A handful of states including Kansas, Maryland and Vermont have already adopted the Next Generation Science Standards. The Kentucky Board of Education will be accepting written testimonies regarding the standards until July 31.

She has overseen higher education policies, such as student aid and adult education. According to her official bio, she is the face of Obama's plan to ensure that the U.S. have ""the best educated, most competitive workforce in the world by 2020.""In a departure memo sent to administration staff Tuesday evening, confirmed by Education Department spokesman Cameron French, Kanter said she will transition out of her job ""to return to academia."" She did not give details. She said she will leave in the fall, but only after the agency finds a replacement. Her departure thins out the ranks of the Education Department's first-term upper echelons. Until recently, the department lacked heads for its preschool and civil rights offices, and a general counsel. Those positions were filled recently. Press secretary Daren Briscoe's last day was Friday, and the department hasn't found a permanent replacement for Alexa Posny, who oversaw special education initiatives. (For the special education slot, officials say, the acting employee has been chosen to fill the slot permanently, pending confirmation). The department has ""acting"" leaders in charge of ""innovation and improvement,"" ""planning, evaluation and policy development"" and communications.In higher education, the transition may be tricky. President Barack Obama last month promised to ""shake up the system"" of higher education. He didn't go into detail, and administration officials have declined to do so. Obama said this would involve controlling college costs and improving the value of a post-secondary degree. Kanter oversaw the implementation of tremendous changes to the federal Pell grant program and new rules on student loans. Before arriving at the Education Department, she served as chancellor of the Foothill-De Anza Community College District in California. Before that, she worked as a high school teacher, then in various administrative roles in California's community colleges chancellor's office. ""Serving as your Under Secretary has deepened my understanding and appreciation of what 'service to improve the public good of our nation' really means,"" Kanter wrote. ""The promise and power of delivering good government to our students and families is a tireless, phenomenal effort, often with few external rewards if done honestly, fairly and well.""Read the full memo below.Dear Colleagues, For more than four years, it has been my honor and privilege to serve our country under President Obama. Together we have accomplished important milestones in improving education for Americans at all levels, especially for those most in need. I know from experience that great teaching, learning and research have the power to transform our nation and the world. To build on the work and considerable outcomes we have achieved, I have decided to return to academia and will leave federal government service this fall. Delivering a world-class education for all is what I have dedicated my life to get done every day. Serving as your Under Secretary has deepened my understanding and appreciation of what “service to improve the public good of our nation” really means. The promise and power of delivering good government to our students and families is a tireless, phenomenal effort, often with few external rewards if done honestly, fairly and well. What unfolds each and every day never ceases to amaze me, even now. I could never have imagined a more exciting and challenging opportunity. For that I thank President Obama, Secretary Duncan and each of you. Over the next few months, my priority is to ensure a seamless transition for the Department until a new Under Secretary comes on board. I remain committed to achieving the goals for our nation’s postsecondary students, institutions and communities: access, affordability, quality and completion. I will continue to pursue these ends during this transition period and beyond. I have assured Secretary Duncan that the postsecondary team will continue to advance our ambitious statutory, regulatory and administrative agenda. We can’t afford to miss a beat as you all know. For me, it is simply that single, unwavering commitment to help our students and institutions aspire to excellence that inspires me each and every day. As always, I welcome your ideas and feedback about our work going forward. Thank you for all that you continue to do and for the opportunity to serve as your Under Secretary of Education. Full speed ahead! Martha Kanter "

The PR help included tweaks to op-eds and running UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Holden Thorp through a four-hour session to prepare for questions he'd likely face from reporters. The News & Observer reports that the bill will be paid by UNC's privately funded foundation.The majority of the money -- $367,000 -- went to The Fleishman-Hillard firm. Another $144,000 went to political consultant Doug Sosnik and $20,000 went to Sheehan Associates.The News & Observer obtained the correspondence through an open records request, which also revealed a series of communications between UNC administrators and faculty involved in the academic fraud scandal.The academic scandal involved courses being offered as ""paper"" classes that did not require attendance, and a number of unauthorized grade changes, the majority of which involved student athletes. It prompted several investigations, including those by former North Carolina Gov. James G. Martin, the National Association of Academic Advisors for Athletics and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.As a consequence of the scandal Thorp resigned and Bruce Carney left his post as executive vice chancellor and provost.UNC's bill tops what Florida State University spent for its own academic fraud scandal: $300,000 between 2007 and 2010.But as large as UNC's bill is for PR advice, it's nothing compared to the $2.3 million Rutgers University has already spent due to the scandal involving former basketball head coach Mike Rice.Both Rutgers and UNC's costs are dwarfed by the $100 million (or more) in costs due to penalties, fees and lost revenue that Penn State University faces in the wake of Jerry Sandusky's sex crimes."

She has overseen higher education policies, such as student aid and adult education. According to her official bio, she is the face of Obama's plan to ensure that the U.S. have ""the best educated, most competitive workforce in the world by 2020.""In a departure memo sent to administration staff Tuesday evening, confirmed by Education Department spokesman Cameron French, Kanter said she will transition out of her job ""to return to academia."" She did not give details. She said she will leave in the fall, but only after the agency finds a replacement. Her departure thins out the ranks of the Education Department's first-term upper echelons. Until recently, the department lacked heads for its preschool and civil rights offices, and a general counsel. Those positions were filled recently. Press secretary Daren Briscoe's last day was Friday, and the department hasn't found a permanent replacement for Alexa Posny, who oversaw special education initiatives. (For the special education slot, officials say, the acting employee has been chosen to fill the slot permanently, pending confirmation). The department has ""acting"" leaders in charge of ""innovation and improvement,"" ""planning, evaluation and policy development"" and communications.In higher education, the transition may be tricky. President Barack Obama last month promised to ""shake up the system"" of higher education. He didn't go into detail, and administration officials have declined to do so. Obama said this would involve controlling college costs and improving the value of a post-secondary degree. Kanter oversaw the implementation of tremendous changes to the federal Pell grant program and new rules on student loans. Before arriving at the Education Department, she served as chancellor of the Foothill-De Anza Community College District in California. Before that, she worked as a high school teacher, then in various administrative roles in California's community colleges chancellor's office. ""Serving as your Under Secretary has deepened my understanding and appreciation of what 'service to improve the public good of our nation' really means,"" Kanter wrote. ""The promise and power of delivering good government to our students and families is a tireless, phenomenal effort, often with few external rewards if done honestly, fairly and well.""Read the full memo below.Dear Colleagues, For more than four years, it has been my honor and privilege to serve our country under President Obama. Together we have accomplished important milestones in improving education for Americans at all levels, especially for those most in need. I know from experience that great teaching, learning and research have the power to transform our nation and the world. To build on the work and considerable outcomes we have achieved, I have decided to return to academia and will leave federal government service this fall. Delivering a world-class education for all is what I have dedicated my life to get done every day. Serving as your Under Secretary has deepened my understanding and appreciation of what “service to improve the public good of our nation” really means. The promise and power of delivering good government to our students and families is a tireless, phenomenal effort, often with few external rewards if done honestly, fairly and well. What unfolds each and every day never ceases to amaze me, even now. I could never have imagined a more exciting and challenging opportunity. For that I thank President Obama, Secretary Duncan and each of you. Over the next few months, my priority is to ensure a seamless transition for the Department until a new Under Secretary comes on board. I remain committed to achieving the goals for our nation’s postsecondary students, institutions and communities: access, affordability, quality and completion. I will continue to pursue these ends during this transition period and beyond. I have assured Secretary Duncan that the postsecondary team will continue to advance our ambitious statutory, regulatory and administrative agenda. We can’t afford to miss a beat as you all know. For me, it is simply that single, unwavering commitment to help our students and institutions aspire to excellence that inspires me each and every day. As always, I welcome your ideas and feedback about our work going forward. Thank you for all that you continue to do and for the opportunity to serve as your Under Secretary of Education. Full speed ahead! Martha Kanter "

Stephen Bloom (R) is under fire after seeking cosponsors for legislation that critics say would allow creationism to be taught in the classroom. Bloom denies such claims, saying the bill would spur intellectual debate by allowing K-12 students in public schools to question scientific theories like evolution and climate change, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. “With free discourse in the classroom under threat, I will soon be introducing a bill to preserve academic freedom in Pennsylvania’s schools,” Bloom said in a memo. “Efforts to squelch and stifle free critical inquiry in the classroom have too frequently arisen, often in the context of the teaching and debate of controversial scientific theories and paradigms.”In the memo, sent Aug. 1, Bloom began soliciting fellow politicians to cosponsor the bill, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. ""In the real world, outside of academia, scientific theory is up for all kinds of argument,"" Bloom said of the bill, which has not been written. ""I don't think it's right to exclude any particular kind of argument prima facie. If a student wants to discuss a criticism, he or she should be able to,"" reports the Philadelphia Inquirer. Bloom told a local ABC affiliate that he did not intend to insert religion into the classroom, but rather to expand students’ academic freedoms.""The free exchange of ideas was being quelled by these very strict speech codes in school,"" said Bloom. ""And, so for me ... it's just something from the heart.""Still, the idea of Bloom’s bill already has prompted opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union in Pennsylvania. Andy Hoover, legislative director for the Pennsylvania branch of the ACLU, said that it would be difficult to ensure that scientific debates regarding evolution would not veer into religious territory.""We do think that ultimately some teacher somewhere or students ... will bring religious doctrine into public school classrooms,"" he told a local ABC affiliate. States like Louisiana and Tennessee currently have similar academic freedom laws in place. At the same time, comparable bills in states like Colorado and Indiana recently failed to pass."

The new standards were developed with input from officials in 26 states –- including Kentucky –- and are part of an effort to make science curricula more uniform across the country. While supporters feel the standards will help beat back scientific ignorance, some religious groups take issue because the standards treat evolution as fact and talk about the human role in climate change.The Kentucky Board of Education adopted the standards in June and held hearings to get public feedback on the standards last week before they were presented to the state legislature for official approval. Matt Singleton, a Baptist minister, is one of the opponents who spoke to the board about why the standards should not be adopted, according to The Courier-Journal. “Outsiders are telling public school families that we must follow the rich man’s elitist religion of evolution, that we no longer have what the Kentucky Constitution says is the right to worship almighty God,” Singleton said. “Instead, this fascist method teaches that our children are the property of the state.”Another opponent, Dena Stewart-Gore, suggested that the standards will make religious students feel ostracized. “The way socialism works is it takes anybody that doesn’t fit the mold and discards them,” she said, per the The Courier-Journal. “We are even talking genocide and murder here, folks.”Supporters of the standards contended that opponents’ fears are unfounded and that the standards’ curriculum is based on evidence. A handful of states including Kansas, Maryland and Vermont have already adopted the Next Generation Science Standards. The Kentucky Board of Education will be accepting written testimonies regarding the standards until July 31.

Circuit -- a top priority for President Barack Obama that some Republicans are determined to sink.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) filed a procedural motion on Monday to begin debate on one of Obama's three nominees to the court. Specifically, Reid filed a ""cloture"" motion on D.C. appellate lawyer Patricia Millett, which sets her up for a confirmation vote later this week.A top Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly predicted ""a big fight"" once the D.C. Circuit nominees hit the floor, but said the ""word is that we and [the White House] are ready to fight hard."" Reid has said that Democrats are focused on getting at least one more judge confirmed to the court, and has hinted at changes to Senate rules if Republicans stage a filibuster.The court currently has four Democrat-appointed judges and four Republican-appointed judges, with three empty slots and three Obama nominees waiting on the sidelines. Two of the nominees -- Millett and Nina Pillard -- cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee months ago and have been awaiting floor votes. The third nominee, Robert Wilkins, is set for his committee vote on Thursday.While partisan scuffles over Obama's nominees are nothing new, his picks for the D.C. Circuit are particularly key to his legacy. The court has broad power to review federal regulations and is considered second only to the Supreme Court in terms of its stature. The D.C. Circuit has also been a launching pad for the Supreme Court: four sitting Supreme Court justices once served on it.Senate Republicans routinely argue that there's no need to fill the vacancies on the court. The court isn't busy enough, some say, to warrant having all 11 of its seats, and thereby should lose those slots waiting to be filled. Others have falsely accused the president of ""court-packing."" Earlier this month, GOP senators repeated those arguments to The Huffington Post.""We do not need these judges. It's just plain as day,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""They have, by far, the lowest caseload per judge. They take the summers off."" ""It's clear they're trying to pack the D.C. court,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), also a member of the committee. ""It's probably the most important appellate court in the country ... so there's a matter of great concern.""Both predicted Republicans will use any procedural or tactical means that they can to block the nominees.""I'm going to fight as hard as I can,"" Sessions said.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) reiterated his party's complaints last week in a FoxNews.com op-ed.""Republicans should remain united in blocking Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s attempt to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is America's second-most-influential judicial body,"" Cornyn wrote.But GOP charges of ""court-packing"" are factually incorrect. The term is used to describe an attempt to increase the number of judges on a court with the goal of shifting its political balance, not to fill existing vacancies. One could even make the case that GOP efforts to prevent Obama from filling empty court seats, thereby keeping those courts from having judges appointed by a Democrat, are instances of ""court-unpacking.""Plenty of other notable voices make the case for filling the court. Patricia M. Wald, a retired judge who served on the court for 20 years, highlighted the court's particularly complex and time-consuming caseload in a Washington Post op-ed. Sid Shapiro, an administrative law expert and Center for Progressive Reform member scholar, said the average number of cases before the court is actually up, from 1,152 cases during the Bush administration to 1,362 under Obama.Also an advocate of filling the court's empty slots: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. He signed off on an April 5 report by the Judicial Conference of the United States that recommends keeping the court at 11 seats. Sessions, for one, hadn't heard about Roberts' recommendation.""I want to see that quote. Where'd he say that?"" Sessions asked, jumping out of an elevator he'd just hopped into. When HuffPost cited the April 5 report, Sessions grumbled about Roberts not being a real Republican.""He's always advocating the court. He wants pay raises for staff,"" he said. ""Otherwise, he's supposed to be conservative."""

I had some exasperated things to say about the situation on HuffPost Live last night, and as soon as I'd signed off, my colleague John Celock -- who has forgotten more things about America's state legislatures than I shall ever know -- gave me the skinny as to how Stella Tremblay became a thing that was happening in America: the New Hampshire House of Representatives has 400 members. ""Double-you tee effing eff!"" I replied, because huh? The Virginia House of Delegates, by contrast, has a mere 100 members. And, oh yeah, the actual U.S. House of Representatives has 435 voting members.These two sentences from the Wikipedia entry on the New Hampshire House of Reps is sufficient to put the fear in you: ""On average, each legislator represents about 3,300 residents. If the same level of representation were present in the U.S. Congress, that body would have approximately 99,000 members, according to current population estimates.""On top of that, Celock told me that members of this august body receive a mere $100 a year for their participation, which means that the only people who are likely to seek these offices are people who are just beginning their political careers, people who are winding down their political careers, and people who have literally nothing better to do than run for these seats. With a system designed like this, it can't not feature a nutter like Tremblay.So, anyone who is truly concerned about getting Stella Tremblay out of office would be well served to stop thinking about running a better candidate in ""Rockingham 4,"" and instead concentrate on making New Hampshire's legislative body a lot less bonkers.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to the city to open the party's African-American Engagement Office. But if anything, the launch event put into stark relief just how much work the GOP has to do, when a largely white audience turned out to hear the senator speak.Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus has said that attracting more minorities to the GOP is crucial for the party's future. He visited Michigan last month, hired radio personality Wayne Bradley to head the African-American Engagement effort in the state and launched the Michigan Black Advisory Council. In the 2012 election, President Barack Obama earned the support of 90 percent of the black voters who turned out at the polls.Paul initially spoke at the new African-American Engagement Office on Livernois Avenue in Detroit for about four minutes on Friday. According to the progressive site Eclectablog, ""The seats in the tiny space were filled with well-dressed supporters, most of whom were African-American."" “Today’s opening of this office is the beginning of a new Republican Party,” Paul said. “This is going to be a Republican Party that is in big cities and small cities, in the countryside, in the city. It’s going to be about bringing a message that is popular no matter where you’re from, whether you're rich or poor, whether you’re black, white or brown.”Paul then went to a larger grassroots event at the Grace Bible Chapel, where there were protesters from the civil rights group National Action Network outside. The online invitation said the event was intended to ""celebrate the opening of our African-American Engagement Office in Detroit.""Tracking footage from the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, however, shows an overwhelmingly white audience ended up turning out: Detroit is approximately 83 percent African-American.Paul also spoke Friday at the Detroit Economic Club, where he proposed a plan to revitalize U.S. cities through the creation of ""economic freedom zones,"" which would cut federal taxes in communities that have an unemployment rate of 12 percent or higher. The Michigan Democratic Party rejected Paul's advice for Detroit.""Sen. Paul was a vocal opponent of the auto rescue, which saved over a million jobs, and led the Republican effort to shut down the government, costing Michigan's economy hundreds of millions,"" said party spokesman Joshua Pugh. ""His special interest tax handout plan is nothing new. Here in Michigan, Rick Snyder gave $1.8 billion to wealthy special interests, and paid for it with billions in devastating cuts to our local communities and public schools. It's time for our elected leaders to stop the tax giveaways, invest in communities and improve education.""Paul has been trying to do more minority outreach in recent months. In April, Paul spoke at the historically black Howard University, becoming the first Republican elected official to speak on campus in years. Still, he continues to generate skepticism, in part due to his criticism of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 2010, he said, ""I think it’s a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant, but, at the same time, I do believe in private ownership.""On Sunday, Paul said he opposed extending long-term unemployment benefits, because doing so would be a ""disservice"" to workers. African-Americans have consistently had a significantly higher unemployment rate than whites.Neither Paul nor the Michigan GOP returned a request for comment."

Circuit on Monday, leaving Democrats with two options for filling the court's empty seats: change the rules and take away the GOP's power to filibuster certain nominees, or call it a day.As expected, Republicans lined up to block a procedural vote for Robert Wilkins. His nomination needed 60 votes to advance. Instead, the Senate voted 53 to 38, with just two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), siding with Democrats to let him get a confirmation vote. The GOP blockade on Wilkins was no surprise. In the last month, Republicans filibustered Obama's two other D.C. Circuit nominees, Patricia Millett and Nina Pillard. They'll readily admit their opposition isn't personal; they just don't want Obama to put any of his nominees on the court. Some argue the court isn't busy enough to warrant filling its three empty seats, and others make the counterintuitive argument that Obama is ""court-packing"" by filling vacancies. Both arguments gloss over the fact that the president has a constitutional duty to fill empty seats on a court.Democrats have been warning for weeks that they're prepared to invoke the ""nuclear option"" and strip Republicans of their ability to block Obama's nominees if they keep filibustering. With Wilkins' vote now blocked, Democrats have to decide if they have it in them to change institutional rules that both parties are typically reluctant to mess with.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and other Democratic leaders are expected to weigh their next steps in a Monday night leadership meeting. One idea being considered is stripping Republicans' ability to filibuster judicial and executive nominees, but not nominees to the Supreme Court. Aides emphasized that nothing has been decided, however, and leaders will likely discuss their options with the full Democratic caucus during lunch on Tuesday.By the sounds of it during Wilkins' vote, some Democrats are ready to go nuclear right now.""I fear that after tonight, the talk about changing the cloture rules for judicial nominations will no longer be just talk. There will be action,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""We cannot allow this unprecedented, wholesale obstruction to continue without undermining the Senate’s role provided in the Constitution and without harming our independent federal judiciary.""“When will we say enough is enough? Repeatedly over the past month, a minority of senators has blocked qualified nominees by abusing the Senate rules,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said. ""The rules on nominees are not working, and we need to change them.""But Republicans are largely shrugging off Democrats' threats, suspecting it's all talk. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the real reason Democrats want to keep talking about the D.C. Circuit is to take attention away from the rocky rollout of the president's health care law.Democrats are trying to ""distract Americans from the failings of Obamacare,"" McConnell said ahead of Wilkins' vote. ""I hope the Senate will focus on things people care about rather than spend its time trying to distract them.""Shortly after the vote, Obama railed against Republicans for blocking another of his key nominees.""This obstruction is completely unprecedented,"" he said in a statement. ""When it comes to judicial nominations, I am fulfilling my constitutional responsibility, but Congress is not. Instead, Senate Republicans are standing in the way of a fully functioning judiciary that serves the American people.""This is a developing story and has been updated."

It said that 20.552 million people watched coverage airing from 10 AM to 4:30 PM on Monday. (CNN was the top-rated cable news network, and NBC the top-rated broadcast network.)The numbers were a steep drop from Obama's first inauguration, which drew 37 million viewers, and was the second-lowest rating for an inauguration since 1969, as the New York Times' Bill Carter noted.This is not surprising: TV viewership is down for all programs, not just inaugurations, and second inaugurations are rarely as popular as first ones.Obama did manage to easily beat George W. Bush, his immediate predecessor, who drew just 15.5 million viewers for his second inauguration. He was well behind the highest-rated second inaugural -- Richard Nixon's in 1973. That speech was watched by over 32 million.

Circuit Court of Appeals.During a Wednesday hearing on one of Obama's key judicial nominees, Nina Pillard for the D.C. Circuit, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee resurrected the claim that the president's effort to fill three vacancies on the court amounts to ""court-packing."" The term refers to an effort to increase the number of judge slots on a court with the goal of shifting its political balance, not to fill existing vacancies.""The president appears to have targeted the D.C. Circuit in hopes that he can pack the court and stack the deck to his advantage,"" said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) noted that the Senate already confirmed a nominee to the D.C. Circuit this year, Sri Srinivasan, and argued that Obama's efforts to fill the court's remaining vacancies are politically motivated.""I have deep concerns about what the administration is doing now with a package of three nominees to the D.C. Circuit after the Senate just confirmed a very qualified nominee,"" Cruz said. ""I believe [this] is an attempt by this administration to pack that court.""Not only is the charge factually inaccurate -- the court has three empty seats, which the president is constitutionally required to fill -- but one could easily make the case that Republican efforts to prevent Obama from filling empty court seats, thereby keeping those courts from having any more judges appointed by a Democrat, are actual instances of ""court-unpacking.""Scuffles over the D.C. Circuit come as Senate Republicans have been using a variety of methods to block Obama's judicial nominees. Tensions over stalled nominees have gotten so high that Democrats nearly proceeded with filibuster reform earlier this month, a standoff that was defused at the last minute as party leaders cut a deal that allowed some of Obama's executive nominees to get votes. That deal did nothing to unclog Obama's judicial nominees, though, and filling the D.C. Circuit is a major priority for the president.Republicans haven't signaled much interest in allowing D.C. Circuit nominees to get a vote. As it stands, the court has 11 seats, three of which are vacant. Lee and Cruz are both are cosponsors of a bill by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that would eliminate those three seats altogether and keep the court where it is: with eight judges, four of whom were appointed by Democrats and four of whom were appointed by Republicans.Grassley, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, re-upped that argument during Wednesday's hearing. He cited statistics that he said illustrated that the court has the lowest workload of all circuit courts. He also read aloud anonymous statements that he said were from current D.C. Circuit judges arguing that the court isn't busy enough to warrant filling its vacancies. Those statements came in response to a letter that Grassley said he sent to the court's judges asking for their take on the matter.""The judges themselves confirmed everything I've been saying,"" Grassley said. ""Who is in a better position than the judges to make an assessment about the court's workload and the need for additional judges?""But Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Grassley's argument overlooks the fact that the D.C. Circuit, considered second only to the Supreme Court in terms of its importance, takes on particularly hefty and complex cases that require extra scrutiny. He also listed off the names of current and former judges on that court -- including Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts -- who have spoken publicly about the court's intense workload.Plenty of judges who have served on the court ""have commented for the record, not anonymously, their views as to the workload of the court,"" Blumenthal said, ""all indicating very strongly and unequivocally that the workload of this court is certainly a tremendous challenge and growing, rather than diminishing."""

10732	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/mitch-mcconnell-reelection-campaign_n_3178608.html	News	1	Elections	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON –- Mitch McConnell does not seem like an obvious choice to help lead the GOP out of the digital wilderness it has found itself in when it comes to political campaigns. The Senate minority leader most often emerges into the public eye from the floor of the Senate, formally debating Democrats in the chamber or dryly answering (or completely ignoring) reporter questions in the halls. Flashy he is not. Yet McConnell's aides have noticed that the Republican conversation about catching up to Obama's data-driven, clinic of a campaign in 2012 is mostly focused on doing so by 2016. That doesn't help McConnell, who is up for reelection in 2014. And so the attitude among aides to the fifth-term Kentucky Republican is that while some in the GOP are holding soul-searching panel discussions and others are fighting over who gets to control the data and the money in 2016, they're going to run a cutting-edge, digital-savvy campaign in 2014 that shows their party how it's done. ""We have no doubt the GOP will be ready for the 2016 presidential cycle, but in the meantime, we plan to set the standard here in our campaign and establish best practices other conservatives can emulate,"" said Jesse Benton, McConnell's campaign manager.McConnell may not have a Democratic opponent yet; he has so far managed to intimidate a long list of Democrats from taking him on, all while avoiding a primary challenge from his right flank. But McConnell has struggled with a low approval rating. Some polls have shown him as low as 36 percent, though his aides point to other surveys showing him closer to 50 percent. And the fact that he is running a full-throttle reelection campaign is a sign to some that he knows he remains vulnerable. So McConnell is bringing some relatively new blood into an establishment campaign. He has hired a small firm called Crowdverb to run his campaign's data operation. For digital strategy, McConnell is turning to Vincent Harris, a 24-year-old digital specialist who worked for Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) campaign and on the presidential primary runs of Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga). Throw in Benton, the 35-year-old former campaign manager for former Rep. Ron Paul's (R-Texas) 2012 presidential campaign, and the message is clear: McConnell may be 71-years-old and look the part of a local chamber of commerce president, but he is taking an approach to personnel that embraces outsiders and innovation. Crowdverb's co-founder, Cyrus Krohn, is someone who has been ""largely ignored in Republican circles,"" Benton said. The 42-year-old Krohn is of the tech world, not of the GOP political establishment, said Josh Holmes, the 34-year-old McConnell adviser who runs the senator's district office in Washington and was Krohn's connection to McConnell. Krohn, who is based in Seattle like Crowdverb co-founder Todd Herman, has done some work for the Republican party, in a two-year stint as digital director at the Republican National Committee during the 2008 election. But he fell victim at the RNC to ""myth of the savior"" thinking, one senior Republican digital strategist told The Huffington Post on background. The RNC, led by then-chairman Mike Duncan, expected Krohn to ""work magic"" but did not give him the resources or the authority to do so, the strategist said. Krohn spent a few years at CNN in the early '90s before helping to start Slate Magazine, where he eventually became publisher. All told, he spent a decade at Slate, and then from 2004 to 2007 Krohn worked for Microsoft and Yahoo in the world of online video, primarily in politics. ""One of the things that has bothered me most about the political industry is that everyone knows how to talk a good game but very few do anything remarkable or unique. Nowhere is that more prevalent than the world of data and online strategy,"" Holmes, the McConnell adviser, told The Huffington Post in an e-mail. ""Most of the people selling data-based products or online strategy to the political world are from the political world, which immediately disqualifies them in my view. I wouldn't hire an accountant to be our press secretary so why would we hire a political strategist to handle our data?""""I spent about a year talking to a lot of vendors. Very few of them invented the technology, wrote code, understood data analytics, or applied algorithms. Most of them know politics and they have a widget to sell,"" Holmes said. ""[Krohn] and his team invent technology, write code, understand analytics, create algorithms, and build usable dashboards. They don't write ad copy and they don't even seem to have an opinion on the political application of their findings. When you're up in the air it's really comforting to know that the guy flying the plane is a pilot.""Crowdverb is harvesting massive amounts of data from publicly available information on the web, in cooperation with its partner BehaviorMatrix, and using it to enhance the McConnell campaign's voter file, to measure public sentiment about McConnell moment by moment and to track how its different messages and tactics are impacting persuadable voters. ""What we're focused on really is the inherent need for dynamic data to complement traditional campaign tactics,"" Krohn said. ""What can you glean from the live web to understand in real time, based on people's emotions, to get them to take an action on the campaign's behalf: opening an e-mail, making a donation.""Krohn gave an example.""Let's say it's a Sunday talk show in Kentucky and it's a call-in program. All of the audio from that program is digitized for closed captioning. We're able to score what was said, gauge how it played with the electorate, and then determine what the implications were in terms of how people perceived that content via broadcast, and then respond,"" he said. Crowdverb measures the response, in part, by ""maintaining records of individuals who have publicly available profiles, and mapping that back to the voter database.""""We can say, 'We've identified that the comments from this program affected people emotionally in these ways' through predictive modeling as well as actual commentary, and that informs geographically how to communicate with them,"" Krohn said. Benton said the campaign has ""about 41 percent of voter file matched to what they consider a detailed online profile,"" which includes ""things like social media handles, mobile phone number, preferred method of internet browsing, general internet activity, how people prefer to use social networks, and then also certain behavioral things or sentiment things about issues.""He continued, ""This is what the Obama machine did.""That may be a stretch. The Obama campaign, according to Sasha Issenberg's reporting, began the 2012 election ""confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans whose votes had put him in the White House,"" and then worked to identify more potential supporters and recruited them one by one with individualized outreach.If McConnell has 40 percent of the voter file identified, they may be on their way to doing some of what Obama did. Benton explained how the real time feedback from Crowdverb will help the McConnell campaign monitor how the electorate is moving, and will then inform how to respond.""Because the boss is always getting attacked, we're seeing a little bit more cycnicism about the boss than we'd like to see. They show us what they think is a critical level of cynicism that would start to hurt, and at this point in time we are below that,"" Benton said. ""But if we start to see a cynicism indices indicate a rise and that would tell us there could be a problem there, we would try to encourage our netroots people to make phone from home calls to people where their cynicism indexes are rising … with a sincerity message.""That element of engaging grassroots supporters to influence their friends was a key component of the Obama campaign ground game. Harris' job in running the campaign's digital strategy is not so much the harvesting and organizing of data as it is the promotion of the candidate through new media. ""Usually campaigns have a communications plan centered only on traditional media but Team McConnell believes in the emerging Buzzfeed culture: memes, web videos, and persuasion by entertainment,"" Harris said. ""They understand that when given a choice, many people would prefer to look at cat photos than engage with their elected officials. So we're working hard to ensure the senator's message breaks through what has become a cluttered medium.""The McConnell team was eager to talk about their burgeoning digital operation, in an obvious attempt to project strength to potential opponents and hopefully keep the field clear as long as possible. Yet, it's not a bluff. McConnell, as always, is playing for keeps. "

Marriott Hotel hosted by two of his campaign's top fundraisers. Romney rejoined the board of directors at Marriott International after losing the election last year.CNN reports that the Romneys will also attend Saturday night's black tie Alfalfa Club Dinner while in Washington. Obama spoke at last year's event.Romney has done his best to remain out of the spotlight following his loss to Obama. He ate lunch with the president after his defeat in November, and has been spotted in various places, but for the most part has remained largely out of the public eye.On Monday, an aide told NBC News that Romney was at his beach home in La Jolla, Calif., during Obama's inauguration. While Romney reportedly had ""no big plans,"" the aide said it was ""doubtful"" that Romney would watch the ceremony.Romney was the first losing presidential candidate not to attend the inauguration since Michael Dukakis in 1989. Dukakis reportedly opted to remain in Massachusetts, watching the day's events on television while eating a tuna sandwich. He did, however, send a telegram to the White House, offering incoming President George H.W. Bush his congratulations."

But though she is well-schooled in the basics -- firm handshake, straight-ahead manner and careful talking points -- Grimes launched her campaign without a website, position papers, staff or much of anything else.Team Mitch unloaded with derision and precision, posting an online video portraying Grimes as Barack Obama's dancing partner (the president isn't popular in Kentucky) and a tree-hugging foe of the state's powerful coal industry.But a Senate race is a long-distance affair, especially in Kentucky, where polls show that McConnell, the Senate minority leader, is weak, at a time when voters everywhere despise Congress and Washington. And now in the second furlong, evidence is beginning to emerge that Grimes may turn into a surprisingly formidable foe for a man who is more than twice her age.In her first major appearance before national party leaders, Saturday on Martha's Vineyard, Grimes wowed Democratic senators, Senate candidates and donors alike at the party's annual private summer fundraising retreat.Each year the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee invites top donors to schmooze with senators, especially those up for reelection, and inspect the merchandise of challengers who will take on Republican incumbents.Grimes spoke to the group Saturday morning and brought the jaded and normally undemonstrative crowd to its feet in wild applause, said one top donor, who had been deeply skeptical of the idea that McConnell could be knocked off by anyone. He and another attendee spoke to The Huffington Post on the condition that their names not be used.Grimes' feisty talk, the sources said, mixed a commitment to a Democratic job-creation agenda with a pedal-to-the-metal attack on McConnell.""I've been going to these for years, and I have never, until this morning, seen a candidate get a standing O,"" said the donor, who is among the top 100 contributors to the committee over the last five years. ""It was amazing.""Clearly, dislike of McConnell -- a shrewd, remorseless combatant in the Senate and in GOP circles nationally -- is one reason why Grimes was so well-received in Martha's Vineyard. It's also well-known that former President Bill Clinton, who is close to Grimes' father, encouraged her to enter the race.But another reason that she was a hit, an attendee said, was that she exceeded expectations with a good speech, strong presence and youthful appeal. ""She's attractive, by the way,"" the donor said. ""Doesn't hurt."""

Obama defeated Romney by a 51 to 47 percent margin.Shortly after the election Gallup's editor-in-chief Frank Newport pledged to conduct an internal review of Gallup's telephone survey methodology. As promised, Newport reviewed on Saturday the kinds of studies conducted on issues including drawing samples, interviewing voters, and how to weight data and select the likely electorate. The company pledges to make the findings of its ongoing review publicly available.Although much analysis is now complete and set to be unveiled June 4, the investigation awaits ""a major experiment"" in conjunction with the gubernatorial campaigns in the fall.""We take it seriously"" when polls misfire, Newport explained on Saturday. ""We've been doing presidential polling since 1936 which is what put George Gallup on the map ...The results [in 2012] certainly were not what we wanted them to be from Gallup's perspective.""Newport's remarks came during a private, on-the-record briefing in Boston attended by The Huffington Post, and a handful of other pollsters and academic researchers at the annual American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) conference.Michael Traugott, a University of Michigan political scientist and survey methodologist retained by the company for the review, said he recommended broadening the scope and timing of the inquiry.""Early on,"" Traugott said, ""Frank and I had a conversation, about trying to learn what we could from an investigation of the data"" collected during the 2012 campaign, ""but then using that information to design a series of experiments going forward.""Traugott also said he recommended reviewing all of Gallup's methods and assessing the data collected before the 2012 campaign. ""We have been assembling data on presidential approval back to 2002 as a benchmark to look at the Gallup data in relations to other data and also party identification data going back.""His analysis confirms, for example, that by ""a small but consistent amount,"" ratings of President George W. Bush ""were a little bit higher than the average"" of other pollsters ""and the Obama ratings were a little bit lower than the average."" Those findings are consistent with a Huffington Post investigation of Gallup's results published in June 2012.Traugott also clarified that Gallup ""has agreed to make all of this information publicly available."" He stressed that both he and Newport, as former presidents of AAPOR ""are firmly committed to transparency. And this is an ongoing part of our relationship as well.""When pressed on whether that included releasing raw respondent-level data, Newport said that although they are ""still making the final decisions, we think we'll try to make the data available as well."" Such data will allow other scholars and researchers to attempt to replicate Traugott's findings and test other theories. On Saturday, Newport also asked assembled AAPOR researchers for further input on a list of 20 specific parts -- virtually every aspect -- of Gallup's methodology included in the review.While Newport declined to reveal specific findings from the review ahead of the June 4 announcement, he shared some new information.One of the experiments, for example, checked on potential bias associated with the Gallup brand name by running a full ""shadow"" sample to a recent Gallup poll in which respondents were told the polster was ""Selection Research Incorporated,"" rather than Gallup. ""The Gallup name significantly increased the response rate,"" Newport said, but without producing differences in the demographics of the resulting sample.Newport also explained that earlier this year, the company changed how it asks respondents to describe their race, replacing yes/no questions critiqued in last year's Huffington Post investigation with a question in which respondents could select more than one in a list of potential answers. That change allowed for a related modification to Gallup's weighting procedure. ""We think that's already had some impact on our data,"" Newport said.It is difficult, Traugott explained, to reconstruct Gallup's problems ""retrospectively"" using the data collected last fall. Instead, he convinced Gallup to conduct experiments to determine if alternative methods would have produced different and more accurate results. Because such experiments only make sense ""in the context of a campaign,"" Traugott explained, they decided to undertake them during the upcoming gubernatorial campaigns in Virginia and possibly New Jersey. He stressed that the experiments would only be used for further analysis, and would not be released publicly before the election.Three academic survey methodologists are joining Traugott in the investigation: Chris Wlezien from Temple University, an expert in likely voter models; James Wagner from the University of Michigan, an authority in telephone survey operations; and Frauke Kreuter from the University of Maryland, an expert on sampling and weighting.Shortly after the election, Newport speculated that ""it is likely that we could see significantly fewer polls conducted in the 2016 election."" Asked Saturday if he was signaling Gallup's intention to withdraw from polling in the next presidential race, Newport replied, ""Well, check back with us in 2016. I don't know what any polling organization is doing in 2016,"" given the increasing challenges to traditional pollster methods.However, despite the months of criticism, Newport was upbeat about the potential for improvements with advances in technology. He spoke favorably about a future in which ""polling is augmented by non-probability data, administrative data, social media data.""""I think it is an exciting time,"" he said later. ""Rather than doing things the same way in any business, it's always exciting when technology in particular opens up all these other opportunities."""

Hoyer, the Democratic House whip who represents southern Maryland, complained privately to colleagues about the slight earlier Thursday, HuffPost was told. A second House source confirmed the lack of an invitation to Pelosi and Hoyer, and a Reid aide said that the Senate majority leader was not invited.""I wanna welcome members of Congress here,"" Bush said Thursday, opening his speech in Dallas. ""I thank the speaker for coming.""The snub is a reminder of the tense relationship that Bush had with Democrats as president. Reid famously called him a ""liar,"" and Pelosi made no attempt to conceal her contempt for him.

Thigpen, who will challenge Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) in next year's primary to represent North Carolina's 3rd District, said the measure signed into law by Gov. Pat McCrory (R) earlier this month is ""discriminatory."" ""You can paint a turd and sell it as art, but it's still a turd,"" Thigpen said in an article posted to his Facebook page on Monday. ""This is 2013 and any legislator that puts forth such a discriminatory bill should be laughed out of office. This is America, not Russia."" He continued, ""You have those that honestly believe our country would be better off turning back the clock to years ago, also known as the 'good-old days,' which weren't all that good for everyone. After suppressing the right to vote, what's next? Are these so-called Representatives going to push for preventing our military, veterans, and women from voting?""When asked by Roll Call about his remarks, Thigpen said he supports requiring voter identification at the polls, but only if steps are taken to make sure the requirement does not discriminate against any individuals.""I do support requiring voters to provide a photo ID in order to vote, as long as there isn’t any undo burden or expense placed on the voter in order to do so,"" he said. ""Otherwise, it’s considered a poll-tax.. I honestly believe that any legislation which may invariably reduce voter turnout is a bad thing and cannot imagine what argument, not discriminatory in some fashion, could be made to purport differently."" North Carolina's law, in addition to requiring identification at the voting booth, reduces early voting time, ends same-day voter registration, eliminates a program to pre-register minors and stops a state-sponsored voter registration drive. The law also scales back the amount of public disclosure required for ""dark money"" groups.Last week, former Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke out against the North Carolina law, saying it would only hurt the Republican Party.""I want to see policies that encourage every American to vote, not make it more difficult to vote,"" Powell said while addressing a Raleigh forum. ""It immediately turns off a voting block the Republican Party needs... These kinds of actions do not build on the base. It just turns people away."""

""Something is horribly wrong in [this] city.""Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota has said he would continue current Mayor Michael Bloomberg's education policies.""That's all I need to know once I hear that,"" Mulgrew said, explaining his support for de Blasio.Below, more from the AP:NEW YORK — New York City mayoral candidate Bill Thompson conceded the Democratic primary race to front-runner Bill de Blasio on Monday, averting a potential runoff and clearing the way for de Blasio to campaign for the general election.Thompson endorsed de Blasio at City Hall, saying he was proud to support him as the party's nominee.The potential runoff had loomed as another act in the Democratic drama over choosing a successor to three-term Mayor Michael Bloomberg – a fight that would keep Democrats tilting at each other while Republicans and independents looked ahead to the general election. With Thompson, the Democrats' 2009 mayoral nominee, out of the race, de Blasio will face Republican nominee Joe Lhota on Nov. 5.Gov. Andrew Cuomo played a role in brokering the deal, according to two people familiar with Thompson's decision who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement.""New York will be an even greater city under the leadership of Mayor Bill de Blasio,"" Cuomo said at the City Hall event.In unofficial returns with 99 percent of precincts reporting, de Blasio had had 40.3 percent of the vote – slightly more than the 40 percent threshold needed to win outright. Thompson was second with 26.2 percent.A runoff had long been expected in the crowded Democratic race. But after last week's unofficial returns put de Blasio above the 40 percent mark, Thompson faced pressure to concede and spare the party further division ahead of the general election.He had said as recently as Sunday he would wait until the official tally was finished.""I think that's important. We want to see every vote counted,"" he said then.Thompson called the Rev. Al Sharpton, an important city power broker, to inform him early Monday of his decision, according to a person close to Sharpton who was not authorized to speak on his behalf and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.Sharpton endorsed his longtime friend Thompson during his 2009 mayoral bid but stayed on the sidelines this race, depriving Thompson of a loud advocate in his bid to win the majority of African-American voters. De Blasio and Thompson ran even among African-American voters, according to exit polls.Sharpton was not expected to attend the morning rally but will likely endorse de Blasio in the coming days, according to the person.Currently the city's elected public advocate, de Blasio has been riding a wave of momentum that built during the last month of his campaign, which he billed as ""a progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era.""After lagging in the polls, de Blasio got voters' attention by protesting a hospital closing – and getting arrested – and airing ads in which his teenage son gave voice to his liberal platform and showed New Yorkers de Blasio's interracial family.Thompson, a former city comptroller and the only African-American in the race, has run a more centrist campaign, offering himself as a seasoned, thoughtful manager.Thompson hadn't led in polls of the crowded Democratic field this year, but supporters noted that he had been underestimated in the past: Thompson came much closer than polls predicted to unseating Bloomberg in 2009, despite being vastly outspent.De Blasio has said Thompson had every right to want the official count.On Friday, elections officials began checking vote totals from more than 645,000 ballots cast via lever machines that were hauled out of storage for the primary, after the elections board worried it wouldn't be able to reprogram the city's newer, optical-scanner devices for a potential runoff. That count was finished Sunday night and was to be announced Monday afternoon.The elections board was beginning to count some 78,000 absentee and other paper ballots Monday.While a runoff had been anticipated, trying to figure out who would be in it had been something like Parcheesi for politics junkies.City Council Speaker Christine Quinn was the front-runner for months and was jousting with Thompson for second place in polls as recent as early September. Ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner leaped to the front of the pack for a time after getting into the race in May, before the public learned that his X-rated exchanges with women online continued even after similar sexting spurred his 2011 resignation from Congress.Regardless of the mayor's race, Democrats still will be asked to go to the polls again on Oct. 1. There's a runoff between City Councilwoman Letitia James and state Sen. Daniel Squadron for the party's nomination to succeed de Blasio as public advocate.If de Blasio's final vote count ends up below 40 percent, the mayoral primary will also be on the ballot, because Thompson missed the Friday deadline to have it removed.Lhota ramped up his general election campaign over the weekend and was expected to address de Blasio's nomination later Monday. Adolfo Carrion Jr., a former Bronx borough president running as an independent, will also be on the November ballot.Michael McLaughlin contributed to this report.This post has been updated with more from the AP."

""Something is horribly wrong in [this] city.""Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota has said he would continue current Mayor Michael Bloomberg's education policies.""That's all I need to know once I hear that,"" Mulgrew said, explaining his support for de Blasio.Below, more from the AP:NEW YORK — New York City mayoral candidate Bill Thompson conceded the Democratic primary race to front-runner Bill de Blasio on Monday, averting a potential runoff and clearing the way for de Blasio to campaign for the general election.Thompson endorsed de Blasio at City Hall, saying he was proud to support him as the party's nominee.The potential runoff had loomed as another act in the Democratic drama over choosing a successor to three-term Mayor Michael Bloomberg – a fight that would keep Democrats tilting at each other while Republicans and independents looked ahead to the general election. With Thompson, the Democrats' 2009 mayoral nominee, out of the race, de Blasio will face Republican nominee Joe Lhota on Nov. 5.Gov. Andrew Cuomo played a role in brokering the deal, according to two people familiar with Thompson's decision who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement.""New York will be an even greater city under the leadership of Mayor Bill de Blasio,"" Cuomo said at the City Hall event.In unofficial returns with 99 percent of precincts reporting, de Blasio had had 40.3 percent of the vote – slightly more than the 40 percent threshold needed to win outright. Thompson was second with 26.2 percent.A runoff had long been expected in the crowded Democratic race. But after last week's unofficial returns put de Blasio above the 40 percent mark, Thompson faced pressure to concede and spare the party further division ahead of the general election.He had said as recently as Sunday he would wait until the official tally was finished.""I think that's important. We want to see every vote counted,"" he said then.Thompson called the Rev. Al Sharpton, an important city power broker, to inform him early Monday of his decision, according to a person close to Sharpton who was not authorized to speak on his behalf and thus spoke on condition of anonymity.Sharpton endorsed his longtime friend Thompson during his 2009 mayoral bid but stayed on the sidelines this race, depriving Thompson of a loud advocate in his bid to win the majority of African-American voters. De Blasio and Thompson ran even among African-American voters, according to exit polls.Sharpton was not expected to attend the morning rally but will likely endorse de Blasio in the coming days, according to the person.Currently the city's elected public advocate, de Blasio has been riding a wave of momentum that built during the last month of his campaign, which he billed as ""a progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era.""After lagging in the polls, de Blasio got voters' attention by protesting a hospital closing – and getting arrested – and airing ads in which his teenage son gave voice to his liberal platform and showed New Yorkers de Blasio's interracial family.Thompson, a former city comptroller and the only African-American in the race, has run a more centrist campaign, offering himself as a seasoned, thoughtful manager.Thompson hadn't led in polls of the crowded Democratic field this year, but supporters noted that he had been underestimated in the past: Thompson came much closer than polls predicted to unseating Bloomberg in 2009, despite being vastly outspent.De Blasio has said Thompson had every right to want the official count.On Friday, elections officials began checking vote totals from more than 645,000 ballots cast via lever machines that were hauled out of storage for the primary, after the elections board worried it wouldn't be able to reprogram the city's newer, optical-scanner devices for a potential runoff. That count was finished Sunday night and was to be announced Monday afternoon.The elections board was beginning to count some 78,000 absentee and other paper ballots Monday.While a runoff had been anticipated, trying to figure out who would be in it had been something like Parcheesi for politics junkies.City Council Speaker Christine Quinn was the front-runner for months and was jousting with Thompson for second place in polls as recent as early September. Ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner leaped to the front of the pack for a time after getting into the race in May, before the public learned that his X-rated exchanges with women online continued even after similar sexting spurred his 2011 resignation from Congress.Regardless of the mayor's race, Democrats still will be asked to go to the polls again on Oct. 1. There's a runoff between City Councilwoman Letitia James and state Sen. Daniel Squadron for the party's nomination to succeed de Blasio as public advocate.If de Blasio's final vote count ends up below 40 percent, the mayoral primary will also be on the ballot, because Thompson missed the Friday deadline to have it removed.Lhota ramped up his general election campaign over the weekend and was expected to address de Blasio's nomination later Monday. Adolfo Carrion Jr., a former Bronx borough president running as an independent, will also be on the November ballot.Michael McLaughlin contributed to this report.This post has been updated with more from the AP."

During an interview with CNN, Mariano said that Christie could suffer a heart attack or stroke during his tenure. ""I'm worried about this man dying in office,"" she said. His response? Take a family history. According to an AP and HuffPost report, Christie told the doctor to ""shut up"" unless she had personally examined him and learned about his family history of heart risk. Undeterred, Mariano responded (via an interview with Bloomberg), saying that ""you don't have to be a doctor to see that he is obese.""Who is right? And is it possible to be healthy and obese? As Christie said on The Late Show with David Letterman, ""I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life.""""Obesity leads to an increase risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. Those are risk factors for heart disease, but so is smoking and family history,"" Dr. Robert Michler, chairman of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, told HuffPost. ""Hundreds of thousands of people who are obese reach old age and even die without having a heart attack or stroke.""It's an important distinction: Obesity is not a condition that causes heart attacks directly. Instead, it increases the risk of developing chronic conditions like major heart disease, high cholesterol and hypertension and those, in turn, often result in heart attack and stroke. Does the obese Christie, 50, have a higher chance of developing one of these conditions and of subsequently dying of a cardiac event? Yes. But that doesn't mean he will. According to New York University's Langone Weight Management Center, about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related complications, though 35.7 percent of the U.S. population is obese (about 112 million people), according to the latest estimates from the CDC. And, as a recent study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found, obesity in and of itself is not a good predictor of health status. They found that during a six year period, obese study participants were no more likely to die than their healthy-weight counterparts if they didn't have one of the chronic diseases associated with obesity, like Type 2 diabetes or hypertension. Early death may not be the primary outcome of obesity, but illness abounds. Obesity is associated with heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, sleep apnea and other respiratory problems, and even some cancers. It also exacerbates other conditions, like asthma, for which Christie has previously been hospitalized. Although we don't know the governor's BMI or weight information, it is relevant to his overall heart attack risk. According to NYU Langone, an obese person has an average of six times the heart disease risk as a non-obese person. And that risk increases depending on how obese you are. In the Framingham Heart Study, a famous, longitudinal study of overall cardiac risk, researchers found that for every increment increase in an adult man's BMI, there was an associated five percent increased risk of heart failure. What's interesting is that obese heart failure patients have better outcomes and are less likely to die than heart failure patients with a healthy weight -- something that doctors refer to as the ""heart failure paradox,"" explains Michler.Stroke risk, which Mariano also expressed concern about, increases with BMI, as well: for every increment increase of BMI, the risk of ischemic stroke goes up four percent and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke increases six percent. Despite his bluster and understandable dismay that a doctor who hasn't examined him would speculate about his health, it seems as though the risks of remaining so profoundly overweight have begun to sink in. ""I have been remarkably healthy,"" Christie told Letterman. ""My doctor continues to warn me my luck is going to run out relatively soon. So, believe me, it is something that I am very conscious of."""

(CNN was the top-rated cable news network, and NBC the top-rated broadcast network.)The numbers were a steep drop from Obama's first inauguration, which drew 37 million viewers, and was the second-lowest rating for an inauguration since 1969, as the New York Times' Bill Carter noted.This is not surprising: TV viewership is down for all programs, not just inaugurations, and second inaugurations are rarely as popular as first ones.Obama did manage to easily beat George W. Bush, his immediate predecessor, who drew just 15.5 million viewers for his second inauguration. He was well behind the highest-rated second inaugural -- Richard Nixon's in 1973. That speech was watched by over 32 million.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), called black and Hispanic voters “uninformed” and “deceived"" during a speech to conservative activists in February.  After attending a panel on minority outreach at the FreedomWorks grassroots summit, Cruz, a Cuban-American, born-again Christian, spoke at the conference. He noted that a previous speaker ""mentioned something about Hispanics being uninformed or deceived."" ""Well, the same thing is true of the black population,” Cruz said.Cruz also suggested how blacks and Hispanics should vote. “As a matter of fact, if we could communicate the truth, not only to the Hispanics but to the black population, all blacks should be Republican,"" he said.“Highly religious, strongly pro-family, strongly pro-life” values and high military enrollment rates align Hispanics’ principles with the Republican Party’s, said Cruz.Exit polls from the 2012 election, however, indicated that a majority of Latino voters, 59 percent, supported same-sex marriage, while an even larger majority, 66 percent, supported abortion rights. Fifty-two percent of black voters supported same-sex marriage, the polls showed.Cruz has made headlines lately with similarly controversial comments. At an event sponsored by the gun rights advocacy group OK2A and the anti-government Tulsa 9.12 Project in November, Cruz claimed that God ordains capital punishment.“You know, the Bible is so clear,"" he said. ""Go to Genesis Chapter 9 and you will find the death penalty clearly stated in Genesis Chapter 9 ... God ordains the death penalty!”Cruz also argued that the legalization of same-sex marriage would lead to an unjustified outpouring of hate-speech accusations. “You preach Romans Chapter 1 in your church, you’re going to be called before a court for hate speech,” Cruz said.In his February speech, Cruz promoted the abolishment of political correctness. “We have been guilty of following two things that we totally have to throw aside. Number one is political correctness,” Cruz said. “We have been destroyed by political correctness. And we must learn to tell the truth unequivocally.”The 74-year-old tea party icon also attributed “all the civil rights” that African-Americans have achieved to Republicans. “Let’s talk about the black population. All the civil rights that the African Americans have obtained have come from Republicans,” Cruz said. “But you know what, Democrats took the credit.”"

This increasingly influential demographic known as the ""millennial generation"" has been a traditional base of Obama's support.More than 50 percent of respondents in the survey, taken between Oct. 30 and Nov. 11, said they disapproved of how the Democratic president handled key issues in his second term, including Syria, Iran, the economy, healthcare and the federal budget deficit.Most cited the economy as their top concern.Still, disapproval ratings were higher for both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. And a plurality of respondents, 46 percent, said they would still vote for Obama for president if they could recast their 2012 ballots, compared with 35 percent who said they would vote for the then-Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.Some 55 percent of the survey respondents who reported casting ballots in the 2012 presidential election said they had voted for Obama, compared with 33 percent for Romney.Institute of Politics Director Trey Grayson said the poll revealed cracks forming in Obama's base.""This isn't a problem for Obama because he's not coming up for election again,"" Grayson said in a conference call with reporters. ""But it is a potential problem for any Democratic candidate seeking to mobilize young Americans.""The results follow a CNN/ORC poll released on Nov. 25 that showed a growing number of Americans doubted Obama's ability to manage the nation, amid ongoing problems plaguing the president's signature domestic policy achievement, the healthcare reform law known as Obamacare.Obama's administration has also come under fire. Critics claim it is dealing poorly with the Syrian government over its alleged use of chemical weapons and Iran over its nuclear ambitions, and has failed to rein in U.S. public spending or revive the economy.Some 57 percent of respondents in the Harvard poll said they disapproved of the Obamacare law, with 40 percent expecting the quality of healthcare to worsen and about half expecting such costs to rise.""Among the 22 percent in our survey who report that they have no insurance, less than one-third tell us they are likely to enroll,"" according to the report detailing the survey findings. ""A plurality however are 50-50 and are therefore open to enrolling under the right circumstances."" UNHAPPY WITH EVERYONEThe Harvard survey respondents spread out the blame for Washington's shortcomings beyond Obama and the Democratic Party. In terms of job performance, 54 percent said they disapproved of the president, 59 percent disapproved of Democrats in Congress, and a whopping 75 percent disapproved of Republicans in Congress.Conservative U.S. Republicans took a hard line in the fight over October's U.S. government shutdown, which was waged over the party's demands to stop the launch of Obamacare. But delays in pay to some public workers, closings of national parks and reductions in public services only deepened Americans' frustration.""Nobody was happy with anybody after the shutdown,"" Grayson said.Asked which proposals they would prefer to see enacted to cut the federal deficit, respondents tended to favor increasing taxes for the wealthy and cutting certain types of military spending - including on the nuclear arsenal and the size of the Navy fleet.More than 70 percent also said they would prefer not to see any cuts to education spending on kindergarten through high school, the poll showed.In a sign of ambivalence over the role of Edward Snowden, a contractor for the National Security Agency, in unveiling details of the U.S. spying program, 52 percent of survey respondents said they were not sure if he was a traitor or a patriot. Some 22 percent labeled him a traitor and an equal 22 percent labeled him a patriot.Snowden is living in Russia as a fugitive after President Vladimir Putin granted him asylum against Washington's wishes.""The Snowden stuff shows that these 18-to-29-year-olds are not that supportive of giving up personal information for the interests of national security,"" Grayson said.

(AP) — Residents in a small Rhode Island town are voting Saturday on whether four town council members should be recalled for proposing a change in the way the town issues gun permits.The rare recall election was prompted by gun rights supporters who said the four Exeter council members ignored their objections to a failed proposal to allow the attorney general to oversee the town's concealed weapons permits.Both sides were concerned about low-turnout with snow in the forecast.The four council members supported a resolution asking the state's General Assembly to allow the state attorney general to process concealed weapons permits. Under current law, those seeking a permit may apply to either the attorney general or their local police. Since Exeter doesn't have a police department — just a single town sergeant — the job now falls to the town clerk, who the council members said lacks the resources to conduct proper background checks.Even though the council's request never got a vote in the Assembly, gun rights supporters began petitioning for a recall, saying the town's leaders had ignored the concerns of hundreds of people who turned out for a meeting on the proposal.Debates about gun policy have sparked similar ouster efforts elsewhere. In September, two Democratic Colorado state senators were recalled over their support for changes to gun laws following the theater massacre outside Denver in 2012.The recall vote coincidentally comes on the anniversary of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting.The four officials being targeted by the recall effort are Council President Arlene Hicks and Councilmen Cal Ellis, Robert Johnson and William Monahan. All are Democrats. A fifth member is not up for recall: independent Councilman Raymond Morrissey Jr., who voted against the resolution.Should one or more of the council members be recalled, their council seats will go to the losing candidates from the last election. Daniel W. Patterson would get the first seat, Edward F. Nataly the second and Lincoln P. Picillo the third.The fourth seat would be filled by a council appointment.Polls close at 8 p.m.

Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) at 10 percent, comptroller John Liu at 6 percent and former council member Sal Albanese at 1 percent. Another 7 percent was undecided.De Blasio also held the lead in three potential runoff scenarios, beating Quinn by 54 percent to 38 percent, Thompson by 50 percent to 40 percent, and Weiner by a whopping 72 percent to 22 percent.But voters' choices are hardly set in stone: 34 percent, including 37 percent who backed de Blasio, said there was a good chance they'd change their minds.While there was little evidence of a gender gap among voters, there was a ""measurable racial divide,"" according to the poll. Thompson led among black voters, with 39 percent, followed by de Blasio and Quinn. Among white voters, de Blasio led with 39 percent, followed by Quinn and then Thompson.De Blasio's 30 percent is the greatest share of the vote any candidate has attracted so far in polling on the race. In the weeks since Weiner's numbers dropped after new revelations of his inappropriate behavior, most surveys have shown Quinn leading the field, although generally with support in the mid-20s, far below the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff. But as shown by HuffPost Pollster's chart, which includes all publicly available polling, de Blasio and Thompson's numbers have also risen.'); if (location.host === ""m.huffpost.com"") { jQuery('iframe[src^=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster""]').parent().each(function() { if (jQuery(this).hasClass('flex-video')) { jQuery(this)[0].style.height = '400px'; } }); } }catch(e){}De Blasio's campaign, until recently mired in the middle of the pack, has been buoyed by improving numbers and a front-page New York Times story.""I always had faith…when people start to focus, a real progressive impulse was going to come out in the New York City electorate,” de Blasio told Politicker in July, after an earlier poll found him gaining.De Blasio attracted 40 percent of the city's ""very liberal"" voters in Tuesday's poll. He has sought to present himself as the campaign's most progressive candidate, as HuffPost's Michael McLaughlin reported Sunday:For months, de Blasio stumped with bread-and-butter proposals to aid the poor and working class. He appealed to the middle class with a liberal agenda promoting green technology, equality for women in the workplace, and job growth in the tech and entertainment industries. Now, it seemed, his message was breaking through....His campaign rests on the idea that New York is ""a tale of two cities,"" divided between the haves and have-nots. Almost half of the city's population lived in or near poverty in 2011 -- a statistic that de Blasio frequently mentions. The villain in his story is none other than billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The pre-K tax is perhaps the centerpiece of his platform to alleviate economic and racial disparities. But de Blasio, the city's public advocate since 2009, also wants to build affordable housing, rescue hospitals on the verge of closing and reform the police department's controversial stop-and-frisk program.A judge ruled Monday that the NYPD's use of the stop-and-frisk tactic violated the rights of thousands of New Yorkers.Sixty percent of likely Democratic voters view the stop-and-frisk program as excessive, while 31 percent find it acceptable, according to Tuesday's poll.The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 579 likely primary voters by phone between Aug. 7 and 12.CORRECTION: This post originally misstated the candidates' rankings among white voters."
10990	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/03/de-blasio-bratton_n_4378748.html	News	1	Elections	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Bill de Blasio, the soon-to-be mayor of New York, surged to prominence over the summer while promising to reform the city’s police department.He said he would scale back the rampant use of stop and frisk, the controversial practice of stopping suspects and frisking them for guns and drugs, which led to hundreds of thousands of arrests of mostly black and Latino New Yorkers on minor marijuana charges. And he vowed to dismiss the current police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, who made stop and frisk a keystone of his tenure and vigorously defended it in the press and in court to those who say that the way he has used it infringes on the rights of minorities. But now de Blasio is considering a replacement for Kelly who has arguably done more than anyone else in the United States -- including Kelly himself -- to popularize the use of stop and frisk and other aggressive tactics associated with racial profiling.William Bratton, who led the Boston Police Department in 1993 and oversaw dramatic crime reductions while leading the New York City Police Department from 1994 to 1996 and the Los Angeles Police Department from 2002 to 2009, is a superstar cop and a hero to many. But some critics of the aggressive policing methods championed by Kelly say he’s a poor choice to lead the department in a new direction. “He would be terrible,” said Harry Levine, a sociology professor at Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center, who studies marijuana arrests. “Bratton is Kelly policing with charm, charisma, savoir-faire, and unbelievably brilliant PR skills.” Others are less critical. Adhyl Polanco, an NYPD officer who has testified against Kelly’s policies in hearings and trials, said he would welcome Bratton back to the force. Stop and frisk isn’t the problem with the NYPD today, Polanco said. “It’s the abuse that’s the problem.” Whether a potential Bratton appointment is a good or bad thing largely depends on the lens through which you view New York City. Is New York’s transformation into one of the safest cities in the U.S. over the last 20 years an unalloyed success story? Or is it a “tale of two cities” in which the haves keep improving their lot, while the have-nots get stopped and frisked and often thrown in jail by those who see them as criminals in the making? Bratton with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. De Blasio ran a very successful campaign arguing the latter, making it all the more surprising he could choose a police commissioner championed by people who see New York through the first lens. As the head of the NYPD, Bratton was perhaps the first police commissioner in the country to embrace the “broken windows” theory of policing -- the idea that the police can discourage criminals from acting with impunity by using the full force of the law to crack down on vandalism and other petty displays of contempt for the authorities.Bratton unleashed patrol officers to stop people for all sorts of minor and suspected violations, and to frisk them for drugs and guns. During his 27 months as New York’s top cop, the city’s arrest rate soared and reports of serious crimes decreased by 33 percent, an extraordinary decline. Supporters praised Bratton both for his hard-nosed style and his introduction of CompStat, a police-intelligence computer system that allows commanders to track crime and arrest data in real time and essentially encourages officers to make more arrests. But as the arrest rate climbed, so did charges of police misconduct, especially in precincts heavily populated by blacks and Latinos. Kelly, who took over from Bratton’s successor, Bernard Kerik, in 2002, embraced and expanded on Bratton’s tactics in a way that many consider excessive and discriminatory against minorities. An analysis of the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practice by the New York Civil Liberties Union found that innocent black and Latino New Yorkers were stopped 400,000 times in 2012, far more often than whites. The report also found that police made more arrests for marijuana possession last year than for any other crime, despite support from both Kelly and Mayor Michael Bloomberg for a proposal to decriminalize open possession of small amounts of the drug.In recent years, Bratton has at times seemed eager to distance himself from Kelly’s approach to policing. At a 2012 business group meeting in New York, he compared stop and frisk to chemotherapy, calling it an “intrusive power,” before adding, “applied in the right way, it can have the effect of reducing crime.”Some black and Latino leaders support Bratton's ""right way” of using stop and frisk, largely because of his accomplishments as the police chief in Los Angeles between 2002 and 2009. John Mack, a black civil rights veteran and the former director of the Los Angeles Urban League, offered a full-throated endorsement of Bratton. “He’s sensitive to the importance of a police department not operating like an occupation force in communities of color,” he said. “The broken windows theory, that’s part of his philosophy, but that was not an issue here in Los Angeles.”Mack worked closely with Bratton in LA and says he has personally recommended him to de Blasio. Under Bratton’s leadership, he said, “the police were not just going after every young black African American on the streets of South Los Angeles.” Bratton greets immigrant reform supporters as they march on Hollywood Boulevard on June 24, 2007 in Los Angeles, California. When Bratton arrived in LA, violent crimes were on the rise. The city’s police department faced corruption allegations and operated under federal oversight, and the historically strained relationship between the city’s cops and black residents was as fraught as ever. Soon after taking over the department, Bratton sat down with some of the LAPD’s fiercest critics, including Mack and civil rights attorney Connie Rice, who had filed a number of lawsuits against the department, and asked for their support. He later tapped Rice to investigate allegations that gang officers from a troubled division had stolen drugs and framed suspects. Meanwhile, the officers who served under him were encouraged to build relationships with black and Latino community leaders, including former gang members, in a cooperative effort to reduce gang violence in the city.By the end of his tenure, crime was down 54 percent from 2001, and race relations seemed to be improving. That year, 51 percent of residents said that the police in their communities treated members of all racial and ethnic groups fairly “almost all the time” or “most of the time,” up from 44 percent in 2005, according to a Harvard University study.In November, de Blasio met with Bratton and two other candidates for New York’s top cop job: Philip Banks III and Rafael Pineiro, both of whom currently serve in high-ranking jobs under Kelly. Banks is black, and Pineiro is Latino, but as veterans of Kelly’s department, neither candidate fully represents a break from the NYPD’s recent past.As the city’s public advocate, de Blasio released a report showing that stopping whites was actually more likely to lead to the recovery of guns and drugs than stops of blacks and Latinos, despite the much higher frequency of the latter. He recommended appointing an inspector general to oversee the department’s use of the strategy and passing a bill to protect against racial profiling.Yet de Blasio has stopped short of calling for an end to stop and frisk altogether. His campaign website criticized the “overuse and abuse” of the tactic under Kelly, not the tactic itself.Donna Lieberman, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she’s heard good things about Bratton from her ACLU colleagues in Southern California. “We have learned from them that his tenure in LA was characterized by a very different relationship with advocates like the Civil Liberties Union than what we have seen with Commissioner Kelly in New York,” she said. “There were lines of communication which don’t exist for us in New York now.”Still, she tempered her praise with words of caution. If Bratton is named commissioner, “we would be very eager to hear about the plans to rein in the excesses with regard to stop and frisk, ‘broken windows,’ and CompStat,” she said. “It starts from the top.”"

Wade ruling. The conversation dealt not only with abortion but also included other ""symptoms"" that have changed the nation.Perkins spoke broadly, saying pro-choice Americans represent a troubled country that doesn't choose life, meaning ""That is to follow the principals, the teachings, the instructions of God ... You see that as you've been in Washington, D.C. There is a rejection of this idea of truth, and that there is a foundation or morality, which needs to be upheld."" Santorum agreed, adding that less young people devote themselves to Christianity. ""If you look at the popular culture and what comes out of Hollywood, if you go to our schools and particularly our colleges and universities, they are indoctrinated in a sea of relativism and a sea of antagonism towards Christianity."" ""Abortion is a symptom. Marriage is a symptom. Pornography [is a symptom],"" he continued. ""All of these are symptoms to the fundamental issue that we've gotten away from the truth and the 'Truth-Giver.'"" Santorum has long been against gay marriage and anti-abortion. When he was in the running for the GOP presidential nomination, he vowed to initiate a war on porn if elected. Santorum received his undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University, an M.B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and a J.D. from the Dickinson School of Law but has criticized the notion that college is a critical entry point to the middle class.""President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college. What a snob!"" Santorum said last February, according to the New York Times. ""There are good, decent men and women who go out and work hard every day and put their skills to the test that aren't taught by some liberal college professor trying to indoctrinate him. I understand why he wants you to go to college. He wants to remake you in his image.""The Times highlighted a 2008 study that disproved the theory that going to college makes students increasingly liberal. The study found that 18 to 24-year-old students' ideals shifted somewhat leftward, but this was in line with normally occurring shifts in that age group regardless of education. "

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) disagreed with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) characterization of the deal made with Democrats on President Barack Obama's nominations, calling McConnell's claims ""bullshit."" According to a Roll Call report, McConnell told his caucus that he believed he could have negotiated a deal more beneficial to his party than the one brokered primarily between Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).Roll Call's Meredith Shiner reports: McConnell’s tone, according to multiple sources, implied that he had been kept in the dark about the talks between some in his own ranks and Democrats. However, those same Republicans say they kept McConnell updated throughout their negotiating process.Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., got so frustrated with McConnell’s presentation of events, that he called “bullshit” loud enough for the room to hear, nearly a half-dozen sources said. The heated exchange underscored the “buyer’s remorse” among some Republicans, especially leaders, one senior Republican said on background.Under the deal brokered by Reid and McCain, Republicans agreed to allow votes on seven of Obama's executive nominees, under the condition that the president replace two of his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board with two other candidates. The deal came after Reid threatened to invoke the so-called nuclear option, or changing Senate rules by a simple majority vote.Corker was one of 17 Republicans who voted to end the filibuster on Richard Cordray's nomination to lead the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau.As The Huffington Post's Ryan Grim and Michael McAuliff reported Tuesday, the deal was perceived as an embarrassment for McConnell: The unfortunate moment culminated Tuesday morning, when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) marched onto the Senate floor not with the leader from Kentucky opposite him to announce a deal to pass the stalled nominees, but with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).McCain was there, according to several sources who spoke about private, behind-the-scenes talks on the condition of anonymity, because he and and several other Republicans grew fed up with their own side's stalling tactics and went around McConnell (R-Ky.) to cut the deal with Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), avoiding a ""nuclear option"" rules change to pass the nominees."

While her lead is within the margin of error, the poll also underscored some broader issues that McConnell is likely to face as he campaigns for a sixth term.At 51 percent, a majority of Kentuckians say they disapprove of McConnell's job performance, while 40 percent approve and 9 percent are undecided. Those numbers are an improvement over an April PPP poll that showed him to be one of the least popular senators in the country, with a 36 percent job approval rating. His lagging numbers reinforce a longstanding problem that McConnell has had wrangling support for his reelection bid.PPP surveyed 1,210 Kentucky voters for the first two questions, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent. PCCC reportedly plans to release additional findings from the survey at a press conference later on Thursday.“It’s no surprise that Kentucky voters have had enough of Mitch McConnell’s partisan gridlock,” said Jonathan Hurst, senior adviser to Lundergan Grimes. “For thirty years, McConnell has been the embodiment of all that is wrong with Washington and has no problem turning his back on Kentucky’s middle class.”""George Soros and the Obama Allies are up to their same old tricks,"" said McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton. ""They have concocted another fictitious poll that has no basis in reality, held it for ten days, and released it at the perfect time in the news cycle to help their upstart liberal candidate. This poll has zero credibility and should be ignored out of hand.""PPP's polling was lauded for its accuracy during the 2012 election cycle.Previous polls by the firm, taken in April and May, before Lundergan Grimes officially kicked off her campaign, similarly suggested that the Democrat would be a viable threat to McConnell. A survey taken by Republican firm Wenzel Strategies last month had McConnell in better shape, leading Grimes 48 percent to 40 percent.Potentially compounding matters for McConnell is the recent decision by Kentucky tea party activist and businessman Matt Bevin to challenge the five-term senator for the Republican nomination. Bevin was not included in the latest survey, though the Wenzel Strategies poll released in July suggested that McConnell had a strong lead over his challenger.This article was updated to include comment from the McConnell campaign.UPDATE: 7:23 p.m. ET -- A poll conducted by Grimes' campaign also showed the Democrat with a slight lead over McConnell, the Courier Journal reported Thursday. In that poll, Grimes led McConnell by two points.The internal Grimes poll surveyed 750 Kentucky voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. "

""This is pretty straightforward,"" said Obama. ""If, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that is outrageous, and there is no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable, because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a non-partisan way. You should feel that way regardless of party."" ""But I have got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this,"" he added.The remarks were the president's first on the evolving scandal surrounding the tax collection agency. News broke last Friday that the IRS had targeted groups with the words ""Tea Party"" or ""Patriot"" in their name, forcing them to fill out additional questionnaires and provide more information in order to get approval for their tax-exempt status. Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that the IRS had also given extra scrutiny to organizations that focused on government spending, debt and taxes.Lawmakers have responded with anger and outrage. On Monday morning, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called on the IRS commissioner to be fired. The senator's office confirmed to The Huffington Post that he was referring to Steven Miller, the acting commissioner. The Senate has not yet confirmed a full-time commissioner since Douglas Shulman, a Bush appointee, stepped down this past fall.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), meanwhile, called for a ""congressional investigation to determine"" how the IRS scandal took place. Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said that ""The IRS should be prepared for a full investigation into this matter by the Senate Finance Committee.""The results of such an investigation will ultimately determine whether the story amounts to a case of terrible bureaucratic judgment or becomes a wider political scandal.The IRS began taking on additional campaign finance regulatory responsibilities after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which led to an uptick in filings for 501(c)(4) organizations seeking social welfare status. The agency's Cincinnati office became the central clearing point for those applications. Officials there, the agency said, were the ones who inappropriately targeted conservative groups for scrutiny. As early as mid-2011, however, high-ranking IRS officials became aware that the Cincinnati office was engaging in this activity, a forthcoming Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report will reportedly reveal. Why nothing was said or done prior to last Friday is unclear. The president on Monday said that neither he nor his advisers were aware that this was taking place. ""I learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this,"" said the president. ""I think it was on Friday."" The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported that a government official who had reviewed a copy of the report said no one outside the IRS was involved in encouraging the targeting of conservative groups. UPDATE: 2:45 p.m. -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has joined the chorus of concerned lawmakers, saying that he supports bipartisan calls for an investigation into the IRS scandal. From his floor remarks:I have spoken today to the senior Senator from Montana, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Max Baucus, and he is looking into this matter in his role as finance chairman of that committee. If the Inspector General's report indicates further investigation is needed, I have full confidence in the ability of Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee to get to the bottom of this matter and recommend appropriate action."

""So we're expecting over the next 22 months to be the focus of this administration as they attempt to annihilate the Republican Party.""Boehner continued, claiming that the broader goal of the administration was ""to just shove us into the dustbin of history.""On Monday, Obama marked his second inauguration with a speech that was regarded by pundits on both sides of the aisle as an unapologetic and aggressive defense of progressive and liberal priorities.HuffPost's Sam Stein reported at the time:The president’s supporters and even casual defenders will, undoubtedly, cheer this second inaugural address in a way that they never fully did the first -- a lofty, historic but somewhat unmemorable speech. His critics will take it as affirmation of a liberal agenda that they’ve often warned is coming once the burdens of reelection are gone.Those reactions are predictable and, ultimately, disposable. What matters more is the extent to which the president acts upon the vision he outlined. The second inaugural address showcased an unapologetic president. Time will tell if Monday was just a few lines in a speech or a new, dedicated mindset for the nation's leader.While some on the left were energized by Obama's tone, Republican lawmakers criticized the speech as overly partisan, as well as a sign that gridlock and obstruction are destined to prevail in Washington. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decried the address during a press conference on Tuesday.""One thing is clear from the president's speech: The era of liberalism is back. His unabashedly far-left-of-center inaugural speech certainly brings back memories of the Democratic Party in ages past,"" McConnell said. ""If the president pursued that kind of agenda, obviously it's not designed to bring us together, and certainly not designed to deal with the transcendent issue of our era, which is deficits and debt."""

After going public with his allegations in 2005, Tice later admitted that he had been a key source in a bombshell New York Times report that blew the lid off the Bush administration's use of warrantless wiretapping of international communications in the U.S. The article forced Bush to admit that the practice was indeed used on a small number of Americans, but Tice maintained that the NSA practice was likely being used the gather records for millions of Americans.

""They’ve got a bloc of voters, we've got a bloc of voters, I've got to get the ones in the middle. And I thought that that would be how it would be perceived -- as a candidate talking about the process of focusing on the people in the middle who can either vote Republican or Democrat.""Romney's argument that the remarks were taken out of context is a new defense for him. During the campaign, he said at first that they were ""not elegantly stated"" and then that they were ""completely wrong.""Also in the interview with Balz, Romney claimed that Obama had made a similar comment: ""And I think the president said he's writing off 47 percent of Americans and so forth. And that wasn't at all what was intended. That wasn't what was meant by it. That is the way it was perceived.""Romney nonetheless acknowledged that the quote was ""very damaging"" to his campaign. Indeed, the Obama campaign seized on the remark, creating an ad based on it, and the former Massachusetts governor took a hit in the polls."

Now, as North Carolina's governor prepares to sign one of the most restrictive election bills in the nation, civil-rights advocates and election officials in the state expect to see a rise in what they call voter intimidation.  The law, which North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory is expected to sign any day, would allow political parties to send 10 roving ""observers"" from precinct to precinct on voting days, and it would authorize citizens to challenge the legality of votes cast in the county where the challenger lives. (Under the current law, you can only challenge a vote cast by someone living in your precinct.)  Supporters contend that the law will help observers catch people in the act of fraud, but critics point out that evidence of this type of fraud is scarce. They insist that the real goal is to intimidate Democratic-leaning black voters, some of whom may remember the threats and assaults that swept the South in the late 1960s, after the 1965 Voting Rights Act toppled the official barriers blacks had faced at the polls.  ""In my mind, the only reason the change is occurring is to have a harmful impact on eligible voters who are trying to exercise their constitutional right,"" said Bob Phillips, the director of Common Cause North Carolina, a progressive group. ""We have hundreds of precincts located in all the communities across our state, and now you're going to be introducing outside observers who are not residents of those precincts and who are really are up to, in my opinion, intimidation.""  In addition to boosting the presence of poll observers, the law would require every voter to display specific forms of government-issued identification, which minorities and low-income people disproportionately lack. It would also cut back on the hours allotted for early voting, prohibit people from registering on the same day that they vote, and cancel a popular program to register high-school students -- practices that have boosted electoral participation among young and black voters and may have helped President Barack Obama carry the state in 2008.The state’s Republican-dominated Legislature passed the law in July, despite scant evidence of voter impersonation fraud in North Carolina (or in any other state). In a statement, Phil Berger, the leader of the State Senate, said the bill ""restores clarity, transparency and confidence in the voting process. It curtails the questions of voter fraud by folks on both sides of the aisle and helps ensure every candidate wins or loses on his or her own merits.""In recent years, more than 30 states around the country have passed laws requiring voters to show ID. North Carolina would become one of at least three states to allow behavior by poll watchers or poll observers that could threaten voting rights, according to a report by the progressive groups Demos and Common Cause.Even among the voter laws in other states, North Carolina’s stands apart. Mainstream election experts have panned the proposal, calling it the most sweeping anti-voter law in the country. For Jay Delancy, though, it doesn't go far enough. Delancy, a retired Air Force office and the head of a group called the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina, is one of the state’s best-known activists in the campaign against fraud and a proponent of even stricter election rules, like ending early voting altogether. Last year, he repeatedly challenged the validity of the state's voter rolls, at one point claiming that nearly 30,000 registered North Carolina's voters were actually names of deceased people.  A state investigation eventually undermined this claim, and Delancy now admits that concerns about counting dead people as voters are ""greatly exaggerated."" But he remains adamant that voter fraud is pervasive, and although he has little evidence to back this up, he hopes the new rules will make it easier for groups like his to catch people cheating at the polls.He plans to train people to act as observers, a strategy modeled on True the Vote, a national tea party-affiliated organization that has stirred up controversy by sending observers into African-American districts in recent years. ""We need to safeguard the ballot box, just like banks,"" Delancy says.  According to one state election official, however, the expected influx of observers could have the opposite effect.  ""You're going to have more observers than you have actual workers,"" said Gary Sims, deputy director of the Wake County Board of Elections. ""Some of our polling places are very small. I don't know how we're going to fit 15, 16 people in there. We're not going to have enough poll workers to make sure observers are following the law.""During last year’s early voting period, there were reports of official poll observers and campaign workers interrogating and harassing voters, hovering over them as they voted and getting into shouting matches with each other. The state board of elections sent out a memo reminding employees that they were obliged to “prevent and stop improper practices and attempts to obstruct, intimidate, or interfere with any person in registering or voting.” Now that job could get harder, election officials say. Some worry that the increased presence of observers could overwhelm poll workers, contributing to long lines and effectively discouraging people from voting.   ""How do you police people?"" asked Sims. ""We're not in the police business.""  If the bill is signed, Delancy and his allies in North Carolina will owe its success in part to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in June on the Voting Rights Act, which cleared the way for North Carolina and other Southern states to pass restrictive voter laws that the federal government could have previously prohibited. In the landmark case, a 5-4 majority ruled that areas with histories of extensive discrimination, including 40 counties in North Carolina, no longer needed to submit their electoral policies to the federal government for approval.  In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the South has changed so dramatically since the Voting Rights Act was passed almost half a century ago that the need for special federal oversight has been eliminated. Civil-rights advocates tend to agree that things have improved since the ‘60s. Yet they see the furor over voter fraud as a thinly veiled attempt to roll back those changes. ""What we've seen recently are efforts by Republicans in largely non-white communities to go in and systematically challenge ballots,"" said Kareem Crayton, a law professor at the University of North Carolina. ""Maybe people in these communities aren't familiar with the process of voting, or aren't entirely clear what their rights are, and in the face of people telling them ‘if you vote illegally or inconsistently with the rules you can be challenged in court under a felony conviction’, that can be intimidating.""  In a recent interview, Delancy dismissed the suggestion that his crusade against fraud and the voter-suppression tactics of the Jim Crow era are in any way alike. No one in today’s North Carolina needs to worry about “dogs and fire hoses and all that,” he said. “It's laughable.”Then he corrected himself: “It's really not laughable. It's tragic. I think in the end, as I tell every black activists who will dare to have a civil conversation with me, we are not who you say we are. What I care about is open and honest elections.”"

Circuit on Monday, leaving Democrats with two options for filling the court's empty seats: change the rules and take away the GOP's power to filibuster certain nominees, or call it a day.As expected, Republicans lined up to block a procedural vote for Robert Wilkins. His nomination needed 60 votes to advance. Instead, the Senate voted 53 to 38, with just two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), siding with Democrats to let him get a confirmation vote. The GOP blockade on Wilkins was no surprise. In the last month, Republicans filibustered Obama's two other D.C. Circuit nominees, Patricia Millett and Nina Pillard. They'll readily admit their opposition isn't personal; they just don't want Obama to put any of his nominees on the court. Some argue the court isn't busy enough to warrant filling its three empty seats, and others make the counterintuitive argument that Obama is ""court-packing"" by filling vacancies. Both arguments gloss over the fact that the president has a constitutional duty to fill empty seats on a court.Democrats have been warning for weeks that they're prepared to invoke the ""nuclear option"" and strip Republicans of their ability to block Obama's nominees if they keep filibustering. With Wilkins' vote now blocked, Democrats have to decide if they have it in them to change institutional rules that both parties are typically reluctant to mess with.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and other Democratic leaders are expected to weigh their next steps in a Monday night leadership meeting. One idea being considered is stripping Republicans' ability to filibuster judicial and executive nominees, but not nominees to the Supreme Court. Aides emphasized that nothing has been decided, however, and leaders will likely discuss their options with the full Democratic caucus during lunch on Tuesday.By the sounds of it during Wilkins' vote, some Democrats are ready to go nuclear right now.""I fear that after tonight, the talk about changing the cloture rules for judicial nominations will no longer be just talk. There will be action,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""We cannot allow this unprecedented, wholesale obstruction to continue without undermining the Senate’s role provided in the Constitution and without harming our independent federal judiciary.""“When will we say enough is enough? Repeatedly over the past month, a minority of senators has blocked qualified nominees by abusing the Senate rules,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said. ""The rules on nominees are not working, and we need to change them.""But Republicans are largely shrugging off Democrats' threats, suspecting it's all talk. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the real reason Democrats want to keep talking about the D.C. Circuit is to take attention away from the rocky rollout of the president's health care law.Democrats are trying to ""distract Americans from the failings of Obamacare,"" McConnell said ahead of Wilkins' vote. ""I hope the Senate will focus on things people care about rather than spend its time trying to distract them.""Shortly after the vote, Obama railed against Republicans for blocking another of his key nominees.""This obstruction is completely unprecedented,"" he said in a statement. ""When it comes to judicial nominations, I am fulfilling my constitutional responsibility, but Congress is not. Instead, Senate Republicans are standing in the way of a fully functioning judiciary that serves the American people.""This is a developing story and has been updated."

As Willie Geist of NBC News reported on Monday morning, some of the most sought-after spots were near the Navy Memorial at 7th Street NW, opposite the National Archives. It was around that location where President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama got out of their limousine and started walking along the processional route four years ago during the president's first Inauguration. And sure enough, for their second Inauguration, the president and first lady left their limousine around 9th Street NW and walked for approximately three blocks before getting back in their motorcade. They arrived in the vicinity of the White House around 4:10 p.m. where they later gathered to watch the remainder of the Inauguration parade from the official review stand opposite Lafayette Park.The parade took a momentary pause as the first family, Vice President Biden and his family and their guests made their way into the review stand just before 4:45 p.m.Story continues after slideshow ...The parade was originally scheduled to start around 2:30 p.m. but was delayed by the Inauguration luncheon in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, which was also behind schedule. The procession, which included 59 groups and 8,800 people, started to leave Capitol Hill around 3:15 p.m., went west along Constitution Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue and ended at 17th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House. Among the groups featured in the parade were the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Boy Scout Troop 358 from Philadelphia, the Boston Crusaders Drum & Bugle Corps, the Georgia State University Marching Band, the Lesbian and Gay Band Association of St. Louis, Military Spouses of Michigan, the Navajo Nation Band of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the University of Maryland Mighty Sound Marching Band, the Virginia Military Institute Marching Unit and the Palmview High School Mariachi and Folkloric Group of La Joya, Texas, among many more.Some of the most recognized landmarks in the nation's capital sit along the processional route. The president passed the U.S. Department of Labor, the Canadian Embassy, the Newseum, the National Gallery of Art, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Archives, the Navy Memorial, the FBI headquarters, the Justice Department, the Old Post Office Pavilion, Freedom Plaza, the John A. Wilson Building and the Treasury Department, among other buildings, memorials and statues. There were some protesters along the route, including members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who received a permit to demonstrate at John Marshall Park near 4th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue.At the John A. Wilson Building, the seat of the District of Columbia government, local officials had a protest banner on full display decrying the lack of full and equal congressional representation for residents of the nation's capital.This post has been updated ...

So why, in an exclusive survey of fast-growth CEOs, do 36 percent of these entrepreneurs say they’d support Hillary Clinton for President? That's more than any other potential Presidential candidate except for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whom 47 percent of survey respondents said they would support.The findings are based on a survey of the Inc. 5000, our annual ranking of the fastest-growing private U.S. companies.Some of the other contenders were Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, with 34 percent; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, with 31 percent; and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, with 21 percent. After Clinton, the best-scoring Democrat was New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Nine percent of fast-growth entrepreneurs said they’d support him. Strange BedfellowsThe conventional wisdom is that two-thirds of business owners are Republican and one-third are Democrats. That’s misleading. In the Inc. survey, 47 percent of fast-growth CEOs describe themselves as Republicans, compared to only 17 percent who say they’re Democrats. But more than a third--36 percent--say they’re independents.When asked about their political philosophy, as opposed to party affiliation, the results are telling. Only 31 percent say they’re conservative. Liberals are an even smaller minority, at only 10 percent. Everyone else--a whopping 59 percent--claims to be moderate.Women CEOs, not surprisingly, are even less likely to be Republican. About a third of fast-growth women entrepreneurs said they are Republicans, a third said they are Democrats, and about a third are independents. While about two-thirds of fast-growth CEOs who are men voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the last U.S. presidential election, more than half the women--53 percent--voted for Barack Obama. The fact that so many of the Inc. 5000 consider themselves moderates doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for candidates on either edge of the political spectrum, be they Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (6.3 percent) or Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas (15 percent). But it leaves plenty of business owners who are willing to back a Democratic woman for President--especially one whose bridge-building efforts have won praise from both sides of the political aisle and who is widely regarded as having had a successful tenure as the U.S. Secretary of State. Forty percent of fast-growth CEOs who said they were independents also said they’d back Clinton. Eighty-seven percent of Democrats said they’d support her, as did 13 percent of Republicans. Among women, 61 percent said they’d back Clinton for President. It’s telling that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican who got flak from his own party by appearing to buddy up with President Obama just a bit too much during Hurricane Sandy last year, was the only one to make a stronger showing than Hillary. More than half of independents--53 percent--said they’d back Christie for president.It undoubtedly helps both Christie and Clinton that neither of them is currently serving in Washington. When it comes to the federal government shutdown, the threatened debt default, and the record-breaking level of dysfunction in D.C., their hands are clean. For now.Based on the results of an October survey of Inc. 5000 entrepreneurs. The survey had 306 respondents.

""They apparently don't consult the deepest hopes or greatest fears of young women.""Cotton, who is unmarried, wrote that he surveyed several women -- whom he referred to as ""Cliffies,"" or female students at Radcliffe -- and they all told him the same thing: that their ""greatest fear"" in life was to be left by their husbands, and their ""deepest hope"" was to be ""a good wife and mother."" To that end, he says, feminists should stop trying to make it easier to get divorced.""If men have easy access to divorce, many will choose it thoughtlessly,"" he wrote. ""They may not gain true happiness with their new trophy wives, but they certainly will not slide into the material indigence and emotional misery that awaits most divorced women."" Cotton tried to make the case for ""covenant marriages,"" in which people can only divorce in cases where there's fault, ""defined as abandonment, physical abuse, adultery or conviction of a capital crime.""The National Organization for Women denounced covenant marriage in 1997 when Louisiana became the first state to create it as a legal category, arguing that it was intended to trap women in bad marriages and re-establish patriarchy. But Cotton wrote that women should support the policy in order to restrain men from leaving, so that they will stay and ""fulfill women's deepest hopes.""""[Men] can learn that personal happiness comes from the desire to devote and sacrifice oneself to one's beloved,"" he wrote. ""A few men can see this by themselves, and women are quite lucky to hook them. Ordinary women must not only defend these men against feminism, but also demand that all other men accept the lifelong nature of marriage. If not, one-half of all women who marry see their ‘greatest fear’ come true.""Laws allowing no-fault divorce across the country were considered a victory for women's rights in the 1970s. A 2003 Stanford Business School study found states that passed no-fault divorce laws saw a 20 percent reduction in female suicide after 20 years and a 33 percent reduction in domestic violence and murder against women.Cotton's campaign did not immediately comment on whether the congressman stands by the article, but Cotton remains a staunch social conservative. He opposes abortion rights, equal pay for women, marriage equality and women in combat, and he voted against every version of the Violence Against Women Act that has come up since he took office.Cotton is challenging Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), the lone Democratic senator in an increasingly Republican state. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) began personally fundraising for Pryor this week, writing in an email to supporters that Cotton is ""recklessly anti-woman.""

In May, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) called Clinton the ""best qualified"" person for the party's nomination. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) commented last week that Clinton would ""handle things probably even better"" in the White House than her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

A big-screen dramatization of the her life is also slated for a 2016 release.Obama has not voiced support for a presidential candidate, laughing off the subject during an interview with Clinton on ""60 Minutes"" in January. The rare joint interview nonetheless triggered a frenzy of speculation about his preferences. Vice President Joe Biden, who previously sought the Democratic nomination twice, is also eying a possible run. Clinton, for her part, has not signaled anything definite with regard to her presidential ambitions. Since stepping down as Secretary of State in February, she has kept busy delivering speeches to a variety of industry groups across the country, collecting $200,000 an appearance.

The ads aim to challenge McConnell to explain his opposition to campaign finance restrictions.""The ad is intended to get a response out of McConnell about why he thinks unlimited campaign contributions are the way to go,"" said Public Campaign Action Fund executive director David Donnelly.McConnell's lawyer has been allowed time to argue before the Supreme Court for the elimination of campaign contribution limits on Oct. 8 in the McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission case. The McCutcheon case challenges the aggregate limit on contributions by an individual donor. For the 2014 election, an individual donor may give $123,200 in total to candidates, parties and political action committees -- a limit the McCutcheon case threatens to overturn.McConnell's argument before the Supreme Court will challenge the court's longtime distinction between campaign contributions and campaign spending. The court ruled in the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo case that campaign spending restrictions violate First Amendment free speech rights. But the court found that limits on campaign contributions are constitutional. Contribution limits have been upheld in every major campaign finance case since.Donnelly said campaign finance reform groups may have failed to adequately stir public interest before the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allows unlimited campaign contributions. He said McConnell's role in the McCutcheon case is a chance to bring attention to the issue.""We need to sound the alarm earlier, and engaging in a debate with Sen. McConnell is probably the best way to raise the stakes on this,"" Donnelly said.The ads are not designed to take sides in McConnell's reelection. McConnell faces a GOP primary challenge from Matt Bevin. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is the leading Democratic candidate in the general election.Still, Donnelly said McConnell's campaign finance views are likely to become a campaign issue.""I can't imagine how it won't be,"" Donnelly said. ""Arguing before the high court that we should have no campaign limits whatsoever. Someone predicted the race will be $100 million. What will it be with no limits? It's just outrageous."""

Chris Christie, who could leave before a second term ends to run for president, and Barbara Buono, a little-known state senator who was the only Democrat willing to challenge the popular incumbent.Polls opened at 6 a.m. and will close at 8 p.m.Christie has been barnstorming the state by bus since Wednesday to drive up turnout. Polls leading up to Election Day showed him with a 20-plus point advantage as he pushes for a landslide to burnish his bipartisan credentials and show how well a reach-across-the-aisle Republican can do in a Democratic-leaning state. Christie is looking to become the first Republican running statewide to break 50 percent since George H.W. Bush in 1988.Buono campaigned without the aid of big-name Democrats. She also was spurned early on by Democratic leaders who control party politics in the state. They have a good working relationship with Christie and didn't believe the progressive from Metuchen, on the fringes of the New York City metropolitan area, could win.Christie, 51, was already popular when Superstorm Sandy slammed into the coast a year ago, damaging 360,000 homes and businesses, plunging 5.5 million people into darkness and disrupting gasoline supplies for days. His popularity skyrocketed as he donned a blue fleece pullover and led the state through its worst natural disaster, whether he was embracing President Barack Obama during a visit to the battered coast or consoling a tearful 9-year-old who had lost her house.Christie underwent weight-loss surgery in February and has been shedding pounds steadily since, addressing a health issue that could affect his political plans in the future. He was disqualified as a 2012 vice presidential candidate after refusing to answer questions about his health and other matters, according to a new book on last year's presidential campaign.Christie has refused to rule out a presidential run, which may mean he could resign before his second term ended.Nearly half of New Jersey residents think he'll run, according to a recent poll.Buono, 60, has portrayed Christie's ambitions as a negative. In an interview on MSNBC on Monday, she said the governor is putting his personal ambitions ahead of the needs of the state.Buono has also challenged Christie on gay marriage, which she supported and he opposed before it became legal in New Jersey last month. She criticized Christie's budget priorities — refusing to reinstate a surcharge on millionaires while trimming a property tax credit for the working poor, for example — and his veto of legislation raising the minimum-wage.Though a majority of New Jersey residents agree with Buono on social issues, she has been unable to get out from a campaign Catch-22: She couldn't get her message out because she hadn't raised a lot of money for advertising, and she had trouble raising money because voters didn't know her.Democrats, including Buono, rejected Christie's minimum-wage compromise of scaling back an increase and phasing it in over three years, and instead decided to put the question to voters.So voters are being asked in ballot question No. 2 to increase the minimum wage by $1, to $8.25 per hour, and to allow annual cost-of-living increases based on inflation. They'll also be asked to allow veterans' groups to use proceeds from games of chance to run their organizations.Voters will also choose their legislative representatives.

Strickland, a one-term governor, was a vocal surrogate during the 2012 election for President Barack Obama and Ohio Democrats, including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D). He said in his statement Tuesday that he looked back ""fondly"" on his four years in the governor's mansion and that it was a ""very difficult decision."" Strickland used the statement, released by the Ohio Democratic Party, to highlight his administration's accomplishments, including the auto bailout, which was a top issue for Obama, Brown and Democrats during the 2012 election. ""Most significant for jobs, we were leaders in investments in alternatives sources of energy and went to bat for the automobile industry; working closely with President Obama on the rescue plan that has been so pivotal in Ohio’s economic recovery,"" Strickland said. Strickland's decision shifts attention to Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald (D) as the leading Democratic challenger to Kasich. FitzGerald, the first county executive in his county, has been mentioned along with Strickland as one of two leading contenders to challenge Kasich. FitzGerald has taken steps to increase his visibility within Ohio, including highlighting his opposition to Kasich. Kasich, a potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate, is considered a target for Democrats in 2014, stemming from his role in changing Ohio's collective bargaining system, which was overturned by voters in 2011.

""The best way to stop left-wing extremists from killing jobs is to vote against their hand-picked candidate Pete Gallego.""The group that put out the mailer, A Better America Now, reported to the Federal Election Commission it had spent about $65,000 for the mailer and TV advertising in the hard-fought race to represent Texas' 23rd district.But in a tax return recently filed with the IRS, the group claimed it did not spend any money at all on ""direct or indirect political campaign activities.""The tax return is signed under the penalty of perjury by the group's president, Bob Portrie, and the accounting firm LBA Group. Neither responded to requests for comment.We first reported on A Better America Now earlier this year, showing it had told the IRS in a 2011 application for nonprofit status that it did not plan to spend any money on elections. (That document was sent to ProPublica last year by the IRS, even though the application was still pending and thus not supposed to be released.)""This type of inaccurate reporting by electioneering nonprofit groups has a long history,"" says Public Citizen's Craig Holman, when asked about the group's most recent filing. ""It is rooted in the fact that the IRS almost never holds these groups accountable for such false declarations.""A Better America Now was a bit player in the elections. But it's also an example of the kind of increasingly common outside groups that inject anonymous money into political campaigns.Such social welfare nonprofits are not supposed to have political campaign activity as their primary purpose 2014 but the ambiguities around how the IRS measures such activity and how it screens the groups are at the center of the recent investigations of the IRS's treatment of Tea Party groups.ProPublica has documented how nonprofits that spent millions of dollars on ads in the 2010 elections failed to report or underreported that political spending to the IRS. The tax form that the groups are required to file with the IRS specifically asks for details on any campaign spending.One of the curious things about A Better America Now is that, though the group spent money in a congressional and a state legislative race in southwest Texas, it is based a few miles off the beach near Jacksonville, Florida. The president of A Better America Now, Portrie, is also the head of a consulting firm, the Fenwick Group. The two groups are listed at the same address. Fenwick's website says it works with ""organizations across the healthcare, financial services, insurance, retail and investment sectors.""Portrie and Fenwick were also linked to ads run by another Florida-based social welfare nonprofit, America is Not Stupid, in last year's U.S. Senate race in Montana. Ads by America is Not Stupid featured a talking baby complaining about alleged cuts to Medicare by President Obama, and referring to the baby's stinking diaper.In 2010, the New York Times reported on links between the Fenwick Group and yet another politically active nonprofit, the Coalition to Protect Seniors. Ads by that group featured the same talking baby ad.In last year's race in Texas, which attracted a lot of outside spending on both sides, the Democrat, Gallego, prevailed over Republican incumbent Quico Canseco."

That gives us leverage on immigration with our Democratic friends.""On CBS' ""Face The Nation,"" two leading members of the ""gang of eight,"" Sens.

Schumer said that legislative language is on track to be completed at the end of this week, and McCain said that the bill could go through committee and land on the Senate floor by May.Graham, however, continued to press forward with a key issue of his, calling for a ""merit-based"" guest worker program. The proposal has been a stumbling block in negotiations, according to people involved, and the outlines of the deal currently tilt more toward family reunification as the central way of handling the future flow of immigrants. Graham also said that the pathway to citizenship must be tied to certified border security. The nature of that certification could end up being central to the final agreement. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson (D), also speaking on ""Meet The Press,"" said that it was inhumane to tie a person's pathway to citizenship to uncertain and unrelated border security evaluations, but Graham insisted there would be ""no deal"" without a direct connection.

Below, more from the Associated Press:WASHINGTON — A divided Senate confirmed Thomas Perez on Thursday to become secretary of labor, elevating the son of Dominican immigrants who as a top Justice Department official won praise from Democrats for aggressively enforcing civil rights laws and criticism from Republicans for being a liberal ideologue.Thursday's party-line, 54-46 vote marked the third major vacancy in President Barack Obama's second-term leadership team that the Senate has filled in three days. The sudden movement followed this week's bipartisan deal in which Republicans agreed to end blockades against votes on seven nominations and Democrats shelved efforts to change Senate rules to weaken the minority GOP's powers.Perez, 51, is a Buffalo, N.Y., native who once worked as a trash collector. Since earning a Harvard University law degree, his career has included stints as a Justice Department civil rights prosecutor and an aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., before taking over Justice's civil rights division in 2009.At Justice, he has challenged Texas and South Carolina laws requiring voters to show photo identification and sued the office of outspoken Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, alleging that Latinos were racially profiled during a crackdown on immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.""He has spent his career fighting for working families, protecting our important civil rights laws and turning around troubled agencies,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.Republicans say Perez has selectively enforced laws according to his political views. GOP senators have suggested that politics has guided his decisions about enforcing voting rights laws and accused him of supporting efforts to sidestep federal immigration laws when he was a local government official in Maryland.""Tom Perez is more than just some left-wing ideologue – he's a left-wing ideologue who appears perfectly willing to bend the rules to achieve his ends,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.After the vote, the Senate began debating Gina McCarthy's nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency.On Wednesday, the Senate voted narrowly to end a filibuster against Perez. All but six Republicans voted against Perez – the exact number of GOP senators that majority Democrats needed to muster the 60 votes required to end the delaying tactic against Perez's nomination.That 60-40 vote was the closest senators have come to unwinding this week's deal between the two parties that has averted all-out partisan warfare over nominations and Senate rules. That roll call seemed to signal that while GOP leaders would deliver the votes needed to honor the bipartisan agreement, numerous Republicans were rankled by the pact and unhappy with Perez.McCarthy, who currently heads the EPA's air pollution office, has helped craft rules aimed at reducing pollutants from power plants and other sources. Republicans have long criticized the agency for championing overly restrictive regulations that they say kill jobs.Last week, Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, top Republican on the Senate environment committee, said he was dropping efforts to delay McCarthy's nomination after the EPA agreed to release more information about how it makes decisions. McCarthy has also faced opposition from Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., because of delays to a flood control project.The other five nominees involved in the deal include Richard Cordray, whom the Senate confirmed Tuesday as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Fred Hochberg, whom the Senate approved Wednesday to continue leading the Export-Import Bank.Still to be considered are labor lawyers Nancy Schiffer and Kent Hirozawa to join the National Labor Relations Board and NLRB Chairman Mark Pearce, whom Obama wants to keep in the role.UPDATE (2:10 p.m. ET) -- President Barack Obama issued a statement Thursday afternoon on Perez's confirmation:I welcome today’s confirmation of Tom Perez to serve as Secretary of Labor. Tom has lived the American dream himself, and has dedicated his career to keeping it within reach for hardworking families across the country. At the Department of Labor, Tom will help us continue to grow our economy, help businesses create jobs, make sure workers have the skills those jobs require, and ensure safe workplaces and economic opportunity for all. I want to thank the Senate once again for agreeing to move forward on Tom and the other nominees who have waited far too long for the yes-or-no votes they deserve.This story has been updated with information from the AP and the White House."

Paladino easily defeated Adrian Fitzgerald Harris 79 percent to 20 percent to capture a seat representing the south Buffalo neighborhood. The move comes 2 1/2 years after Paladino lost the race for the governor's mansion to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) by 29 percentage points after upsetting New York's Republican establishment in the GOP primary. Paladino, a millionaire developer, entered the school board race in January vowing to ""destroy"" the nine-member board. He has long been at odds with board members, filing a lawsuit against the board last year to challenge the appointment of a new schools superintendent. He said he wants to fire the school system's entire top leadership and has challenged the Buffalo teachers union. Paladino has described African American women school board members as a ""parasitic black sisterhood.""  In 2010, the Buffalo Common Council considered a resolution condemning Paladino for racial insensitivity. In 2011, Paladino proposed that Buffalo's school system create boarding schools in order to improve test scores. He said boarding schools would provide children with study skills, meals and a chance to escape dysfunctional families. He repeated the boarding school proposal during his school board campaign. Paladino has courted controversy. In October, he had bumper stickers tied to the birther movement placed on cars at a Thrifty rental car branch he owns at Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The stickers said, ""Vote for the American."" During his failed gubernatorial campaign, a series of racist and sexually charged emails he forwarded to friends surfaced. At the time, he told the New York Post that he was not a racist, but said he would not run a politically correct campaign for New York state's top job. Despite his business success, Paladino has struggled in elective politics. In 2008, he used his own money in an unsuccessful effort to oust a Republican state senator he did not like.Paladino won the 2010 Republican primary over former Rep. Rick Lazio, who was backed by the state GOP, based largely on landslide numbers in western New York, where he captured 93 percent of the vote in Buffalo's Erie County. "

Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) at 10 percent, comptroller John Liu at 6 percent and former council member Sal Albanese at 1 percent.

Thompson led among black voters, with 39 percent, followed by de Blasio and Quinn. Among white voters, de Blasio led with 39 percent, followed by Quinn and then Thompson.De Blasio's 30 percent is the greatest share of the vote any candidate has attracted so far in polling on the race. In the weeks since Weiner's numbers dropped after new revelations of his inappropriate behavior, most surveys have shown Quinn leading the field, although generally with support in the mid-20s, far below the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff.

He has sought to present himself as the campaign's most progressive candidate, as HuffPost's Michael McLaughlin reported Sunday:For months, de Blasio stumped with bread-and-butter proposals to aid the poor and working class. He appealed to the middle class with a liberal agenda promoting green technology, equality for women in the workplace, and job growth in the tech and entertainment industries. Now, it seemed, his message was breaking through....His campaign rests on the idea that New York is ""a tale of two cities,"" divided between the haves and have-nots. Almost half of the city's population lived in or near poverty in 2011 -- a statistic that de Blasio frequently mentions. The villain in his story is none other than billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The pre-K tax is perhaps the centerpiece of his platform to alleviate economic and racial disparities. But de Blasio, the city's public advocate since 2009, also wants to build affordable housing, rescue hospitals on the verge of closing and reform the police department's controversial stop-and-frisk program.A judge ruled Monday that the NYPD's use of the stop-and-frisk tactic violated the rights of thousands of New Yorkers.Sixty percent of likely Democratic voters view the stop-and-frisk program as excessive, while 31 percent find it acceptable, according to Tuesday's poll.The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 579 likely primary voters by phone between Aug. 7 and 12.CORRECTION: This post originally misstated the candidates' rankings among white voters."

Within Ohio, Democrats are expected to push heavy challenges against Kasich, Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) and state Treasurer Josh Mandel (R) in the 2014 races. "

The ads aim to challenge McConnell to explain his opposition to campaign finance restrictions.""The ad is intended to get a response out of McConnell about why he thinks unlimited campaign contributions are the way to go,"" said Public Campaign Action Fund executive director David Donnelly.McConnell's lawyer has been allowed time to argue before the Supreme Court for the elimination of campaign contribution limits on Oct. 8 in the McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission case. The McCutcheon case challenges the aggregate limit on contributions by an individual donor. For the 2014 election, an individual donor may give $123,200 in total to candidates, parties and political action committees -- a limit the McCutcheon case threatens to overturn.McConnell's argument before the Supreme Court will challenge the court's longtime distinction between campaign contributions and campaign spending. The court ruled in the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo case that campaign spending restrictions violate First Amendment free speech rights. But the court found that limits on campaign contributions are constitutional. Contribution limits have been upheld in every major campaign finance case since.Donnelly said campaign finance reform groups may have failed to adequately stir public interest before the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allows unlimited campaign contributions. He said McConnell's role in the McCutcheon case is a chance to bring attention to the issue.""We need to sound the alarm earlier, and engaging in a debate with Sen. McConnell is probably the best way to raise the stakes on this,"" Donnelly said.The ads are not designed to take sides in McConnell's reelection. McConnell faces a GOP primary challenge from Matt Bevin. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is the leading Democratic candidate in the general election.Still, Donnelly said McConnell's campaign finance views are likely to become a campaign issue.""I can't imagine how it won't be,"" Donnelly said. ""Arguing before the high court that we should have no campaign limits whatsoever. Someone predicted the race will be $100 million. What will it be with no limits? It's just outrageous."""

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced on Monday another amendment to throw a wrench into the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill: tying it to voter ID. The amendment, which he first announced on Twitter, is unlikely to make it into the eventual bill. Cruz voted three times -- once in the Judiciary Committee and twice on the Senate floor -- against moving the ""gang of eight"" bill forward even for debate, and is considered unwinnable as a ""yes"" vote for the legislation as a whole. Still, he has attempted to add his own touches to the bill, such as stripping it of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The most recent amendment would touch on the equally contentious issue of whether would-be voters should be required to show identification to prove their citizenship before registering to vote.The Supreme Court ruled earlier Monday that states cannot require people to prove their U.S. citizenship before using a federal voter registration system.UPDATE: 6:30 p.m. -- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced an amendment later Monday aimed at addressing voter ID issues brought up by the Supreme Court ruling. According to a statement, his ""Secure the Vote"" amendment is meant to ensure immigrants do not vote until they become citizens -- they are already banned from doing so -- by providing ""new procedures to enable states to check that individuals gaining status or a work visa are not illegally registered to vote."" ""Not only would this amendment prevent voter fraud, it would also clear up the problem created by today's Supreme Court decision,"" Paul said in a statement.

Obama defeated Romney by a 51 to 47 percent margin.Shortly after the election Gallup's editor-in-chief Frank Newport pledged to conduct an internal review of Gallup's telephone survey methodology. As promised, Newport reviewed on Saturday the kinds of studies conducted on issues including drawing samples, interviewing voters, and how to weight data and select the likely electorate. The company pledges to make the findings of its ongoing review publicly available.Although much analysis is now complete and set to be unveiled June 4, the investigation awaits ""a major experiment"" in conjunction with the gubernatorial campaigns in the fall.""We take it seriously"" when polls misfire, Newport explained on Saturday. ""We've been doing presidential polling since 1936 which is what put George Gallup on the map ...The results [in 2012] certainly were not what we wanted them to be from Gallup's perspective.""Newport's remarks came during a private, on-the-record briefing in Boston attended by The Huffington Post, and a handful of other pollsters and academic researchers at the annual American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) conference.Michael Traugott, a University of Michigan political scientist and survey methodologist retained by the company for the review, said he recommended broadening the scope and timing of the inquiry.""Early on,"" Traugott said, ""Frank and I had a conversation, about trying to learn what we could from an investigation of the data"" collected during the 2012 campaign, ""but then using that information to design a series of experiments going forward.""Traugott also said he recommended reviewing all of Gallup's methods and assessing the data collected before the 2012 campaign. ""We have been assembling data on presidential approval back to 2002 as a benchmark to look at the Gallup data in relations to other data and also party identification data going back.""His analysis confirms, for example, that by ""a small but consistent amount,"" ratings of President George W. Bush ""were a little bit higher than the average"" of other pollsters ""and the Obama ratings were a little bit lower than the average."" Those findings are consistent with a Huffington Post investigation of Gallup's results published in June 2012.Traugott also clarified that Gallup ""has agreed to make all of this information publicly available."" He stressed that both he and Newport, as former presidents of AAPOR ""are firmly committed to transparency. And this is an ongoing part of our relationship as well.""When pressed on whether that included releasing raw respondent-level data, Newport said that although they are ""still making the final decisions, we think we'll try to make the data available as well."" Such data will allow other scholars and researchers to attempt to replicate Traugott's findings and test other theories. On Saturday, Newport also asked assembled AAPOR researchers for further input on a list of 20 specific parts -- virtually every aspect -- of Gallup's methodology included in the review.While Newport declined to reveal specific findings from the review ahead of the June 4 announcement, he shared some new information.One of the experiments, for example, checked on potential bias associated with the Gallup brand name by running a full ""shadow"" sample to a recent Gallup poll in which respondents were told the polster was ""Selection Research Incorporated,"" rather than Gallup. ""The Gallup name significantly increased the response rate,"" Newport said, but without producing differences in the demographics of the resulting sample.Newport also explained that earlier this year, the company changed how it asks respondents to describe their race, replacing yes/no questions critiqued in last year's Huffington Post investigation with a question in which respondents could select more than one in a list of potential answers. That change allowed for a related modification to Gallup's weighting procedure. ""We think that's already had some impact on our data,"" Newport said.It is difficult, Traugott explained, to reconstruct Gallup's problems ""retrospectively"" using the data collected last fall. Instead, he convinced Gallup to conduct experiments to determine if alternative methods would have produced different and more accurate results. Because such experiments only make sense ""in the context of a campaign,"" Traugott explained, they decided to undertake them during the upcoming gubernatorial campaigns in Virginia and possibly New Jersey. He stressed that the experiments would only be used for further analysis, and would not be released publicly before the election.Three academic survey methodologists are joining Traugott in the investigation: Chris Wlezien from Temple University, an expert in likely voter models; James Wagner from the University of Michigan, an authority in telephone survey operations; and Frauke Kreuter from the University of Maryland, an expert on sampling and weighting.Shortly after the election, Newport speculated that ""it is likely that we could see significantly fewer polls conducted in the 2016 election."" Asked Saturday if he was signaling Gallup's intention to withdraw from polling in the next presidential race, Newport replied, ""Well, check back with us in 2016. I don't know what any polling organization is doing in 2016,"" given the increasing challenges to traditional pollster methods.However, despite the months of criticism, Newport was upbeat about the potential for improvements with advances in technology. He spoke favorably about a future in which ""polling is augmented by non-probability data, administrative data, social media data.""""I think it is an exciting time,"" he said later. ""Rather than doing things the same way in any business, it's always exciting when technology in particular opens up all these other opportunities."""

Booker indicated he was pointed to the statistical analysis on his favorite medium, Twitter. Booker's love of ""Star Trek"" was never a secret, sharing his inner Trekkie with his more than 1.3 million Twitter followers.

The White House did not disclose the purpose of the meeting. However, as with anything related to Clinton these days, discussion in the media will likely circle back to one topic: 2016.Several prominent Democrats have already voiced their support for another Clinton presidential run. In May, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) called Clinton the ""best qualified"" person for the party's nomination. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) commented last week that Clinton would ""handle things probably even better"" in the White House than her husband, former President Bill Clinton. NBC is so confident Clinton will play a starring role in 2016, it just announced plans for a four-episode miniseries about the former Secretary of State, set to debut during the heat of the general election. A big-screen dramatization of the her life is also slated for a 2016 release.Obama has not voiced support for a presidential candidate, laughing off the subject during an interview with Clinton on ""60 Minutes"" in January. The rare joint interview nonetheless triggered a frenzy of speculation about his preferences. Vice President Joe Biden, who previously sought the Democratic nomination twice, is also eying a possible run. Clinton, for her part, has not signaled anything definite with regard to her presidential ambitions. Since stepping down as Secretary of State in February, she has kept busy delivering speeches to a variety of industry groups across the country, collecting $200,000 an appearance.

During an interview with Nevada Public Radio, Reid warned that he was willing to make drastic changes to Senate rules if action is not taken on the ballooning number of stalled judicial nominees. “All within the sound of my voice, including my Democratic senators and the Republican senators who I serve with, should understand that we as a body have the power on any given day to change the rules with a simple majority, and I will do that if necessary,"" Reid said. ""If the Republicans in the Senate don’t start approving some judges and don’t start helping get some of these nominations done, then we’re going to have to take more action."" The ""nuclear option"" was floated by Reid during filibuster reform talks earlier this year. If taken, the simple majority vote would override the precedent of requiring a two-thirds supermajority to change filibuster rules. However, Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) instead agreed to a scaled-back reform deal in January after Republicans pushed back on Reid's threats. ""No party has ever broken the rules of the Senate to change those rules. I'm glad such an irreparably damaging precedent will not be set today,"" McConnell said in a statement in January. However, Reid's latest comments signal that the precedent may be broken if action is not taken soon on the stalled judicial nominations. As The Washington Post reported earlier this week, 15 nominations are currently awaiting a vote on the Senate floor, including 13 nominees who already cleared unanimous committee votes.In the Nevada Public Radio interview, Reid also pointed to Republican obstruction of Richard Cordray's nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.“We have not been able to confirm a person for that job. They refuse to allow us to bring that up, and -- and he was recess-appointed. Now, we have the Republican-dominated D.C.

Mitch McConnell, and to begin unveiling her own positions in the high-profile Kentucky Senate race.With an icy smile, the 34-year-old Grimes scoffed at the notion that she was philosophically or politically close to President Barack Obama, who is so unpopular here that he is mentioned by Kentucky Democrats fewer times than Voldemort ever was at Hogwarts.“The president and I disagree on a lot of things,” she said. “Sen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.“Well, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen. McConnell is a Chippendale dancer.”It was funny -– and definitely not nice. Even the thought of the doughy, 71-year-old McConnell in a dancer’s outfit might be enough to cost him a sixth term. In a wide-ranging, half-hour interview, Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Senate nominee for 2014, told me that she was pro-choice down the line on abortion, and that she would delay the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.The two statements were her first substantive comments on policy matters. Until now she has spent most of her time attacking McConnell as the embodiment of all that is corrupt and unproductive about Washington.The interview took place on the eve of the 133rd annual Fancy Farm Picnic, a church-sponsored day of politicking and speechifying on a rural expanse in the far-western Purchase region of Kentucky.Grimes is one of five daughters in a devout Catholic family in Lexington. “I am a practicing Catholic,” she told me. “But I’m also for separation of church and state. I am supportive of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. And I think that this is the kind of choice that has to be up to the woman, her God and her doctor.”On the Affordable Care Act -– Obama’s signature legislative measure -– Grimes was cautiously critical. “I am troubled by some of the provisions,” she said, and for the first time said exactly which one.“There are 700,000 businesses in Kentucky and I am concerned that especially the smaller ones are overburdened,” she said.Her suggestion: delay the imposition of the coverage mandate on small business, as the president already has done for larger corporations.“The mandate will not work for many small businesses in Kentucky,” she said, “so I believe that a delay is the right course so that changes can be made.”She also blasted McConnell for wanting to abandon the law altogether, pointing out that the state’s health ratings are among the worst in the nation, and that other provisions in the law will extend coverage to an estimated 600,000 more Kentuckians.“Unlike Sen. McConnell, I don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water,” she said. Of course McConnell is being blasted by tea party conservatives for his refusal -– so far -– to sign a letter that would force the issue by tying the next budget and debt-ceiling bills to the “defunding” of the ACA.“He has a tightrope to walk,” Grimes observed, not sympathetically.Her opening gambits on the issues are revealing for what they show about her beliefs and the strategy -- disagree with Washington Democratic orthodoxy when she can; hew to it when it is useful.A pure pro-choice view is a must in the Democratic Party, if for no other reason than so many women activists are motivated to vote for –- and work for -– the party because of their strong belief in that view.Grimes clearly wants to tap the fast-growing power of women in the Democratic Party, a phenomenon with a surprisingly long history in Kentucky politics.She stressed the female mentors in her life -– a teacher who taught her rhetoric, her mother and grandmothers, her four sisters. She proudly stated that she is the “youngest female secretary of state in the nation.”It sounded like a rather obscure claim when she made it at the Marshall County Bean Supper in nearby Kentucky Lakes on Friday night.But it drew a big round of applause -– even bigger than the one Marshall County Judge/Executive Mike Miller got when he auctioned off a donated “whole hog” for $350.Her speech was primarily sound-bitten attacks on McConnell. It was well received, if only because Democratic loyalists deeply despise McConnell.But to win -– she is in a dead-heat in some recent polls –- she will have to come of age on the fly in the midst of a grueling, 15-month race from here to November 2014.Nobody really knows who she is or what she really stands for, but she began the process of saying so Friday night.Next stop, Fancy Farm.

A new HuffPost/YouGov poll suggests that Americans would be split over whether that was a good thing.According to the poll, 40 percent of Americans would approve of the president nominating an atheist to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, while almost as many -- 38 percent -- said they would disapprove.The suggestion that Breyer might be a nonbeliever was sparked by a remark he made last week during oral arguments in a case involving government-instituted prayer at public meetings. After Justice Antonin Scalia asked a lawyer in the case what would be the equivalent of prayer for a nonreligious person, Breyer interjected, ""Perhaps he’s asking me that question and I can answer it later.""The poll found that 45 percent of Americans think a potential justice's religious beliefs should not be relevant during the nominations process, while 36 percent said the president should take those beliefs into account. Republicans were especially likely to disapprove of the idea of nominating an atheist justice (56 percent to 26 percent), while pluralities of Democrats (49 percent to 34 percent) and independents (42 percent to 34 percent) said they would approve.Republicans were about equally divided on whether the president should take religious beliefs into account when choosing a nominee: 43 percent said he should, 41 percent said he should not. Democrats, by 47 percent to 36 percent, and independents, by 46 percent to 33 percent, said he should not. Born-again Christians were also especially likely to think religious beliefs should be considered during the nominations process (53 percent) and to disapprove of the idea of an atheist Supreme Court nominee (65 percent). Americans' views about an atheist justice parallel their feelings on nonbelievers holding other public offices. By 40 percent to 34 percent, Americans said they would vote for a well-qualified atheist nominated by their party for president. By 42 percent to 35 percent, they said they would vote for a well-qualified atheist for Congress.The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Nov. 8-9 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

A Bloomberg National poll released Wednesday found that 55 percent of Americans approve of Obama's performance, his highest rating in the poll since September 2009. The poll also found that 49 percent of respondents believe that the president's proposals to increase government spending in key areas are more likely to spur job creation than GOP-backed efforts to cut both spending and taxes. Additionally, the Bloomberg poll found Republican popularity at a record low. Just 35 percent of respondents said they have a favorable view of the GOP, marking the lowest ratings for the party since the poll began three years ago. The Republican rating also marked a six point drop over the last six months. The poll surveyed 1,003 adults between February 15 and February 18, with a three percent margin of error.Obama's popularity has been on an upward trend in the months since his reelection. A Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted last month found that 60 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the president. In December, a CBS poll showed Obama's strongest numbers since the death of Osama Bin Laden in May 2011. However, the Bloomberg poll wasn't all good news for the president. 55 percent of respondents said they disapprove of how Obama has handled the federal budget deficit, and 49 percent have an unfavorable view with how he has handled the economy. HuffPost Pollster's chart, which tracks all publicly available polls, currently finds Obama approval rating at 52.7 percent.

As Willie Geist of NBC News reported on Monday morning, some of the most sought-after spots were near the Navy Memorial at 7th Street NW, opposite the National Archives. It was around that location where President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama got out of their limousine and started walking along the processional route four years ago during the president's first Inauguration. And sure enough, for their second Inauguration, the president and first lady left their limousine around 9th Street NW and walked for approximately three blocks before getting back in their motorcade. They arrived in the vicinity of the White House around 4:10 p.m. where they later gathered to watch the remainder of the Inauguration parade from the official review stand opposite Lafayette Park.The parade took a momentary pause as the first family, Vice President Biden and his family and their guests made their way into the review stand just before 4:45 p.m.Story continues after slideshow ...The parade was originally scheduled to start around 2:30 p.m. but was delayed by the Inauguration luncheon in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, which was also behind schedule. The procession, which included 59 groups and 8,800 people, started to leave Capitol Hill around 3:15 p.m., went west along Constitution Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue and ended at 17th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House. Among the groups featured in the parade were the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, Boy Scout Troop 358 from Philadelphia, the Boston Crusaders Drum & Bugle Corps, the Georgia State University Marching Band, the Lesbian and Gay Band Association of St. Louis, Military Spouses of Michigan, the Navajo Nation Band of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the University of Maryland Mighty Sound Marching Band, the Virginia Military Institute Marching Unit and the Palmview High School Mariachi and Folkloric Group of La Joya, Texas, among many more.Some of the most recognized landmarks in the nation's capital sit along the processional route. The president passed the U.S. Department of Labor, the Canadian Embassy, the Newseum, the National Gallery of Art, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Archives, the Navy Memorial, the FBI headquarters, the Justice Department, the Old Post Office Pavilion, Freedom Plaza, the John A. Wilson Building and the Treasury Department, among other buildings, memorials and statues. There were some protesters along the route, including members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who received a permit to demonstrate at John Marshall Park near 4th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue.At the John A. Wilson Building, the seat of the District of Columbia government, local officials had a protest banner on full display decrying the lack of full and equal congressional representation for residents of the nation's capital.This post has been updated ...

Circuit -- a top priority for President Barack Obama that some Republicans are determined to sink.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) filed a procedural motion on Monday to begin debate on one of Obama's three nominees to the court. Specifically, Reid filed a ""cloture"" motion on D.C. appellate lawyer Patricia Millett, which sets her up for a confirmation vote later this week.A top Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly predicted ""a big fight"" once the D.C. Circuit nominees hit the floor, but said the ""word is that we and [the White House] are ready to fight hard."" Reid has said that Democrats are focused on getting at least one more judge confirmed to the court, and has hinted at changes to Senate rules if Republicans stage a filibuster.The court currently has four Democrat-appointed judges and four Republican-appointed judges, with three empty slots and three Obama nominees waiting on the sidelines. Two of the nominees -- Millett and Nina Pillard -- cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee months ago and have been awaiting floor votes. The third nominee, Robert Wilkins, is set for his committee vote on Thursday.While partisan scuffles over Obama's nominees are nothing new, his picks for the D.C. Circuit are particularly key to his legacy. The court has broad power to review federal regulations and is considered second only to the Supreme Court in terms of its stature. The D.C. Circuit has also been a launching pad for the Supreme Court: four sitting Supreme Court justices once served on it.Senate Republicans routinely argue that there's no need to fill the vacancies on the court. The court isn't busy enough, some say, to warrant having all 11 of its seats, and thereby should lose those slots waiting to be filled. Others have falsely accused the president of ""court-packing."" Earlier this month, GOP senators repeated those arguments to The Huffington Post.""We do not need these judges. It's just plain as day,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""They have, by far, the lowest caseload per judge. They take the summers off."" ""It's clear they're trying to pack the D.C. court,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), also a member of the committee. ""It's probably the most important appellate court in the country ... so there's a matter of great concern.""Both predicted Republicans will use any procedural or tactical means that they can to block the nominees.""I'm going to fight as hard as I can,"" Sessions said.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) reiterated his party's complaints last week in a FoxNews.com op-ed.""Republicans should remain united in blocking Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s attempt to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is America's second-most-influential judicial body,"" Cornyn wrote.But GOP charges of ""court-packing"" are factually incorrect. The term is used to describe an attempt to increase the number of judges on a court with the goal of shifting its political balance, not to fill existing vacancies. One could even make the case that GOP efforts to prevent Obama from filling empty court seats, thereby keeping those courts from having judges appointed by a Democrat, are instances of ""court-unpacking.""Plenty of other notable voices make the case for filling the court. Patricia M. Wald, a retired judge who served on the court for 20 years, highlighted the court's particularly complex and time-consuming caseload in a Washington Post op-ed. Sid Shapiro, an administrative law expert and Center for Progressive Reform member scholar, said the average number of cases before the court is actually up, from 1,152 cases during the Bush administration to 1,362 under Obama.Also an advocate of filling the court's empty slots: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. He signed off on an April 5 report by the Judicial Conference of the United States that recommends keeping the court at 11 seats. Sessions, for one, hadn't heard about Roberts' recommendation.""I want to see that quote. Where'd he say that?"" Sessions asked, jumping out of an elevator he'd just hopped into. When HuffPost cited the April 5 report, Sessions grumbled about Roberts not being a real Republican.""He's always advocating the court. He wants pay raises for staff,"" he said. ""Otherwise, he's supposed to be conservative."""

But though she is well-schooled in the basics -- firm handshake, straight-ahead manner and careful talking points -- Grimes launched her campaign without a website, position papers, staff or much of anything else.Team Mitch unloaded with derision and precision, posting an online video portraying Grimes as Barack Obama's dancing partner (the president isn't popular in Kentucky) and a tree-hugging foe of the state's powerful coal industry.But a Senate race is a long-distance affair, especially in Kentucky, where polls show that McConnell, the Senate minority leader, is weak, at a time when voters everywhere despise Congress and Washington. And now in the second furlong, evidence is beginning to emerge that Grimes may turn into a surprisingly formidable foe for a man who is more than twice her age.In her first major appearance before national party leaders, Saturday on Martha's Vineyard, Grimes wowed Democratic senators, Senate candidates and donors alike at the party's annual private summer fundraising retreat.Each year the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee invites top donors to schmooze with senators, especially those up for reelection, and inspect the merchandise of challengers who will take on Republican incumbents.Grimes spoke to the group Saturday morning and brought the jaded and normally undemonstrative crowd to its feet in wild applause, said one top donor, who had been deeply skeptical of the idea that McConnell could be knocked off by anyone. He and another attendee spoke to The Huffington Post on the condition that their names not be used.Grimes' feisty talk, the sources said, mixed a commitment to a Democratic job-creation agenda with a pedal-to-the-metal attack on McConnell.""I've been going to these for years, and I have never, until this morning, seen a candidate get a standing O,"" said the donor, who is among the top 100 contributors to the committee over the last five years. ""It was amazing.""Clearly, dislike of McConnell -- a shrewd, remorseless combatant in the Senate and in GOP circles nationally -- is one reason why Grimes was so well-received in Martha's Vineyard. It's also well-known that former President Bill Clinton, who is close to Grimes' father, encouraged her to enter the race.But another reason that she was a hit, an attendee said, was that she exceeded expectations with a good speech, strong presence and youthful appeal. ""She's attractive, by the way,"" the donor said. ""Doesn't hurt."""

11896	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/20/tea-party_n_4308305.html	Opinion	0	Elections	None	SomewhatPositive	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"By Nick CareyLOUISVILLE, Kentucky, Nov 20 (Reuters) - After a string of setbacks and losses, the insurgent Tea Party movement is at a crossroads, between learning to live within the Republican Party or pursuing its fight against those it sees as not conservative enough.The choice is an easy one for Tea Party activists, who vow to keep up their campaign to vote out of office those Republican politicians they say have betrayed the tenets of the conservative cause - smaller government and less federal spending and taxes.Voters nationally blame October's partial government shutdown on Republicans, and particularly the Tea Party, which lost elections earlier this month in Virginia and Alabama.With important mid-term congressional elections coming in November 2014, the Tea Party is under pressure from within the Republican Party to call off their insurgency and focus on the end game of defeating Democrats, rather than bruising primaries to clobber Republicans, some of whom could be in close contests to keep their seats.Republican strategist Ford O'Connell said the Tea Party movement needs to decide its long-term strategy.""Are they interested in toppling Republicans or winning elections? If they don't win some elections they're probably going to die on the vine,"" O'Connell said.A series of interviews with Tea Party activists preparing for 2014, mainly in southern states, produced a clear consensus of the path forward, with possibly unsettling implications for Republican incumbents.While mainstream Republicans nationally see the crisis of President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul as their ticket to success next November, Tea Party activists see Republican leaders' decision to end the shutdown in October as a betrayal of the fight over healthcare reform, best met with primary challenges next spring.""The Tea Party won the 2010 election for the Republicans,"" said Debbie Dooley of the Atlanta Tea Party. ""We took a back seat in 2012 and the Republicans lost. We're not going to make the same mistake in 2014.""The national criticism of the movement is failing to change many minds in the movement, either.""If we have to get hurt in the polls in order to save the country from financial ruin, so be it,"" said Ben Cunningham, a long-time conservative activist in Tennessee involved in efforts to find a challenger for Senator Lamar Alexander.Tea Party-backed primary challengers are running in South Carolina against Senator Lindsey Graham, a frequent target of Tea Party ire for his ability to compromise, and Alexander in Tennessee. There are also right-wing challenges to Senator Pat Roberts in Kansas and Thad Cochran in Mississippi. The Senate seat in Georgia left open by the impending retirement of Saxby Chambliss has a field of candidates vying for the mantle of most conservative.For many grassroots conservatives the main target is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. McConnell is well known for vowing to make Obama a one-term president, but his record of brokering deals with Obama has incensed the Tea Party.""There are many important races in 2014 that deserve attention,"" said David Adams, president of Kentucky Citizens Judicial, a group suing Kentucky's Democratic Governor Steve Beshear over the implementation of Obama's health care law. ""But in terms of taking off the head of the snake, Kentucky is it.""In Kentucky and elsewhere, some of the Tea Party's challenges are perennial: they lack name recognition, the benefits of incumbency, and their rivals raise millions of dollars to their thousands.What Tea Party activists have on their side is cheap get-out-the-vote technology, motivated volunteers, and enough past success to provide a roadmap for would-be candidates. In Kentucky, for instance, many Tea Partiers united early around a candidate, and started campaigning early, following the lead of Ted Cruz of Texas, who came from behind to win a U.S. Senate seat. BACKING ONE HORSEA national Quinnipiac University poll published Nov. 13 found 47 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of the Tea Party, the highest percentage yet. Other national polls have also shown a drop in popularity for the movement.But unlike the Republican Party's national structure, the Tea Party has become an increasingly regional phenomenon, at its strongest in Republican dominated states like Georgia or in a few battleground states like Ohio.Of 80 Republican House members who wrote to John Boehner in August arguing the House Speaker should threaten a shutdown over the healthcare law known as Obamacare, 13 represent districts in Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.""There are parts of the country geographically and sociologically that continue to feed the Tea Party phenomenon,"" said James Henson, a politics professor at the University of Texas in Austin. ""I'd be surprised if recruitment wasn't up.""While some senior Republicans in the U.S. Senate say House Republicans and senators Cruz and Mike Lee of Utah fought a useless, self-punishing fight over the government shutdown, conservatives say were close to victory undermining Obamacare when moderate Republicans undermined them.The Tea Party also pins the narrow Nov. 5 defeat of conservative Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia's gubernatorial race on the refusal of the Republican establishment to back him.The challenge is daunting in Kentucky, Tennessee and South Carolina where McConnell, Alexander and Graham all have a big advantage in raising money. McConnell, for instance, had $10 million cash on hand at the end of September. His opponent, moderately wealthy businessman Matt Bevin, had raised less than $900,000, more than two thirds of which was his own money.McConnell had a 33 point lead over Bevin in one poll. The Senator has focused his campaign on Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, with whom he was tied, according to polling.Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said it is hard to see the challengers in Kentucky, Tennessee or South Carolina being able to win, but that Cruz's long slog ahead of the Texas primary showed a challenge could develop late.""The best you could say at the moment is the jury is out,"" he said. INDIANA PLAYBOOKTea Party activists in Kentucky and Tennessee have carefully studied the playbook adopted by activists in Indiana in their successful bid to oust former Republican Senator Richard ""Dick"" Lugar in 2012. The key to primary victory involved getting behind a single challenger in state treasurer Richard Mourdock and going door to door for months ahead of the election -- well ahead of traditional campaigns.Many Tea Party activists have rallied behind Bevin in Kentucky. Speaking at his home in Louisville in October, Bevin said he would have favored the government shutdown. McConnell's team says voters will favor politicians who get things done.Bevin said his race against McConnell would be won ""from the bottom up"" by grassroots activists and compared his opponent to the emperor with no clothes, lacking real Republican values.""If this naked emperor can be exposed, any one of them can be exposed. If we can do this at the ballot box, none of them are safe and we can send them home one at a time,"" he said, invoking other Tea Party challenges gearing up.Activists are already going door to door for the primary election in May, using get-out-the-vote software provided free of charge by Kansas-based group the Madison Project, and Tea Partiers in Tennessee are using similar technology.""The only energy in the Republican Party at the moment lies in the Tea Party,"" said Randy Keller of the Bowling Green Southern Kentucky Tea Party, a conclusion some political analysts reach as well.""The lack of a ground game is a particular point of vulnerability for Republicans like Mitch McConnell,"" said Steven Schier, a politics professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. ""The question is can they compete at the ground level?""BOON FOR DEMOCRATS?With bruising primary contests likely in key states, one question is will the winner be able to win the general election.In Indiana's primary last year, Mourdock beat Lugar but lost in the general election in a reliably Republican state.In Kentucky's 2011 gubernatorial election, the candidate backed by Tea Party activists lost in a hard-fought primary, and many frustrated conservatives stayed home on election day, contributing to the re-election of Democrat Beshear.The Bowling Green Southern Kentucky Tea Party's Keller is no fan of McConnell's but he worries that widespread dislike for McConnell among conservatives could favor the Democratic candidate on election day in 2014.""I would really rather not see that happen because even a flawed Republican would be better than a Democrat,"" he said.

While her lead is within the margin of error, the poll also underscored some broader issues that McConnell is likely to face as he campaigns for a sixth term.At 51 percent, a majority of Kentuckians say they disapprove of McConnell's job performance, while 40 percent approve and 9 percent are undecided. Those numbers are an improvement over an April PPP poll that showed him to be one of the least popular senators in the country, with a 36 percent job approval rating. His lagging numbers reinforce a longstanding problem that McConnell has had wrangling support for his reelection bid.PPP surveyed 1,210 Kentucky voters for the first two questions, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent. PCCC reportedly plans to release additional findings from the survey at a press conference later on Thursday.“It’s no surprise that Kentucky voters have had enough of Mitch McConnell’s partisan gridlock,” said Jonathan Hurst, senior adviser to Lundergan Grimes. “For thirty years, McConnell has been the embodiment of all that is wrong with Washington and has no problem turning his back on Kentucky’s middle class.”""George Soros and the Obama Allies are up to their same old tricks,"" said McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton. ""They have concocted another fictitious poll that has no basis in reality, held it for ten days, and released it at the perfect time in the news cycle to help their upstart liberal candidate. This poll has zero credibility and should be ignored out of hand.""PPP's polling was lauded for its accuracy during the 2012 election cycle.Previous polls by the firm, taken in April and May, before Lundergan Grimes officially kicked off her campaign, similarly suggested that the Democrat would be a viable threat to McConnell. A survey taken by Republican firm Wenzel Strategies last month had McConnell in better shape, leading Grimes 48 percent to 40 percent.Potentially compounding matters for McConnell is the recent decision by Kentucky tea party activist and businessman Matt Bevin to challenge the five-term senator for the Republican nomination. Bevin was not included in the latest survey, though the Wenzel Strategies poll released in July suggested that McConnell had a strong lead over his challenger.This article was updated to include comment from the McConnell campaign.UPDATE: 7:23 p.m. ET -- A poll conducted by Grimes' campaign also showed the Democrat with a slight lead over McConnell, the Courier Journal reported Thursday. In that poll, Grimes led McConnell by two points.The internal Grimes poll surveyed 750 Kentucky voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. "

So King was primed to be one of those ""mad as hell/not gonna take it anymore"" types as Monday's deliberations began, and as the sun set in the west, it looked for all the world like he was going to finally foment a revolt. As the National Review's Jonathan Strong reported Monday evening, ""Republican moderates have apparently had enough."" King wanted a ""clean"" continuing resolution, and he was going to damn well keep the rest of the GOP caucus from adding rules to the bill by leading a gang of moderate Republicans into the breach:In what is by far their boldest stand since the GOP took control of the House in 2010, a group of them are threatening to bring down a vote on the rule for the government-funding bill scheduled for 6:30 p.m.New York representative Peter King is leading the charge, and his fellow New Yorker [Representative] Michael Grimm is close behind him. The group told leadership on Saturday they have 25 members who are willing to bring down the rule.This was a significant rump, taking this ""boldest stand."" As Politico reported, ""If no Democrats vote for the rule, [Speaker of the House John] Boehner can only lose 17 Republicans to sink the plan."" And so, the battle was joined, and as night fell across the District of Columbia, everyone who wanted the insanity to end turned their hopeful eyes to the vote count in the House. Would King bring 25 votes against dirtying up the continuing resolution?As it turns out, King overestimated the number in his band of brothers by... you know, about 23 people:The size of a bloc of GOP moderates ready to bring down a vote on the House floor over the government-funding bill shriveled from 25 lawmakers on Saturday to just two when the House voted just now to pass the rule.New York representative Peter King and Pennsylvania representative Charlie Dent, two key moderates, voted no, while four hardline conservatives, including Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, voted no because the bill didn’t draw a hard enough line against Obamacare.Well done, lads. Ha, ha, remember that whole ""fellow New Yorker Michael Grimm is close behind him"" part? That was really neat.There's not a whole lot to say about a plan that nobody should have believed was going to come to fruition anyway. But it's worth pointing out that when the political media holds forth on the ideological landscape of Congress, and games out what they believe is possible in terms of bargains and compromises, just about everything in their conceptual framework is premised on the notion that a lot of moderate Republicans exist, and that the resting state of Capitol Hill is ""center-right.""As it turns out, all of those premises are wrong. There aren't a lot of ""moderate Republicans"" in Congress. And those who exist are very timid and nearly useless when the chips are down. The government is shut down right now, but the notion that ""moderate Republicans"" were capable of steering a debate somewhere sensible went by the boards a long time ago.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) warned Thursday that a coming Supreme Court case that could ultimately eliminate certain campaign contribution limits is a ""clear danger"" that threatens to expand the influence of large and wealthy corporations on elections.The case -- McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, set to be argued on Oct. 8 -- challenges the aggregate limit on campaign contributions that an individual donor can make in a single election. Currently, a donor may only give $123,300 in total, made up of sub-limits of $48,600 to candidates and $74,600 to party committees and PACs.The plaintiff, Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon, hopes that the court will eliminate these limits, arguing earlier this year that the issue is ""a very important First Amendment case about freedom of speech.""On Thursday, speaking at an event held by the Constitutional Accountability Center, Warren argued, ""If the court continues in the direction of Citizens United, we may move another step closer to neutering Congress' ability to limit the influence of money in politics and another step closer to unlimited corporate contributions given directly to candidates and political committees.""Warren also endorsed the research of her former academic colleague, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, on the framers of the Constitution's original definition of corruption and on the ways in which Congress has become warped by monied interests.Lessig, who followed Warren Thursday with a presentation on his research, sought to frame the McCutcheon case, and the money-in-politics issue generally, in terms the conservative justices on the Supreme Court would respond to. Lessig and the Constitutional Accountability Center have filed an amicus brief in the McCutcheon case based on his research and arguments.The Supreme Court -- most dramatically in the 2010 Citizens United decision -- has stated that the only type of corruption able to be regulated is quid pro quo, cash-for-votes corruption. But, according to Lessig, this is not the way the framers understood corruption and, thus, neither should the five conservative justices on the court.Two chapters from the Federalist Papers are of particular interest to Lessig. In Federalist 52, James Madison writes that the federal government created by the Constitution should have at least one branch ""dependent upon the people alone."" In Federalist 57, Madison writes that the people on whom that branch depends should be ""not the rich, more than the poor.""Lessig argued that the oversized reliance of members of Congress on their campaign donors is an institutional corruption of the dependence that Congress is supposed to have ""upon the people alone."" The foundation for his argument is a number of statements and writings by the framers concerning corruption of this nature -- evidence a constitutional originalist would take into consideration.Lessig said he had found at least 325 specific instances in which the framers used the term corruption (collected here in a Tumblr blog). Of those, only six explained corruption as a trading of favors, while there were 29 mentions of corruption as an ""improper dependence."" He also found that 57 percent of the mentions of corruption were about institutions, rather than individuals.This argument is designed to paint into a corner the five conservative justices, who commonly favor eliminating campaign finance limits, by suggesting that their efforts conflict with the original intent of the framers.In the McCutcheon case, he argued, the elimination of campaign contribution limits would likely reduce the overall number of donors to campaigns and, thus, make Congress even more dependent upon an even smaller slice of donors, who are not representative of the people. Lessig used research done by National Institute of Money in State Politics executive director Ed Bender that shows that contribution limits expand the number of donors while the elimination of contribution limits reduces the number of donors.""If you eliminate the cap on aggregate contributions, the number of funders in the system will fall even more than it has so far,"" Lessig said. ""And if the number of funders drop, then the dependence corruption within the system, as I've just described it, only gets worse.""But Lessig said he is optimistic that the justices will look at the McCutcheon case and the original definition of corruption used by the framers and form a strong majority to uphold the aggregate campaign contribution limits."

""If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you'll see more of them doing it,"" Obama said. Most recently, Limbaugh had a flair for the divisive during the fiscal cliff talks, encouraging members of the GOP to refrain from negotiating with the president.""I would suggest to people who really believe Obama is concerned about his second term and his legacy -- he doesn't want a recession -- the only way to flush that out is to come dangerously close to allowing it all to happen,"" said Limbaugh in late November.Obama linked that point to John Boehner in the TNR interview, adding that he thought the House Speaker ""genuinely wanted to get a deal done,"" but was impacted by vulnerability to attacks from more conservative streams of the Republican Party.  Boehner barely retained his House Speaker role, leaving the holiday talks in an embattled state after many members of his caucus were displeased with the terms of the agreement. While the president specifically named some names of the right-wing contingency, he added that the left is far from immune to the ""same dynamic."" Yet those networks in his estimation, and Democrats alike, are less obstinate to some give and take.""I think the difference is just that the more left-leaning media outlets recognize that compromise is not a dirty word,"" he said. ""And I think at least leaders like myself—and I include Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi in this -- are willing to buck the more absolutist-wing elements in our party to try to get stuff done.""For the full interview with Obama, head over to The New Republic.

Below, more from the Associated Press:WASHINGTON — A divided Senate confirmed Thomas Perez on Thursday to become secretary of labor, elevating the son of Dominican immigrants who as a top Justice Department official won praise from Democrats for aggressively enforcing civil rights laws and criticism from Republicans for being a liberal ideologue.Thursday's party-line, 54-46 vote marked the third major vacancy in President Barack Obama's second-term leadership team that the Senate has filled in three days. The sudden movement followed this week's bipartisan deal in which Republicans agreed to end blockades against votes on seven nominations and Democrats shelved efforts to change Senate rules to weaken the minority GOP's powers.Perez, 51, is a Buffalo, N.Y., native who once worked as a trash collector. Since earning a Harvard University law degree, his career has included stints as a Justice Department civil rights prosecutor and an aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., before taking over Justice's civil rights division in 2009.At Justice, he has challenged Texas and South Carolina laws requiring voters to show photo identification and sued the office of outspoken Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, alleging that Latinos were racially profiled during a crackdown on immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.""He has spent his career fighting for working families, protecting our important civil rights laws and turning around troubled agencies,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.Republicans say Perez has selectively enforced laws according to his political views. GOP senators have suggested that politics has guided his decisions about enforcing voting rights laws and accused him of supporting efforts to sidestep federal immigration laws when he was a local government official in Maryland.""Tom Perez is more than just some left-wing ideologue – he's a left-wing ideologue who appears perfectly willing to bend the rules to achieve his ends,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.After the vote, the Senate began debating Gina McCarthy's nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency.On Wednesday, the Senate voted narrowly to end a filibuster against Perez. All but six Republicans voted against Perez – the exact number of GOP senators that majority Democrats needed to muster the 60 votes required to end the delaying tactic against Perez's nomination.That 60-40 vote was the closest senators have come to unwinding this week's deal between the two parties that has averted all-out partisan warfare over nominations and Senate rules. That roll call seemed to signal that while GOP leaders would deliver the votes needed to honor the bipartisan agreement, numerous Republicans were rankled by the pact and unhappy with Perez.McCarthy, who currently heads the EPA's air pollution office, has helped craft rules aimed at reducing pollutants from power plants and other sources. Republicans have long criticized the agency for championing overly restrictive regulations that they say kill jobs.Last week, Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, top Republican on the Senate environment committee, said he was dropping efforts to delay McCarthy's nomination after the EPA agreed to release more information about how it makes decisions. McCarthy has also faced opposition from Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., because of delays to a flood control project.The other five nominees involved in the deal include Richard Cordray, whom the Senate confirmed Tuesday as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Fred Hochberg, whom the Senate approved Wednesday to continue leading the Export-Import Bank.Still to be considered are labor lawyers Nancy Schiffer and Kent Hirozawa to join the National Labor Relations Board and NLRB Chairman Mark Pearce, whom Obama wants to keep in the role.UPDATE (2:10 p.m. ET) -- President Barack Obama issued a statement Thursday afternoon on Perez's confirmation:I welcome today’s confirmation of Tom Perez to serve as Secretary of Labor. Tom has lived the American dream himself, and has dedicated his career to keeping it within reach for hardworking families across the country. At the Department of Labor, Tom will help us continue to grow our economy, help businesses create jobs, make sure workers have the skills those jobs require, and ensure safe workplaces and economic opportunity for all. I want to thank the Senate once again for agreeing to move forward on Tom and the other nominees who have waited far too long for the yes-or-no votes they deserve.This story has been updated with information from the AP and the White House."

While Romney reportedly had ""no big plans,"" the aide said it was ""doubtful"" that Romney would watch the ceremony.Romney was the first losing presidential candidate not to attend the inauguration since Michael Dukakis in 1989.

But teens weren’t the only sources of inspiration from that day -- host Chelsea Clinton also had some words of wisdom to share with the young audience.While you probably know her best as President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea has made a name for herself as a special correspondent for NBC News, as well as in her efforts to speak out about the uncomfortable topic of diarrhea, which is related to 100,000 deaths in Nigeria each year. HuffPost Teen caught up with the impassioned former first daughter at TEDxTeen this past Saturday in New York. Here are five powerful pieces of advice for Generation Y we took from our conversation with her.1. Ask yourself what you can do for others.  ""When [my grandmother and parents] would ask me, 'Well, what did you do today?' part of what they implied was, 'Well, what did you do for others?' It would not have been okay at the dinner table if I just didn’t have something to say ... That was the kind of world I grew up in. And being asked those questions really often helped me to always think, 'Wow, I have a real responsibility to define my life partly through what I can do for others and what I can learn from others.' I’m grateful that they set that example.""2. You should care about the world around you.  “I think [there] is a big misconception that people who are younger are more apathetic or more disinterested or more tuned out. That’s just not true. People are more connected, feel more empowered and feel a greater responsibility for their world than ever before. And we see that in so many different ways. I mean, a greater number and a greater percentage of people than ever before volunteer on a regular basis, and they actually keep volunteering once they’re in college ... young people [also] donate small dollar amounts when there are crises, like the Haiti earthquake. So I think all of this says that young people are far from apathetic, actually feel quite engaged, and thankfully, [feel] quite empowered.”3. Do what you can.  “I think all the time, 'What can I be doing?' and then, 'What should I be doing?' ... Because if we feel like, 'Oh my gosh, we can do everything and we should do everything' -- that’s overwhelming and disempowering. So I think about the things where I can make a difference.""4. If you have a great idea, speak up.  “Let your idea out of your head. Have the courage to share your idea, whether it’s with your teacher, a friend, online -- like an online community that is already concentrated around something that you really care about. See what the reaction is, see what the response is. Hopefully that will help surface different ideas to make your idea even stronger.” 5. ""Get caught trying.""  “The best advice that my mom gave me was repeating my grandmother’s mantra: Life’s about not what happens to you, it’s about what you do with what happens to you. It really is this kind of galvanizing message in my family. [Also] 'get caught trying,' which is something that has really motivated my father’s life. It’s always better to have tried and failed than to never have tried at all.”"

With 2012 officially the hottest year on record for the U.S., activists warn that continued burning of fossil fuels will further increase greenhouse gas concentrations, raise global average temperatures and increase the odds of more frequent and intense extreme weather events.In his 2013 State of the Union Address, President Obama said, ""We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it's too late."" While Obama's speech was marked by sweeping rhetoric, it included ""little detail on how to tackle climate change and propel green energy,"" noted The Huffington Post's Lynne Peeples."

Environmental Resources Management has conflicts of interest that should have prevented it from winning the contract for the analysis of the controversial pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Sierra Club has said. The group filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the State Department seeking documents that would show how Environmental Resources Management was chosen. Sierra Club provided some of the documents it received to The Huffington Post.But the documents do not indicate that the State Department conducted its own investigation into the company's ties to pipeline operator TransCanada before approving it to produce the analysis. Environmental Resources Management's draft supplemental environmental analysis, released in March, recommended changes to the pipeline route, but declared the project would have ""no significant impacts to most resources."" The Obama administration's decision on the pipeline is expected sometime early next year. Included in the documents Sierra Club obtained is a memo from a State Department staffer to Kerri-Ann Jones, assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, that recommends Environmental Resources Management for the pipeline contract. ""ERM is the only candidate that has not worked for TransCanada or its subsidiaries of affiliates, nor has ERM been a third-party contractor on any reviews of TransCanada projects,"" the memo says. The documents include signed forms from ERM and TransCanada affirming that they had not previously worked together, as well as talking points for government staff to use answering press questions about potential conflicts of interest.""The most alarming thing is the documents that aren't there,"" said Doug Hayes, a staff attorney at Sierra Club. ""So far they've sent us a bunch of documents, and none of them demonstrate that State Department did any independent inquiry into ERM's conflict of interest.""If State Department officials had looked, they may have found reasons to reject ERM, Hayes said. After ERM's analysis was released, Mother Jones revealed that a key ERM staffer on the project had previously done work for TransCanada, and that two other contractors had done work for ANR Pipeline, a TransCanada subsidiary. Still other ERM employees had worked for companies that would benefit from the pipeline. The biographies of those ERM staffers had been removed from materials the State Department released with the draft environmental impact statement. Mother Jones reported on the potential conflicts earlier this year after obtaining the version of the biographies before they were redacted by the State Department. Environmental groups seized on those connections, arguing that they should have prevented ERM from getting the contract. They also argued that ERM had not been transparent about this previous work for TransCanada in its disclosure form. The State Department's Office of Inspector General is now looking into those allegations. The inspector general's report, delayed by the government shutdown, will not be ready until late-February 2014, spokesman Douglas Welty told The Huffington Post.The department's first environmental analysis for the pipeline was conducted by Cardo Entrix, a company whose previous work for TransCanada prompted environmental groups to complain of conflicts of interest. That led to an investigation by the State Department's inspector general, which found no evidence that TransCanada had ""improperly influenced"" State's selection of the contractor and no actual conflict of interest in hiring Cardno Entrix. But the report dinged the department for failing to independently evaluate the contractor's claim that it had no conflicts and for ""accepting them at face value.""Sierra Club's FOIA request sought records related to State's approval of ERM for the second study to see what, if anything, the department did differently in evaluating potential conflicts of interest for the new environmental study. ""It looks like State Department did exactly what they did last time, which is take ERM and TransCanada's statements at face value and not do any independent evaluation,"" Hayes said.In response to questions about the documents, a State Department official said the department doesn't believe there was a conflict of interest in selecting ERM. ""No Environmental Resources Management (ERM) employees working on the review have worked for TransCanada,"" said the official. ""Our rigorous conflict of interest procedures are designed to ensure that no contractors or subcontractors have financial or other interests in the outcome of a project.""The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Interior both have submitted comments critical of ERM's study. The EPA said the study included ""insufficient information"" about several environmental concerns.Another document released in response to the FOIA request is a State Department press guidance from of Aug. 3, 2012. It includes this paragraph as a suggested response to reporters' questions about whether ERM had worked with TransCanada before:No, ERM has neither worked directly for TransCanada before, nor has it worked as a third-party contractor for a federal agency reviewing a TransCanada project. This is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada.The FOIA includes another version of the press guidance dated three days later. That document removes the line that says this ""is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada."" Ross Hammond, a senior campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the removal of that line raises more questions about any potential relationships between ERM and TransCanada, and what the State Department knew about them. Hammond said the information that has come out about ties between the contractors and TransCanada should also raises questions about the Keystone report that ERM wrote. ""There's no reason that anyone should have any confidence -- particularly the president, who will be making the decision on this pipeline -- that what they put in this report is true,"" said Hammond."

The real issue at hand is not freedom of speech or same-sex marriage but Chick-fil-A's secretive funding of documented anti-gay hate groups. The national organization Campus Pride made this clear last week in releasing ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A."" Campus Pride specifically called upon our nation's student leaders to share the truth about Chick-fil-A and its funding of radical-right-wing organizations and documented hate groups.Through its family-controlled nonprofit arm, Chick-fil-A profits have funded such groups as Eagle Forum, Exodus International, Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family. These groups proudly and aggressively work against the rights of LGBT people, advocating their criminalization, psychological abuse, and death. Chick-fil-A has not disputed any of these facts. The ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A"" are well documented, showing the funneling of Chick-fil-A profits to anti-gay causes and even a hate group, as determined by the Southern Poverty Law Center. While Chick-fil-A's leadership has every right to its views, beliefs, and voice, students and administrators alike need to know that revenues going to Chick-fil-A drive funding for groups that are almost certainly in conflict with campus nondiscrimination policies. There is no justification for Chick-fil-A to be on a college campus where there is a responsibility by administrators for a safe learning environment for all students. The actions by Chick-fil-A in taking profits to fund hate groups that harm a population on campus impedes safety and creating a learning environment for academic success.Thanks to the president of Chick-fil-A, Dan Cathy, the cow façade has been lifted to show what is really behind the billboards and spicy chicken sandwiches. Good people, Christian or not, don't use their corporate profits to fund hate groups or causes that work to defame, criminalize, and execute people. Colleges and universities have a real problem on their hands in the next few weeks as students come back to campus. You can't just tell students who disagree to not eat the chicken sandwich; that message is irresponsible and harmful to LGBT students. Colleges have to take responsibility for the facts and realize that student-meal-plan money is going to fund a documented hate group that works to aggressively harm students on their campus. This will certainly affect the safety and campus climate of all students.Read the ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A."" Campus Pride calls on student leaders and campus newspapers to share that:Chick-fil-A profits fund documented hate groups that aggressively work against LGBT people, advocating for their criminalization, psychological abuse, or death.Chick-fil-A profits support the radical-right-wing group Eagle Forum, which supports LGBT people being considered criminals.Chick-fil-A profits support Exodus International, which claims to ""cure homosexuality"" through psychological coercion of LGBT people. It says LGBT people are ""perverse.""Chick-fil-A profits support Focus on the Family (FOF) and its off-shoot group, the Family Research Council (FRC), which has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. FOF aggressively defames LGBT people as a threat to children, and FRC spent $25,000 to stop the U.S. Congress from condemning Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill, which calls for the execution of gay people in some cases.Chick-fil-A profits come from you.

John Francis, 65, adopted his 73-year-old gay partner, Gregory, as a means of financial security, ABC News reported. The move came about because the two, who have been together for 45 years, began to worry about what might happen if one of them died. Even though the Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which had defined marriage as between a man and a woman, couples in Pennsylvania and more than 30 other states where same-sex marriage is still not legal face an uphill battle for equal benefits. ""It's humorous to me,"" he told ABC News. ""Gregory was a high school and college jock. Today, I am making dough for blueberry crostata and he is golfing. You're going to think of him as the dad, rather than me. … But it provided us with some level of comfort that we have protected each other as much as we can.""Visit the CentralVoice to read more about John and Greg's story.Pennsylvania's inheritance tax law states there is a zero percent tax on transfers to a surviving legal spouse. There is a 4.5 percent tax on transfers to direct descendants and lineal heirs, but a 15 percent tax on transfers to other heirs. Since Pennsylvania does not legally recognize same-sex couples, John and Greg previously fell under the 15 percent bracket; however, by adopting Greg, John has moved them into the 4.5 percent bracket. “We wanted to protect ourselves from higher inheritance taxes that heterosexual couples do no[t] incur upon the death of one or other spouse,” Francis explained to local LGBT blog CentralVoice. Since the Supreme Court's landmark DOMA ruling, focus has shifted onto equal rights in states like Pennsylvania. State Rep. Brian Sims (D-Philadelphia), the first openly gay person elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, plans to introduce a marriage equality bill in his state in the hopes of getting ""marriage"" redefined as a ""civil contract between two people who enter into matrimony,"" Philadelphia Weekly reported. However, Sims faces staunch opposition. When he took to the House floor Thursday to discuss the DOMA decision, he was silenced by his conservative peers. Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R-Butler) later told local radio station WHYY that Sims was barred from making comments that would have been ""an open rebellion against God's law."" Others think there is a good chance Pennsylvania will rise to equal rights sooner rather than later. “I think it’s going to be odd for people to be recognized in some states but not in others,"" Christine Bryan of LGBT advocacy group Delta Foundation told CBS station KDKA, ""so I think in some respect the state’s hand is going to be forced.""

Wade ruling. The conversation dealt not only with abortion but also included other ""symptoms"" that have changed the nation.Perkins spoke broadly, saying pro-choice Americans represent a troubled country that doesn't choose life, meaning ""That is to follow the principals, the teachings, the instructions of God ... You see that as you've been in Washington, D.C. There is a rejection of this idea of truth, and that there is a foundation or morality, which needs to be upheld."" Santorum agreed, adding that less young people devote themselves to Christianity. ""If you look at the popular culture and what comes out of Hollywood, if you go to our schools and particularly our colleges and universities, they are indoctrinated in a sea of relativism and a sea of antagonism towards Christianity."" ""Abortion is a symptom. Marriage is a symptom. Pornography [is a symptom],"" he continued. ""All of these are symptoms to the fundamental issue that we've gotten away from the truth and the 'Truth-Giver.'"" Santorum has long been against gay marriage and anti-abortion. When he was in the running for the GOP presidential nomination, he vowed to initiate a war on porn if elected. Santorum received his undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University, an M.B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and a J.D. from the Dickinson School of Law but has criticized the notion that college is a critical entry point to the middle class.""President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college. What a snob!"" Santorum said last February, according to the New York Times. ""There are good, decent men and women who go out and work hard every day and put their skills to the test that aren't taught by some liberal college professor trying to indoctrinate him. I understand why he wants you to go to college. He wants to remake you in his image.""The Times highlighted a 2008 study that disproved the theory that going to college makes students increasingly liberal. The study found that 18 to 24-year-old students' ideals shifted somewhat leftward, but this was in line with normally occurring shifts in that age group regardless of education. "

Several states with constitutional prohibitions on same-sex marriage have implemented rules in the past several weeks saying that same-sex married couples in their states will have to file state taxes as individuals. The U.S. Department of the Treasury ruling recognizing same-sex married couples even if they live in states that do not, was issued in August in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision earlier this year to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Treasury's new rule covers all federal tax matters where marriage is involved, including filing status. North Dakota Tax Commissioner Cory Fong (R) wrote an email to state Rep. Kylie Oversen (D-Grand Forks) in late September explaining North Dakota's policy: Because the North Dakota Constitution does not recognize same sex marriages, the married filing status cannot be recognized for same-sex couples at the state level. Instead, each individual will complete a new supplemental schedule that instructs them on how to report their separate share of the joint federal taxable income. The information on the completed schedule will then be used by each individual to fill out their respective state tax return. The filing status selected by each individual on the state tax return must be either single or head of household.Last week, Kansas Revenue Secretary Nick Jordan made a similar announcement, while the Idaho Tax Commission also indicated that same-sex married couples would be treated as singles on their state filings. In Kansas, Tom Witt, the executive director of Equality Kansas, told The Huffington Post that the state revenue department's ruling may actually violate a state law that allows married couples to use their federal tax returns to determine their state return. ""The administration should really follow state law and federal guidelines, and stop discriminating against gay and lesbian couples in the state,"" Witt told HuffPost.Kansas Revenue Department spokeswoman Jeannine Koranda disagreed with Witt, saying that the state constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage trumps the federal law. She noted that the revenue department is taking steps to help same-sex couples, like developing guidelines on how to use the federally adjusted gross incomes from an IRS worksheet to complete state returns. But Witt said that he believes the state will be sued over this.""If we get sued and go to the courts, and the court decides it is not constitutional, then we will address it,"" Kansas state Rep. J.R. Claeys (R-Salina) told HuffPost. Claeys said he agrees with the rule changes, noting that same-sex marriage is banned in the Kansas constitution. North Dakota Deputy Tax Commissioner Ryan Rauschenberger told HuffPost that his department also wants to streamline the process for same-sex married couples. He said under the North Dakota rules, same-sex couples would be able to divide their federal taxable income between them for state tax purposes. Rauschenberger said rough estimates show those filing as singles under this plan would pay less in taxes than if they filed as a married couple. ""It is a pretty streamlined process,"" Rauschenberger said. In Idaho, the state tax commission will require same-sex married couples to prepare paperwork as singles for the state, in addition to their federal tax preparation. In North Dakota, Rauschenberger said allowing joint filing will have to be addressed by amending the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and noted that state lawmakers don't reconvene until January 2015. Anything the state adopted would have to face a statewide referendum. Oversen said she would like to bring up the issue with her colleagues in the Legislature, but said it would be a tough climb. ""We can't even get same sex housing discrimination banned yet,"" she said. "

DeMint argued that marriage between a man and a woman is ""better for children."" Maddow objected, saying that denying same-sex couples the right to marry was ""humiliating and demeaning"" for kids raised by gay parents. She continued: ""Gay people exist. There's nothing we can do in public policy that makes more of us exist, or less of us exist. And you guys have been arguing for a generation that public policy ought to essentially demean gay people as a way of expressing disapproval of the fact that we exist, but you don't make any less of us exist. You just are arguing in favor of more discrimination, and more discrimination doesn't make straight people's lives any better.""Reed said that Maddow's argument would mean that Obama, who first stated his support for gay marriage last May, was a ""bigot"" until fourteen months ago. ""No one's calling anybody a bigot,"" Maddow shot back. ""You're the only one who's saying 'bigot.'"" Reed also said that the decision would spur Republican voters to action in the mid-term elections.

Gingrich spoke about the issue of same-sex marriage during an interview with The Huffington Post in December. Although he defended his belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, the former House Speaker said the GOP needs to progress with the times. ""It is in every family. It is in every community,"" he told HuffPost. ""The momentum is clearly now in the direction in finding some way to ... accommodate and deal with reality. And the reality is going to be that in a number of American states -- and it will be more after 2014 -- gay relationships will be legal, period.""On Thursday, Right Wing Watch posted a video response to Gingrich's same-sex marriage comments made by Navy chaplain Gordon Klingenschmitt, according to Raw Story. In the video, the chaplain says Gingrich is wholly misguided in pandering to the left and ""homosexual sin."" The chaplain cites a Bible passage from Romans, Chapter 1, which reads ""the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another ... that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.”“It’s not like Newt is personally engaging in homosexual activity, but the Bible condemns him now because he takes pleasure in those that do that sort of thing,” Klingenschmitt explained. “When the Bible condemns his endorsement of homosexual sin then he has become one of the sinners condemned by Romans, Chapter 1.”Klingenschmitt continued to say Gingrich is tempted by ""demonic voices"" that tell him ""Okay, it's not really a sin. We ought to endorse this"" simply to get more votes in a possible 2016 presidential run. The chaplain, who belongs to an evangelical sect of the Episcopal Church and was disgraced in 2006 for disobeying an order, is not the only one to speak out against Gingrich's evolved view on same-sex marriage. Frank Schubert, National Political Director for the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), called the politician's comments both ""stupid"" and ""ridiculous."" Gingrich was previously vocal against same-sex marriage. He went so far as to compare it to paganism, saying, ""The effort to create alternatives to marriage between a man and a woman are perfectly natural pagan behaviors, but they are a fundamental violation of our civilization."" While running for the GOP presidential nomination, he also vowed to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act. Watch Gordon Klingenschmitt's video below. He discusses Newt Gingrich around the 5-minute mark. UPDATE: Gordon Klingenschmitt wrote HuffPost to clarify that he never said he believes Newt Gingrich to be worthy of death. According to the video, however, he did state that the Bible holds ""homosexual acts are worthy of death"" and that the Bible also equally condemns those who ""take pleasure in those who do that sort of thing.""

After the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act on Wednesday, the restaurant chain's president and chief operating officer, Dan Cathy, apparently tweeted an anti-gay response to the ruling. The court ruled Wednesday morning that DOMA, which barred the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, even in states where the union has already been legalized, is unconstitutional. Following the decision, the Supreme Court also dropped the case for Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban. Upon hearing the news, some celebrated for equality while others complained about how society has changed for the worse. Cathy, who made headlines last summer for saying his company supports the ""biblical definition"" of marriage, stood with the latter camp. The Wall Street Journal's Speakeasy reporter Charles Passy was the first to report that Cathy reportedly tweeted an anti-gay marriage statement following the DOMA verdict. A reader sent Passy the tweet, which said it was a ""sad day"" for the nation and that the ""founding fathers would be ashamed."" The post has been deleted.The tweet is still available on Topsy, an online platform that can index and trackback tweets and web pages. In a statement emailed to The Huffington Post on Thursday, a spokesperson for the fast-food restaurant discussed the company's stance, but wouldn't directly comment on Cathy's tweet. ""Dan Cathy, like everyone in this country, has his own views. However, Chick-fil-A is focused on providing great-tasting food and genuine hospitality to everyone,"" spokesman Jerry Johnston said. Cathy's statement may not come as much of a surprise to some. The COO said in 2012 that ""we are inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, ‘We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,'"" the New York Times noted. A backlash ensued after Cathy confirmed his anti-gay stance and his company was found to have ties to anti-gay groups, but Chick-fil-A claimed its only mission is to ""treat every person with honor, dignity and respect"" regardless of ""belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender."" The famed fried chicken joint has since tried to distance itself from any discrimination. Last September, it was reported that Chick-fil-A stopped donating to right-wing groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Cathy himself even seemed to progress, embracing a more open dialogue and befriending LGBT activist Shane Windmeyer, the founder and executive director of pro-LGBT college group Campus Pride. UPDATE: 2:16 p.m. -- Chick-fil-A spokesman Jerry Johnston reached out to HuffPost Thursday afternoon to explain why Cathy decided to pull the tweet, saying, ""He realized his views didn’t necessarily represent the views of all customers, restaurant owners and employees and didn’t want to distract them from providing a great restaurant experience."""

At this level of the debate there is very little exploration of the inherent validity (or otherwise) of same-sex marriage but rather a fixation on the notion that homosexuality is unnatural: ""It's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,"" the opponents quip. In reality, marriage is a societal institution. The natural world didn't create marriage, humans did. Nature-themed arguments against gay marriage say little about the societal institution of marriage but reveal a lot about the homophobia and heterosexism of those who present such arguments. In this regard, the disapproval isn't about gay marriage per se -- it's more about discomfort with homosexuality, period.2. Procreation: ""Marriage is for Procreation"" (FAIL) With the procreation argument, opponents of equality argue that the institution of marriage is essentially in place to assist with procreation and the raising of children. They reason that because two people of the same sex cannot procreate that they should not be allowed to marry. While the production of children may indeed be a feature of many heterosexual marriages the capacity to procreate does not determine the legal validity of such marriages. There are many married straight couples who cannot biologically have children or who choose not to. The procreation argument ignores the fact that people marry for a wide range of reasons unrelated to procreation including love, friendship and companionship.3. Religion: ""It's Against My Religion"" (FAIL)   Christianity-based arguments lead the way in efforts to oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage in America. References to the Bible, the ""sinful"" nature of homosexuality, and ""religious beliefs"" are regularly made by those who seek to rationalize their support of discrimination via religion. Marriage is a religious institution, they argue, and not one for society to tamper with. Given that the U.S.A. is a secular nation, religion should play no role in any discussion about civil and societal laws. In order to legally marry there is absolutely no requirement for a religious ceremony to be held. In this sense, marriage is not a religious institution but a socio-legal one governed by the state. Religious beliefs about marriage should never be enshrined in laws in ways that restrict the freedom of others who do not share those beliefs.4. Redefinition: ""You're Trying to Redefine the Institution"" (FAIL)Opponents argue that marriage has always been between a man and a woman and that it should stay that way. They say that efforts to legalize same-sex marriage will fundamentally alter the institution for the worse. History reveals, however, that marriage laws in the U.S.A. and in countries across the globe have been modified repeatedly in response to evolving cultural norms. There was a time when women were the legal property of their husbands. There was a time when a man and a woman of different races couldn't marry each other. There was even a time when not one country in the world had legalized same-sex marriage! Removing discrimination from the institution of marriage does not redefine ""marriage"" -- it simply makes the institution more accessible and reflects the evolution of society.5. Sanctity: ""It's a Threat to the Sanctity of (Opposite-Sex) Marriage"" (FAIL)With roots in religion, the sanctity argument posits that marriage is a ""sacred"" institution that only heterosexual couples should have access to. Allowing same-sex couples to marry apparently poses a ""threat"" to ""traditional marriage"" as though somehow heterosexual married couples will all be at risk of divorcing when two people of the same sex marry each other. If those who use the ""sanctity"" argument were genuinely concerned about the institution of marriage they'd focus their efforts on helping those straight married couples who are at risk of divorcing. If marriage was so ""sacred"" they'd also be pursuing the outlawing of heterosexual divorce. They do neither of these things. The only married straight couples impacted by the legalization of gay marriage are those in which one of the parties is a closet-case gay person who dreams of coming out and marrying someone of the same sex!6. Children: ""It Will Harm the Children"" (FAIL)Opponents of equality frequently make use of flawed research studies to insinuate that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow harm children. They argue that children need a ""mom and a dad"" in order to flourish in life and that legalizing same-sex marriage denies children this opportunity of ""normalcy."" Multiple studies across the social sciences have repeatedly demonstrated that there is no difference in psychosocial outcomes between children raised by opposite-sex couples and those raised by same-sex couples. There is no evidence that children are psychologically harmed by having two dads or two moms. The American Psychological Association (APA), the American Sociological Association (ASA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has each endorsed the legalization of same-sex marriage and its capacity to provide a stable familial framework for children. 7. Reverse Discrimination: ""Religious People Will Be Discriminated Against"" (FAIL)Some opponents of marriage equality describe a future in which religious people become the new ""victims"" of oppression. They talk of charity-based religious organizations being ""forced out of business"" for ""sticking to their beliefs"" about marriage. In this reverse scenario, gay people are apparently ""hateful"" for wanting to be treated equally in society. How dare we demand equal rights and criticize those who discriminate against us! In no state of the U.S.A. in which gay marriage is legal is a church legally required to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. Religious groups and churches are still free to pick and choose who they will and won't marry. Organizations that receive public money, however, and which must adhere to anti-discrimination laws, should rightly be challenged if they engage in discrimination against a protected class of people. 8. Slippery Slope: ""It Will Lead to Marriage Involving Animals, Siblings, Children, or Groups of People!"" (FAIL)Slippery slopes arguments suggest that legalizing gay marriage will serve as a ""gateway"" for the legalization of marriage involving animals, siblings, children, or groups of people. People who present these scenarios portray a catastrophic future with society crumbling under the weight of rampant immorality and social discord. Efforts to legalize same-sex marriage, however, simply aim to provide same-sex couples with equal access to marriage laws -- there is no intention to change the fundamental definition of marriage as the legal union between two adult human beings who have no direct biological connection with each other. Facts are useful in this regard: of the fifteen countries and 12 U.S. states that have legalized same-sex marriage, none of them has subsequently legalized marriage involving animals, children, siblings, or groups of people.9. Civil Unions: ""Civil Unions Are Good Enough"" (FAIL)Some opponents of same-sex marriage support the creation of a ""separate but equal"" platform in which straight couples and gay couples receive the same relationship rights and benefits, but from within different institutional frameworks. They argue that ""marriage"" should be left exclusively for opposite-sex couples and that same-sex couples should be granted ""civil unions."" History has demonstrated that this ""separate but equal"" approach doesn't work. Various countries and American states which initially permitted ""civil unions"" for same-sex couples have subsequently enacted marriage equality legislation. These jurisdictions have pursued such changes because civil union legislation, no matter how valiant the effort, is not able to provide the same rights and benefits as legal marriage. In essence, having a two-class system continues to maintain the erroneous notion that one group (straight people) is more superior to another group (LGBT people). 10. States' Rights: ""States Have the Right to Oppose It"" (FAIL) This position stresses that states have a constitutional right to make their own decisions about the legalization of same-sex marriage which may include banning it. Ironically, most advocates of this argument also support the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law which allows the federal government to deny more than one thousand federal rights and benefits to same-sex couples legally married at the state level. The maintenance of a system which allows some states to recognize same-sex marriage and others not to, and which allows the federal government to ignore legal same-sex marriages performed at the state level, sets up a cumbersome and extremely complicated national map of unequal rights and legal nightmares. Those who support a ""states' rights"" approach to same-sex marriage should at least be consistent and drop their support of a federal government act (DOMA) which essentially tramples states' rights.Conclusion: Marriage Equality is the Future -- Embrace it! There is no logical or reasonable basis for denying same-sex couples access to secular marriage laws. Opposing the inevitable (marriage equality) is a waste of time, money and energy. I urge all of those who oppose gay marriage to start focusing on their own lives, to accept that they don't need to marry a person of the same sex, and to recognize the right of all Americans to be treated equally under the law: ""liberty and justice for all"" should not come with a disclaimer.(A longer version of the above article is available at the GMUSA blog.

I mean, what would prohibit you from saying that you’re gay, and y’all get married and still live as separate, but you get all the benefits? I just see so much abuse in this it’s unreal. I believe a husband and a wife should be a man and a woman, the benefits should be for a man and a woman. There is no way that this is about equality. To me, it’s all about a free ride.”It's theoretically possible that such a scenario could happen, but there isn't any evidence of widespread fraud following the adoption of gay marriage in nine states and the District of Columbia. Though fictional, the premise of the 2007 Adam Sandler movie ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" was a pair of straight firefighters getting domestic partnership status. Everhart does not note the possibility of marriage fraud among opposite-sex couples, though others have warned against marriage fraud committed in order to get immigration benefits. In reality, the number of proven cases of such fraud is extremely small.Everhart also said she could not understand how two gay people could ever have sex. ""If it was natural, they would have the equipment to have a sexual relationship,"" she told the Journal.(h/t TPM) "

However, that has not stopped conservatives from pledging to defy marriage equality, if the high court makes a pro-LGBT decision.In a letter released Thursday, more than 200 conservative activists -- ranging from the Catholic League’s Bill Donohue to Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kern (R) -- vowed to ignore any ruling in favor of same-sex couples. The group of endorsers, signing under the moniker of Freedom Federation, is composed of anti-LGBT Christian conservatives, many of whom have fallen from prominence in recent years.""We stand together as Christians in defense of marriage and the family and society founded upon them,"" the letter reads. Liberty Counsel head Mat Staver and Deacon Keith Fournier, the editor-in-chief of Catholic Online, drafted the ""Marriage Solidarity Statement"" that attacks marriage equality by invoking ""Natural Moral Law"" and questioning the authority of the Supreme Court.""This Natural Moral Law gives us the norms we need to build truly human and humane societies and govern ourselves. It should also inform our positive law or we will become lawless and devolve into anarchy,"" the statement warns. ""Redefining the very institution of marriage is improper and outside the authority of the State. The Supreme Court has no authority to redefine marriage.""While the letter ends with a vague threat that the signers must draw a line on the definition of marriage and will not cross it, the statement does not specify what the Freedom Federation intends to do if the Supreme Court rules in favor of marriage equality.Raw Story makes a good point, writing: ""What, exactly, they intend to do is unclear, since their churches presumably do not perform same sex unions, and because they themselves do not work in the wedding business or grant marriage licenses.""The Supreme Court is expected to release its decision on the two marriage equality cases, Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor, sometime next week. The former questions whether California's Proposition 8 violated the constitution, while the later challenges the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage.Though an online HuffPost/YouGov survey conducted earlier this month indicated that Americans are sharply divided on whether the court should overturn DOMA, another poll released by Pew Research revealed that 72 percent of Americans say the recognition of same-sex marriage is ""inevitable.""Click over to Liberty Counsel to read the full letter."

Two Democrats were absent for the vote.Governor Neil Abercrombie has indicated he would swiftly sign the measure into law, making Hawaii the 15th or 16th U.S. state to extend marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples, depending on when the governor of Illinois signs that state's bill.As currently drafted, the Hawaii bill would take effect on Dec. 2.""This is about a move toward acceptance, tolerance and compassion,"" Representative Sylvia Luke, chairwoman of the House Finance Committee, said as the House floor debate began hours before the vote.The vote in Hawaii comes at a time of increasing momentum for gay marriage in the courts, at the ballot box and statehouses across the country.Hawaii's Supreme Court ruled two decades ago that banning same-sex marriage was discriminatory, helping to advance gay rights nationwide but also sparking a backlash that kept the legislature passing a bill on the issue.With public opinion shifting, Abercrombie, a first-term Democrat, called the state legislature into special session late last month to consider a bill that rolls back a 1994 statute defining marriage as between a man and a woman only.The Senate overwhelmingly approved the measure last Wednesday, with a 20-4 vote. Three Democrats joined the state's only Republican senator in voting against the bill.Because the measure was amended in the House, it must return to the Senate for final adoption. The Senate is precluded by legislative rules from acting before next Tuesday, aides say.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Clayton Hee was quoted in the Honolulu Star Advertiser as saying he expected the Senate would accept the House version quickly. GAY RIGHTS VS. RELIGIOUS FREEDOMAbercrombie, who served more than two decades in the U.S. House of Representatives before running for governor in 2010, signed a same-sex civil unions bill into law two years ago. His predecessor, Republican Linda Lingle, vetoed a civil unions bill in 2010.The governor has said the proposal was crafted to address opponents' concerns that legalizing gay marriage would infringe on religious freedoms. The proposal exempts clergy and churches from having to perform same-sex marriages.Only six states and the District of Columbia recognized same-sex marriage a year ago, but the number has since more than doubled, due in most cases to litigation over the issue.Three states - Maine, Maryland and Washington - became the first to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples by popular vote with passage of ballot initiatives last November.Last month, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie dropped his legal opposition to gay marriage, making his state the 14th to legalize same-sex weddings.Illinois, whose legislature gave final approval to a same-sex marriage bill on Tuesday, would become the 15th state, unless Abercrombie manages to beat Illinois Governor Pat Quinn to the punch.

But all the encouraging steps toward a more accepting America may not mean much when you're called ""faggot"", and slammed into a locker.Polling shows that America has never been on better terms with sexual diversity -- from equal economic rights to gay marriage to the belief that gay issues will one day be non-issues. In younger demographics, we're already there. A recent Gallup-USA Today poll showed that among those 18 to 29, 73 percent are fine with same-sex marriage.The same poll showed that people who identify as gay, lesbian or transgender, are more optimistic than ever. Three out of four said they were generally out with others, and nine in ten said their communities have become more accepting.The media's LGBT portrayal has gone from invisible to mainstream. Gay couple Cam and Mitchell are the affectionately hilarious heart of TV's Modern Family. Neil Patrick Harris is an openly gay man, who plays a ladies' man, for an audience that doesn't care. How I Met Your Mother was just renewed for a ninth season. The last election deepened the twilight of the day when gay marriage (or gay anything) could bring out the conservative electorate. On gay issues, the religious right finds itself a drum line in search of a lost parade.But does tolerance trickle down? What does statistical and prime-time acceptance mean in the unforgiving halls of an average junior high?Journalist and activist Dan Savage -- whose It Gets Better LGBT suicide prevention project has literally saved lives -- calls these days of dawning sexual enlightenment ""the best of times and the worst of times."" For those with accepting families, progressive communities, and determined school support, LGBT life -- indeed -- has never been better. For others, it can actually be tougher than the days of closeted anonymity. Seeing validation and acceptance in the media, while experiencing rejection and bullying in life can be especially isolating. If the world is OK with being gay; why isn't it OK with me?Both straight and gay students say being called ""gay"" is the single worst form of harassment. Gay students hear anti-gay slurs as often as 26 times a day. LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say they don't feel safe at school. Some 90 percent of them report being harassed or assaulted in the past year. School days can be harrowing for anyone who is different: too short, too heavy, too skinny, too shy, too anything that puts them in the sights of the predators inevitably drawn to the social stragglers. Multiply that by the pain experienced by a child whose difference - real or perceived -- crosses into the perilous territory of sexual identity, and different can take on life-altering dimensions.There is a clear connection between childhood bullying and self-esteem. The consequences are measured in depression, self-loathing (maybe they're right about me), anger, hopelessness and -- tragically -- suicide. Although factors other than sexuality are certainly involved, LGBT students are four times more likely than hetero students to take their own lives. True, the worst of the harassment tends to be a point in time. A seven year study of U.K. teens, by educational psychology professor Joseph Robinson, University of Illinois, Urbana- Champagne, published in the current issue of Pediatrics, reports that LGBT bullying goes down with age. More than 50 percent of gay and bisexual boys were bullied at ages 13-14, versus only 6 percent at ages 18-20. That implies that bullies grow out of it, or that older youth can simply avoid them. Probably both.The vulnerable years may be few. But in those years: What cues are delivered? What life lessons are taught? What beliefs are shaped about personal value and place in the world?Yes, things are getting better. But the emotional wilds of an average middle, junior and even high school are never going to be as welcoming as polls and sitcom plot lines would have us believe. It's a mistake to confuse progress with solution. Bullying is real, it leaves scars, and we still have a long way to go.Just ask a ""faggot"" -- as he picks his books up off the floor."

John Francis, 65, adopted his 73-year-old gay partner, Gregory, as a means of financial security, ABC News reported. The move came about because the two, who have been together for 45 years, began to worry about what might happen if one of them died. Even though the Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which had defined marriage as between a man and a woman, couples in Pennsylvania and more than 30 other states where same-sex marriage is still not legal face an uphill battle for equal benefits. ""It's humorous to me,"" he told ABC News. ""Gregory was a high school and college jock. Today, I am making dough for blueberry crostata and he is golfing. You're going to think of him as the dad, rather than me. … But it provided us with some level of comfort that we have protected each other as much as we can.""Visit the CentralVoice to read more about John and Greg's story.Pennsylvania's inheritance tax law states there is a zero percent tax on transfers to a surviving legal spouse. There is a 4.5 percent tax on transfers to direct descendants and lineal heirs, but a 15 percent tax on transfers to other heirs. Since Pennsylvania does not legally recognize same-sex couples, John and Greg previously fell under the 15 percent bracket; however, by adopting Greg, John has moved them into the 4.5 percent bracket. “We wanted to protect ourselves from higher inheritance taxes that heterosexual couples do no[t] incur upon the death of one or other spouse,” Francis explained to local LGBT blog CentralVoice. Since the Supreme Court's landmark DOMA ruling, focus has shifted onto equal rights in states like Pennsylvania. State Rep. Brian Sims (D-Philadelphia), the first openly gay person elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, plans to introduce a marriage equality bill in his state in the hopes of getting ""marriage"" redefined as a ""civil contract between two people who enter into matrimony,"" Philadelphia Weekly reported. However, Sims faces staunch opposition. When he took to the House floor Thursday to discuss the DOMA decision, he was silenced by his conservative peers. Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R-Butler) later told local radio station WHYY that Sims was barred from making comments that would have been ""an open rebellion against God's law."" Others think there is a good chance Pennsylvania will rise to equal rights sooner rather than later. “I think it’s going to be odd for people to be recognized in some states but not in others,"" Christine Bryan of LGBT advocacy group Delta Foundation told CBS station KDKA, ""so I think in some respect the state’s hand is going to be forced.""

The action threw the communion into disarray.At the Jerusalem meeting, the primates called for the creation of an Anglican province in North America to rival the Episcopal Church. Five years later, the primates say the new Anglican province, known as the Anglican Church in North America, is thriving.Now, the archbishop of Nigeria and archbishops in East Africa have organized the second Global Anglican Future Conference at which they hope to accelerate the process that began in Jerusalem. The so-called GAFCON II meeting will take place Oct. 21-26 in Nairobi.“We have succeeded in consolidation,” said Ugandan Anglican Archbishop Stanley Ntagali.“Anglican churches have been planted in North America. The clergy trust one another to preach according to the Bible,” he said. “But the crisis in the communion continues to deepen as more (homosexual) consecrations occur.”In addition to the consecration of gay bishops, the African primates are concerned with the growing acceptance of same-sex unions in the West. They say attempts to discipline the Episcopal Church were not successful, and, as a result, a “spiritual cancer” has spread to other provinces, including the Anglican Church of Canada, the Church of England, the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church in Wales, and the Anglican Church of Southern Africa.In their words, GAFCON II seeks to restore good order, theological integrity and biblical faithfulness.“We need to see the overthrow by some churches of the creation order of female and male as just one symptom of the disease,” wrote Kenyan Anglican Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, chairman of the GAFCON primates’ council in a letter to the conference dated Thursday (Aug. 22). “The cause is spiritual.”The primates remain optimistic that Archbishop Justin Welby, the new global leader of the Anglican Communion, may prevent a split since he is on record as being opposed to gay consecrations.“The primates are happy with Welby since he has been attending our meetings,” said Ntagali. “He has taken time to follow what we are doing and he understands we are not breaking the communion.”YS/AMB END NZWILI

Of those, at least 74 percent, or 905 licenses, were issued to gay and lesbian couples.Marriage licenses in Utah cost between $30 and $50, depending on the county.With an average marriage license costing $40, counties in Utah made a grand total of more than $49,000 in the three-and-a-half days most county clerk’s offices were open this week.About three-quarters of that money came from gay and lesbian couples seeking marriage licenses in the immediate aftermath of U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling that overturned a statewide ban on same-sex marriages.Salt Lake County shattered a previously held record of 85 marriages in a given day, by handing out 353 on Monday (Dec. 23) — the first full day of issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.On the other hand, Piute, a small county of about 1,500 people in the center of the state, was of several counties with no takers. Had any Piute couples requested a license, they would have been denied anyway.County Clerk Valeen Brown is on vacation until Monday (Dec. 30), officials said. So, Piute officials suspended all marriage license activity until Brown returns.Utah County — which made national news this week when Shelly Eyre and her partner Cheryl Haws declared that they would sue its clerk for denying gay and lesbian couples — was doling out certificates Thursday to all.“Moving forward, we probably won’t keep track of how many same-sex couples versus opposite-sex couples we issue licenses to,” said Bryan Thompson, the county’s clerk and auditor. “I don’t see any reason to differentiate between them.”(Marissa Lang writes for The Salt Lake Tribune.)

Mefferd posted a link to a Fox News piece referencing Gross Pointe South High School's cancellation of a planned speech by Rick Santorum. It remains unclear why exactly the speech was canceled, though some speculate it was because of the politician's stance against gay marriage. (The appearance has since been rescheduled.)On Facebook, Mefferd wrote that she could see America moving ""toward a day when every Christian who supports real marriage might be made to wear a yellow patch on the sleeve, a ""badge of shame"" to identify us as 'anti-gay haters.' Kind of like the Jews in Nazi Germany.""While the post had several supportive comments, it also drew criticism, prompting a response from Mefferd several hours later:How much tolerance is there for Christians who are constantly being marginalized for standing for biblical marriage when they're constantly being called ""extremists"" and ""haters"" ... when even an Army officer is sending emails that call the AFA and the FRC ""domestic hate groups"" ... when the SPLC's hate map led a homosexual activist to shoot a man at the FRC, leading to his being chharged with domestic terrorism ... ? We're not the haters. We're the HATED.""We're deleting all the nasty comments that gay activists are making,"" Mefferd added.Right Wing Watch's Brian Tashman notes that ""the comparison of anti-gay activists to the Jews who suffered and died under the genocidal Nazi regime is deeply offensive and absurd on its face,"" adding that Nazis singled out homosexuals for brutal persecution as well. Although not in these same terms, conservatives and same-sex marriage opponents have been issuing dire warnings of coming persecution.In March, Fox News commentator Todd Starnes said social conservatives were being treated like ""second-class citizens.""""There seems to be this opinion on the other side that says, you know what, you and I don’t deserve the same rights,"" Starnes told Sandy Rios on American Family Radio.And five years ago, before years before President Barack Obama publicly endorsed gay marriage, conservative columnist Chuck Colson wrote that ""If same-sex “marriage” becomes the law of the land, we can expect massive persecution of the Church."""

Gendreau gave an exclusive interview to OutSports' Cyd Zeigler about life as an openly gay college athlete and his NFL prospects, revealing that when he came out to his MT team in freshman year, they fully embraced him. ""Everyone just saw him as a football player,"" MT holder and team punter Josh Davis told OutSports. ""He was just one of the guys. The fact that he proved himself on the field, there was a respect for him.""The 5-foot, 10-inch kicker, who graduated from MT last year, knows the NFL is a long-shot for him this year. Gendreau is currently a free agent, and only the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers are likely to draft a kicker this year. Still, it isn't impossible. ""It's totally legit that he can get into the league,"" Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, who is also a gay rights advocate, told OutSports. ""Place-kicking is all about doing this one specific skill set. And if you can do that, you can make it whether you’ve been out of football for one year or 10 years.""Visit OutSports to read Alan Gendreau's interview. If he does make it into the NFL, Gendreau would not only be the first gay professional football player, but he would also be the first professional player to enter the league openly gay. Gay players in sports have been especially controversial lately. Former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo revealed earlier this month that as many as four current football players are in talks to come out in the near future. Following this statement, the NFL met with gay rights groups to discuss enacting policies to end homophobia and combat discrimination. The NFL would likely embrace a player like Gendreau, and why not? The first openly gay, male athlete will likely rake in millions in endorsement deals and garner major attention for the team. ""We have seen time and time again that diversity is a benefit,"" Hudson Taylor, founder and executive director of pro-tolerance nonprofit Athlete Ally, previously told The Huffington Post. ""It's a benefit in corporate America; it's a benefit in schools; and it's a benefit in sports. An athletic culture that welcomes and includes LGBT athletes will ultimately draw improved talent and create more unified and respectful team cultures.""""These ideas are resonating for the sports community at all levels, from the leagues to the players to the corporate sponsors. And perhaps most importantly, they are resonating for fans,"" he continued. ""Though a player's decision to come out is intensely personal and something about which only he or she knows best, it is a promising time as the sports community welcomes those decisions and the corporate community incentivizes them."""

Gingrich spoke about the issue of same-sex marriage during an interview with The Huffington Post in December. Although he defended his belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, the former House Speaker said the GOP needs to progress with the times. ""It is in every family. It is in every community,"" he told HuffPost. ""The momentum is clearly now in the direction in finding some way to ... accommodate and deal with reality. And the reality is going to be that in a number of American states -- and it will be more after 2014 -- gay relationships will be legal, period.""On Thursday, Right Wing Watch posted a video response to Gingrich's same-sex marriage comments made by Navy chaplain Gordon Klingenschmitt, according to Raw Story. In the video, the chaplain says Gingrich is wholly misguided in pandering to the left and ""homosexual sin."" The chaplain cites a Bible passage from Romans, Chapter 1, which reads ""the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another ... that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.”“It’s not like Newt is personally engaging in homosexual activity, but the Bible condemns him now because he takes pleasure in those that do that sort of thing,” Klingenschmitt explained. “When the Bible condemns his endorsement of homosexual sin then he has become one of the sinners condemned by Romans, Chapter 1.”Klingenschmitt continued to say Gingrich is tempted by ""demonic voices"" that tell him ""Okay, it's not really a sin. We ought to endorse this"" simply to get more votes in a possible 2016 presidential run. The chaplain, who belongs to an evangelical sect of the Episcopal Church and was disgraced in 2006 for disobeying an order, is not the only one to speak out against Gingrich's evolved view on same-sex marriage. Frank Schubert, National Political Director for the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), called the politician's comments both ""stupid"" and ""ridiculous."" Gingrich was previously vocal against same-sex marriage. He went so far as to compare it to paganism, saying, ""The effort to create alternatives to marriage between a man and a woman are perfectly natural pagan behaviors, but they are a fundamental violation of our civilization."" While running for the GOP presidential nomination, he also vowed to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act. Watch Gordon Klingenschmitt's video below. He discusses Newt Gingrich around the 5-minute mark. UPDATE: Gordon Klingenschmitt wrote HuffPost to clarify that he never said he believes Newt Gingrich to be worthy of death. According to the video, however, he did state that the Bible holds ""homosexual acts are worthy of death"" and that the Bible also equally condemns those who ""take pleasure in those who do that sort of thing.""

The gay Republican was referring to GOProud’s exclusion from participation at CPAC for a second year in a row, banned as an official sponsor. LaSalvia attended CPAC as a guest of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a sponsor of CPAC which hosted a panel Thursday on which LaSalvia appeared, “A Rainbow on the Right: Growing the Coalition, Bringing Tolerance Out of the Closet.”At the packed panel, attended by younger CPAC members, including quite a few conservative gays and lesbians, conservative commentators and activists on the panel who support marriage equality, including CNN pundit Margaret Hoover and Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, made the case for gay marriage as a conservative value. Earlier in the day Senator Marco Rubio, criticized those who would call him a “bigot” for not supporting same-sex marriage, underscoring the tension the issue continues to cause among conservatives. LaSalvia, for his part, however, agreed with Rubio, making a similar statement during the panel discussion and getting applause from the audience. (Scroll down to listen to the full interview) “It’s truly about what people think conservatives think of gay people,” LaSalvia said in an interview on my SiriusXM radio program. “Kicking us out of CPAC doesn’t help. People aren’t going to vote for you if they think you hate their family and friends.”“How do we have a winning coalition in the future, in a world that has gay people in every single family,” LaSalvia continued, a day before GOP Senator Rob Portman reversed his position and came out for marriage equality because his son had come out as gay. “It’s broader than marriage equality. It's about, 'Do you support my loved ones?' I think that a lot of the establishment leaders are out of touch with America and with their own base. There are a few folks in the establishment that don’t like gay people.”Asked why GOProud endorsed candidates like Mitt Romney, who supported an constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, said that was old news.“Mitt Romney is as relevant as Mike Dukakis is now,” he said. “So let’s not talk about the past. I know that it’s embarrassing to call yourself a Republican right now. I’m embarrassed to call myself a Republican right now.

There's nothing we can do in public policy that makes more of us exist, or less of us exist. And you guys have been arguing for a generation that public policy ought to essentially demean gay people as a way of expressing disapproval of the fact that we exist, but you don't make any less of us exist.

12340	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/26/proposition-8_n_2952595.html	News	0	Gay Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	By MARK SHERMAN, THE ASSOCIATED PRESSWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is wading into the fight over same-sex marriage at a time when public opinion is shifting rapidly in favor of permitting gay and lesbian couples to wed, but 40 states don't allow it.The court's first major examination of gay rights in 10 years begins Tuesday with a hearing on California's ban on same-sex marriage. On Wednesday, the justices will consider the federal law that prevents legally married gay couples from receiving a range of benefits afforded straight married Americans.People have been waiting in line – even through light snow – since Thursday for coveted seats for the argument over California's Proposition 8.The two California couples challenging the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage in the nation's largest state are in Washington for the argument and are urging the justices to strike down not just the California provision, but constitutional amendments and statutes in every state that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.They envision the 21st century equivalent of the court's 1967 decision in Loving v. Virginia that struck down state bans on interracial marriages.The Obama administration has weighed in on behalf of the challengers, following President Barack Obama's declaration of support for same-sex marriage last year and his invocation of gay rights at his inauguration in January.Supporters of Proposition 8 say the court should respect the verdict of California voters who approved the ban in 2008 and let the fast-changing politics of gay marriage evolve on their own, through ballot measures and legislative action, not judicial decrees.Same-sex marriage is legal in nine states and the District of Columbia. The states are Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont and Washington.Thirty states ban same-sex marriage in their state constitutions, while ten states bar them under state laws. New Mexico law is silent on the issue.Polls have shown increasing support in the country for gay marriage. According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in mid-March, 49 percent of Americans now favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, with 44 percent opposed.The California case is being argued 10 years to the day after the court took up a challenge to Texas' anti-sodomy statute. That case ended with a forceful ruling prohibiting states from criminalizing sexual relations between consenting adults.Justice Anthony Kennedy was the author of the decision in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and he is being closely watched for how he might vote on the California ban. He cautioned in the Lawrence case that it had nothing to do with gay marriage, but dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia predicted the decision would lead to the invalidation of state laws against same-sex marriage.Kennedy's decision is widely cited in the briefs in support of same-sex unions.The court has several options for its eventual ruling, which is not expected before late June. In addition to upholding the ban and invalidating prohibitions everywhere, the justices could endorse an appeals court ruling that would make same-sex marriage legal in California but apply only to that state. They also could issue a broader ruling that would apply to California and eight other states: Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island. In those states, gay couples may join in civil unions or become domestic partners and have all the benefits of marriage but cannot be married.One other possibility is a ruling that says nothing about marriage. California's top elected officials, Gov. Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris, are refusing to defend Proposition 8, and there is a question about whether the Proposition 8 supporters have the right, or legal standing, to defend the measure in court. If the justices decide they do not, the case would end without a high court ruling about marriage, although legal experts widely believe same-sex marriages would quickly resume in California.The California couples, Kris Perry and Sandy Stier of Berkeley and Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, filed their federal lawsuit in May 2009 to overturn the same-sex marriage ban that voters approved the previous November. The ballot measure halted same-sex unions in California, which began in June 2008 after a ruling from the California Supreme Court.Roughly 18,000 couples were wed in the nearly five months that same-sex marriage was legal and those marriages remain valid in California.The high-profile case has brought together onetime Supreme Court opponents. Republican Theodore Olson and Democrat David Boies are leading the legal team representing the same-sex couples. They argued against each other in the Bush v. Gore case that settled the disputed 2000 presidential election in favor of George W. Bush.Opposing them is Charles Cooper, Olson's onetime colleague at the Justice Department in the Reagan administration.The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry, 12-144.

Rick Perry (R) stood before conservatives gathered at a Faith and Family Rally in Austin on Tuesday and spoke about what he perceives as a sustained attack on their values by gay rights activists.“This is a very unsettling time in our nation’s history,” Perry said, according to the Associated Press. “These are the days when a person is vilified when they state that they believe fundamentally that marriage is between one man and one woman.”Perry spoke just hours after the Supreme Court heard arguments on Proposition 8, California's gay marriage ban. On Wednesday, the justices will consider a case challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act.Perry went on to suggest that the decision by LGBT rights advocates to fight for equal treatment was proof that they were themselves intolerant.“The underlying problem is that there is this very vocal, very litigious minority of Americans willing to legally attack anybody who dares utter a phrase or even a name that they don’t agree with,” he said. “In a twisting of logic, they insist on silencing the religious in the cause of tolerance. Now I ask you, where is the tolerance in that?”The Austin American-Statesman reports that a heckler in the back of the crowd disagreed with Perry's remarks, yelling that the governor was finished politically.Perry has been a consistent opponent of gay rights throughout his tenure as governor. He's supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and helped usher through a 2005 state ballot amendment that officially defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman. During his 2012 GOP presidential campaign, Perry put his fight against gay rights front and center with a campaign ad that quickly became one of the most disliked videos on YouTube.On Tuesday, Perry told reporters that Texas was ""fairly clear about where"" it stands on gay marriage.""The people of the state of Texas, myself included, believe marriage is between one man and one woman,” Perry said, according to the Dallas Morning News."

A majority of the group of 30 or so sign-holders were in their 50s and much older -- and they called themselves Catholics. Linda Karle-Nelson, 72, and her husband Tom Nelson, 83, organized Thursday's event in response to recent remarks made by Detroit Archbishop Allen H. Vigneron asserting that those who support gay marriage and take Communion are contradicting themselves. ""This sort of behavior would result in publicly renouncing one's integrity and logically bring shame for a double-dealing that is not unlike perjury,"" Vigneron said last month. The archbishop thinks gay marriage supporters should, instead, abstain from receiving the sacrament of the Eucharist.But Nelson and his wife couldn't reconcile Vigneron's statements with their own understanding of their faith, nor with their experience as parents of gay children. ""The trauma that exists in families today over this issue is virtually unrecognized, except by folks like us,"" Nelson said. ""When we hear rhetoric from the church that demeans our children, we just can't be silent.""The Archdiocese of Detroit declined to comment on the protest earlier on Thursday.Nelson and Karle-Nelson are members of the national organization Fortunate Families, a group that represents Catholics with LGBT children and sponsored Thursday's event. They were both widowed and had fully grown children from those previous marriages before they wed six years ago. Nelson recalled ""pontificating religious doctrine"" in his household when his kids were younger. His view of the church changed when he learned that his gay son attempted suicide while he was in college. ""That was the beginning of my journey and completely changed my attitude,"" Nelson said. ""His struggles, what he was going through -- he was so closeted, he kept it so veiled. I had no clue.""""The greatest blessing of my life was having a gay son, because of what it's taught me,"" he added.Nelson's son continued to worship as a practicing Catholic after coming out, until the LGBTQ Catholic group he practiced with was asked to leave the church they attended. He, and four of his five siblings, have since left the church. Karle-Nelson's son, who is also gay, had a different experience. He left the church shortly after he left home to attend college. But several years ago, he returned to services when he found a Jesuit parish that was welcoming and diverse.""It shows you that where there is acceptance and a welcoming [environment], people flower,"" Karle-Nelson said.Mary Ellen Lopata, who is the co-founder and on the board of directors of Fortunate Families, said it's a ""sad situation"" that many children have left the Catholic church over its lack of acceptance of gays and lesbians.""We encourage people to speak up, because the bishops don't know our children and they need to hear our children, and understand that our children are every bit as whole and holy,"" Lopata said.Fortunate Families is part of Equally Blessed, a coalition of groups that support full equality in the church and society for LGBT people. The organization does not have local chapters, instead representing constituents from its base in Rochester, N.Y., and supporting actions like the Nelsons' and drawing attention to injustices within the church. ""We're starting to see tiny glimmers of hope that pastors and members of the hierarchy might be willing to talk,"" Lopata said. ""We do believe that if they would just talk to us and talk to children and listen to what they would have to say, their hearts would be changed.""Nelson and Karle-Nelson attend St. Alexanders Parish in Farmington Hills, a suburb of Detroit. ""I think ... many of the clergy [there] are sympathetic to our cause,"" Nelson said. ""But because of the leadership and the Archdiocese, they have to fly under the radar and be careful how they respond to issues like this.""""There have been many instances in the history of the church where they have made statements [that they withdrew],"" Nelson said, rattling off a list that included child labor laws, women's suffrage and democracy. ""It took them 400 years to apologize to Galileo,"" he noted.""But guess what? They changed,"" he said. ""They will change on this too, but it will take a long time."""

The real issue at hand is not freedom of speech or same-sex marriage but Chick-fil-A's secretive funding of documented anti-gay hate groups. The national organization Campus Pride made this clear last week in releasing ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A."" Campus Pride specifically called upon our nation's student leaders to share the truth about Chick-fil-A and its funding of radical-right-wing organizations and documented hate groups.Through its family-controlled nonprofit arm, Chick-fil-A profits have funded such groups as Eagle Forum, Exodus International, Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family. These groups proudly and aggressively work against the rights of LGBT people, advocating their criminalization, psychological abuse, and death. Chick-fil-A has not disputed any of these facts. The ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A"" are well documented, showing the funneling of Chick-fil-A profits to anti-gay causes and even a hate group, as determined by the Southern Poverty Law Center. While Chick-fil-A's leadership has every right to its views, beliefs, and voice, students and administrators alike need to know that revenues going to Chick-fil-A drive funding for groups that are almost certainly in conflict with campus nondiscrimination policies. There is no justification for Chick-fil-A to be on a college campus where there is a responsibility by administrators for a safe learning environment for all students. The actions by Chick-fil-A in taking profits to fund hate groups that harm a population on campus impedes safety and creating a learning environment for academic success.Thanks to the president of Chick-fil-A, Dan Cathy, the cow façade has been lifted to show what is really behind the billboards and spicy chicken sandwiches. Good people, Christian or not, don't use their corporate profits to fund hate groups or causes that work to defame, criminalize, and execute people. Colleges and universities have a real problem on their hands in the next few weeks as students come back to campus. You can't just tell students who disagree to not eat the chicken sandwich; that message is irresponsible and harmful to LGBT students. Colleges have to take responsibility for the facts and realize that student-meal-plan money is going to fund a documented hate group that works to aggressively harm students on their campus. This will certainly affect the safety and campus climate of all students.Read the ""5 Simple Facts About Chick-fil-A."" Campus Pride calls on student leaders and campus newspapers to share that:Chick-fil-A profits fund documented hate groups that aggressively work against LGBT people, advocating for their criminalization, psychological abuse, or death.Chick-fil-A profits support the radical-right-wing group Eagle Forum, which supports LGBT people being considered criminals.Chick-fil-A profits support Exodus International, which claims to ""cure homosexuality"" through psychological coercion of LGBT people. It says LGBT people are ""perverse.""Chick-fil-A profits support Focus on the Family (FOF) and its off-shoot group, the Family Research Council (FRC), which has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. FOF aggressively defames LGBT people as a threat to children, and FRC spent $25,000 to stop the U.S. Congress from condemning Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill, which calls for the execution of gay people in some cases.Chick-fil-A profits come from you.

However, when Seelig called Best Vacations Ever to reserve the dates of their trip after the company had already accepted their credit card information and sent them welcome materials, they were allegedly met with the following interaction. Seelig told The Huffington Post in an email:They were most helpful and eager to make the arrangements... until [Dan] said the second person was named Tim. They asked if that was a male?... [The representative] said, 'Please hold a moment.' After five minutes or so, she came back on the line and said, 'I'm so sorry, we don't allow same-sex couples to use the Vegas vacation offer. We can book you in Orlando or New Orleans, but not Vegas.' We spent the entire day in shock.... Seelig and England spent the remainder of the day attempting to contact different representatives of the company. One manager Seelig spoke to allegedly told the chorus director to mail a letter to a P.O. Box in Florida if the couple had an issue with the policy. Following a formal complaint by Seelig and press coverage of the incident, Best Vacations Ever reached out to the couple and informed them that their customer care agent had made a mistake by telling Dan he couldn't travel to Las Vegas ""due to his sexual preference.""The representative also allegedly offered to send the couples on their Las Vegas ""best vacation ever"" and reimburse them fully for the cost of the trip. Seelig and England told The Huffington Post that they would not be accepting the offer. ""Our initial reaction was definitely, 'Oh no, you did not just say that!'"" stated Seelig. ""The two of us had different reactions. For Dan, this kind of blatant discrimination is somewhat new -- he came out in California and has not really experienced such things. For me, it brought up many experiences I had having come out in Houston, Texas... this was not new, but, interestingly enough, no less painful really. My reaction was to fight.""When The Huffington Post reached out to Best Vacations Ever, Michelle Morse, a representative of the company, responded with the following statement and a similar statement was posted on the company's Facebook. (The statement in full can be read at the end of the article.)""This promotional offer for a hotel stay was subsidized by a third party resort in Las Vegas.

Any accusations to the contrary are inaccurate.In this specific case, when the guest called to make the reservation there was confusion as to whether they could show proof of residency (living together), however, there was no intentional disqualification based on the sexual orientation or marital status of the couple.Seelig and England, however, aren't buying it. They claim that six different representatives of the company told them the same information regarding the company's policy about same-sex couples and denied them a booking in Las Vegas.""I have been conducting LGBT choruses for 25 years,"" Seelig told The Huffington Post. ""People often ask, is there really a reason or relevance to such organizations in today's 'We love the gays world?' Yes there is. This is proof.

The devout Christian, Florida native was a superstar kicker for the Middle Tennessee State's Blue Raiders; he is also openly gay. As an athlete at a Southern college, Gendreau was not only a successul team member, but he also felt accepted by his teammates. Now, he has his sights set on the National Football League (NFL). Gendreau gave an exclusive interview to OutSports' Cyd Zeigler about life as an openly gay college athlete and his NFL prospects, revealing that when he came out to his MT team in freshman year, they fully embraced him. ""Everyone just saw him as a football player,"" MT holder and team punter Josh Davis told OutSports. ""He was just one of the guys. The fact that he proved himself on the field, there was a respect for him.""The 5-foot, 10-inch kicker, who graduated from MT last year, knows the NFL is a long-shot for him this year. Gendreau is currently a free agent, and only the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers are likely to draft a kicker this year. Still, it isn't impossible. ""It's totally legit that he can get into the league,"" Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, who is also a gay rights advocate, told OutSports. ""Place-kicking is all about doing this one specific skill set. And if you can do that, you can make it whether you’ve been out of football for one year or 10 years.""Visit OutSports to read Alan Gendreau's interview. If he does make it into the NFL, Gendreau would not only be the first gay professional football player, but he would also be the first professional player to enter the league openly gay. Gay players in sports have been especially controversial lately. Former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo revealed earlier this month that as many as four current football players are in talks to come out in the near future. Following this statement, the NFL met with gay rights groups to discuss enacting policies to end homophobia and combat discrimination. The NFL would likely embrace a player like Gendreau, and why not? The first openly gay, male athlete will likely rake in millions in endorsement deals and garner major attention for the team. ""We have seen time and time again that diversity is a benefit,"" Hudson Taylor, founder and executive director of pro-tolerance nonprofit Athlete Ally, previously told The Huffington Post. ""It's a benefit in corporate America; it's a benefit in schools; and it's a benefit in sports. An athletic culture that welcomes and includes LGBT athletes will ultimately draw improved talent and create more unified and respectful team cultures.""""These ideas are resonating for the sports community at all levels, from the leagues to the players to the corporate sponsors. And perhaps most importantly, they are resonating for fans,"" he continued. ""Though a player's decision to come out is intensely personal and something about which only he or she knows best, it is a promising time as the sports community welcomes those decisions and the corporate community incentivizes them."""

But all the encouraging steps toward a more accepting America may not mean much when you're called ""faggot"", and slammed into a locker.Polling shows that America has never been on better terms with sexual diversity -- from equal economic rights to gay marriage to the belief that gay issues will one day be non-issues. In younger demographics, we're already there. A recent Gallup-USA Today poll showed that among those 18 to 29, 73 percent are fine with same-sex marriage.The same poll showed that people who identify as gay, lesbian or transgender, are more optimistic than ever. Three out of four said they were generally out with others, and nine in ten said their communities have become more accepting.The media's LGBT portrayal has gone from invisible to mainstream. Gay couple Cam and Mitchell are the affectionately hilarious heart of TV's Modern Family. Neil Patrick Harris is an openly gay man, who plays a ladies' man, for an audience that doesn't care. How I Met Your Mother was just renewed for a ninth season. The last election deepened the twilight of the day when gay marriage (or gay anything) could bring out the conservative electorate. On gay issues, the religious right finds itself a drum line in search of a lost parade.But does tolerance trickle down? What does statistical and prime-time acceptance mean in the unforgiving halls of an average junior high?Journalist and activist Dan Savage -- whose It Gets Better LGBT suicide prevention project has literally saved lives -- calls these days of dawning sexual enlightenment ""the best of times and the worst of times."" For those with accepting families, progressive communities, and determined school support, LGBT life -- indeed -- has never been better. For others, it can actually be tougher than the days of closeted anonymity. Seeing validation and acceptance in the media, while experiencing rejection and bullying in life can be especially isolating. If the world is OK with being gay; why isn't it OK with me?Both straight and gay students say being called ""gay"" is the single worst form of harassment. Gay students hear anti-gay slurs as often as 26 times a day. LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say they don't feel safe at school. Some 90 percent of them report being harassed or assaulted in the past year. School days can be harrowing for anyone who is different: too short, too heavy, too skinny, too shy, too anything that puts them in the sights of the predators inevitably drawn to the social stragglers. Multiply that by the pain experienced by a child whose difference - real or perceived -- crosses into the perilous territory of sexual identity, and different can take on life-altering dimensions.There is a clear connection between childhood bullying and self-esteem. The consequences are measured in depression, self-loathing (maybe they're right about me), anger, hopelessness and -- tragically -- suicide. Although factors other than sexuality are certainly involved, LGBT students are four times more likely than hetero students to take their own lives. True, the worst of the harassment tends to be a point in time. A seven year study of U.K. teens, by educational psychology professor Joseph Robinson, University of Illinois, Urbana- Champagne, published in the current issue of Pediatrics, reports that LGBT bullying goes down with age. More than 50 percent of gay and bisexual boys were bullied at ages 13-14, versus only 6 percent at ages 18-20. That implies that bullies grow out of it, or that older youth can simply avoid them. Probably both.The vulnerable years may be few. But in those years: What cues are delivered? What life lessons are taught? What beliefs are shaped about personal value and place in the world?Yes, things are getting better. But the emotional wilds of an average middle, junior and even high school are never going to be as welcoming as polls and sitcom plot lines would have us believe. It's a mistake to confuse progress with solution. Bullying is real, it leaves scars, and we still have a long way to go.Just ask a ""faggot"" -- as he picks his books up off the floor."

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has not taken a position on the issue.Lawyers at the Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe law firm, which is handling the Proposition 8 brief, said more names could be added to the list before it is filed on Thursday.In the DOMA case, a source close to the case said a similar brief with more than 250 signatories is due to be filed with the Supreme Court on Wednesday.In the Proposition 8 brief, attorney Joshua Rosenkranz wrote that companies believe that the ban and other laws like it ""inflict real and wholly unnecessary injury on business.""""By marginalizing same-sex couples and foreclosing gay men and lesbians from forming 'married' families, these bans on equal access to marriage stigmatize gay men and lesbians and deprive them of the benefits intrinsic to marriage,"" he added.Even if a corporation welcomes gay and lesbian unions, ""it cannot overcome the societal stigma institutionalized by Proposition 8 and similar laws,"" Rosenkranz wrote.He also made the argument that there is ""a strong business case"" for recognizing same-sex marriage. Gay marriage bans ""can impede business efforts to recruit, hire and retain the best workers,"" he added."

In all of the cases, the men were arrested under the state's anti-sodomy law, which was struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2003 ruling in Lawrence v. Texas.Technically invalid yet still on the books, the state's ""Crime Against Nature"" law prohibits “unnatural carnal copulation by a human being with another of the same-sex or opposite-sex or with an animal” along with “solicitation by a human being of another with the intent to engage in any unnatural carnal copulation for compensation,” according to Louisiana legislature.“This is a law that is currently on the Louisiana books, and the sheriff is charged with enforcing the laws passed by our Louisiana Legislature,” Casey Rayborn Hicks, a Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman, told the Baton Rouge Advocate. “Whether the law is valid is something for the courts to determine, but the sheriff will enforce the laws that are enacted.”However, the Advocate also revealed that none of these cases had been prosecuted by District Attorney Hillar Moore III, whose office could find no evidence of any crime being committed by any of the arrested men.While Hicks argued that the fact that the men agreed to sex in a public park made their actions illegal, Equality Louisiana’s Bruce Parker told MSNBC.com that this claim carried little legitimacy as no sex ever actually happened in the park and most of the men intended to have sex at a private residence.“They started a conversation and the officer invited him back,"" Parker said. ""That’s a conversation that could happen anywhere. It’s the equivalent of me asking you out in a Post Office.” As outrage from advocates for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community grew over the weekend, the East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office posted two statement on its Facebook page. The first was a defense of the policy, which claimed that department was not trying to target or embarrass any particular community. ""When we receive calls from the public about lewd activity near our children, we have to respond,"" the statement reads. ""Our park operations, conducted at the specific request of the BREC Park’s Ranger, were an attempt to deter or stop lewd activity occurring in the park near children... The deputies used a statute that they felt fit the situation in order to remedy the concerns of the parents and park officials.""However, one hour and several Facebook comments later the department posted a second, more conciliatory status: The goal of our statement was to express our intent to the public, which was to keep the parks safe. We admit, however, the approach needs to change. We are not making excuses, simply stating we will learn from this, make changes and move forward. We will be working with all branches of government to find a better solution for keeping our parks safe. Thanks to all for their input.While it appears that law enforcement in Louisiana may be rethinking any further application of the anti-sodomy statutes, ThinkProgress notes that similar laws remain on the books in over a dozen other states. In fact, two years ago a Michigan sheriff’s office was revealed to be executing similar stings against gay men in the area.UPDATE on July 29 at 2:45pm ET: The East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff’s office has released a statement with an apology which note, ""While sections of La. R.S. 14:89, Crimes Against Nature, have not been removed from the Louisianalaw code, they have been deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional. The Sheriff’s Office will not use these unconstitutional sections of the law in future cases."" Read more at The New Civil Rights Movement.(h/t Raw Story)"

Sandy Rios, American Family Association talk show host and Fox News contributor, broached the topic of same-sex marriage while speaking with Chicago anti-gay pastor Erwin Lutzer last week, Right Wing Watch notes. Lutzer said one opposition against same-sex marriage is that the city's crime is bad enough and they don't need the ""destruction of marriage"" as well. The two also agreed that love shouldn't be reason enough to allow same-sex couples to marry.""A pedophile I'm sure says that he loves children -- as a matter of fact, he does -- but you can see how destructive that love is,"" Lutzer said. ""Once love is undefined as kind of this 'I want to do this and so I'm loving' then, of course, we end up where we are ending up today with a great slide in morality, the destruction of the family, the confusion that children grow up with. All of these implications..."" ""You know, the gentleman that was just sentenced yesterday for holding those women hostage in Ohio, and molesting them for years, and doing terrible things to them,"" Rios continued, ""His defense was that he ‘loved’ his family, he ‘loved’ his child that was born out of one of the rapes that he did of the woman. He ‘loved’ and he couldn’t understand. He said, ‘I’m not a monster.’”   Rios was referring to Castro, a kidnapper and rapist who kept victims Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus captive in his Cleveland home for a decade. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 counts last week, including murder and kidnapping, and was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison. During the Aug. 1 hearing, he claimed “most of the sex that went on in that house, probably all of it, was consensual.” He also denied being a monster, saying he ""simply kept them [in his house] without them being able to leave.”David Badash of the New Civil Rights Movement called Rios' comments both ""offensive and ludicrous.""The conservative pundit has previously falsely claimed that sexual abuse in the gay male community is an ""epidemic""; teaching kids about equality is like teaching them to use crack; and gay-inclusive curricula is to blame for falling test scores.

In a 25-34 vote, the House rejected the domestic partnership legislation, the first time Wyoming lawmakers formally voted on legislation related to marriage equality. The legislation's defeat comes after the House Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee passed the domestic partnership bill on Monday, while defeating a measure that would have allowed gay marriage. ""Just a sad day for the Equality State,"" state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer (R-Cheyenne) told The Huffington Post. Zwonitzer has been a leading supporter of gay rights in the legislature, including several efforts to kill gay marriage bans since his election in 2004. The debate that predeeded Wednesday night's debate was tamer then Monday's committee hearing, where opponents of the gay marriage bill had contended that gay marriage harms moral and public health. State Rep. Mark Baker (R-Rock Springs) again raised the public health argument in the debate on the House floor, claiming that ""only 1 percent of homosexuals die of old age"" and that domestic partnership would cause higher health care costs for the state, according to a tweet by Trevor Brown, the state government reporter for the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. Brown also tweeted that Baker had said that domestic partnerships were not ""rooted"" in the Wyoming constitution or in the state's tradition. Supporters of the legislation focused on civil rights and equality issues raised by state Rep. Cathy Connolly (D-Laramie), the bill's sponsor, in Monday's committee meeting. Connolly, the state's only openly gay elected official, could not immediately be reached for comment. Baker tweeted that Connolly was ""stoic"" during the vote. The domestic partnership measure had been viewed by supporters as having a better chance of passing than the gay marriage bill, but several legislators may have changed their minds at the last minute. Gov. Matt Mead (R) had indicated that he would sign a domestic partnership bill. The domestic partnership bill had included the ability for heterosexual couples and platonic couples to enter into partnerships. State Sen. Bruce Burns (R-Sheridan), a co-sponsor, told the Corporations Committee on Monday that his aunt has shared a house with another woman for over three decades in a ""platonic relationship"" and the bill would allow them to have domestic partner benefits. He also said it would allow siblings who live together to become domestic partners. State Rep. Lynn Hutchings (R-Cheyenne), an African American, told the committee that gay marriage was not comparable to the civil rights movement because she said people choose to be gay. She told committee members that her ex-fiance had been gay before dating her. Hutchings also said she opposed the bill due to AIDS. "
12467	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/26/proposition-8_n_2952595.html	News	1	Gay Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	By MARK SHERMAN, THE ASSOCIATED PRESSWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is wading into the fight over same-sex marriage at a time when public opinion is shifting rapidly in favor of permitting gay and lesbian couples to wed, but 40 states don't allow it.The court's first major examination of gay rights in 10 years begins Tuesday with a hearing on California's ban on same-sex marriage. On Wednesday, the justices will consider the federal law that prevents legally married gay couples from receiving a range of benefits afforded straight married Americans.People have been waiting in line – even through light snow – since Thursday for coveted seats for the argument over California's Proposition 8.The two California couples challenging the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage in the nation's largest state are in Washington for the argument and are urging the justices to strike down not just the California provision, but constitutional amendments and statutes in every state that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.They envision the 21st century equivalent of the court's 1967 decision in Loving v. Virginia that struck down state bans on interracial marriages.The Obama administration has weighed in on behalf of the challengers, following President Barack Obama's declaration of support for same-sex marriage last year and his invocation of gay rights at his inauguration in January.Supporters of Proposition 8 say the court should respect the verdict of California voters who approved the ban in 2008 and let the fast-changing politics of gay marriage evolve on their own, through ballot measures and legislative action, not judicial decrees.Same-sex marriage is legal in nine states and the District of Columbia. The states are Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont and Washington.Thirty states ban same-sex marriage in their state constitutions, while ten states bar them under state laws. New Mexico law is silent on the issue.Polls have shown increasing support in the country for gay marriage. According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in mid-March, 49 percent of Americans now favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, with 44 percent opposed.The California case is being argued 10 years to the day after the court took up a challenge to Texas' anti-sodomy statute. That case ended with a forceful ruling prohibiting states from criminalizing sexual relations between consenting adults.Justice Anthony Kennedy was the author of the decision in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and he is being closely watched for how he might vote on the California ban. He cautioned in the Lawrence case that it had nothing to do with gay marriage, but dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia predicted the decision would lead to the invalidation of state laws against same-sex marriage.Kennedy's decision is widely cited in the briefs in support of same-sex unions.The court has several options for its eventual ruling, which is not expected before late June. In addition to upholding the ban and invalidating prohibitions everywhere, the justices could endorse an appeals court ruling that would make same-sex marriage legal in California but apply only to that state. They also could issue a broader ruling that would apply to California and eight other states: Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island. In those states, gay couples may join in civil unions or become domestic partners and have all the benefits of marriage but cannot be married.One other possibility is a ruling that says nothing about marriage. California's top elected officials, Gov. Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris, are refusing to defend Proposition 8, and there is a question about whether the Proposition 8 supporters have the right, or legal standing, to defend the measure in court. If the justices decide they do not, the case would end without a high court ruling about marriage, although legal experts widely believe same-sex marriages would quickly resume in California.The California couples, Kris Perry and Sandy Stier of Berkeley and Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, filed their federal lawsuit in May 2009 to overturn the same-sex marriage ban that voters approved the previous November. The ballot measure halted same-sex unions in California, which began in June 2008 after a ruling from the California Supreme Court.Roughly 18,000 couples were wed in the nearly five months that same-sex marriage was legal and those marriages remain valid in California.The high-profile case has brought together onetime Supreme Court opponents. Republican Theodore Olson and Democrat David Boies are leading the legal team representing the same-sex couples. They argued against each other in the Bush v. Gore case that settled the disputed 2000 presidential election in favor of George W. Bush.Opposing them is Charles Cooper, Olson's onetime colleague at the Justice Department in the Reagan administration.The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry, 12-144.

However, when Seelig called Best Vacations Ever to reserve the dates of their trip after the company had already accepted their credit card information and sent them welcome materials, they were allegedly met with the following interaction. Seelig told The Huffington Post in an email:They were most helpful and eager to make the arrangements... until [Dan] said the second person was named Tim. They asked if that was a male?... [The representative] said, 'Please hold a moment.' After five minutes or so, she came back on the line and said, 'I'm so sorry, we don't allow same-sex couples to use the Vegas vacation offer. We can book you in Orlando or New Orleans, but not Vegas.' We spent the entire day in shock.... Seelig and England spent the remainder of the day attempting to contact different representatives of the company. One manager Seelig spoke to allegedly told the chorus director to mail a letter to a P.O. Box in Florida if the couple had an issue with the policy. Following a formal complaint by Seelig and press coverage of the incident, Best Vacations Ever reached out to the couple and informed them that their customer care agent had made a mistake by telling Dan he couldn't travel to Las Vegas ""due to his sexual preference.""The representative also allegedly offered to send the couples on their Las Vegas ""best vacation ever"" and reimburse them fully for the cost of the trip. Seelig and England told The Huffington Post that they would not be accepting the offer. ""Our initial reaction was definitely, 'Oh no, you did not just say that!'"" stated Seelig. ""The two of us had different reactions. For Dan, this kind of blatant discrimination is somewhat new -- he came out in California and has not really experienced such things. For me, it brought up many experiences I had having come out in Houston, Texas... this was not new, but, interestingly enough, no less painful really. My reaction was to fight.""When The Huffington Post reached out to Best Vacations Ever, Michelle Morse, a representative of the company, responded with the following statement and a similar statement was posted on the company's Facebook. (The statement in full can be read at the end of the article.)""This promotional offer for a hotel stay was subsidized by a third party resort in Las Vegas. These offers are designed to cater to co-habitating couples, regardless of sexual orientation or marital status. Both parties within a household must travel and participate in the promotion together. This requirement is in place to prevent the use of this type of promotional package for bachelor or bachelorette parties, business trips or conventions.Couples, regardless of sexual orientation, are in fact the primary audience for this and many other vacation and travel related products offered by our company. Any accusations to the contrary are inaccurate.In this specific case, when the guest called to make the reservation there was confusion as to whether they could show proof of residency (living together), however, there was no intentional disqualification based on the sexual orientation or marital status of the couple.Seelig and England, however, aren't buying it. They claim that six different representatives of the company told them the same information regarding the company's policy about same-sex couples and denied them a booking in Las Vegas.""I have been conducting LGBT choruses for 25 years,"" Seelig told The Huffington Post. ""People often ask, is there really a reason or relevance to such organizations in today's 'We love the gays world?' Yes there is. This is proof. We may be the darlings of the entertainment industry, but discrimination and bigotry go very, very deep and we must fight it at every turn.""The full statement from Best Vacation Ever is available below.The web portal, Best Vacations Ever, provides marketing and reservation services for many third party resorts around the country.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has not taken a position on the issue.Lawyers at the Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe law firm, which is handling the Proposition 8 brief, said more names could be added to the list before it is filed on Thursday.In the DOMA case, a source close to the case said a similar brief with more than 250 signatories is due to be filed with the Supreme Court on Wednesday.In the Proposition 8 brief, attorney Joshua Rosenkranz wrote that companies believe that the ban and other laws like it ""inflict real and wholly unnecessary injury on business.""""By marginalizing same-sex couples and foreclosing gay men and lesbians from forming 'married' families, these bans on equal access to marriage stigmatize gay men and lesbians and deprive them of the benefits intrinsic to marriage,"" he added.Even if a corporation welcomes gay and lesbian unions, ""it cannot overcome the societal stigma institutionalized by Proposition 8 and similar laws,"" Rosenkranz wrote.He also made the argument that there is ""a strong business case"" for recognizing same-sex marriage. Gay marriage bans ""can impede business efforts to recruit, hire and retain the best workers,"" he added."

Sandy Rios, American Family Association talk show host and Fox News contributor, broached the topic of same-sex marriage while speaking with Chicago anti-gay pastor Erwin Lutzer last week, Right Wing Watch notes. Lutzer said one opposition against same-sex marriage is that the city's crime is bad enough and they don't need the ""destruction of marriage"" as well. The two also agreed that love shouldn't be reason enough to allow same-sex couples to marry.""A pedophile I'm sure says that he loves children -- as a matter of fact, he does -- but you can see how destructive that love is,"" Lutzer said. ""Once love is undefined as kind of this 'I want to do this and so I'm loving' then, of course, we end up where we are ending up today with a great slide in morality, the destruction of the family, the confusion that children grow up with. All of these implications..."" ""You know, the gentleman that was just sentenced yesterday for holding those women hostage in Ohio, and molesting them for years, and doing terrible things to them,"" Rios continued, ""His defense was that he ‘loved’ his family, he ‘loved’ his child that was born out of one of the rapes that he did of the woman. He ‘loved’ and he couldn’t understand. He said, ‘I’m not a monster.’”   Rios was referring to Castro, a kidnapper and rapist who kept victims Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus captive in his Cleveland home for a decade. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 counts last week, including murder and kidnapping, and was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison. During the Aug. 1 hearing, he claimed “most of the sex that went on in that house, probably all of it, was consensual.” He also denied being a monster, saying he ""simply kept them [in his house] without them being able to leave.”David Badash of the New Civil Rights Movement called Rios' comments both ""offensive and ludicrous.""The conservative pundit has previously falsely claimed that sexual abuse in the gay male community is an ""epidemic""; teaching kids about equality is like teaching them to use crack; and gay-inclusive curricula is to blame for falling test scores.

""Just because Al Sharpton is doing something and you hate Al Sharpton, doesn’t mean you help your party or your cause by going in the complete opposite direction. Maybe sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.

In it, he wrote that ""conservative commentators were offensive in their reflexive defense of Zimmerman, as well as their efforts to attack the integrity of a dead black teenager.""The MSNBC host has criticized conservative media outlets before. In December, he accused conservative media of ""destroying"" the Republican party, and before that, he said that said that GOP donors were ""lied to"" by conservative media during the 2012 election.

Speaking to MSNBC hosts Melissa Harris-Perry, Touré and legal analyst Lisa Bloom, Roberts questioned how minorities in America were treated by fellow citizens:Don’t we need to do a lot more about our social contract with each other in this country when it comes to being others? Because, as we look at this, we can use this as a great pivot point to talk about race relations in this country. But, being an 'other'—whether it’s LGBT, because you’re then suspected of being a pedophile and a rabid disease carrier. And if you are a woman, well you certainly don’t have a right to your own body and your own reproductive health, because if you do, then you’re just a slut who wants to sleep around and use abortion as birth control. And then if you’re Hispanic, well you're just a taker, you're not a maker. And you just want to come here and have anchor babies and you just want to lay off the land.Roberts then challenged MSNBC to sponsor an ""I Am Other"" forum to bring people to discuss what he called ""the social contract we have currently negotiated that is so wrong."" ""It’s supposed to be a melting pot but we're treating each other with such disdain it’s not even funny,"" he said.Roberts is not the only host to react so passionately to the news of the George Zimmerman trial verdict.

While in those rooms he killed the two adults in each room, fifteen children in classroom 8 and five in classroom 10. All of the killings were done with the Bushmaster rifle. He then took his own life with a single shot from a Glock 20, 10 mm pistol in classroom 10.""The report does not establish a conclusive motive for the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting that left 20 children, six school staff members and the gunman dead. It does, however, highlight Lanza's ""preoccupation with mass shootings, in particular the Columbine shootings, and a strong interest in firearms.""Items found within digital evidence seized from Lanza's possessions include:Bookmarks pertaining to firearms, military, politics, mass murder, video games, music, books, Army Ranger, computers and programs, ammunition, candy, economic books  Two videos showing suicide by gunshot  Commercial movies depicting mass shootings  The computer game titled “School Shooting” where the player controls a character who enters a school and shoots at students  Images of the shooter holding a handgun to his head  Images of the shooter holding a rifle to his head  Five-second video (dramatization) depicting children being shot A spreadsheet listing mass murders by name and information about the incident  Materials regarding the topic of pedophilia and advocating for rights for pedophiles (not child pornography) Large amount of materials relating to Columbine shootings and documents on mass murders The report also states that authorities recovered a New York Times article from February 18, 2008, regarding the school shooting at Northern Illinois University and photocopied newspaper articles from 1891 pertaining to the shooting of school children.Authorities found Lanza ""dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,"" according to the report.

Previously, police have cited consideration for victims' families and the sheer size of the investigation as reasons for keeping the file private.Critics say that withholding information demonstrates the secrecy of the state's investigation.""What I found troubling about the approach of the state's attorney is that from my perspective, [Sedensky] seems to have forgotten his job is to represent the state of Connecticut,"" Dan Klau, a Hartford attroney, told the AP.

Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" Obama said.Obama said he understands why people are so upset that George Zimmerman was found not guilty for shooting and killing Martin, an unarmed teen who was walking down the street in Sanford, Fla., in February 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman, pursued Martin for no clear reason and ultimately shot him in what he said was self-defense.The president urged the nation to accept the court's verdict, saying the judge conducted the trial ""in a professional manner"" and that the jury had made its decision. But in an unusually personal moment, he began talking about the broader context of the case and the need to better understand the experiences of black men in this country.""I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,"" Obama said. ""There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.""He went on to recount instances when he had heard ""the locks click on the doors of cars"" as he walked down the street. African-American men are used to getting into an elevator and seeing a fellow passenger ""clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off,"" he said.""I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,"" Obama said. ""And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.""Obama also pointed to the fact that young African-American men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, both as perpetrators of violence and as its victims. And that violence, he noted, often takes place in poor black neighborhoods that are ""born out of a very violent past in this country."" The poverty and dysfunction in those communities ""can be traced to a very difficult history,"" he said.Obama said he's going to be thinking about what steps he can take as president in the wake of the ruling. He put forward the idea of meeting with local and state officials to come up with ways to provide more training to law enforcement on racial bias, and he also suggested that he plans to examine certain states' Stand Your Ground laws.More generally, Obama lent support to the idea of creating a coalition -- of business leaders, elected officials, celebrities, athletes -- to address the need for African-American men to feel that they are ""a full part of this society.""Obama's decision to speak on the verdict was a bit of a surprise. Several days had passed since it was issued on Saturday, and he had already put out an official statement. The conventional wisdom was that the president was wary of bringing more politics to an already sensitive issue. But both he and his advisers wanted to offer a bit more.Speaking after the president finished his remarks, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that the process behind putting the impromptu speech together wasn't all that complicated. The president had been prepared to address the jury verdict in Zimmerman's trial had he been asked about it in one of the interviews he did this week, but he wasn't asked. Eventually, Obama met with the press office and decided to just address the issue. A Friday statement before the press corps was as good a time as any other.""This is not hard at all,"" said Carney. ""The president wanted to say something, and he opened the briefing today so he could say something."""

DeMarte said she reviewed an evaluation of Arias by Dr. Cheryl L. Karp, the Vice-Chairperson for the State of Arizona Board of Psychologist Examiners. DeMarte said Arias indicated more episodes of alleged abuse to Dr. Karp than she did to herself and the other defense experts.""She told me there were four distinct episodes of alleged abuse,"" Demarte said of her evaluation of Arias.Martinez then asked DeMarte how many incidents of alleged abuse Arias recounted to Dr. Karp.""I can't even count [them] ... there was numerous reports of frequent abuse and threatening behavior,"" DeMarte said. DeMarte said she diagnosed Arias with borderline personality disorder. She also testified she found no evidence to believe Arias' claims about her memory problems or that she was a victim of domestic violence and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.""There wasn't symptoms that were consistent with that diagnosis,"" she said of the PTSD. During cross-examination by defense attorney Jennifer Willmott, DeMarte stood her ground. She did not flinch when the attorney suggested she was too young or lacked experience. At one point Willmott asked DeMarte about her knowledge of Alyce LaViolette, the defense teams domestic violence expert. Willmott pointed out that DeMarte had not been born when LaViolette got her Masters degree in 1980.Willmott is expected to continue her redirect of DeMarte on Wednesday, at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time.TUESDAYS LIVE BLOG:"

Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) criticized New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's federal gun control push on Tuesday, advising the mayor that he should be more worried about gun violence in his own city than in North Dakota, the Grand Forks Herald reported.""North Dakota continues to have one [of] the highest rates of gun ownership and lowest incidences of gun crime in the country,"" Heitkamp said in a statement. ""Yet New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg insists on taking gun-driven crime statistics in his city and from other major cities and trying to force those numbers into a narrative that just does not fit North Dakota.""Heitkamp, who previously served as North Dakota's attorney general, added, ""I do not need someone from New York City to tell me how to handle crime in our state.""Her statement came in response to the recent $12 million ad buy from Mayors Against Illegal Guns, pushing senators in key states -- including Heitkamp -- to support such gun control legislation as comprehensive background checks. Bloomberg, who co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns in 2006 and is personally financing the ad campaign, is spending roughly $156,000 in North Dakota.""Frankly, there are far better uses for Mayor Bloomberg's $156,000 than buying ads attacking a way of life he clearly does not understand,"" Heitkamp wrote.Bloomberg earlier defended the ad buy, saying that the campaign reflects the sentiments of most Americans. ""These ads bring the voices of Americans -- who overwhelmingly support comprehensive and enforceable background checks -- into the discussion to move senators to immediately take action to prevent gun violence,"" he said in a statement issued last week by Mayors Against Illegal Guns.According to survey data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, roughly 50.7 percent of North Dakotans own a firearm -- one of the highest rates in the country. Yet the state's annual gun homicide rate is below the national average, with less than 1.1 per 100,000 people dying from gun violence in North Dakota, compared to the national rate of 2.75 per 100,000. Heitkamp attributed these figures to North Dakota's ""proud ... outdoor heritage,"" explaining that firearms owners in her state understand the rights and responsibilities that come with gun ownership.""Gun ownership in North Dakota comes down to growing up in a culture where those rights come with an ingrained responsibility taught at a young age,"" Heitkamp argued.""I wouldn't expect Mayor Bloomberg to follow my advice on how to run a major east coast city of over 8 million people, and I don't plan to follow his advice on what is best for North Dakotans,"" added Heitkamp, whose state has about 700,000 inhabitants.This isn't the first ad campaign targeting Heitkamp's position on gun control.

""Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school?"" The ad continues: ""Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he is just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security.""The video, part of the NRA's new ""Stand and Fight"" campaign, comes in response to comments Obama made on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" last month. ""I am skeptical that the only answer is putting more guns in schools, and I think the vast majority of the American people are skeptical that that somehow is going to solve our problem,"" Obama said. ""And, look, here's the bottom line. We're not going to get this done unless the American people decide it's important.""President Obama is set to announce his proposals for curbing gun violence on Wednesday. According to a Washington Post report, White House officials have considered funding for more police officers in public schools as part of those recommendations.While placing armed guards in school remains controversial, some polling has showed support for the idea in the weeks since the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School last month. A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found two-thirds of Virginia voters in favor of increased police presence at schools, while 41 percent of respondents in a Washington Post-ABC poll released Tuesday said that having armed guards in schools would do more to curb violence on campuses than stricter gun measures would.Watch the NRA video above.UPDATE: The NRA responded to criticism of the ad Wednesday morning.

Lisa Murkowski's (R-Alaska) net approval rating dropped 16 points, as she shed much of her previous cross-party appeal. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) saw his numbers dive 18 points, from a positive to a negative rating.Not all of the change can be attributed to the vote. Portman, for instance, saw his approval drop among Republicans when he announced his support for gay marriage in March. But in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada and Ohio, at least 60 percent of voters supported background checks, and many expressed disappointment with politicians who voted otherwise. Fifty-two percent of Arizona voters said they were less likely to support Sen. Jeff Flake (R) for reelection due to his ""no"" vote, while 46 percent of Nevadans said the same of Sen. Dean Heller (R). More than a third of voters were less likely to back Portman as well as Alaska Sens. Mark Begich (D) and Murkowski. A previous PPP poll found that Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) also saw her ratings tumble 15 points, likely due in part to her vote against background checks.Much of the lost support comes from independent or moderate voters.PPP hasn't yet conducted polling on how senators who supported the bill have fared. But Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who cosponsored background check legislation, saw his approval rating increase by a net 7 points, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Friday.Nationally, most polls taken since the shooting in Newtown, Conn., have found that upwards of 80 percent of people support gun background checks, and that there is relatively little partisan division on the issue.Opinions were less unified on the actual legislation considered in the Senate, but most still say they wish it had gone through. A 65 percent majority of Americans said the measure should have passed, including 45 percent of Republicans and a majority of Democrats and independents, according to a Gallup poll released Monday. "

Next time, let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you."" The words came following the Navy Yard shooting in Washington.Guth was put on paid administrative leave Friday, and the university has taken steps to distance itself from the tweet. In a statement reported by Fox4 in Kansas, the school's vice chancellor called the tweet ""repugnant,"" while Ann Brill, Kansas' journalism dean, said the university does not agree with Guth and does not ""advocate violence directed against any group or individuals.""#NavyYardShooting The blood is on the hands of the #NRA. Next time, let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you.— David Guth (@DWGuth) September 16, 2013While the university has taken steps against Guth, Republican state lawmakers want Guth fired. If he isn't, they say, the school could face consequences. State Senate President Susan Wagle (R-Wichita) and Senate Majority Leader Terry Bruce (R-Hutchison) have both issued statements calling for Guth's dismissal. State Sen. Greg Smith (R-Overland Park) released a statement Friday saying that unless further action is taken against Guth, he will react. ""As a public educator in the Kansas high school education system, I am often consulted by my students as to which college they should attend,"" Smith said in his statement. ""As long as Professor Guth remains employed by the University of Kansas I will no longer recommend the university as an institution worthy of attendance by any of my students nor, as a state senator, will I support any budget proposals or recommendations for the University of Kansas.""Other Republican lawmakers echoed Smith's comments about the university budget. State Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (R-Palco) told The Huffington Post that the university's latest budget proposal is arriving this week on lawmakers' desks -- and it asks for an increase. Swift action against Guth is needed to show that the university does not tolerate his tweet, Couture-Lovelady said.""It is a university decision,"" Couture-Lovelady said. ""We are elected representatives of the people who develop the budget for the university. I could see something like this being detrimental to their cause. Things like this hurt their cause, and it's unfortunate. I want to see them continue to grow.""State Rep. Brett Hildabrand (R-Shawnee), one of the most vocal pro-Second Amendment legislators in Kansas, told HuffPost that he and other lawmakers have been in contact with the university to express their opinions that Guth should be fired.""He went after the children of NRA members, and some of those children could be students in one of his classes,"" Hildabrand said. ""That sets up a hostile environment for the students.""Guth has been standing by his comments, telling Fox4KC Thursday that he does not want people to be shot.""If you look at how I structured the statement, I didn’t really bring [the NRA’s) children into it,” he said, according to Fox4KC. “I carefully structured the statement to make it conditional, but apparently it was too much of a nuance for some people.”“I don’t want anybody harmed. If somebody’s going to be harmed, maybe it ought to be the people who believe that guns are so precious that it’s worth spilling blood over,” Guth added, according to Fox4KC. Guth did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.Several lawmakers expressed concern that Guth's administrative leave is paid. Rep. Reid Petty (R-Liberal) said that while he doesn't think administrative leave is enough of a sanction for Guth, it's not the job of the legislature to interject itself into Guth's employment status.""I don't think that it is appropriate for us,"" Petty said. ""We can share our opinions and you have the chancellor and the Board of Regents. If you had a pattern of professors saying outrageous things, then we could.""Jack Martin, University of Kansas spokesman, said the university did not have a comment on the legislators. He referred back to the statement the school released announcing Guth's suspension.All of the legislators contacted by HuffPost said they agree that Guth has a First Amendment right to free speech. But, they said, he's paid by the taxpayer and has embarrassed the state.""He has freedom of speech. Speak all he wants as a former KU professor,"" state Rep. J.R. Claeys (R-Salina) told HuffPost. ""When he voices an insensitive and threatening opinion, he doesn't get to take the good image of our institutions down with him.""UPDATE: 10:30 p.m. -- Guth told The Huffington Post in an email he agreed with University of Kansas officials' request to take paid administrative leave because of the threats. He explained:""I have had conversations with the university and have agreed to this action -- an administrative leave with pay -- in light of the abusive email threats I and others have received. It is in it the best interests and peace of mind of our students that I remove myself from the situation and let cooler heads prevail. It is unfortunate that my comments have been deliberately distorted. I know what I meant. Unfortunately, this is a topic that generates more heat than light. I don't think any further comment would be appropriate at this time."""

Larry Ward, chairman of Gun Appreciation Day, appeared on CNN Friday to defend the nationwide gun rally, which is scheduled for Jan. 19 -- just two days before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Talking Points Memo notes. Ward insists that Gun Appreciation Day, which calls on gun activists across the nation to rally in support of the right to bear arms and against President Barack Obama's “post-Sandy Hook assault on gun rights,"" actually ""honors the legacy of Dr. King."" ""We are looking for a peaceful protest,"" Ward said. Continuing, ""I think Martin Luther King, Jr. would agree with me if he were alive today that if African Americans had been given the right to keep and bear arms from day one of the country’s founding, perhaps slavery might not have been a chapter in our history."" Maria Roach, founder of United for Change USA, an organization dedicated to prison reform and gun violence prevention, called Ward's comments simply ""ridiculous."" ""Slavery means that you are a possession,"" she said on CNN. ""Slaves were a possession, just like a gun."" She continued to criticize Ward for celebrating weapons just two days before celebrating the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was assassinated in 1968 by a single shot.Think Progress' Aviva Shen notes the caveats in Ward's armed-slaves argument: Ward also neglects to mention that in fact there were many armed uprisings by slaves, as early as 1526. Armed revolts almost always failed, and often led to retribution by the slave owners, who had the justice system on their side. Most famously, Nat Turner led a rebellion that resulted in 60 white deaths and 100 black deaths. The state later executed 56 blacks accused of being involved in the insurrection, and white mobs beat and killed at least 200 others in revenge.Gun Appreciation Day, backed by a coalition of conservative groups, not only coincides with MLK Day, but also Obama's second inauguration. Roach's United for Change USA has launched a petition to stop Gun Appreciation Day, according to ABC News. ""Gun groups are planning to have a National Gun Appreciation Day on January 19th, the same weekend that Americans celebrate the life and service of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an American leader who was assassinated by a rifle's bullet,"" reads the petition. ""This is an outrage and a slap in the face to Americans who value life and freedom!""As of Friday, the petition had garnered more than 26,000 of the 30,000 signatures needed on SignOn.org. "

Too many children are dying,"" Giffords said.Wednesday's hearing is a direct response to the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 first-graders and six adults were killed at an elementary school. ""Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you,"" Giffords urged the committee.Watch video of Giffords' comments above.Giffords' husband Mark Kelly, a NASA astronaut, also spoke at the hearing. Yahoo! News reports:Giffords' husband, NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, testified at the hearing and called for action to increase background checks on gun purchasers and to remove limitations on public health organizations that collect gun violence data. He also urged the enactment of a federal gun trafficking statute that increases penalties on illegal guns purchases.""Our rights are paramount. But our responsibilities are serious,"" Kelly said. ""And as a nation we are not taking responsibility for the gun rights our Founding Fathers conferred upon us. Gabby and I are pro-gun ownership.

""She struggles to walk and she is partially blind. And a year ago, she left a job she loves, serving the people of Arizona.""Giffords' appearance at the witness table offered rare insight into her condition. Her family has closely guarded her privacy and the details of her impairment.Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida told CNN it takes her good friend ""a tremendous amount of rehearsal and practice"" to utter even a few sentences.""What she did today was remarkable,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""You could hear the emotion and the power behind the statement she was making because she feels so strongly about this.""White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama was looking forward to seeing Giffords and Kelly later Wednesday, and that everyone at the White House was heartened by her appearance on Capitol Hill.Giffords has made only a few public appearances and interviews since the January 2011 shooting, including reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democratic National Convention and casting a single vote in August 2011 on legislation to raise the federal debt limit.She resigned her seat in Congress a year ago to focus on her recovery. Giffords and Kelly, both gun owners, have formed a political action group called Americans for Responsible Solutions, aimed at promoting gun restrictions.Gun control is an issue that really hasn't been debated in Congress for more than 10 years. It rarely gets an airing and engenders strong emotions.And so it was that both sides did their all to ensure maximum impact from Wednesday's hearing.Giffords was clearly happy to do her part.This post has been updated to include Kelly's remarks.

A gun-rights group in New Hampshire - the site of a key presidential nominating primary where Christie would want to do well should he run for president - warned that it would organize voters against him if he were to crack down on gun owners in New Jersey.""There are still three major anti-gun bills on Governor Christie's desk, and we are watching,"" said Sam Cohen, executive vice president of Pro Gun New Hampshire.Gun control supporters in New Jersey said the signings represented a step forward.""Seeing these bills signed into law is a victory for New Jersey's communities,"" said Louis Greenwald, majority leader of the state assembly.

John Hickenlooper (D) signed three major gun control measures into law on Wednesday morning, just hours after the state's Department of Corrections chief, Tom Clements, was shot and killed at home. The new legislation represents the culmination of a battle between Hickenlooper and national gun rights advocacy groups that began on a cordial note, but ended acrimoniously on both sides.The three laws will ban gun magazines with a capacity of more than 15 rounds, require background checks for all firearms sales (with exceptions made for antique guns and ""bona fide"" gifts between immediate family members), and impose a fee on background checks that covers the cost to the state of performing them. The laws are scheduled to go into effect July 1. Hickenlooper signed the bills in a solemn ceremony at the state Capitol in Denver a few hours after he held a news conference on the death of Clements, who had been appointed executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections in 2011. ""Corrections is a very different job. You make difficult decisions every time that affect different people,"" Hickenlooper said at the news conference. ""Tom Clements dedicated his life to being a public servant, to making our state a better place, and he is going to be deeply, deeply missed.""Authorities have not apprehended a suspect in Clements' murder, which occurred Tuesday around 8:30 p.m. The killer allegedly knocked on Clements' front door and then shot him at close range when he opened it. Hickenlooper said he would be visiting with Clements' family Wednesday after he signed the gun control bills. In recent years, gun violence has become an increasingly divisive political issue in Colorado, in no small part because the state has been the scene of two mass shootings. The first was at Columbine High School in 1999, when two students murdered 12 people and injured 21 others before committing suicide. Then, in August 2012, a lone gunman opened fire in a movie theater in nearby Aurora, killing 12 and injuring 58 people. ""Colorado is in a unique position in that we have suffered these tragedies firsthand, so there is a drumbeat [for greater gun control] in Colorado,” said state Senate President John Morse (D) this month in an interview with NBC News.But Colorado is also a state with a strong tradition of firearms ownership and a pioneer heritage that remains a source of pride for residents. As the state House of Representatives prepared to introduce the gun control legislation this winter in the wake of the tragic shooting in Newtown, Conn., gun rights advocates initially sought to capitalize on that goodwill by announcing that their goal was to find a reasonable compromise. In February, the National Rifle Association's president, David Keene, traveled to Colorado to meet with Hickenlooper in person and said afterward that the NRA had always considered the governor ""a pretty reasonable and thoughtful guy."" In turn, Hickenlooper said that ""while [the NRA and I] might not agree on a number of things, there will certainly be places we can find common ground."" As the sweeping gun control bills advanced through the Colorado House and Senate in late February and March largely unamended, however, the NRA and similar groups dropped the ""nice guy"" veneer. The NRA established a dedicated website, Defend Colorado, aimed at mobilizing opposition to the bills and took out print advertisements in Colorado newspapers attacking Hickenlooper. The attacks continued right up to Tuesday afternoon, when the NRA put out a release warning Colorado residents that ""Governor Hickenlooper is likely to sign a series of draconian bills that attack on [sic] your Second Amendment rights."" On Wednesday, after the news of Clements' death broke, the NRA was silent on both social media and its website. A spokesman for the group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) attempted to attach to a water resources bill on Wednesday, which would have allowed gun owners to carry firearms into recreational areas currently off-limits. The amendment was one of two Coburn had planned to offer, although he withdrew his second earlier in the day. Areas controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- such as hundreds of the nation's lakes and thousands of campsites and miles of trails -- are gun-free zones, even if the state where the land is located allows concealed weapons. Coburn's amendment, however, would have granted precedence to state laws and permitted people to carry guns in some of these places. The Senate voted 56-43 on Coburn's amendment, failing to garner the 60 votes needed to move forward. Coburn's second amendment would have required federal agencies to account for all of their guns and ammunition, essentially creating a registry of government firearms. The push was part of a concern among some conservatives that the government may be stockpiling ammunition in order to restrict the supply available to the public. Coburn spokesman John Hart confirmed to The Huffington Post that Coburn had withdrawn his amendment, which was also scheduled for a vote. He said it was ""a goodwill gesture"" to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), one of the sponsors of the Water Resources Development Act. On Tuesday, Boxer criticized Republicans for putting forward gun amendments on her bill. The NRA's federal affairs office sent out an alert on Wednesday afternoon, urging senators to support Coburn's Army Corps of Engineers amendment. ""The National Rifle Association strongly supports this amendment,"" the email reads, with the statement in bold, underlined type. The group argued that Coburn's amendment would ""not only allow law abiding citizens to protect themselves, but relieve them from the onerous responsibility of tracking where one federal agency’s land management jurisdiction ends and another begins.""In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a bill into law that allows loaded firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges.This story has been updated to reflect the results of a Senate vote Wednesday afternoon.

However, both surveys found that support for stricter laws remains higher than it was before the Newtown shooting.In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 48 percent of Americans said they think gun laws should be made more strict, while 16 percent said they should be made less strict and 29 percent said they preferred no change. Support for stricter gun laws in the poll is down from a high of 60 percent in a YouGov/Economist poll conducted in January, weeks after the Newtown shooting. Likewise, a Gallup poll released Friday found that support for stricter gun laws has fallen from a high of 58 percent after the Newtown shooting to 49 percent now. Both the Gallup poll and the HuffPost/YouGov poll were conducted Sept. 17 and 18, after the Monday deaths of 13 people in the shooting at Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.Although support for stricter gun laws was down in both surveys from the rates seen just after the Newtown shooting, it has not fallen to levels seen before that shooting. The most recent Gallup and YouGov polls conducted before the Newtown shooting both found support for stricter gun laws below 45 percent.Some policies supported by advocates of stricter gun laws still receive broad support -- most notably universal background checks. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in August found that 79 percent of Americans support universal background checks, including for gun shows and private sales. However, overall support for stricter laws has shown a marked decline over the past 25 years. Two major school shootings -- Columbine and Newtown -- have reversed that trend, but only temporarily.In accordance with the longer-term trend against support for tightening gun laws, the post-Newtown bump in support never reached the same level that it did after Columbine.Following other mass shootings, including the recent shooting in Washington, polls have found little evidence of anything more than fleeting changes in opinion on gun laws. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted a month ago, before the Navy Yard shooting, found that 49 percent of Americans said they support stricter gun laws -- almost identical to the 48 percent who said so in the most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll. Both the latest HuffPost/YouGov poll and the Gallup poll were conducted before the shooting Thursday in Chicago in which 13 people were injured, including a 3-year-old boy who was shot in the head.Fifty-nine percent of respondents to the HuffPost/YouGov poll said they had ""heard a lot"" about the Navy Yard shooting. In contrast,  a HuffPost/YouGov poll  conducted in the days after the Newtown school shooting found that 70 percent said they had heard a lot about that shooting.The HuffPost/YouGov poll also found that many Americans don't think stricter gun laws will prevent future mass shootings. Forty percent said stricter laws would help, but 52 percent said changing things won't make a difference.And when it comes to ways to reduce the likelihood of future violence, many people didn't look to gun laws. By a 57 percent to 29 percent margin, the HuffPost/YouGov poll found that most people think better mental health care is more likely to prevent future mass shootings than stricter gun laws. Similarly, the Gallup poll found that 48 percent of Americans place a ""great deal"" of blame for mass shootings on the ""failure of the mental health system to identify individuals who are a danger to others,"" compared to 40 percent who said the same of ""easy access to guns.""On the other hand, the HuffPost/YouGov survey showed little sympathy for the argument frequently made by gun-rights advocates that people carrying guns would lead to lower gun violence. A plurality of respondents to the poll rejected that argument, saying by a 44 percent to 38 percent margin that stricter gun laws were more likely to prevent mass shootings than allowing more people to carry guns for protection. Just after the Newtown shooting, respondents said the same by a 46 percent to 34 percent margin. Mark Blumenthal and Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reportingThe HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Sept. 17-18 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

In a concise, 3-minute argument, Merkle said the proposed legislation would not prevent violence.“Ever since I first learned how to shoot, the issue with gun violence around the nation became clear — guns are not the problem, people are,"" Merkle told the lawmakers. “Purging our society of violence and murder cannot be done by gun control legislation.""The teen, who is secretary of the Maryland Rifle Club and a life-long sport shooter, also said ""guns are not needed for mass murder, and robbing American citizens over rights to own them won’t solve anything."" Merkle added that the proposed laws would stop her from attending college on a shooting scholarship.ABC News notes that Maryland's ""Firearm Safety Act of 2013,"" a provision regarding interstate transportation of weapons, could make it harder for Merkle to practice shooting at a range in Delaware.While Merkle's testimony will probably not influence Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is expected to soon sign the gun measure into law, it has made her a budding star among conservative bloggers and gun rights advocates.A YouTube video of the teen's testimony has racked up more than 2.5 million views in the ensuing weeks. The clip also has garnered 16,000-plus comments. On Sunday, Merkle told the Washington Times that she was glad her video was getting attention, if only to bring more awareness to the issue.“The biggest part of this is that the pro-gun, Second Amendment argument is getting publicity,” Merkle said. “I like that it actually got out there, and not just because it’s me, but because it’s the argument.”On Tuesday, Merkle also made an appearance on Fox News program ""Hannity."" Host Sean Hannity praised Merkle for understanding that gun control wouldn't have prevented the Sandy Hook tragedy. ""Here you are, 15-years-old, you get that,"" he said, asking why did she think the massacre was being ""used as an issue to control people's guns.""""I don't understand what they're doing, they are criminalizing law abiding citizens,"" Merkle replied. She also told him that she thought the AR-15 rifle -- the weapon used by Newtown shooter Adam Lanza -- is actually one of the most effective weapons for self-defense. The AR-15 is much more accurate, and much easier to fire, Merkle said, especially for children or people with smaller frames.Merkle told the Washington Times that her high profile comments have also attracted some less-than-positive feedback, including pretty nasty threats, but she said she remains committed to the cause.""I’m not going to stop fighting on this just because some people disagree with me,"" she said."

They're hard to aim, they're difficult to use. But shotguns, well, that's a different story.During a Facebook Town Hall hosted by Parents magazine, Biden took a handful of questions from readers about gun violence. One questioner named Kate asked how gun owners would be able to sufficiently protect themselves if Congress passed a bill banning certain weapons and high-capacity gun magazines. ""Kate, if you want to protect yourself, get a double barreled shotgun,"" Biden responded. ""I promise you, as I told my wife, we live in an area that's wooded and somewhat secluded. I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here, walk out, put [up] that double barreled shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.""The vice president said that by firing two shotgun blasts, anyone who might be trying to break in would be scared off. ""You don't need an AR-15,"" he said. ""Buy a shotgun! Buy a shotgun!"" Biden fielded a handful of other questions about gun reform proposals. He said he doesn't support making changes to the Second Amendment and described America's ""really healthy gun culture,"" which was a ""part of my father's ethic."" He clarified to another questioner that nobody wants to take away people's guns.""I have two shotguns at home,"" he said. ""No one is going to come and take my guns.""Biden appeared to get testy in some moments. When one person suggested that gun reforms would infringe on people's constitutional rights, Biden began his response by muttering, ""How can I say this politely?""He also described his younger days of shotgun use, which were around the same time he was driving around in his cherished 1967 Corvette.""Still have it,"" Biden said."

Larry Ward, chairman of Gun Appreciation Day, appeared on CNN Friday to defend the nationwide gun rally, which is scheduled for Jan. 19 -- just two days before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Talking Points Memo notes. Ward insists that Gun Appreciation Day, which calls on gun activists across the nation to rally in support of the right to bear arms and against President Barack Obama's “post-Sandy Hook assault on gun rights,"" actually ""honors the legacy of Dr. King."" ""We are looking for a peaceful protest,"" Ward said. Continuing, ""I think Martin Luther King, Jr. would agree with me if he were alive today that if African Americans had been given the right to keep and bear arms from day one of the country’s founding, perhaps slavery might not have been a chapter in our history."" Maria Roach, founder of United for Change USA, an organization dedicated to prison reform and gun violence prevention, called Ward's comments simply ""ridiculous."" ""Slavery means that you are a possession,"" she said on CNN. ""Slaves were a possession, just like a gun."" She continued to criticize Ward for celebrating weapons just two days before celebrating the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was assassinated in 1968 by a single shot.Think Progress' Aviva Shen notes the caveats in Ward's armed-slaves argument: Ward also neglects to mention that in fact there were many armed uprisings by slaves, as early as 1526. Armed revolts almost always failed, and often led to retribution by the slave owners, who had the justice system on their side. Most famously, Nat Turner led a rebellion that resulted in 60 white deaths and 100 black deaths. The state later executed 56 blacks accused of being involved in the insurrection, and white mobs beat and killed at least 200 others in revenge.Gun Appreciation Day, backed by a coalition of conservative groups, not only coincides with MLK Day, but also Obama's second inauguration. Roach's United for Change USA has launched a petition to stop Gun Appreciation Day, according to ABC News. ""Gun groups are planning to have a National Gun Appreciation Day on January 19th, the same weekend that Americans celebrate the life and service of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an American leader who was assassinated by a rifle's bullet,"" reads the petition. ""This is an outrage and a slap in the face to Americans who value life and freedom!""As of Friday, the petition had garnered more than 26,000 of the 30,000 signatures needed on SignOn.org. "

The Republican senator went on to explain that while he didn't think Obama would try to repeal the Second Amendment, he worried about efforts to weaken it. ""If they don't fully understand the Second Amendment and how it's supposed to apply, they are willing to test it and they are willing to see how much they can infringe on it,"" Rubio said.

Fred Upton (R-Mich.) to allow individuals to keep their health care plans fits in with that strategy. ""Remember the strategy for stopping Obamacare we laid out to you back in July. It had two components: Aggressive, coordinated oversight, and targeted legislative strikes aimed at shattering the legislative coalition the president has used to force his law on the nation,” Boehner said, closely following his earlier comments. ""That plan is being executed as we speak.""The statements signal how much of a reversal of fortune Republicans have enjoyed since the Obamacare exchange glitches and cancellations of individual health insurance plans. The shutdown failed to make any changes to Obamacare, while the cancellations have caused even Senate Democrats -- including liberals such as Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) -- to sign onto a bill to allow individuals to keep their health insurance plans.The White House opposes the Upton bill. However, Roll Call reported Monday that the White House is exploring an ""administrative fix"" to cancellations. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday morning that there may be a presidential announcement on Obamacare by midday.A Boehner spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said Tuesday that she and several of her Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives are considering suing President Barack Obama for allowing plans canceled under the Affordable Care Act to be extended through 2014. According to Politico, Bachmann, speaking at an event sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, accused the president of violating the constitutional separation of powers by changing the health care law through administrative means, rather than consulting Congress. ""That's the essence of lawlessness and now it's our time to defend our prerogative,"" she said.When asked about the lawsuit by MinnPost, Bachmann's office said a lawsuit was not imminent, but was under discussion. ""She and some of her colleagues have had discussions about the best recourse to put a stop to his unconstitutional actions,"" a spokesman said in a statement.Last week, facing backlash over plan cancellations under the health care law, Obama asked insurers to let individuals whose plans had been cancelled to renew their plans another year. ""Insurers can extend current plans that otherwise would be canceled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan,"" Obama said. ""This fix won't solve every problem for every person, but it's going to help a lot of people. Doing more would require work with Congress.""The White House later offered legal justification for Obama's fix to the Washington Post's Greg Sargent. “The Supreme Court held more than 25 years ago that agencies charged with administering statues have inherent authority to exercise discretion to ensure that their statutes are enforced in a manner that achieves statutory goals and are consistent with other administrative policies,"" a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said. ""Agencies may exercise this discretion in appropriate circumstances, including when implementing new or different regulatory regimes, and to ensure that transitional periods do not result in undue hardship.”"

HealthCare.gov, the online portal for health insurance shopping in more than 30 states, hasn't reliably worked during the first month and early enrollment figures came in well below expectations. In the meantime, between hundreds of thousands and millions of consumers have been notified that their insurance policies don't meet the health care law's standards and will be discontinued next year, in violation of Obama's vow that his law would allow people to keep their current coverage.""That's on me,"" Obama said. ""We fumbled the rollout on this health care law.""Obama vowed to press ahead with implementing his law, and reiterated that the health insurance market needs reforming to guarantee stable health insurance coverage. ""I make no apologies for us taking this on,"" he said. ""Because somebody sooner or later had to do it.""""It took a hundred years for us to even get to the point where we could start talking about and implementing a law to make sure everybody's got health insurance, and my pledge to the American people is, is that we're going to solve the problems that are there, we're going to get it right, and the Affordable Care Act is going to work for the American people,"" Obama said.Under the policy Obama announced Thursday, health insurance companies will be permitted to extend current policies, even though they don't comply with Affordable Care Act standards for benefits and financial protections, for their customers into next year. Insurers won't be allowed to enroll new customers into these extended policies, Obama said.Consumers should still examine the health insurance available on the exchanges to determine whether the new plans are better or less expensive than their current plans, or whether they qualify for financial assistance, Obama said. ""If you received one of these letters I'd encourage you to take a look at the marketplace,"" he said.Insurers will be required to disclose to customers that these new plans won't include the new consumer protections in the law and explain that alternatives are available on Obamacare's health insurance exchanges, and that tax credits to cut the cost of private insurance are only available on the exchanges. Insurance companies will also have to tell consumers that they may qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income people. State health insurance regulators are being asked to permit the administration's new policy.Health insurance companies ultimately will be responsible for deciding whether to carry out Obama's new policy, which puts the onus on them. ""The Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan,"" Obama said.The White House acknowledged this new policy could have a limited reach. ""It may not be taken by all insurance companies and by all state insurance commissioners,"" a senior White House official said during a conference call with reporters prior to Obama's remarks.This proposed solution would be problematic for health insurance companies that have already eliminated the current plans from their books of business and would have to recreate them. In addition, enabling a portion of the health insurance market to stay outside of the health insurance exchanges could cause future premiums to rise for those using the new marketplaces. If healthier people with lower medical expenses avoid the exchanges and purchase policies with less generous benefits, the exchanges would attract a relatively older and sicker population, the health insurance industry has warned.“Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,"" Karen Ignagni, CEO of the trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement.State regulators were also cool to Obama's proposal. ""This decision continues different rules for different policies and threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond,"" Jim Donelon, Louisiana's insurance commissioner and president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said in a press release. ""It is unclear how, as a practical matter, the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect.""Health insurance plans are being canceled next year because the Affordable Care Act includes a slew of benefit mandates and consumer protections at the heart of Obama's reform platform. Plans sold on the exchanges can't exclude people with pre-existing conditions, charge women higher rates than men, must cover at least 60 percent of a person's annual medical expenses, and can't impose annual or lifetime caps on coverage. In addition, exchange plans must cover a basic set of benefits that includes hospitalizations, prescription drugs and maternity care. Health insurance extended via Obama's new policy would not include those guarantees.""The old individual market was not working well. And it's important that we don't pretend that somehow that's a place worth going back to,"" Obama said. ""Too often it works fine as long as you stay healthy. It doesn't work well when you're sick.""Obama rejected legislative proposals akin to Upton's bill. ""I will not accept proposals that are just another brazen attempt to undermine or repeal the overall law and drag us back into a broken system.""White House officials visited Capitol Hill Thursday to meet with House and Senate Democrats to assure them that Obama is addressing issues with canceled policies and the broken website, and to urge them not to back legislative changes to the president's signature domestic policy achievement.Obama again addressed his oft-stated pledge that individuals would be able to keep their current insurance plans when his law was implemented, noting that the Affordable Care Act leaves in place the employer-sponsored health plans and government programs that cover more than 90 percent of insured Americans. But he acknowledged underestimating the law's effects on the remaining consumers.""We chose a path that was the least disruptive to try to finally make sure that health care is treated in this country like it is in every other advanced country, that it's not some privilege that just a certain portion of people can have,"" he said. ""There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate.""Only about 27,000 people chose a new health insurance plan using HealthCare.gov between Oct. 1 and Nov. 2, according to a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services Wednesday. About 79,000 people did so via the health insurance exchanges being operated by 15 states and the District of Columbia. Almost 400,000 individuals have been deemed newly eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.""In just one month, despite all the problems that we've seen with the website, more than 500,000 Americans could know the security of health care by Jan. 1, many of them for the first time in their lives,"" Obama said. ""Is that as high a number as we'd like? Absolutely not. But it does mean that people want affordable health care.""The White House maintains that HealthCare.gov will be functioning better by the end of this month and that enrollment via the exchanges will have substantially increased by the end of the sign-up period on March 31. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that 7 million people would use the exchanges to buy health insurance for 2014.""We should have done a better job getting that right on day one, not on day 28 or on day 40,"" Obama said.Obama restated his administration's aim to improve the website by the end of November, but stopped short of guaranteeing it would work perfectly. ""The website will work much better on Nov. 30, Dec. 1, than it worked certainly on Oct. 1. That's a pretty low bar,"" Obama said. ""It is not possible for me to guarantee that a hundred percent of the people a hundred percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience.""House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) expressed skepticism that the Affordable Care Act permits Obama to carry out the policy he unveiled Thursday. ""I'm highly skeptical they can do this administratively. I just don't see within the law their ability to do it,"" Boehner said during a press briefing.A senior White House official said the Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to allow health insurance plan extensions via the law's ""grandfathering"" provisions, which already enabled some plans to be continued if they hadn't been substantially changed since 2010, and via administrative discretion.Sabrina Siddiqui contributed reporting."

Even many Republicans believe Obama would never agree to sign a spending bill that removed funding for his signature domestic policy achievement.Cole disagrees with the idea of using a government shutdown threat to try to take aim at Obamacare but added, ""the frustration is how do you keep fighting it without taking an action that is counterproductive.""On the call, Boehner sketched out a plan in which Republicans would pass a short-term measure to fund the government until around December while insisting on keeping in place steep cuts in spending known as the ""sequester.""When Congress reconvenes on Sept. 9 after its summer break, Boehner said, ""Our intent is to move quickly on a short-term continuing resolution that keeps the government running and maintains current sequester spending levels.""Earlier on Thursday, about a third of the Republican caucus sent a letter to Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor urging them to oppose any annual spending bills that include funding for Obamacare.The letter was spearheaded by Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina and got the signatures of 80 House Republicans.During the call, one member asked Boehner, ""Can you at least announce that you want to defund Obamacare?"" Another asked Boehner how he would get a short-term spending measure passed, according to one person on the call.Congressional Republicans have sought repeatedly to repeal the law.While Republicans say the law will hurt job creation, supporters view it as a landmark initiative that will extend health insurance coverage to millions of Americans.In addition to the House lawmakers who signed the letter to Republican leaders, there is support for denying funds to Obamacare from prominent Republican senators including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida.During the five-week summer recess, Obamacare has been riling up constituents at town hall-style meeting in lawmakers' home districts, with both critics and supporters airing their views.Republican Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas told Reuters there was a ""large divide between Republican leaders in (Washington) D.C. and Republicans in the rest of the country.""Huelskamp, who participated in the call and agrees with using the government shutdown strategy on Obamacare, said Republican leaders were ignoring that divide ""at their own peril.""Republican leaders have been working to find alternative ways to weaken the health law.One idea under consideration is tying approval of an increase in the country's borrowing limit to agreement by the Obama administration to delay implementation of the measure.An aide to Cantor, the No. 2 House Republican, told Reuters on Wednesday that the debt limit was a good ""leverage point"" to try to force action on Obamacare."

It's true! For all we know, these are living organisms that endure excruciating nerve stimulation when exposed outside of the male reproductive system.There are those who would argue that we are regulating men's bodies and taking away their freedom to make their own healthcare choices, but as our conservative brethren have pointed out in many a debate on rape culture, men simply can't control their sexual urges on their own as per the landmark legal reasoning of ""boys will be boys."" Therefore, they need help and incentives.To that end, I am proposing a bill in the Texas Legislature that does the following:1. Ejaculation of semen outside of an active effort to procreate is banned. Some would make the case that we should allow exemptions for cases of rape, incest, or if the man's life is in danger, but this is all nonsense and doesn't correspond with our strong, Texas values. A life is a life. Just consider if our great governor Rick Perry had been ejaculated by his father during a self-pleasuring act.In the event Section 1 isn't passed, we should include further restrictions that make it incredibly difficult for men to masturbate without facing criminal prosecution:2. Men who masturbate must apply for a state permit, pay a $500 fee for that permit, undergo a transanal sonogram to view the internal route sperm must take to leave the male body, be counseled by a physician on the benefits of a celibate lifestyle, and view a two-hour video on the modern genocide that is male masturbation.3. Men who obtain masturbation permits are only permitted to do so in designated areas for such activities, specifically masturbation centers that receive licensing by the state.4. The state will be limited to a total of six masturbation centers in order to better monitor this activity, all of which will be placed at least 200 miles outside towns with populations greater than 20,000 residents. We must think of the children who could see a sign for one of these centers.5. Male members of the Texas Legislature are examples to all men everywhere and thus, should submit to daily external and internal swab samples when the Legislature is in session that will be analyzed for evidence that masturbation has occurred.6. In order to evaluate charges that unsanctioned masturbation has occurred by a male member of the Texas Legislature, a Committee to Understand Male Masturbation (CUMM) will be formed to determine if reported transgressions should result in the impeachment of investigated members.7. To avoid bias in these investigations, CUMM will be composed entirely of women in the Texas Legislature. All testimonies given on this subject will be limited to the approval of the committee.8. The Chairwoman of CUMM could hold a possible bias if she is heterosexual, and therefore, it is advised that she be a lesbian to avoid impropriety in oversight of this committee.We love men and believe they are the bedrock of the Texas family. We are only choosing to do what's best for them and avoid a breakdown in the societal order of this state.TWITTER: @cmclymer"

Chris Christie became the eighth Republican governor to back expanding Medicaid under President Barack Obama's health care reform law on Tuesday.Christie, a potential 2016 presidential contender who is up for reelection this year, defied conservative opponents of Obamacare by embracing one of its key components when he announced his plan to the Democratic-controlled state legislature in Trenton. So far, more than a dozen Republican governors, including Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Perry of Texas, have declared their opposition to the Medicaid expansion.""After considerable discussion and research, I have decided to participate in Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. While we already have one of the most expansive and generous Medicaid programs in the nation, including the second highest eligibility rate for children, we have an opportunity to ensure that an even greater number of New Jerseyans who are at or near the poverty line will have access to critical health services beginning in January of 2014,"" Christie said.Expanding Medicaid in New Jersey would provide new health care coverage to an estimated 291,000 people through 2022, according to an analysis released by the Urban Institute and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in November. New Jersey would spend an additional $1.5 billion and receive $15.4 billion from the federal government to finance the expansion during that time period, the report predicted.The health care reform law calls for Medicaid coverage to be available to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,282 for a single person this year. When the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare last year, it gave states the option to refuse the Medicaid expansion because the program is jointly funded by the federal and state governments. Other Republican governors, including Florida's Rick Scott and Ohio's John Kasich, also support the Medicaid expansion. Altogether, 25 states and the District of Columbia plan to broaden the program under the health care reform law beginning next year. Most of the new enrollees in states that expand are expected to be adults without children living at home, who were not previously covered by Medicaid.""These folks are consistently among those who need help the most -- men and women who have suffered trauma in their lives, live with mental illness, rely on New Jersey’s emergency rooms for primary health care, or those citizens who lack insurance or access to treatment in other ways,"" Christie said.The federal government will pay the full cost of insuring newly eligible people from 2014 through 2016 under the health care reform law expansion. That share declines over several years until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and beyond. For other people on Medicaid, such as children, pregnant women and people with disabilities, the federal government pays states an average of 57 percent of the expenses.The New Jersey Medicaid expansion actually would save the state $227 million in fiscal year 2014, Christie said. Some governors, like Jay Nixon of Missouri (D), expect to use new federal Medicaid funding to replace spending currently conducted by other state programs. Christie also echoed Kasich and other Republicans by noting his state's residents would pay federal taxes to finance Medicaid expansions in other states and not see benefits themselves if New Jersey doesn't participate.Christie has opposed the health care reform law and has expressed some hostility to the Medicaid expansion in the past. He likened the Medicaid provisions in the health care reform law to ""extortion"" during an appearance at the Brookings Institution in Washington in July. Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, states that defied the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare risked losing all their federal Medicaid dollars. ""I'm really glad that a majority of the Supreme Court still supports the notion, as a former prosecutor, that extortion is still illegal, even when done by the president of the United States,"" Politico reported Christie saying at the time.Christie also previously indicated that New Jersey's Medicaid program was broad enough. ""Medicaid is pretty well expanded in our state already because of the legacy of previous Democratic governors, and so I don't think there's a lot more for us to do in New Jersey in that regard,"" Christie said on Fox News Channel in July.New Jersey currently doesn't provide Medicaid benefits to childless adults, though it does offer less-generous coverage to poor adults with incomes below 23 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $2,643 for a single person this year. New Jersey does offer Medicaid to the parents of poor children and to pregnant women who earn up to 133 percent of poverty.Christie's Medicaid plan could provoke ire among conservatives who remain opposed to all aspects of Obamacare. Christie also angered some conservatives during the presidential campaign last year when he appeared with Obama and praised his handling of the response to Hurricane Sandy just days before Obama defeated GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Christie hasn't been invited to next month's Conservative Political Action Conference after being a featured speaker at the event last year.""I am no fan of the Affordable Care Act. I think it is wrong for New Jersey and for America. I fought against it and believe, in the long run, it will not achieve what it promises. However, it is now the law of the land and I will make all my judgments as governor based on what I believe is best for New Jersey,"" Christie said on Tuesday.Christie rejected another aspect of Obamacare when he twice vetoed bills passed by the Democratic-controlled state Legislature last year that would have established a state-run health insurance exchange. The exchanges will be websites where residents can comparison shop for coverage and learn whether they qualify for Medicaid or for tax credits to pay for private health insurance options that are available to people who earn between the poverty level, $11,490 for an individual this year, and four times that amount.WATCH:"

A new study has found that Corbett's decision might end up costing the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Expanding Medicaid in Pennsylvania would have increased the annual amount of money the state receives from the federal government by around $2 billion, adding about $200 million in state revenue every year, according to a new study by the RAND Corporation, the nation's largest independent health policy research program. The study's findings contradict remarks made by the governor during his budget address last month when he said that “without serious reforms, [Medicaid expansion] would be financially unsustainable for the taxpayers."" Medicaid expansion, which the Supreme Court ruled states could opt in or out of, would increase medical coverage to families that earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Many Republican governors have opposed the measure.Had Pennsylvania opted into Medicaid expansion, the state would have received around $6 billion in federal funding for health care programs in 2014, according to the study. That's $2 billion more than it will receive without expanding Medicaid. The increase in funding would have added 35,000 jobs and provided a $3 billion boost in economic activity, according to the study.“This is money that is coming into the state that wouldn’t otherwise,” RAND mathematician and lead study author Carter Price told The Huffington Post. “There are certainly substantive benefits, in that you have more people covered, more revenue coming in the state and more jobs.”But Price cautions that the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare will eventually come with a cost. Starting in 2017, the federal government will begin to pay less of the state costs of the expansion, causing Pennsylvania's revenue increases to decline over time. "

State health insurance regulators are being asked to permit the administration's new policy.Health insurance companies ultimately will be responsible for deciding whether to carry out Obama's new policy, which puts the onus on them. ""The Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan,"" Obama said.The White House acknowledged this new policy could have a limited reach. ""It may not be taken by all insurance companies and by all state insurance commissioners,"" a senior White House official said during a conference call with reporters prior to Obama's remarks.This proposed solution would be problematic for health insurance companies that have already eliminated the current plans from their books of business and would have to recreate them. In addition, enabling a portion of the health insurance market to stay outside of the health insurance exchanges could cause future premiums to rise for those using the new marketplaces. If healthier people with lower medical expenses avoid the exchanges and purchase policies with less generous benefits, the exchanges would attract a relatively older and sicker population, the health insurance industry has warned.“Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,"" Karen Ignagni, CEO of the trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement.State regulators were also cool to Obama's proposal. ""This decision continues different rules for different policies and threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond,"" Jim Donelon, Louisiana's insurance commissioner and president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said in a press release. ""It is unclear how, as a practical matter, the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect.""Health insurance plans are being canceled next year because the Affordable Care Act includes a slew of benefit mandates and consumer protections at the heart of Obama's reform platform. Plans sold on the exchanges can't exclude people with pre-existing conditions, charge women higher rates than men, must cover at least 60 percent of a person's annual medical expenses, and can't impose annual or lifetime caps on coverage. In addition, exchange plans must cover a basic set of benefits that includes hospitalizations, prescription drugs and maternity care. Health insurance extended via Obama's new policy would not include those guarantees.""The old individual market was not working well. And it's important that we don't pretend that somehow that's a place worth going back to,"" Obama said. ""Too often it works fine as long as you stay healthy. It doesn't work well when you're sick.""Obama rejected legislative proposals akin to Upton's bill. ""I will not accept proposals that are just another brazen attempt to undermine or repeal the overall law and drag us back into a broken system.""White House officials visited Capitol Hill Thursday to meet with House and Senate Democrats to assure them that Obama is addressing issues with canceled policies and the broken website, and to urge them not to back legislative changes to the president's signature domestic policy achievement.Obama again addressed his oft-stated pledge that individuals would be able to keep their current insurance plans when his law was implemented, noting that the Affordable Care Act leaves in place the employer-sponsored health plans and government programs that cover more than 90 percent of insured Americans. But he acknowledged underestimating the law's effects on the remaining consumers.""We chose a path that was the least disruptive to try to finally make sure that health care is treated in this country like it is in every other advanced country, that it's not some privilege that just a certain portion of people can have,"" he said. ""There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate.""Only about 27,000 people chose a new health insurance plan using HealthCare.gov between Oct. 1 and Nov. 2, according to a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services Wednesday. About 79,000 people did so via the health insurance exchanges being operated by 15 states and the District of Columbia. Almost 400,000 individuals have been deemed newly eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program.""In just one month, despite all the problems that we've seen with the website, more than 500,000 Americans could know the security of health care by Jan. 1, many of them for the first time in their lives,"" Obama said. ""Is that as high a number as we'd like? Absolutely not. But it does mean that people want affordable health care.""The White House maintains that HealthCare.gov will be functioning better by the end of this month and that enrollment via the exchanges will have substantially increased by the end of the sign-up period on March 31. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that 7 million people would use the exchanges to buy health insurance for 2014.""We should have done a better job getting that right on day one, not on day 28 or on day 40,"" Obama said.Obama restated his administration's aim to improve the website by the end of November, but stopped short of guaranteeing it would work perfectly. ""The website will work much better on Nov. 30, Dec. 1, than it worked certainly on Oct. 1. That's a pretty low bar,"" Obama said. ""It is not possible for me to guarantee that a hundred percent of the people a hundred percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience.""House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) expressed skepticism that the Affordable Care Act permits Obama to carry out the policy he unveiled Thursday. ""I'm highly skeptical they can do this administratively. I just don't see within the law their ability to do it,"" Boehner said during a press briefing.A senior White House official said the Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to allow health insurance plan extensions via the law's ""grandfathering"" provisions, which already enabled some plans to be continued if they hadn't been substantially changed since 2010, and via administrative discretion.Sabrina Siddiqui contributed reporting."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was bemoaning the ""defeatist attitude"" of his fellow Republican senators, his close ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) acknowledged Obamacare won't be defunded in a bill to keep the federal government open.The Kentucky Republican stood with Cruz in his all-night speech against Obamacare, but later on Wednesday Paul added his name to those who say the writing is on the wall.""I'm not saying we would get everything we want. We don't want to fund [Obamacare] at all, but I'm ready to admit we may not get that,"" Paul told reporters shortly after he voted to begin debate on the government funding bill passed by House Republicans last week. That bill would keep the federal government open beyond Sept. 30, but permanently strips the Affordable Care Act of its funding, as Cruz and his allies have demanded. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is expected to amend the measure to restore funding for the Affordable Care Act in the course of a subsequent procedural vote that requires a simple majority.Republicans, with 46 votes, could stop the bill during the procedural motion; but many of them oppose shutting down the federal government, especially since it wouldn't lead to the end of Obamacare, and the GOP is likely to bear the brunt of the blame.To Cruz, who spoke Wednesday on Rush Limbaugh's radio show, that stance shows that Republicans are ""beaten down.""""The single biggest surprise about arriving to the Senate is the defeatist attitude here,"" Cruz said.While Paul joined Cruz in his 21-hour talkathon -- which outlasted Paul's 13-hour talking filibuster earlier this year -- the senator from the Bluegrass State conceded Wednesday afternoon that the Senate should no longer delay sending a revised continuing resolution to the House GOP leaders, who will only have one day to pass the measure in order to avert a government shutdown.""We've spent a lot of time on this, and it's time to vote,"" Paul said. ""I think the sooner we're done with this, the better chance we have of not having the government shut down.""""I think it's presumptuous of me to tell the House what to do, but I think the goal of everybody should be to try to do something right and at the same time not shut down the government,"" Paul added.The Kentucky senator argued that Reid and President Barack Obama are pushing the country to the brink of a shutdown by refusing to compromise on the health care law, and called for a ""a discussion over how we could make the bill less bad.""""I think if you analyze this situation, this is us saying the bill has many problems. Even one of the authors of the bill says there's problems with the bill,"" Paul said. ""But if they're unwilling to revisit the bill and compromise on anything ... maybe some of you in the media ought to ask ... why are they shutting down the government in order to get everything they want?""Paul was among nearly a dozen Republican signatories on a letter distributed by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) in July that called on the conference to oppose any continuing resolution that included funding for Obamacare. In recent weeks, Cruz and Lee have insisted that any vote to advance the House-passed bill is a vote for Obamacare, because it would enable Reid to keep the health care law funded.Paul was hesitant to share that opinion.""I don't really want to characterize what I think the vote means,"" he said. ""I think that the Republican caucus has been united in its opposition to Obamacare.""""All I know is at this time, my conclusion is -- and apparently a lot of people's conclusion is -- we ought to get to the votes,"" Paul added later, as reporters continued to press him on Cruz's strategy. ""If we're going to send something to the House, I think get something over there sooner rather than later. That's always been my opinion.""He commended Cruz's speech, noting opposition to Obamacare has been a motivating issue for tea party and grassroots activists in the Republican Party.""I don't think you're finding many people out in the countryside or across the country saying, 'Oh, it's a bad idea to stand up to Obamacare,'"" Paul said. ""What makes it difficult is people really probably don't want to shut down the government, and I don't either ... so it is a difficult situation."""

But conservatives keep pushing votes on the issue because it's popular with their base. Cruz's statement on Wednesday was simply a tactical error: He admitted what his colleagues won't.Not all Senate Republicans signed up for a fight over Obamacare tied to a government shutdown. Several have gone on record to oppose or criticize the strategy of pushing to defund the law in exchange for keeping the government open. Even in the House, some rank-and-file Republicans like Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.) have been vocal critics of that move.But House Republican leaders were counting on Cruz to lead the fight in the Senate this time -- not to concede the game before it even began.

13404	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/25/obamacare-website-headaches_n_4161042.html	News	1	Healthcare	None	Negative	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"By Caroline HumerNEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Americans hitting roadblocks on the new U.S. government-run healthcare website have been contacting insurers directly and enrolling in plans away from the federal marketplace, representing a lost opportunity for President Barack Obama's landmark reform.Since its launch on Oct. 1, technical problems have stalled Healthcare.gov, the website meant to help millions of uninsured Americans sign up for coverage as part of the biggest U.S. social program since Medicare plans for the elderly launched in the 1960s.Nearly a dozen insurance companies offering plans on the exchange who were interviewed by Reuters say they have received at most a trickle of enrollments through the federal marketplace serving 36 states, some of them with errors that require the insurers to separately verify information about applicants.At the same time, consumer inquiries at insurance company call centers and websites are up, in some case even double the amount of normal traffic. When they hear from potential customers who appear to qualify for government subsidized plans, they take phone numbers, create shopping baskets for the plans they like and send them to Healthcare.gov to verify eligibility.But if the shoppers do not qualify for a subsidy, insurers say they sell them a plan directly. More often than not, those plans are individual policies that are not available on the government-run exchange. PHONES RINGING 'OFF THE HOOK'Health First Health Plans in Florida, one of nine insurers selling individual plans in the state through Healthcare.gov, has sold only a handful of exchange-based plans through the government marketplace.But its phones have been ringing ""off the hook"" since Oct. 1, said Jason Alford, director of individual and marketplace sales. Many of the sales are for plans that extend coverage from 2013 into 2014 and that do not include many of the government program's most significant benefit requirements.""We have begun taking a number of off-exchange applications,"" Alford said.A chain of five Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance plans, including BCBS of Texas and BCBS of Oklahoma, said it is also sending buyers who qualify for subsidies to the exchange, while those who do not qualify for subsidies have been buying off exchange plans more often.""I'm very hopeful that individuals will come back and purchase the product,"" said Kurt Kossen, vice president of retail at parent company Health Care Service Corp, referring to customers who get information about a plan but do not buy it on the spot.The move off exchanges is another way in which the Healthcare.gov problems may jeopardize the administration's efforts to sign up as many as 7 million Americans for coverage on the exchanges in their first year, including an estimated 2.7 million young and healthy members needed to make the system work financially.The administration and the contractors it has hired say they are working around the clock to fix the problems. The government said on Thursday that about 700,000 applications have been submitted so far for coverage through Healthcare.gov and 14 insurance exchanges run by states.The loss of potential customers could become more critical if the federal exchange is not fixed in time for an expected influx of enrollments by Dec. 15, the last day to sign up and have benefits available on Jan. 1.Dan Mendelson, Chief Executive Officer at Avalere Health, which has been tracking the exchanges closely, said although he expects the Healthcare.gov problems to be solved, ""There is a void right now and the void is being filled in many cases by insurers engaging directly with patients.""He said that ""ultimately there will be a modest uptick in the off-exchange products as a result of this."" WHITE HOUSE PROMISES FIXWhite House officials on Wednesday met with chief executives of 12 leading insurance companies, including Aetna Inc, Humana Inc and WellPoint Inc. The administration promised to fix problems with enrollment data sent to the health plans and address issues that have prevented insurers from directly enrolling consumers who are eligible for subsidies.For some small insurers selling only on the exchange, the technology issues have affected all of their business. Community First Health Plans in San Antonio, Texas said that it was still experiencing technical problems and that the volume of sales was small. Community Health Choice in Houston, Texas said sales from the federal exchange had been slow.""I see that every day the system is getting a little bit easier,"" said Daisy Morales, vice president of marketing and outreach.Some insurers are selling 2013 plans that extend into 2014 and do not have all the benefits required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly called ""Obamacare,"" making them less costly.As a result, a shift to off-exchange products could signal that more healthy consumers will not be part of the Obamacare exchanges.In the first year of the exchanges, insurers are reimbursed by the Obamacare risk adjustment program if they enroll very sick people. The more people in the pool, the lower the risk, and in the health insurance market, lower risk has meant more competition and lower premium prices.""I can't give you a magic number, but insurers need a big enough pool of risk,"" said Jay Angoff, a former official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who now works as a lawyer at Mehri & Skalet in Washington DC.Jefferies & Co analyst David Windley said that a weaker enrollment in Obamacare exchanges, with a final tally of a few million consumers, could mean the risk pool has a higher concentration of sick consumers.It would mean ""that the healthy ones tried and gave up (on enrollment) and the sick ones were the persistent ones that actually got through the process,"" Windley said.In 2014, risk adjustment payments would help cover any hit that insurers take because of the sicker population. After that, it could mean higher premiums and therefore more government spending per person on subsidies.WellPoint Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said in an interview that the company, which has the largest presence on exchanges among health insurers, is selling both exchange-based products and off-exchange products from its websites. It sends people eligible for subsidies to Healthcare.gov.""It messes the timing up a little, just because those off exchange can get in a little bit sooner,"" DeVeydt said. ""It doesn't change the outlook. None of these policies start until Jan. 1 anyway.""At the same time, WellPoint on Wednesday told investors it would not yet give a forecast for 2014 financial results due to uncertainty over how the Obamacare exchanges will work next year."

John Kasich (R) for his expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, Kasich dismissed the idea that he and Obama are ""BFF.""Appearing on Fox News' ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" Kasich was confronted by guest host Laura Ingraham for his state's participation in Medicaid expansion. Ingraham cracked that Kasich and Obama were becoming ""BFF"" and practically ""spooning"" together.""[I had] the chance to bring Ohio money back to Ohio to do some things that frankly needed to be done,"" Kasich said, citing treatment of the mentally ill and drug addicted, as well as providing insurance outlets for the working poor.""That being said, I have never been a supporter of Obamacare,"" Kasich added, citing his refusal to run a state exchange.Ingraham pressed back on that, saying that Medicaid expansion has been touted by Obama as a key success story within the government-run health care program. But she claimed that Obamacare is using money that the government doesn't have to spend, prompting the question of whether that was tricky to support as a conservative.“Conservatism means that you help people so they can help themselves, and that they can enter into the economic strength of our country,"" Kasich said. ""Now you have to separate that from the fact that the government was designing a program to take over our whole health care system in the back rooms on Capitol Hill.""Speaking Thursday at ArcelorMittal Cleveland Steel Factory in Ohio, Obama gave Kasich a shoutout for his role in helping Ohioans have better access to health insurance. I got to give your Governor a little bit of credit. John Kasich, along with a lot of state legislators who are here today, they expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. And think about that. Just that one step means as many as 275,000 Ohioans are going to have health insurance. And it doesn't depend on a website. That's already happening because of the Affordable Care Act.And I think it's fair to say that the Governor didn't do it because he just loves me so much. (Laughter.) We don't agree on much, but he saw, well, this makes sense -- why wouldn't we do this? Why wouldn't we make sure that hundreds of thousands of people right here in Ohio have some security? It was the right thing to do. And, by the way, if every Republican governor did what Kasich did here rather than play politics about it, you'd have another 5.4 million Americans who could get access to health care next year, regardless of what happens with the website. That's their decision not to do it. And it's the wrong decision. They've got to go ahead and sign folks up.CORRECTION: A headline elsewhere on The Huffington Post incorrectly identified the program expanded by Kasich as Medicare, not Medicaid. "

Jan Brewer said Monday in her State of the State address, making her the third Republican governor to agree to one of the key components of President Barack Obama's health care reform.Brewer said that if she did not accept the Medicaid funds for Arizona, other states could claim those federal dollars and create jobs that otherwise would be created in Arizona. Fellow Republican governors Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada also plan to expand Medicaid to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is currently $14,856 for an individual. But 10 other Republican governors have already decided not to participate. The Supreme Court's 2012 ruling that affirmed Obama's health care law allows states to refuse to take part in the Medicaid expansion.Although Brewer has been a consistent opponent of Obamacare, she acknowledged Monday that the law is now an unavoidable reality and that Arizona would be worse off turning down the federal dollars that will come with broadening Medicaid.""Try as we might, the law was upheld by the United States Supreme Court,"" Brewer said. ""The Affordable Care Act is not going anywhere, at least not for the time being.""The Arizona governor said the federal funding would help pay for some individuals already covered by the state's Medicaid program and provide some protection for the state's rural hospitals.While Arizona is moving ahead with the expansion of Medicaid, Brewer declined to take part in another key aspect of Obamacare. In November, she notified the Obama administration that Arizona would not establish a state-run health insurance exchange. These exchanges will be the gateways for individuals and small businesses to comparison shop for health benefits and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance or Medicaid coverage. Arizona is one of 25 states in which the federal government will have to set up the insurance exchange.In announcing her decision to lawmakers in Phoenix, Brewer emphasized her continued concern that the federal government may cut back on its share of financing the Medicaid expansion and said she would put plans in place to protect the state's budget. Under Obamacare, the federal government will pay the full cost of covering newly eligible individuals from 2014 to 2016, and then will scale back funding to 90 percent by 2022.""As I weighed this decision, I was troubled that a future president and Congress would reduce matching rates,"" Brewer said. ""Together with my team, I have crafted a plan that addresses both of those concerns and safeguards Arizona.""Brewer's plan includes what she described as a ""circuit breaker,"" which would automatically shrink the state's Medicaid program in the event that the federal government were to decrease funding. ""I will not allow Obamacare to become a bait and switch,"" she said. Brewer placed her decision on Medicaid in the context of the main economic development theme of her speech. She told lawmakers that she did not want to forfeit the federal funds to other states that have agreed to expansion, singling out such neighboring states as California and Colorado. She said that the Medicaid expansion, which she described as ""just slightly beyond"" what voters had previously approved, would insert $2 billion into the Arizona economy.She also promoted Arizona's Medicaid expansion plan as ""the gold standard"" for the nation. Brewer continued to emphasize her opposition to the Affordable Care Act but told legislators that the state could not oppose the federal government on all aspects of the health care law. ""We cannot wag our finger at the federal government,"" Brewer said, reminding lawmakers of her famous meeting on an airport tarmac with President Obama last year. ""Trust me, I tried that once.""Arizona House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told The Huffington Post that Democrats are ""encouraged"" by Brewer's decision. He said that the party still plans to look at the details of her Medicaid plan, but that what the governor outlined in her address was a good step for the state. Brewer and Campbell, a potential 2014 gubernatorial candidate, have had a frosty relationship over the past two years. Noting that the Medicaid expansion was pushed by the state's business community, along with Democrats and moderate Republicans, Campbell said he hopes that the governor is willing to work with them in a ""constructive fashion"" to pass the plan through the GOP-controlled legislature, which has been led by Tea Party loyalists.""The only people opposed to this is the ideological far right and the Tea Party,"" Campbell said. ""This is about economic development for the state. Rejecting this will destroy the hospital system."""

They may find they're not insured after all.HealthCare.gov, the federal online portal for health-insurance shopping in more than 30 states, has improved after more than a month of intense fixes, and enrollment is accelerating. But insurance companies are still getting information on their would-be customers that is garbled and incomplete, and in some cases they are getting no information at all. President Barack Obama's administration is scrambling to repair the faulty system, but scant time remains until the Dec. 23 deadline for consumers to choose a health plan that will be in place Jan. 1. The result could be an untold number of consumers remaining uninsured despite completing the enrollment process -- another embarrassing chapter in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health care reform law.The Obama administration insists the enrollment glitches will be fixed in time to prevent any troubles next month, but won't disclose the extent of the problem. Nor will it guarantee that any patients who fall victim to these problems won't be exposed to medical bills if they get sick or injured.""I doubt very seriously the insurance company or the government is going to say, 'Oh, don't worry, We'll take care of it.'

""I wouldn't count on anybody else jumping in and bailing everybody out.""In an unusual joint press release on Wednesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the largest national trade groups for insurers, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, emphasized their collaboration in addressing the problem. “Ensuring that all Americans who need coverage are properly enrolled is a top priority for all of us. We are working together closely to resolve back-end issues between health plans and HealthCare.gov,"" the statement said. ""We will report on our progress.”Insurance companies could smooth over difficulties during the first month of new coverage by paying the expenses of people who believed they were enrolled. But that would subject the companies to potentially big costs for patients who get expensive services without having yet paid a premium, or who may not be their customers at all.Moreover, insurers may be reluctant to bear the brunt of another technical failure after having already shouldered responsibility for fixing other Obamacare problems.Insurers grumbled last month after Obama asked them to renew health policies that had been canceled for not meeting Obamacare standards. The White House has also proposed that  insurers cover the cost of birth control for workers whose employers object on religious grounds. And the administration has delayed the launch of the payment system that will transfer government subsidies under Obamacare to insurance companies.""You'd be counting on the goodwill of the insurance company. I'm not sure how long that's going to last,"" said Leslie Norwalk, who was a senior official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President George W. Bush and is now strategic counsel at Epstein Becker Green in Washington.Patients who show up at a doctor's office, hospital, pharmacy or elsewhere without insurance cards in hand will have to rely on the kindness of those providers, Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington & Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Va., wrote in an email. ""It is likely that there will be problems, probably a lot of them, with confirming coverage, but providers are used to dealing with insurer screw-ups and hopefully will be patient,"" Jost wrote. HealthCare.gov users who go through the enrollment process to the end are prompted to connect with their new health insurance provider to make payments, which are due Dec. 31 for coverage that begins in January. Consumers who don't take action or believe they can wait for a bill from their insurance company could find themselves in the lurch next month, especially if the company has no record of their enrollment because of the technical problems.The White House says it is incumbent on individuals to double-check that they have coverage. ""If consumers are not sure if they are enrolled, they should call our customer call center or the insurer of their choice so that they can be sure they’re covered by Jan. 1,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday. The administration is reaching out by telephone and email to consumers who have begun or submitted applications via HealthCare.gov, in order to advise them of the steps they must take to confirm their enrollments.Insurance companies receive daily uploads of data about new enrollees. Despite progress since Obamacare marketplaces launched on Oct. 1, as many as one-third of enrollments submitted through the federal system contain errors, The Washington Post reported on Monday. The administration says that error rate isn't accurate, but won't reveal how many of the submissions -- called 834 forms -- are incorrect. The White House maintains that most of the problems have already been fixed and that the rest will be resolved in time to prevent hardships next month.The George W. Bush administration faced a similar dilemma in January 2006, when the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit launched. Enrollees across the country visited drugstores only to find their benefits weren't in place.""That was a point of crisis because every one of those became a story,"" said Michael Leavitt, who was Bush's secretary of Health and Human Services at the time.A frenzied effort to guarantee patients' access to medications followed, while the Bush administration worked to correct the technical bugs, said Leavitt, now chairman of Salt Lake City-based Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm that has advised states on ACA implementation. ""It became our problem with the system, not the consumer's problem,"" Leavitt said. The Obama administration likewise needs to protect patients, Leavitt said. ""The federal government caused this, and they're the ones who are going to have to take responsibility for it,"" he said. ""There's an obligation to make certain that people have not been seriously disadvantaged in their health by this."" Unlike during the Medicare Part D snafu, the Obama administration has no funding stream to tap to pay for medical expenses incurred by patients who encounter problems. Nevertheless, Leavitt predicted his successor, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, would take unilateral action to avoid a backlash, as the administration has on previous occasions.""The secretary of health does not lack authority in this situation,"" he said. ""I can't tell you the exact authority with which she would act, but you just look at the number of things they've already deferred and the way they've found flexibility, they're going find the authority.""HuffPost readers: Do you plan to try HealthCare.gov or a state-run health insurance exchange website in December?

Jan Brewer (R) through the state legislature on Thursday.Brewer, a conservative and avowed foe of President Barack Obama's health care reform law, announced her support for the Medicaid expansion in January, but faced stiff resistance from fellow Republicans in Arizona's House and Senate. During a marathon session that began Wednesday afternoon and stretched into the wee hours of Thursday morning before culminating in a final vote late Thursday afternoon, a handful of Republicans joined Democrats in the House and Senate to pass the Medicaid expansion.Although Obama's health care law continues to divide elected officials and the public along starkly partisan lines, Brewer is one of nine Republican governors who have bucked their party and embraced the Medicaid expansion. ""With landmark votes today in the House and Senate, legislators have tackled the issue that is Job One every session -- adoption of a responsible State budget -- and enacted Arizona’s most sweeping health care legislation in decades,"" Brewer said in a news release after the vote Thursday. ""It will extend cost-effective care to Arizona’s working poor, using the very tax dollars our citizens already pay to the federal government.""The Arizona governor aggressively promoted the Medicaid expansion since taking her surprising public stand earlier this year. Brewer assembled a coalition of health care interests and business groups and worked alongside Democratic legislators in addition to campaigning across the state in service of extending health coverage to hundreds of thousands of poor Arizonans using Obamacare funding.Brewer played hardball with Republican legislative leaders in the state to get her way, earning their ire in the process. She followed through on her threat to veto any bill not addressing the Medicaid expansion last month. On Tuesday, she raised the stakes by calling a special session and forcing the temporarily adjourned legislature back to work on Medicaid and the state's budget. Democratic lawmakers in both chambers unanimously voted for the Medicaid legislation. ""We have done truly the right thing for the people of this state,"" state Senate Minority Leader Leah Landrum Taylor said during the vote Thursday.Republican legislative leaders and conservative lawmakers have bristled at Brewer's embrace of the expansion, a key component of Obamacare, and objected to her calling a special session when the legislature was scheduled to reconvene later in the week anyway. ""I'm deeply and profoundly disappointed at the manner in which this came down,"" said Senate President Andy Biggs, before voting against the measure Thursday. Brewer won praise from conservatives for her hardline stance against illegal immigration, but she has attracted strong right-wing condemnation over Medicaid. ""This proposal is not a freebie for Arizona taxpayers,"" said state Sen. Nancy Barto, a Republican and the chairwoman of the health committee, on the floor Thursday. ""Here we are, once again, putting ourselves at the mercy of the federal government.""The political fallout from the split among Arizona Republicans won't have an immediate effect on Brewer's electoral future: She can't seek another four years as governor when her time runs out next year because of state term limits. She ascended from Arizona secretary of state to the governor's office when Obama tapped then-Gov. Janet Napolitano (D) to be his secretary of homeland security in 2009; voters reelected Brewer in 2010.Arizona is among the 29 states and the District of Columbia with chief executives who support expanding Medicaid under Obamacare to anyone who earns less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,282 for a single person this year. Majority-Republican legislatures in a number of states have stymied expansions endorsed by their governors, including Florida's Rick Scott (R), Ohio's John Kasich (R), Michigan's Rick Snyder (R), Missouri's Jay Nixon (D) and others.""This is a big deal because Arizona and Gov. Brewer are very conservative,"" said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy organization that supports the health care reform law. ""It shows that at least for this governor and this state, practicality and common sense has prevailed over ideology and partisanship,"" he said. ""This is a reflection of what we're going to see over time in many other states across the country.""But about a dozen Republican governors, including Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, remain opposed to broadening the program, citing opposition to Obama's health care law and the expense of the expansion. The Supreme Court ruling that upheld the law last year gave states the right to opt out of its Medicaid provisions.Under the law, the federal government will pay the full cost of the Medicaid expansion from 2014 through 2016, after which the federal share will gradually decline until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and beyond. Currently, the federal government covers an average of 57 percent of Medicaid costs and the states pay the remainder.States that refuse the expansion risk losing $8.4 billion in federal money and face $1 billion in new state spending on programs to compensate hospitals that treat people without health insurance, according to an analysis released last week by the Rand Corporation. About 3.4 million people who could have gained health coverage under Obamacare will remain uninsured next year because of states that won't expand the program, Avalere Health estimated.The uninsured rate in Arizona was 18 percent in 2011, when 1.2 million residents lacked health insurance, according to census data compiled by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.Unique factors affecting Arizona's Medicaid program, called the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System or AHCCCS, played a role in Brewer's decision to set aside her staunch opposition to Obamacare.In 2011, a federal court allowed Brewer to freeze enrollment of adults without children into Medicaid to resolve a budget crunch, which resulted in more than 140,000 fewer people on the program, according to Brewer. Accepting Obamacare's federally financed expansion enables Arizona to reopen Medicaid without having to pay about half the cost. This is why Brewer consistently refers to her Medicaid plan as a ""restoration"" of the program.Moreover, Arizona expanded Medicaid to cover all adults below the poverty line based on a ballot initiative approved by voters in 2000, which Brewer has cited as justification for participating in the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. In 1982, Arizona became the last state to join Medicaid, a program President Lyndon Johnson enacted in 1965. Arizona pioneered the use of private health insurance companies to administer the program, an approach since copied by nearly every state.This story has been updated with comment from Jan Brewer, Leah Landrum Taylor, Andy Biggs and Nancy Barto."

John Kasich (R) for his expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, Kasich dismissed the idea that he and Obama are ""BFF.""Appearing on Fox News' ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" Kasich was confronted by guest host Laura Ingraham for his state's participation in Medicaid expansion. Ingraham cracked that Kasich and Obama were becoming ""BFF"" and practically ""spooning"" together.""[I had] the chance to bring Ohio money back to Ohio to do some things that frankly needed to be done,"" Kasich said, citing treatment of the mentally ill and drug addicted, as well as providing insurance outlets for the working poor.""That being said, I have never been a supporter of Obamacare,"" Kasich added, citing his refusal to run a state exchange.Ingraham pressed back on that, saying that Medicaid expansion has been touted by Obama as a key success story within the government-run health care program. But she claimed that Obamacare is using money that the government doesn't have to spend, prompting the question of whether that was tricky to support as a conservative.“Conservatism means that you help people so they can help themselves, and that they can enter into the economic strength of our country,"" Kasich said. ""Now you have to separate that from the fact that the government was designing a program to take over our whole health care system in the back rooms on Capitol Hill.""Speaking Thursday at ArcelorMittal Cleveland Steel Factory in Ohio, Obama gave Kasich a shoutout for his role in helping Ohioans have better access to health insurance. I got to give your Governor a little bit of credit. John Kasich, along with a lot of state legislators who are here today, they expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. And think about that. Just that one step means as many as 275,000 Ohioans are going to have health insurance. And it doesn't depend on a website. That's already happening because of the Affordable Care Act.And I think it's fair to say that the Governor didn't do it because he just loves me so much. (Laughter.) We don't agree on much, but he saw, well, this makes sense -- why wouldn't we do this? Why wouldn't we make sure that hundreds of thousands of people right here in Ohio have some security? It was the right thing to do. And, by the way, if every Republican governor did what Kasich did here rather than play politics about it, you'd have another 5.4 million Americans who could get access to health care next year, regardless of what happens with the website. That's their decision not to do it. And it's the wrong decision. They've got to go ahead and sign folks up.CORRECTION: A headline elsewhere on The Huffington Post incorrectly identified the program expanded by Kasich as Medicare, not Medicaid. "

It would also repeal a tax on medical devices that helps finance the health care law.The measure would allow employers and insurers to opt out of providing health care services that they find morally or religiously objectionable. The addition reignites the debate over a portion of the health care reform law that requires most insurers to cover women's preventative health care, including contraception. CNN reports that the provision would allow them to opt out of coverage for the next year.A House Republican leadership aide confirmed to HuffPost that the provision was added into the one-year delay of Obamacare during a House Rules Committee meeting on Saturday evening. Planned Parenthood Federation of America Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens called the move ""desperate, misguided, and extreme"" in a statement. ""The country wants Congress to focus on jobs and the economy, not on pushing an extreme agenda against birth control,"" said Laguens. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) didn't know Republicans had added the provision into the bill, even as the House was already debating the rule for bringing it up.""They did?"" Becerra asked, during a Saturday night interview with The Huffington Post. ""What part of their social agenda will they not stick into a budget bill?""Becerra called it ""absurd"" that an abortion-related provision found its way into the bill at the last minute. ""We're less than three days from watching [Republicans] lead to a government shutdown. Now they want to reignite the war on women?"" he asked. ""It makes for theater, and that's what it is.

That could create another headache for the administration starting in January, if the enrollments for some who sign up for coverage via the website are not finalized before their coverage is supposed to begin.""The real challenges remain, and that's downstream,"" said Rick Howard, research director for the technology consultant Gartner. ""The real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is.""The administration said that in meetings with insurers and healthcare officials this week, it will refocus attention efforts to nail down functions for handling insurance payments, including federal subsidies for low-income consumers buying coverage under Obamacare.Without those functions working properly, HealthCare.gov and websites for 14 state-run marketplaces could have difficulty operating in 2014.At the White House on Monday, Obama spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that ""the work is not done"" on the website.Carney added that the waiting page that some visitors saw was created in part because officials knew that Monday would put a strain on the system.""We absolutely anticipated that on this day in particular, because it is the first workday after the deadline we set ... to make sure that the website was functioning effectively for the vast majority of users, we would see a surge in visitors,"" Carney said. ENCOURAGING NUMBERSFor the White House and supporters of Obamacare, the encouraging news on Monday was that the pace of enrollments in healthcare programs has increased dramatically since Oct. 1, when the administration's enthusiastic launch of HealthCare.gov was quickly tempered by problems with the website that allowed few people to enroll.Preliminary government data indicated that about 100,000 people chose a health plan through HealthCare.gov during November, as officials and tech specialists scrambled to improve the site's capacity, according to a source familiar with the issue. In October, only about 27,000 had enrolled via the site.The federally run HealthCare.gov site handles enrollments for 36 states. The 14 other states and Washington, D.C., have their own exchanges under Obamacare. The state-run exchanges have had fewer technical problems and generally are in states that are most enthusiastic about Obamacare, so their enrollments figures have been relatively high, including 80,000 in California and 50,000 in New York.Official November data will be released in two weeks. But if the November estimate for HealthCare.gov enrollments is correct, it means at least 290,000 people have signed up for private insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.That is still far short of the administration's projection in September that nearly 500,000 people would sign up through the insurance marketplaces in the first month, according to documents obtained by congressional investigators.Ultimately, 7 million Americans were expected to sign up for private health insurance offered through the online marketplaces for 2014, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).The website's issues have put that goal in doubt, and administration officials have begun playing down the importance of getting 7 million enrollees in Obamacare for 2014. On Monday, Carney emphasized that the CBO, not the White House, that produced that estimate for total enrollment.

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said Tuesday that she and several of her Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives are considering suing President Barack Obama for allowing plans canceled under the Affordable Care Act to be extended through 2014. According to Politico, Bachmann, speaking at an event sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, accused the president of violating the constitutional separation of powers by changing the health care law through administrative means, rather than consulting Congress. ""That's the essence of lawlessness and now it's our time to defend our prerogative,"" she said.When asked about the lawsuit by MinnPost, Bachmann's office said a lawsuit was not imminent, but was under discussion. ""She and some of her colleagues have had discussions about the best recourse to put a stop to his unconstitutional actions,"" a spokesman said in a statement.Last week, facing backlash over plan cancellations under the health care law, Obama asked insurers to let individuals whose plans had been cancelled to renew their plans another year. ""Insurers can extend current plans that otherwise would be canceled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan,"" Obama said. ""This fix won't solve every problem for every person, but it's going to help a lot of people. Doing more would require work with Congress.""The White House later offered legal justification for Obama's fix to the Washington Post's Greg Sargent. “The Supreme Court held more than 25 years ago that agencies charged with administering statues have inherent authority to exercise discretion to ensure that their statutes are enforced in a manner that achieves statutory goals and are consistent with other administrative policies,"" a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said.

Novitas has numerous contracts with CMS, including to administer doctor and hospital claims in the federal Medicare program for elderly Americans.The problem-plagued HealthCare.gov is being worked on by contractors racing to fix it by the end of November so that people can enroll in insurance plans for 2014 under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The law aims to provide health care insurance to millions of uninsured people. OBAMA ASKED FOR FEWER 'NO-BID' CONTRACTSFederal agencies are normally required to solicit bids for work, so as to get the best deal for taxpayers, but can award a contract to a favored company in emergencies as long as they document the urgency.A few weeks after taking office in 2009, Obama issued a memorandum to government agency heads ordering them to minimize the use of non-competitive contracts, calling them potentially ""wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse.""The procurement documents made clear how crucial the financial functions on the healthcare portal are. If payments were not made on time and accurately, CMS said, ""operation of the Marketplace and the Affordable Care Act will certainly be jeopardized.""Financial management includes such functions as transmitting premium payments to insurers. Building that capability into the Obamacare marketplace ""is already minimally two months overdue,"" according to the August documents.Just a few weeks before the financial-management contract was awarded, according to emails released last week by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, CMS officials were becoming increasingly concerned about the status of the federal insurance marketplace, asking for assurance that the lead contractor was not ""going to crash the plane at take-off.""On Tuesday, CMS's deputy chief information officer, Henry Chao, author of the ""crash"" email, told a congressional panel that 30 to 40 percent of the federal marketplace was still under construction.Invisible to consumers are what Chao called the ""back office systems."" Those include accounting and payment systems to send premiums to insurers and transfer funds to insurers that attract more than their share of customers with high medical costs.The no-bid contract awarded to Novitas includes these systems. Novitas is a subsidiary of Diversified Service Options, which is wholly-owned by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida .Asked about how Novitas was awarded the contract and the work it is doing, Florida Blue spokesman Mark Wright said a company official told him, ""We're not going to be able to get into this right now.""Chao told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that CMS and its contractors had focused on building HealthCare.gov so it could launch on Oct. 1, postponing construction of ""the financial management aspects of the system.""The lead contractor on HealthCare.gov, the U.S. subsidiary of Canada's CGI Group Inc, is also involved in building the financial management piece of the marketplace, a company official said.The construction ""is a bigger problem than people realize,"" said Robert Booz, a vice-president and healthcare specialist at technology consultant Gartner.""Everyone recognizes it's going to be a problem in January,"" he said, referring to financial management. In the worst case, if financial records are wrong, then people who have signed up for, and paid a monthly premium for, insurance may be told incorrectly that they are not covered.

The site was back up on Monday.Republicans have seized on the troubled website to further attack Obamacare and question whether administration officials hid problems before the launch. They are expected to press Tavenner on testimony she gave in August, when she said work was on track to roll out a tested website that would make it easy for Americans to enroll for insurance.Tavenner said in her testimony for Tuesday that an ""initial wave of interest stressed the account service, resulting in many consumers experiencing difficulty signing up, while those who were able to sign up sometimes had problems logging in.""She also placed some blame on the contractors helping to build and maintain the website, saying a subset of them ""have not met expectations."" She did not name the contractors.A ""new infusion of talent"" has been brought in and experts are working aggressively to diagnose the parts that are still experiencing problems, Tavenner said. They are continuing to add capacity, and more people are creating accounts, she said.""We are pleased with these quick improvements, but we know there is still significant, additional work to be done,"" she said.Tavenner's testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee marks the second congressional hearing to examine the problems with the program's rollout. Last week, contractors who worked on the site told a different panel that the administration launched it after only a minimum of system-wide testing.Tavenner, 62, was confirmed for her job by the Senate in May. She had been optimistic about the rollout when questioned by lawmakers about it in April and again in August.She is appearing before Congress one day before her boss, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, testifies to Congress on the same subject.With Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients saying Healthcare.gov should be fixed by the end of November, experts say the administration could lose the interest of healthy younger adults aged 18-35 for whom the website was seen as a major avenue for enrollment.On Monday, the White House issued a report promoting the program for young people. Based partly on Census data, it said 46 percent of young adults who live alone in 34 states could get health coverage for $50 a month or less under Obamacare.Republicans in Congress have introduced a flurry of legislation they say is aimed at protecting the public from the problem-plagued rollout.Senators Marco Rubio and Jerry Moran have a bill to delay - until six months after the troubled Healthcare.gov is fully functioning - the mandate requiring most Americans to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty.Fred Upton, the Republican chair of the House, Energy and Commerce Committee, has also produced a bill allowing insurers to maintain existing health plans in 2014 outside the new online health insurance exchanges - even if they do not meet the benefit standards of Obamacare."

But state Rep. Bette Grande (R-Fargo) proposed to kill the grant to keep Planned Parenthood out of teen sex education in North Dakota, even though the family planning provider does not operate any clinics in the state. ""They're not a part of how we do business in this state,"" Grande said of Planned Parenthood in January after the sex ed program was announced. ""It is an overt abortion industry that we don't want to be a part of.""Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, told reporters on Monday that North Dakota is the first state ever to go after a sex education program that is fully funded by the federal government. ""This is incredibly unusual,"" she said. ""No state has tried to block a comprehensive sex education program like this, ever."" Arkansas lawmakers, meanwhile, are considering a bill that would prevent public funds from flowing to any entity that provides or refers for abortions, which would effectively end an HIV and STI prevention program that Planned Parenthood administers through a state grant.And Texas state Sen. Ken Paxton (R-McKinney) proposed a bill in March that would prevent Planned Parenthood from providing sex education materials to Texas students because the family planning provider has an inherent ""conflict of interest."" Nash told HuffPost that most states have been moving away from abstinence-only education and toward comprehensive sex education programs over the past decade because the U.S. has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the developed world. Research has shown that such programs delay sexual debut, reduce number of partners and increase contraceptive use among teenagers. But since 2011, several conservative-leaning states have been trending in the opposite direction.""This could be the start of something,"" Nash said. ""For a couple of years, we've been dealing with attempts to defund Planned Parenthood in the sense of prohibiting state funds to go to Planned Parenthood for the purposes of providing family planning, but now we're seeing that potentially expand to these sex education programs that give teens the information they need to prevent pregnancy."" Twenty states currently require abstinence-only education in public schools where sex education is taught, including North Dakota and Arkansas. Texas law stresses abstinence education in public schools, but also includes information about condoms. Dr. John Santelli, a pediatrician and professor at Columbia University's School of Public Health, told reporters in a conference call on Monday that the medical profession and public health communities are united in the belief that comprehensive sex education programs are the best way to combat the country's soaring teen pregnancy rate. ""Unfortunately, this is an area where there's more heat than light sometimes, and political interference is all too common,"" he said. ""We broadly support comprehensive sex education and feel strongly that these programs should be left to health professionals and not politicians."" "

Her Republican colleagues, who control the state legislature, are staunch opponents of the law, and Gov. Nathan Deal is one of 20 GOP governors who rejected the Medicaid expansion.That alone would seem like enough for state Rep. Abrams and her Democratic colleagues to tackle, but it doesn't end there. Last month, U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall, another Georgia Republican, chaired a congressional oversight hearing in Gainesville during which a handful of cherry-picked witnesses spoke only of being harmed by the health care law.Georgia is also home to Ralph Hudgens, the Republican state insurance commissioner who drew sharp criticism this week when a camera caught him likening pre-existing conditions to a car wreck in which the driver is at fault. Hudgens also bragged to a crowd of fellow Republicans in August about GOP efforts to destroy the law.""Let me tell you what we’re doing [about Obamacare]: everything in our power to be an obstructionist,"" Hudgens said. But despite the litany of obstacles facing Obamacare in her state, Abrams said that Georgians are ""hungry for information"" on what the law means for them and how they can sign up. She has made it her mission to bring that directly to them, by leading events explaining the Affordable Care Act to people across Georgia, many of whom have spent decades waiting for access to health insurance.""What we have is that people are hungry for information. They desperately want to know what's going on,"" Abrams told The Huffington Post in an interview Thursday. ""They want to know how this impacts them because they realize, whether they're Democrat or Republican, they are going to be held accountable for getting health insurance."" ""But even more importantly, they want it,"" she added. ""A lot of the communities we're speaking to have been denied access to health care either because of cost or because of pre-existing conditions or because they didn't have an option.""Since August, Abrams and her colleagues have reached out to discuss Obamacare on 40 occasions, from town hall meetings to teleconferences. Unlike most local events with state legislators, Abrams said empty seats are hard to come by at the Obamacare forums, prompting her to extend the activities through January.""A big part of it is how we frame it. There isn't the hostility to us sharing this information,"" she said, noting that their primary objective is to arm individuals with information about the law, not to discuss its politics.A typical event consists of legislators translating the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, down to such basics as explaining deductibles and co-pays to individuals who have never had health insurance before. Now that the functionality of Healthcare.gov has improved, Abrams and her team have launched ""Enrollment Saturdays"" for people to come in and access both the technology and the human navigators who can help them sign up on the health care exchange. States such as Texas and California have adopted similar outreach tactics, underscoring how critical on-the-ground operations are to meeting the law's primary objective of expanding coverage to the uninsured. Abrams conceded the problems that plagued the Obamacare rollout over the last couple of months, including the website glitches and the news of canceled policies, left people disappointed and ""didn't help matters at all."" She and her colleagues spent a great deal of time in their early events directing constituents to the telephone hotline rather than the website, but added that the struggles haven't dissuaded people from wanting to sign up.""People get sick and they want to get care,"" she said. ""The challenges with the rollout did not change what for some people has been a 10-, 20- or 30-year wait to actually have access to health care. This is a miracle for them.""Early data for November has shown a surge in the number of enrollments, although the White House is still lagging behind its target of 7 million by the March 31, 2014, deadline.As part of ongoing efforts to boost enrollment, the administration gathered state legislators from across the country Wednesday for a briefing on the Obamacare exchanges. Abrams was in attendance and shared her story, which was met with loud applause, according to a senior administration official. The White House meeting also focused on the law's Medicaid expansion, which Georgia Gov. Deal refused on the grounds that his state can't afford it -- even though his decision will cost Georgia nearly $3 billion in lost funding by 2022. Supporters of the law point out that the federal government will cover the entire cost of the expansion from 2014 through 2016, after which the federal share declines until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and future years.A study released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, titled ""Nobody Wins,"" detailed the impact on states where governors rejected the Medicaid expansion. ""There are no states where the taxpayers would actually gain by not expanding Medicaid,"" Sherry Glied, lead author on the study, told USA Today.Georgia falls into the category of states whose residents are most in need of the Medicaid expansion. An estimated additional 410,000 would qualify in Georgia, where gaps in coverage abound.Financial pressures in states where Medicaid wasn't expanded have also put many public hospitals at risk, including as many as 15 facilities in Georgia. Just this year, hospitals in Folkston, Richland and Arlington, three of the state's rural towns, permanently closed their doors. Abrams hopes such events will put public pressure on Gov. Deal to reverse his decision. ""If we say no to the Medicaid expansion, we are saying yes to shutting down our hospitals,"" she said."

On New York, as a result of our analysis, we reluctantly came to the conclusion to withdraw,"" Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said.The New York decision comes as states finalize the roster of health plans that will be offered to millions of uninsured Americans beginning on Oct. 1.Aetna and its newly acquired Coventry Health unit, a low-cost provider that caters to individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries and provides private Medicare policies, still have applications to sell coverage in 10 states, based on publicly available information.Michener said the full list of state exchanges where Aetna will participate is still being finalized.The new online insurance exchanges are the lynchpin of Obama's healthcare reform, representing a massive technology build-out that has run up against multiple delays and political opposition in many states. In their first year, the exchanges aim to provide coverage to 7 million uninsured Americans, many of whom will be eligible for government subsidies.Aetna's large competitors, such as UnitedHealth Group Inc and WellPoint Inc, have also planned limited entries into the new exchanges while they wait and see whether they operate smoothly and whether enough healthy people sign on to offset the costs of sicker new members.""We've got this period where the exchange experience, the exchange sentiment, and news headlines are probably not going to be very flattering and that's not going to have a positive impact on turnout,"" said Jefferies & Co analyst David Windley.""Longer-term, those kinks will get ironed out, more people will get comfortable and in (the next few years) more people will be accessing their health insurance through an exchange of some sort,"" he said.'RISK-BASED APPROACH'Aetna signaled last month that it was considering withdrawing some applications because of its purchase of Coventry, which also had filed documents to sell insurance plans on exchanges around the country.""We have taken a prudent risk-based approach to both our overall exposure and exposure within a given marketplace,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on a conference call with analysts at the time.Since then, it has withdrawn applications in Maryland, Ohio, Georgia, and Connecticut, where it is based. In Maryland, Aetna's decision came after state regulators ordered the company to lower rates dramatically from what it had proposed.Aetna also has filed applications in Florida, Arizona and Virginia, where the federal government will operate the exchanges, and in Washington, D.C., which is running its own exchange.Coventry filed applications to sell insurance in Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, according to those states' insurance departments. Iowa is working with the government on its exchanges while the rest are being run entirely by the federal government.Coventry withdrew its applications in Georgia and Maryland when Aetna bowed out but it remains in Ohio. It also withdrew earlier this month from Tennessee.Aetna and Coventry may also have filed plans in other states that have not released any information about participants.Insurance plans in the 33 states that have defaulted to the federal government exchanges must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and then insurers sign off on them. Earlier this week, HHS delayed the sign-off deadline to mid-September after originally aiming for early next month.Michener said the company will continue to serve small business and large business customers in New York and will offer products to individual consumers outside of the exchanges.Only 17,000 or so people in New York currently buy individual insurance, but the exchange is expected to bring in 1 million people during the first three years. The exchange announced insurance participants on Aug. 20. Aetna was not on the list."

The development also comes just days before HealthCare.gov, the online portal for individual and family health coverage in more than 30 states, is supposed to be working better after its troubled first two months.Small businesses that want to utilize the federally run SHOP exchanges, and the tax credits worth up to half the cost of insurance that are available to some firms, will have to sign up through an insurance agent or broker or directly with a health insurance company, an administration official explained via email. In an attempt to mitigate the failure of the online application and enrollment process that was supposed to be in place, small businesses can submit their applications for tax credits whenever they file their taxes rather than in advance, the official wrote.“This new delay announcement is a disappointment but not a surprise. Small businesses continue to be low on the priority list during the Obamacare implementation process,"" Kevin Kuhlman, manager of legislative affairs at the National Federation of Independent Business, said in a written statement. ""The continued delays add to uncertainty and contribute to the decision of many owners to take early renewals of their small-group plans.” The National Federation of Independent Business opposed the Affordable Care Act and was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, which the Supreme Court ultimately upheld.The administration previously said online enrollment on the SHOP exchanges would be available by the end of this month, following earlier delays. Prior to Wednesday's announcement that the administration would facilitate enrollment via insurers, agents and brokers, paper applications were the only means small companies could employ to utilize the SHOP exchanges. Maryland also delayed its state-run SHOP exchange, though other states' exchanges are operational. The federal government is operating SHOP exchanges in more than 30 states, and the remainder are being run by states.""Small businesses will able to enroll directly into a SHOP plan through an insurer, agent or broker, and get can certified for a tax credit after they enroll. We will also offer an improved comparison shopping feature online so small businesses can choose a plan before enrolling in one,"" Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday.Unlike the federal- and state-run health insurance exchanges for individuals and families that limit sign-up to a certain period during the year, the SHOP exchanges are supposed to allow companies to enroll workers at any time. Still, companies with current benefits that expire at the end of the year have until just Dec. 23 to choose a health plan that will be in effect on Jan. 1, the official wrote.The delay of the SHOP exchanges is partly a byproduct of the administration's scramble to get HealthCare.gov reliably working for individual consumers, Bataille indicated. ""It was important for us to prioritize the functionality that would enable consumers, individually, to shop and enroll online in coverage,"" she said.Online enrollment won't be possible on the SHOP exchanges until next year for benefits that will be available in 2015, the administration said.Earlier this year, the administration delayed another key component of the SHOP exchanges. Under health care reform, small business employees were supposed to be able to choose among any of the plans available on the exchanges. For 2014, employers will select the coverage for all workers instead.This post has been updated with additional information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."
13764	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/30/obama-health-care-reform_n_4361679.html	News	1	Healthcare	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Contrary to the cliché, there are second acts in politics. They just don’t usually come two months after the first.  On Nov. 30, the Obama administration will have a second chance to showcase its capacity to administer a website and oversee health care reform. Senior officials in the administration are quick to insist that the date is merely a point on a calendar, not a moment when a switch is suddenly flipped and all the problems surrounding Obamacare disappear.  But as a political matter, they also understand the scrutiny that comes after Nov. 30 will be heightened, and the stakes a bit higher. More than one administration official over the course of reporting this article said they fully expect that the first time a consumer encounters an error message on the website on Dec. 1, it will be used as a cudgel by the critics. Senate aides, meanwhile, say it's unclear how long a leash up-for-reelection Democrats would give the president should problems persist. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) may not be able to keep legislation reforming the Affordable Care Act off the floor absent major, tangible improvements. And so, as they enter , White House aides and ideological allies are taking steps to avoid repeating the disastrous first one. ""We are better prepared because the site is a better site,"" said one senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss post-Nov. 30 plans. ""We have visibility into the site, what’s happening with it, how many consumers are coming. It is vastly improved. It will allow us to adapt our tactics and tools to reach consumers in real time. And now, people all across the country have enrolled and we will continue to make sure their stories are told. It is different when you have lots of people enrolled as opposed to day one, when you had some people trying to enroll and who were stuck."" On a technological level, the administration is far ahead of where it stood on Oct. 1 -- an important but hardly remarkable feat considering how bad things were two months ago. Medicare spokeswoman Julie Bataille said that as of the end of November, approximately 50,000 users will be able to use HealthCare.gov concurrently, which will be the equivalent of more than 800,000 during a day. If user interest exceeds those numbers, the administration has set up “a customer-friendly queuing system which would notify you when to come back to the site and sort of be first in line,” Jeff Zients, President Barack Obama’s point man for rebuilding the website, told reporters in a Tuesday roundtable.The White House also hired a general contractor to set up a command center in Columbia, Md., that functions as a 24/7 monitoring and incident response team. The center, which is staffed by 25 people with different areas of expertise in web technology, will work with the White House to troubleshoot and react to incidents that may occur on healthcare.gov, in real-time. The better the website works, the logic goes, the easier it will be to manage the politics. But even so, the White House is also making administrative adjustments to HealthCare.gov in order to avoid a repeat the agony of those early October days. One (perhaps the only) unforeseen benefit of the website's disastrous rollout was that interest didn't wane as much as expected over the course of October. In addition to the stream of consumers looking to buy insurance, people wanted to see what the fuss was about -- like drivers who can't help looking at the car wreck across the freeway. So the administrators of the site got a healthy sense of when traffic peaks (around lunchtime) and when it lulls (the weekend). Looking forward, that data will allow them to help keep the number of visits to the site relatively steady.Hoping to manage Nov. 30th expectations, the administration has already told private insurers to hold back on advertising the exchanges, worrying that heavy traffic could overwhelm the servers. Allies in the progressive community, meanwhile, say they've been told to wait for word from the administration before sending out sign-up alerts to their email lists. Already, there has been evidence of some success in micromanaging the traffic flow. According to a 39-page “recess toolkit” put together by the White House for Democrats on the Hill, which was shared by an aide with The Huffington Post, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services was able to invite back, in clusters, nearly 275,000 consumers who had problems during the account creation process in early October. Of those who returned to the site, 92 percent successfully created an account on HealthCare.gov. Another Democratic Hill aide said the White House is expected to step up its consumer education and outreach in early December, particularly focusing on the 18-to-35-year-old demographic. Next week, for instance, the White House is planning a youth summit to ensure that young leaders understand the benefits of the health care law and help get the word out among their peers. That comes on top of the administration’s ongoing efforts to enlist athletes and celebrities to engage with youth on the law’s benefits.The White House is also trying to make it easier for Democratic lawmakers to go on offense this time around. In addition to the sending them home for the Thanksgiving recess with a 54-page packet of Affordable Care Act sign-up “success stories,” broken down by all 50 states, administration officials are encouraging Democrats to talk about a new report released by the White House Council of Economic Advisors showing how Obamacare is helping to slow health care costs, in turn helping the economy.Despite these steps, Democrats in and out of office have a hard time evincing much confidence that the political troubles caused by health care reform will dissipate quickly. Some are hopeful but not yet sold that the administration can successfully manage the next few months after being stunned by the ineptitude they exhibited around the website's launch. ""The website is getting better but it's not fixed,"" said one Democratic lawmaker. ""Don't even get me started on talking points. They should use the time they spend writing useless talking points fixing the website."" Even the administration acknowledges that success on Dec. 1 means that the website will function for some 80 percent of users. And with 20 percent still in the dark, critical focus will continue -- a scary proposition for many Democrats. One party operative who works on health care reform said that it remains a mystery as to how to respond to accusations that the president misled the public when he pledged that people could keep their insurance plans if they liked them. ""If there are good talking points around that, I haven't heard them,"" the operative said. Several other operatives, when interviewed for this piece, marveled at how the administration ""lost"" traditional media allies during the October rollout. Winning them back has proven difficult, though the White House is far better prepared for the media wars now than it was on Oct. 1. A Democratic aide familiar with White House strategy said the administration has given assurances that it will have a beefed-up, rapid-response operation to address new attacks or incorrect stories. They certainly have more manpower.   ""You have to remember what happened on Oct. 1,"" said the health care reform operative. ""There was a government shutdown. All the people who would have been part of the rapid response team were furloughed. That lasted for 16 days.""During the early weeks of October, nearly all the White House staffers chiefly responsible for pushing back against bad press and spreading good health care news were off the job. Eric Schultz, a White press official who worked during the shutdown and has health care reform under his portfolio, was so preoccupied with the shutdown that he was seen running the president's remarks to the podium -- a task usually reserved for a junior staffer. ""The shutdown wasn’t the root cause of the problem,"" commented one administration official, ""but it sure as hell didn’t help.""

Chris Christie became the eighth Republican governor to back expanding Medicaid under President Barack Obama's health care reform law on Tuesday.Christie, a potential 2016 presidential contender who is up for reelection this year, defied conservative opponents of Obamacare by embracing one of its key components when he announced his plan to the Democratic-controlled state legislature in Trenton. So far, more than a dozen Republican governors, including Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Perry of Texas, have declared their opposition to the Medicaid expansion.""After considerable discussion and research, I have decided to participate in Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. While we already have one of the most expansive and generous Medicaid programs in the nation, including the second highest eligibility rate for children, we have an opportunity to ensure that an even greater number of New Jerseyans who are at or near the poverty line will have access to critical health services beginning in January of 2014,"" Christie said.Expanding Medicaid in New Jersey would provide new health care coverage to an estimated 291,000 people through 2022, according to an analysis released by the Urban Institute and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in November. New Jersey would spend an additional $1.5 billion and receive $15.4 billion from the federal government to finance the expansion during that time period, the report predicted.The health care reform law calls for Medicaid coverage to be available to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,282 for a single person this year. When the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare last year, it gave states the option to refuse the Medicaid expansion because the program is jointly funded by the federal and state governments. Other Republican governors, including Florida's Rick Scott and Ohio's John Kasich, also support the Medicaid expansion. Altogether, 25 states and the District of Columbia plan to broaden the program under the health care reform law beginning next year. Most of the new enrollees in states that expand are expected to be adults without children living at home, who were not previously covered by Medicaid.""These folks are consistently among those who need help the most -- men and women who have suffered trauma in their lives, live with mental illness, rely on New Jersey’s emergency rooms for primary health care, or those citizens who lack insurance or access to treatment in other ways,"" Christie said.The federal government will pay the full cost of insuring newly eligible people from 2014 through 2016 under the health care reform law expansion. That share declines over several years until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and beyond. For other people on Medicaid, such as children, pregnant women and people with disabilities, the federal government pays states an average of 57 percent of the expenses.The New Jersey Medicaid expansion actually would save the state $227 million in fiscal year 2014, Christie said. Some governors, like Jay Nixon of Missouri (D), expect to use new federal Medicaid funding to replace spending currently conducted by other state programs. Christie also echoed Kasich and other Republicans by noting his state's residents would pay federal taxes to finance Medicaid expansions in other states and not see benefits themselves if New Jersey doesn't participate.Christie has opposed the health care reform law and has expressed some hostility to the Medicaid expansion in the past. He likened the Medicaid provisions in the health care reform law to ""extortion"" during an appearance at the Brookings Institution in Washington in July. Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, states that defied the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare risked losing all their federal Medicaid dollars. ""I'm really glad that a majority of the Supreme Court still supports the notion, as a former prosecutor, that extortion is still illegal, even when done by the president of the United States,"" Politico reported Christie saying at the time.Christie also previously indicated that New Jersey's Medicaid program was broad enough. ""Medicaid is pretty well expanded in our state already because of the legacy of previous Democratic governors, and so I don't think there's a lot more for us to do in New Jersey in that regard,"" Christie said on Fox News Channel in July.New Jersey currently doesn't provide Medicaid benefits to childless adults, though it does offer less-generous coverage to poor adults with incomes below 23 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $2,643 for a single person this year. New Jersey does offer Medicaid to the parents of poor children and to pregnant women who earn up to 133 percent of poverty.Christie's Medicaid plan could provoke ire among conservatives who remain opposed to all aspects of Obamacare. Christie also angered some conservatives during the presidential campaign last year when he appeared with Obama and praised his handling of the response to Hurricane Sandy just days before Obama defeated GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Christie hasn't been invited to next month's Conservative Political Action Conference after being a featured speaker at the event last year.""I am no fan of the Affordable Care Act. I think it is wrong for New Jersey and for America. I fought against it and believe, in the long run, it will not achieve what it promises. However, it is now the law of the land and I will make all my judgments as governor based on what I believe is best for New Jersey,"" Christie said on Tuesday.Christie rejected another aspect of Obamacare when he twice vetoed bills passed by the Democratic-controlled state Legislature last year that would have established a state-run health insurance exchange. The exchanges will be websites where residents can comparison shop for coverage and learn whether they qualify for Medicaid or for tax credits to pay for private health insurance options that are available to people who earn between the poverty level, $11,490 for an individual this year, and four times that amount.WATCH:"

In a letter thanking ABC News, Robach said that her cancer spread to her sentinel lymph node and another malignant tumor was found during surgery. Although she still has more treatment to complete, the ABC News reporter said that she would be returning to work on Monday, December 2nd.In the letter, Robach said that since her initial diagnosis she has received an ""outpouring of support"" from her co-workers with everything from emails to flowers to medical advice. ""Physically and emotionally I have been through the ringer, but I am emerging on the other side so much stronger,"" Robach wrote. ""I have a greater appreciation for life, for health and for how such simple acts of kindness can be so incredibly powerful. I am looking through a different lens now…and I am thankful for that as well. There was my life before October 30th and now my life after.""Read the full letter below:Happy Friday Everyone!It may be cold and gloomy outside today but it is warm and sunny in my world. This message is long overdue…it has been weighing heavily on me how much gratitude I owe each and every one of you. The unbelievable outpouring of support from ABC began from the first moment I received my diagnosis. Phone calls, emails, cards, flowers, blankets, care packages, food, pajamas, slippers, help with insurance, medical advice….The list goes on and on…It was truly overwhelming how many of you thought of everything anyone could possibly want or need during a time of medical crisis. It brought so many tears of joy to my eyes and warmed my heart more than you’ll ever know to see what my ABC family did for me and for my entire family. In fact, there have been so many emails, it may take me weeks to get back to each and every one of you!Physically and emotionally I have been through the ringer, but I am emerging on the other side so much stronger. I have a greater appreciation for life, for health and for how such simple acts of kindness can be so incredibly powerful. I am looking through a different lens now…and I am thankful for that as well. There was my life before October 30th and now my life after.My prognosis is good, I got very lucky finding the cancer through our ABC sponsored mammogram and I got lucky choosing an aggressive approach, bilateral mastectomy, because while in surgery last week my surgeon found a second, undetected malignant tumor. No MRI, no mammogram, no sonogram had found it…it was only through the mastectomy that she discovered it. My cancer had spread to my sentinel lymph node, but not beyond, so I will have more treatments ahead of me, but none that will take me out of work. As of right now, I plan to head back into the building Monday, December 2nd and I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work.Your support and love has made this all an experience that has given me the strength to fight the fear and hopefully help others do the same in the days/weeks/years to come!With much love,Amy"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ended his symbolic filibuster Wednesday as Senate rules forced him to stop talking. Senators then voted to push ahead with the bill to fund the government that the Texan and his allies had tried to stall all night long.Cruz quit at noon to a smattering of Republican applause, ceding the floor at the technical start of a new legislative day after holding forth for more than 21 hours. He could have spoken longer, but had to stop for good at 1 p.m. for a vote to proceed with debate on the spending bill.The Senate voted unanimously to do so, including Cruz.Cruz is trying to block the spending bill, already passed by the House last week, even though it contains the provisions he requested to defund President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Money to keep the government open runs out Sept. 30, and Cruz is seeking to block the bill because he doesn't want Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to have the opportunity to amend the measure.The Texas senator has pointed to the next procedural vote in the process on Friday or Saturday -- to end debate -- as the key one in the fight. After that, Reid would be able to amend the bill with just 51 votes.But killing the legislation in the Senate would guarantee a government shutdown, and senators on both sides of the aisle would prefer to move the spending portion quickly, in hopes of leaving enough time to work out some sort of deal with the House.Still, Cruz, aided by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and several other senators, talked through the night, hoping to stall the process.Cruz spoke at seemingly infinite length, comparing his desire to defund Obamacare to the battle against the Nazis, the American Revolution, and other moments that he said were similar in that people said some fight couldn't be won.He resorted to many well-worn talking points against the health care law, and also sprinkled in the sorts of odd references that can crop up when someone talks for so long, reading Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters via C-Span, claiming that his dad invented that dish, and even channeling Darth Vader in response to a line from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).""I will confess that that phrase, a 'rebellion against oppression,' conjured up to me the rebel alliance fighting against the empire, the empire being the Washington, D.C., establishment,"" Cruz said on Wednesday morning. ""I wondered if at some point we were going to see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forth and say in a deep voice, 'Mike Lee, I am your father.'""""This is a fight to restore freedom to the people,"" he added, completing the analogy. ""This is a fight to get the Washington establishment -- the empire -- to listen to the people.""Cruz's talkathon would have constituted the fourth longest filibuster in modern history, but Democrats have been calling it a ""faux filibuster"" because it had no chance to stop the vote, which was already determined under the chamber's rules.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) emerged shortly after Cruz yielded the floor to commend the Texas senator for holding the floor ""for nearly a day, speaking passionately about an issue that unites every single Republican.""But McConnell had been noticeably absent from Cruz's talkathon after stating Tuesday that he disagreed with his colleague's approach, which he said would put House Republicans in a ""tough spot.""The biggest opposition to Cruz's tactics came from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has butted heads with the junior senator all year. In a lengthy floor speech ahead of the vote, McCain dubbed Cruz's marathon a case of ""extended oratory.""""I can't call it a filibuster because filibusters delay passage of legislation,"" McCain said.He added that Obamacare was ""a major issue in the [2012] campaign.""""I campaigned all over America for two months everywhere I could, and in every single campaign rally I said, 'And we have to repeal and replace Obamacare,'"" McCain said. ""Well, the people spoke. They spoke, much to my dismay, but they spoke and they reelected the president of the United States.""""Now, that doesn't mean that we give up our efforts to try to repeal and replace Obamacare, but it does mean that elections have consequences,"" he added."

Kelly wanted to know whether the White House had known that some policies would be canceled. Kelly and Emanuel disagreed over the number of people who are affected, and Emanuel argued that insurance companies had ""always canceled policies"" even before Obamacare.

""The website that was supposed to do this all in a seamless way has had way more glitches than I think are acceptable,"" Obama said during a Tuesday interview with KCCI television in Des Moines, Iowa. But the administration won't disclose exactly what's wrong with the health insurance exchange website, or when consumers can expect to see the promise of convenient, one-stop shopping for health benefits and financial assistance fulfilled.Time remains for these problems to be resolved, but not much. ""If things aren't resolved in three weeks, we've got some serious, serious problems,"" said Timothy Jost, a law professor and health care reform expert at Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Va., and an Obamacare supporter. ""I don't think we're anywhere close to there yet, but if the whole thing collapses, it'll be another generation before we get this problem fixed.""The White House vowed to fix the problem and said people are managing to sign up for health care. ""The website is unacceptable, but we're working to improve it and the product is good,"" said White House official Tara McGuinness. ""Across the country people today are getting access to affordable care. We're going to work intensely for the next six months to make sure we meet the demand. We're going to make affordable health care accessible through the website, through the phone, in communities across the country, and with in-person assistance.""The stakes are high for uninsured people, individuals and families who buy their health insurance directly and the entire health care industry. Without a functioning health insurance exchange, many people too sick or too poor to get health insurance under the old rules will remain shut out of the system. The millions of Americans who already buy their own insurance will face major disruptions. Health insurance companies could experience a nightmare scenario where the bulk of the individuals who brave the frustrating sign-up process are those who are sick, desperate for coverage and expensive to treat.And anyone who isn't able to get coverage because of the exchanges' problems could confront the prospect of tax penalties through no fault of their own.For Obama and the Democrats who've stood behind Obamacare during four years of relentless attacks from Republicans -- including a face-off that led to a 16-day government shutdown and a threat of U.S. default -- failure of this magnitude would discredit a core premise of this presidency, that government can do big things to improve Americans' lives.Although there are signs of incremental improvement, HealthCare.gov is unable to reliably allow consumers to create accounts, verify their identifies, apply for tax credits available to low- and middle-income people or shop for health insurance plans. Insurers are receiving bad enrollment data and states are reporting difficulties in accessing the federal system.The administration won't say how many people have signed up so far, but its reported goal of enrolling 500,000 people this month appears difficult to reach. Some thousands of dogged shoppers appear to have signed up for plans on the federal health insurance exchanges, also called marketplaces. But others have become discouraged, and traffic to HealthCare.gov has waned, according to one independent analysis. People working to help consumers are using paper applications for financial assistance that eventually will have to be entered into the computer system.If the administration does succeed in getting the website in working order in the coming weeks, the system will be strained by a backlog of pending applications and a crush of consumers frantically trying to get their coverage in place before the new year.Consumers have until Dec. 15 to choose a plan for Jan. 1, and until Feb. 15 to avoid being hit with tax penalties for violating the law's mandate that individuals obtain health insurance. The 2014 enrollment period ends March 31. The administration insists it's doing everything it can to get HealthCare.gov into shape. In states operating their own health insurance exchanges, a small but growing number of people are signing up.""We really do need to get this thing resolved pretty quickly. And then, of course, the longer you wait to resolve it, the more you have piling up for the last minute with the risk of another crash,"" Jost said. Robert Laszewski, a health care industry consultant, is skeptical that the health insurance exchanges' information technology failings can be mitigated in time to prevent chaos. ""The fix might be to take it down and start over,"" he said. ""I don't know what the best-case scenario for these guys fixing this thing is, but it's got to be two or three weeks, minimum.""The urgency is underscored not only by the fact that the low-income Americans and the 48 million uninsured -- those whom the law was primarily intended to benefit -- won't get the help they were promised. There's also the plight of those who currently have coverage they bought themselves that now has to be replaced, said Laszewski, who is president of Alexandria, Va.-based Health Policy and Strategy Associates. That represents about 3.6 percent of the population, according to census data.Many health insurance products currently on the market don't meet Obamacare's benefit standards and consumer protections so they are being discontinued. Consumers with these plans are the most likely to see rate increases next year, especially if they earn too much to get tax credits. ""They've got to convert to a new policy -- no ifs, ands or buts about it,"" Laszewski said.And while people who currently pay for their own health insurance are likely to do whatever they can to remain covered, buying a plan directly from an insurance carrier or using a private online broker isn't what Obamacare promised, and tax-credit subsidies aren't available without the federal system. Moreover, these private companies aren't prepared to deal with millions of customers who were supposed to be using the government marketplace, Laszewski said. Under these circumstances, the lion's share of the people who do whatever is necessary to sign up through HealthCare.gov are likely to be the sickest and most expensive to cover because they have the greatest need, Laszewski said. That would make the pool of people covered very costly, causing health insurers to lose money and likely rethink whether they want to participate in the exchanges, he said. ""The fundamental threat to Obamacare is we don't get enough healthy people in the pool to keep the rates reasonable, and they are in grave danger of that problem,"" he said. If these problems persist longer -- weeks, months, a whole year -- the entire Obamacare project falls apart, Laszewski said: ""It's a holy shit moment.""This article has been updated to include White House comments."

Speaking to a local conservative radio station called ""Z Politics,"" Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) discussed his Small Business Fairness In ObamaCare Act, which would exempt small businesses from the requirement that companies with over 50 full-time workers provide health insurance. Kingston's legislation obviously falls far short of fully repealing Obamacare, which many conservatives insist should be the main goal. But Kingston said such a focus was not the best path. ""And there’s some criticism, 'Well, are you helping improve this law when you make that change? And should we be doing that?'"" Kingston said, referring to pushback against his bill. ""A lot of conservatives say, 'Nah, let’s just step back and let this thing fall to pieces on its own.' But I don’t think that’s always the responsible thing to do.""""I think we need to be looking for things that improve health care overall for all of us,"" he added. ""And if there was something in Obamacare, we need to know about it.""Listen:Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford told the Hill, which first picked up Crawford's comments, that the congressman was pushing for a replacement to Obamacare.""He essentially said that we don't just need to wait for Obamacare to die under its own weight, we need to be looking for solutions that would replace it,"" Crawford said.Kingston has also repeatedly voted to defund Obamacare.Kingston is running against seven other Republicans in the primary to replace the retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), and the winner is expected to face Michelle Nunn, the leading contender on the Democratic side, in the general election. An October survey by the Democratic Public Policy Polling found Nunn tied with with a generic Republican opponent.Kingston's position is notable because his primary opponents have staked out positions far more to the right. On Monday, Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.), for example, posted an op-ed on the conservative site Breitbart titled, ""Stop Wasting Time Trying To Fix Obamacare."" ""Obamacare is simply not fixable, and Congress must stop wasting time passing bills which keep Obamacare in place,"" wrote Broun.Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.) has promised to ""help repeal Obamacare in my first term, or go home"" and not run for reelection.While every Republican seems to want to repeal Obamacare, there is no consensus on what should go in its place. Making sure people have health insurance is expensive and disruptive, and Republicans don't have much appetite for taking up that battle. ""If you think about it, it would be in the interest of conservatives who believe in the magic of markets to make this system work,"" wrote Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""If it can be demonstrated that real competition in a real marketplace offers good services at lower overall costs, that adds powerful ammunition to the case for free markets. Let’s face it: The unrelenting opposition to all parts of the law ... is far more about Barack Obama than it is about the structure and nature of the Affordable Care Act."""

On New York, as a result of our analysis, we reluctantly came to the conclusion to withdraw,"" Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said.The New York decision comes as states finalize the roster of health plans that will be offered to millions of uninsured Americans beginning on Oct. 1.Aetna and its newly acquired Coventry Health unit, a low-cost provider that caters to individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries and provides private Medicare policies, still have applications to sell coverage in 10 states, based on publicly available information.Michener said the full list of state exchanges where Aetna will participate is still being finalized.The new online insurance exchanges are the lynchpin of Obama's healthcare reform, representing a massive technology build-out that has run up against multiple delays and political opposition in many states. In their first year, the exchanges aim to provide coverage to 7 million uninsured Americans, many of whom will be eligible for government subsidies.Aetna's large competitors, such as UnitedHealth Group Inc and WellPoint Inc, have also planned limited entries into the new exchanges while they wait and see whether they operate smoothly and whether enough healthy people sign on to offset the costs of sicker new members.""We've got this period where the exchange experience, the exchange sentiment, and news headlines are probably not going to be very flattering and that's not going to have a positive impact on turnout,"" said Jefferies & Co analyst David Windley.""Longer-term, those kinks will get ironed out, more people will get comfortable and in (the next few years) more people will be accessing their health insurance through an exchange of some sort,"" he said.'RISK-BASED APPROACH'Aetna signaled last month that it was considering withdrawing some applications because of its purchase of Coventry, which also had filed documents to sell insurance plans on exchanges around the country.""We have taken a prudent risk-based approach to both our overall exposure and exposure within a given marketplace,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on a conference call with analysts at the time.Since then, it has withdrawn applications in Maryland, Ohio, Georgia, and Connecticut, where it is based. In Maryland, Aetna's decision came after state regulators ordered the company to lower rates dramatically from what it had proposed.Aetna also has filed applications in Florida, Arizona and Virginia, where the federal government will operate the exchanges, and in Washington, D.C., which is running its own exchange.Coventry filed applications to sell insurance in Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, according to those states' insurance departments. Iowa is working with the government on its exchanges while the rest are being run entirely by the federal government.Coventry withdrew its applications in Georgia and Maryland when Aetna bowed out but it remains in Ohio. It also withdrew earlier this month from Tennessee.Aetna and Coventry may also have filed plans in other states that have not released any information about participants.Insurance plans in the 33 states that have defaulted to the federal government exchanges must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and then insurers sign off on them. Earlier this week, HHS delayed the sign-off deadline to mid-September after originally aiming for early next month.Michener said the company will continue to serve small business and large business customers in New York and will offer products to individual consumers outside of the exchanges.Only 17,000 or so people in New York currently buy individual insurance, but the exchange is expected to bring in 1 million people during the first three years. The exchange announced insurance participants on Aug. 20. Aetna was not on the list."

Republicans are pursuing ""a narrow ideological agenda ... and pushing the government towards shutdown,"" it said.The Senate is not scheduled to meet until mid-afternoon on Monday, 10 hours before a shutdown would begin, and even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage in the fast-approaching end game. If so, a House GOP rank and file that includes numerous tea party allies would soon have to choose between triggering the first partial shutdown in nearly two decades – or coming away empty-handed from their latest confrontation with Obama.Undeterred, House Republicans pressed ahead with their latest attempt to squeeze a concession from the White House in exchange for letting the government open for business normally on Tuesday. ""Obamacare is based on a limitless government, bureaucratic arrogance and a disregard of a will of the people,"" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind.Another Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa of California, reacted angrily when asked whether he would eventually support a standalone spending bill if needed to prevent a shutdown. ""How dare you presume a failure? How dare you? How dare you?"" he said.Apart from its impact on the health care law, the legislation that House Republicans decided to back would assure routine funding for government agencies through Dec. 15. Under House rules, the measure went to the Senate after lawmakers voted 248-174 to repeal the medical tax, then 231-192 for the one-year delay in Obamacare.A companion measure headed for approval assures U.S. troops are paid in the event of a shutdown.The government spending measure marked something of a reduction in demands by House Republicans, who passed legislation several days ago that would permanently strip the health care law of money while providing funding for the government.It also contained significant concessions from a party that long has criticized the health care law for imposing numerous government mandates on industry, in some cases far exceeding what Republicans have been willing to support in the past. Acknowledging as much, Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said that as a conservative he had often found during Obama's presidency that his choice was ""between something bad or (something) horrible.""GOP aides said that under the legislation headed toward a vote, most portions of the health law that already have gone into effect would remain unchanged. That includes requirements for insurance companies to guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions and to require children to be covered on their parents' plans until age 26. It would not change a part of the law that reduces costs for seniors with high prescription drug expenses.One exception would give insurers or others the right not to provide abortion coverage, based on religious or moral objections.The measure would delay implementation of a requirement for all individuals to purchase coverage or face a penalty, and of a separate feature of the law that will create marketplaces where individuals can shop for coverage from private insurers.By repealing the medical device tax, the GOP measure also would raise deficits – an irony for a party that won the House majority in 2010 by pledging to get the nation's finances under control.The Senate rejected the most recent House-passed anti-shutdown bill on a party-line vote of 54-44 Friday, insisting on a straightforward continuation in government funding without health care-related add-ons.That left the next step up to the House – with time to avert a partial shutdown growing ever shorter.For a moment at least, the revised House proposal papered over a simmering dispute between Speaker John Boehner and the rest of the leadership, and tea party conservatives who have been more militant about abolishing the health law that all Republican lawmakers oppose.It was unclear whether members of the rank and file had consulted with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has become the face of the ""Defund Obamacare"" campaign that tea party organizations are promoting and using as a fundraising tool.In debate on the House floor, Republicans adamantly rejected charges that they seek a government shutdown, and said their goal is to spare the nation from the effects of a law they said would cost jobs and reduce the quality of care. The law is an ""attack and an assault on the free enterprise and the free economy,"" said Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas.Democrats disagreed vociferously. ""House Republicans are shutting down the government. They're doing it intentionally. They're doing it on purpose,"" said Rep. Donna Edwards of Maryland, as Republican lawmakers booed from their seats on the floor.In the Senate, there was little doubt that Reid had the votes to block a one-year delay in the health care program widely known as ""Obamacare."" He said the same was true for the repeal of the medical device tax, even though 33 Democrats joined all Senate Republicans in supporting repeal on a nonbinding vote earlier in the year.The 2.3 percent tax, which took effect in January, is imposed on items such as pacemakers and CT scan machines; eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and other items are exempt. Repealing it would cost the government an estimated $29 billion over the coming decade.If lawmakers miss the approaching deadline, a wide range of federal programs would be affected, from the national parks to the Pentagon.Some critical services such patrolling the borders, inspecting meat and controlling air traffic would continue. Social Security benefits would be sent and the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals.The new health insurance exchanges would open Tuesday, a development that's lent urgency to the drive to use a normally routine stopgap spending bill to gut implementation of the law. ___Associated Press writer Alan Fram and radio reporter Gerry Bodlander contributed to this report."

House Bill 845, sponsored by Rep. Charles Van Zant (R-Keystone Heights), would make it a third-degree felony in Florida to perform an abortion based on the race or gender of the fetus. In his closing statements on Thursday, Van Zant accused Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers of intentionally targeting black people. ""The fact is, 80 percent of abortion clinics nationwide are located in minority neighborhoods where 43 percent of all black babies are aborted,"" Van Zant said, according to the Tampa Bay Times.""In America alone, without the Nazi Holocaust, without the Ku Klux Klan, Planned Parenthood and other abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973,"" he said. ""This is called discriminatory targeting."" Several black lawmakers became insulted during the debate, and at least five women walked out. Rep. Barbara Watson (D-Miami), one of the members who left, told HuffPost in a phone interview that she felt as if Van Zant was manipulating information to reflect his personal beliefs about abortion. ""I don't appreciate anyone trying to explain what any other ethnic group's lifestyle is and what they do, when you really don't have any authority to interpret it,"" she said. ""I think the women and people of color in that chamber deserve an apology from him, but I don't know that it would actually change his point of view."" Rep. Darryl Rouson (D-St. Petersburg) said he felt the bills' sponsors were disingenuous in their mission to save the black population from abortion. ""If these representatives truly care about even the subject matter of black genocide, I've got a few bills they could file,"" he said. ""That's what got me upset. They could have talked about the bill and its intent without trying to use black genocide and black babies to sway a vote.""Van Zant was not immediately available for comment. Anti-abortion activists have long accused Planned Parenthood of targeting African Americans, but a 2011 fact-check by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research organization, showed that only 9 percent of abortion clinics are located in predominantly black neighborhoods, while 63 percent of clinics are in non-Hispanic white neighborhoods. While black women have a disproportionately high abortion rate compared to other ethnic groups, Guttmacher research shows that could be attributed to higher rates of poverty among black women and the fact that 69 percent of pregnancies among black women are unintended, compared with 40 percent of pregnancies among whites. Florida representatives passed the anti-abortion bill after a long, fiery debate on Thursday by a vote 71-44, sending it to the state Senate. Rouson said that bill cosponsor Rep. Keith Perry (R-Gainesville) wrote him a personal letter after the vote to apologize for offending him. Rouson said he hopes the legislature can focus on something else now. ""I've been up here five sessions now, and every last one we're dealing with abortion bills,"" he said. ""You would think we could deal with some women's rights issues or things of great governmental concern, other than every year coming back and trying to do something with abortion.""UPDATE: 6:10 p.m. -- Rep. Keith Perry acknowledged in a phone interview with HuffPost on Friday that he did send an apology letter to Rouson out of a concern that he had offended him. But Perry said he stands by the comments he made on the House floor. ""What I did was speak some facts about percentages of abortion that are performed, and the ratios [for black women] far exceed the norm of the population,"" he said. ""And I'm not saying the facts are wrong, because they weren't, but the way it was presented, it certainly offended [members of the black caucus].""Perry added, ""The concern is whether or not there's a strategic marketing approach by people who provide abortions to target certain groups. I don't know if they do or not, but there's a concern that some people may share."""

For starters, the effort has elicited something long missing on the part of this president -- some spine.Ever since he stepped into the Rose Garden on October 1 to warn the Republicans that he simply wasn't prepared to negotiate while the government was shut down and default on the debt was threatened, we've seen a much tougher Obama. The split in the Republicans, meanwhile, continues to widen, with an ever-increasing backlash among party professionals against the nihilism of Ted Cruz and company. Poor John Boehner tacks back and forth between frantically trying to hold his coalition together and signaling that he'd be willing to suspend the Hastert Rule and allow pragmatic Republicans vote with Democrats to keep the government open.Public opinion seems to be moving against the Republicans. The question is no longer whether they will continue their suicidal gambit but when they will cave and on what terms.Weirdly, by threatening to shut the government unless Obama killed the Affordable Care act, they got the opposite of what they sought. The rest of the government is closed, and Obamacare is open for business.And, while Republicans and movement conservatives have spent the better part of a year demonizing Obama's health reform, the more people become familiar with it, the more people will appreciate it -- leaving the Republican alarmism with no clothes. In that regard, the president and his strategists would do well to change one core piece of their rhetoric. In his Rose Garden remarks, the president said this:Now, of course, if you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, you don't need to do a thing. You're already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law. But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance, this opportunity is life-changing. In fact, that's profoundly wrong, and weakens the president's case. The statistically accurate contention that 85 percent of people will have no change in their insurance is a throwback to the early days of the health reform debate, when focus groups suggested that people who had employer-provided insurance and liked it needed to be reassured.But a lot has changed since then. Employer coverage is eroding. People who lose jobs or change jobs typically lose their insurance. COBRA protection paid entirely by the former worker is only a temporary and largely unaffordable stopgap.The fact is that the Affordable Care Act helps a lot more the 15 percent of the population. Young adults with no employer-provided insurance (and their parents) already know how valuable Obamacare is, for allowing people under age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance. People without jobs and at risk of losing jobs are also coming to value the Affordable Care Act.There is an analogy here with the revolution in broad acceptance of sexual diversity. As more and more gays and lesbians came out, straight people were initially shocked, then surprisingly accepting, as they realized that they had a friend, co-worker, neighbor, or family member who turned out to be gay.As more and more people sign up for affordable insurance thanks to Obama Care, many Americans who have insurance (and many who are worried about losing it) will hear heart-rending firsthand stories about friends, colleagues and relatives with medical worries, who finally get insurance. That coalition is a lot more than 15 percent.Many of these people, incidentally, are in red states, where the percentage of the uninsured tends to be far higher than the national average. In several such states, Republican governors have broken ranks and signed their states up for the provision of the Affordable Care Act that has the Federal government finance nearly all the costs of expanded Medicaid.No wonder the Republicans are so desperate to kill Obamacare in utero. The more it takes effect, the more their hysteria will be proven to be a phony. By 2014, when the Republican House majority will present itself for re-election, the Affordable Care Act could be quite popular. What then?President Obama, increasingly, finds himself in the chips. Let's see if this time he can resist the impulse to fold a winning hand.  Robert Kuttner's new book is Debtors' Prison: The Politics of Austerity Versus Possibility.

Kaiser Family foundation estimates. Enrollment via the insurance exchanges began Oct. 1, but has been hampered by the failed launch of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal to the marketplaces in more than 30 states, and technical problems affecting several of the state-run exchanges.Residents of five states -- Texas, California, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania -- represent more than 40 percent of the people who would qualify for tax credits across the country, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. California and New York are operating their own insurance exchanges, while the other states are part of the federal system. The report includes breakdowns of how many people are eligible for tax credits in every state.Source: Henry J. Kaiser Family FoundationThe insurance exchanges are intended for people who are uninsured or who buy insurance on their own because they don't get health benefits from their employers. Those already covered by job-based health coverage or government programs like Medicare and Medicaid don't need to use the exchanges.The Affordable Care Act provides two kinds of financial assistance based on income. People who earn up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $46,000 for a single person, are eligible for tax credits to reduce the cost of their monthly insurance premiums. In addition, people who earn up to 250 percent of the poverty level, or about $29,000, can get additional subsidies to cut out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copayments. Subsidies mainly will go to younger, working people, according to an analysis published by Families USA in April.The value of these subsidies will differ based on the price of health insurance, which varies greatly by state and by factors such as age. Although millions of people will get tax credits large enough to cover the full cost of their insurance, others will get smaller subsidies, and people earning above 400 percent of the poverty level will have to pay full price. In some cases, those premiums will be higher than prices available on the current health insurance market. Although the Kaiser Family Foundation projects close to 30 million people could be using the exchanges, actual enrollment during the first year is expected to be much lower. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 7 million people will use the exchanges to obtain private health insurance for 2014, and that 6 million of them will qualify for tax credits. The poor performance of HealthCare.gov and ongoing issues in a few states could suppress enrollment, although the Obama administration maintains it will have the federal web portal functional by the end of the month, enabling people to sign up. Consumers have until Dec. 15 to choose a health plan that will be in place on Jan. 1, and the enrollment period ends March 31.HuffPost Readers: Did you receive a cancellation notice or a similar letter from your insurance company?

Democratic lawmakers blasted the proposal this week because it would force women to anticipate being raped, ThinkProgress reported. ""Forcing women to decide whether they want to buy 'rape insurance' and even compelling parents to make the unfathomable decision about whether to buy it for their daughters is truly despicable,"" State Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer (D) said Monday. ""Requiring Michigan women to plan ahead for an unplanned pregnancy is not only illogical, it’s one of the most misogynistic proposals I have ever seen in the Michigan Legislature.""More than 80 percent of private insurance plans currently cover abortions, so the measure would have a broad effect. Michigan lawmakers passed the same bill last year, but Governor Rick Snyder (R) vetoed it, saying he does not ""believe it is appropriate to tell a woman who becomes pregnant due to a rape that she needed to select elective insurance coverage.""But anti-abortion activists were able to collect enough signatures on a petition this year to force a vote on the measure again. If the Republican-controlled legislature approves it, it will automatically become law, even if Snyder does not sign it. If lawmakers do not pass it, citizens will consider it as a ballot measure in 2014. Right to Life Michigan gathered protesters this week who had been born as a result of rape and incest to speak out in support of the measure. ""We are people, we are not exceptions,"" Mary Rathke, a 34-year-old from Essexville whose birth mother was raped, told reporters. The group's president, Barbara Listing, compared rape and incest to car accidents and floods earlier this year. ""It’s simply, like, nobody plans to have an accident in a car accident, nobody plans to have their homes flooded,"" Listing said. ""You have to buy extra insurance for those."""
14094	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/20/obamacare-deadline_n_4476397.html	News	1	Healthcare	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Obamacare's most crucial deadline thus far is mere days away, sparking a mad dash as Americans seek health coverage for 2014 and put the system to its toughest test yet.Consumers, insurance companies and federal and state authorities are scrambling ahead of Monday, the last day people in nearly all states have to choose a health insurance plan that is guaranteed to be in place on Jan. 1. Even after revamps of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal to health coverage in 36 states, and improvements to some state-run insurance exchanges, technological problems and a tight time frame pose major challenges to people looking for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Those include uninsured people and insured people whose policies expire Dec. 31, risking potentially costly gaps in their health benefits.The coming days could strain the insurance exchanges, rendering a stark verdict on whether the Obama administration's weeks-long effort to fix HealthCare.gov was enough to handle an expected surge in people trying to get a health plan, while working through backlogs of pending applications. Failure would mean more than frustration for people trying to get covered, as those who fall through the cracks will be at risk of huge medical expenses if they become ill or injured in 2014.The risks of failure were clearly evident Friday, when HealthCare.gov was inoperable, the Wall Street Journal reported.After more than two months of frustrating struggles with HealthCare.gov and the federal exchange's telephone customer service system, Sharon Van Daele, a retiree in Tucson, Ariz., feels tantalizingly close to the finish line and intends to cross it by this weekend. ""I'm trying desperately to get this resolved before the 23rd,"" said Van Daele, 64. ""It's been a long and difficult road. I started this on Oct. 4,"" she said. Van Daele's application was held up by a litany of problems that no one could help with, until she used the option made available this month to delete an application and start over, which she did last week. ""It was smooth -- very smooth. When I started in early October, it was horrible,"" said Van Daele, a cancer survivor. She's currently enrolled in a temporary Obamacare program for people who can't get private coverage, the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, which expires next month. Van Daele thinks she can get a comparable policy for about $250 a month, including the tax credits she will receive. ""Now I'm seeing a light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.If she's able to complete the process in time, Van Daele will follow a rapidly growing number of people who've used the insurance exchanges to sign up for coverage in recent weeks.Although nationwide enrollment in private coverage through the exchanges has a long way to go toward the 7 million people the Congressional Budget Office initially projected would enroll by the end of the sign-up period on March 31, the pace has picked up, and the share of enrollments threatened by faulty data delivered to insurance companies appears to be shrinking.Through the end of November, nearly 365,000 people enrolled in private insurance via the exchanges, and more than 800,000 were deemed eligible for Medicaid, the Department of Health and Human Services announced last week. And Obama announced on Friday that half a million people have signed up in December alone, suggesting the pace of signups has accelerated.In some state-run health insurance marketplaces, new figures could portend a big uptick by the end of the year. Enrollments into private insurance via Covered California sped up to more than 17,000 a day this week, and more than 50,000 people signed up from Monday to Wednesday. The jump brings Covered California's total enrollment above 200,000 since October, the exchange announced Thursday. New York, Kentucky, Connecticut and other states reported similar increases.Ahead of the Dec. 23 deadline, the federal government and several state exchanges have taken steps to ease the messy transition into 2014, as has the insurance industry. The federal government has increased staffing at its call centers to more than 12,000 people, and is reaching out directly to consumers who haven't completed their applications, senior administration officials told reporters Thursday. The insurance exchanges in California, Connecticut, Kentucky, New York and Washington state have taken similar measures, executives said during a conference call with reporters hosted by the advocacy group Families USA on Wednesday.On Thursday, the administration revealed that individuals whose policies were canceled because they don't meet the Affordable Care Act's standards won't be subject to the law's individual mandate, and will be allowed to buy bare-bones catastrophic plans originally intended for people younger than 30 or those who demonstrated financial hardship. Senior administration officials estimated this option will apply to fewer than 500,000 people.""If people are trying to get coverage by Jan. 1, have a policy that's running out and need that coverage, we are committed to getting them through the system,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on HuffPost Live Thursday.Insurance companies agreed this week to accept customers' first premium payments until Jan. 10 while still guaranteeing coverage on New Year's Day if people had enrolled on time. State-run exchanges in Maryland, Rhode Island, Oregon, Washington state and Minnesota extended their enrollment or payment dates even further.Insurance companies like Health Care Service Corp., a Chicago-based company that operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in five states, and Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna also have geared up for the pre-holiday rush by bolstering their customer service and sales teams, according to spokespeople for the companies.""We've staffed up for it. We know that there's a crunch,"" said Lisa Rubino, the executive at Long Beach, Calif.-based Molina Healthcare who oversees its exchange business in nine states. ""There's a lot of folks looking to enroll,"" she said.Concerns linger, however, about the federal exchanges' ability to provide insurers with accurate data about their new customers, which would jeopardize people's enrollments. And the situation in several states, such as Oregon, Maryland and Hawaii, is considerably shakier. ""We are aware of the fact that we are going to have to struggle with folks who went through the Cover Oregon process but somehow did not get to us in a timely manner,"" said Dawn Bonder, CEO of Health Republic Insurance of Oregon, based in Lake Oswego. ""What we've been encouraging folks to do is, you can buy our plan directly through our website, and put your application into Cover Oregon immediately,"" she said.In spite of indications that enrollment is rising, and stories of failures-turned-potential-successes like Sharon Van Daele, other consumers continue to struggle with the balky system.Alan Wells of Bluff City, Tenn., was eager to get into the exchanges and tried to start the process in October. But the 61-year-old retired information technology professional is still stuck. ""I kind of gave up,"" Wells said.Wells is looking to replace the COBRA plan he's had since his involuntary retirement, which costs $340 a month. Wells' only income is Social Security, so he expects the law's tax credits would save him money. But he's been stymied at every turn, including his most recent attempt on Thursday. ""I'm going to try it periodically,"" Wells said. ""When it works, it will work.""This story has been updated with December's enrollment number."

Jan Brewer said Monday in her State of the State address, making her the third Republican governor to agree to one of the key components of President Barack Obama's health care reform.Brewer said that if she did not accept the Medicaid funds for Arizona, other states could claim those federal dollars and create jobs that otherwise would be created in Arizona. Fellow Republican governors Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada also plan to expand Medicaid to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is currently $14,856 for an individual. But 10 other Republican governors have already decided not to participate. The Supreme Court's 2012 ruling that affirmed Obama's health care law allows states to refuse to take part in the Medicaid expansion.Although Brewer has been a consistent opponent of Obamacare, she acknowledged Monday that the law is now an unavoidable reality and that Arizona would be worse off turning down the federal dollars that will come with broadening Medicaid.""Try as we might, the law was upheld by the United States Supreme Court,"" Brewer said. ""The Affordable Care Act is not going anywhere, at least not for the time being.""The Arizona governor said the federal funding would help pay for some individuals already covered by the state's Medicaid program and provide some protection for the state's rural hospitals.While Arizona is moving ahead with the expansion of Medicaid, Brewer declined to take part in another key aspect of Obamacare. In November, she notified the Obama administration that Arizona would not establish a state-run health insurance exchange. These exchanges will be the gateways for individuals and small businesses to comparison shop for health benefits and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance or Medicaid coverage. Arizona is one of 25 states in which the federal government will have to set up the insurance exchange.In announcing her decision to lawmakers in Phoenix, Brewer emphasized her continued concern that the federal government may cut back on its share of financing the Medicaid expansion and said she would put plans in place to protect the state's budget. Under Obamacare, the federal government will pay the full cost of covering newly eligible individuals from 2014 to 2016, and then will scale back funding to 90 percent by 2022.""As I weighed this decision, I was troubled that a future president and Congress would reduce matching rates,"" Brewer said. ""Together with my team, I have crafted a plan that addresses both of those concerns and safeguards Arizona.""Brewer's plan includes what she described as a ""circuit breaker,"" which would automatically shrink the state's Medicaid program in the event that the federal government were to decrease funding. ""I will not allow Obamacare to become a bait and switch,"" she said. Brewer placed her decision on Medicaid in the context of the main economic development theme of her speech. She told lawmakers that she did not want to forfeit the federal funds to other states that have agreed to expansion, singling out such neighboring states as California and Colorado. She said that the Medicaid expansion, which she described as ""just slightly beyond"" what voters had previously approved, would insert $2 billion into the Arizona economy.She also promoted Arizona's Medicaid expansion plan as ""the gold standard"" for the nation. Brewer continued to emphasize her opposition to the Affordable Care Act but told legislators that the state could not oppose the federal government on all aspects of the health care law. ""We cannot wag our finger at the federal government,"" Brewer said, reminding lawmakers of her famous meeting on an airport tarmac with President Obama last year. ""Trust me, I tried that once.""Arizona House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told The Huffington Post that Democrats are ""encouraged"" by Brewer's decision. He said that the party still plans to look at the details of her Medicaid plan, but that what the governor outlined in her address was a good step for the state. Brewer and Campbell, a potential 2014 gubernatorial candidate, have had a frosty relationship over the past two years. Noting that the Medicaid expansion was pushed by the state's business community, along with Democrats and moderate Republicans, Campbell said he hopes that the governor is willing to work with them in a ""constructive fashion"" to pass the plan through the GOP-controlled legislature, which has been led by Tea Party loyalists.""The only people opposed to this is the ideological far right and the Tea Party,"" Campbell said. ""This is about economic development for the state. Rejecting this will destroy the hospital system."""

But state Rep. Bette Grande (R-Fargo) proposed to kill the grant to keep Planned Parenthood out of teen sex education in North Dakota, even though the family planning provider does not operate any clinics in the state. ""They're not a part of how we do business in this state,"" Grande said of Planned Parenthood in January after the sex ed program was announced. ""It is an overt abortion industry that we don't want to be a part of.""Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, told reporters on Monday that North Dakota is the first state ever to go after a sex education program that is fully funded by the federal government. ""This is incredibly unusual,"" she said. ""No state has tried to block a comprehensive sex education program like this, ever."" Arkansas lawmakers, meanwhile, are considering a bill that would prevent public funds from flowing to any entity that provides or refers for abortions, which would effectively end an HIV and STI prevention program that Planned Parenthood administers through a state grant.And Texas state Sen. Ken Paxton (R-McKinney) proposed a bill in March that would prevent Planned Parenthood from providing sex education materials to Texas students because the family planning provider has an inherent ""conflict of interest."" Nash told HuffPost that most states have been moving away from abstinence-only education and toward comprehensive sex education programs over the past decade because the U.S. has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the developed world. Research has shown that such programs delay sexual debut, reduce number of partners and increase contraceptive use among teenagers. But since 2011, several conservative-leaning states have been trending in the opposite direction.""This could be the start of something,"" Nash said. ""For a couple of years, we've been dealing with attempts to defund Planned Parenthood in the sense of prohibiting state funds to go to Planned Parenthood for the purposes of providing family planning, but now we're seeing that potentially expand to these sex education programs that give teens the information they need to prevent pregnancy."" Twenty states currently require abstinence-only education in public schools where sex education is taught, including North Dakota and Arkansas. Texas law stresses abstinence education in public schools, but also includes information about condoms. Dr. John Santelli, a pediatrician and professor at Columbia University's School of Public Health, told reporters in a conference call on Monday that the medical profession and public health communities are united in the belief that comprehensive sex education programs are the best way to combat the country's soaring teen pregnancy rate. ""Unfortunately, this is an area where there's more heat than light sometimes, and political interference is all too common,"" he said. ""We broadly support comprehensive sex education and feel strongly that these programs should be left to health professionals and not politicians."" "
14117	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/manoj-jain-md-mph/aca-canceled-plans_b_4288865.html	Opinion	0	Healthcare	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Some years ago, driving through an end of town where pawn shops and boarded up homes are common, I saw a small placard sign nailed on a telephone pole. ""Buy Health Insurance,"" it touted with premiums as low as $25 a month. I was tempted. Health insurance, for me and for most Americans, is a necessary part of life, similar to home rent or mortgage, grocery bills and gasoline. Insurance is essential because a hospitalization for a few days costs $10,000 and medical bills for a major illness can lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments. So it is no wonder that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare, has created anxiety among many Americans. And, without doubt, the ACA has caused the health insurance market to go into upheaval, with a nonfunctional healthcare.gov website, with unexpected insurance cancellation notices, and now with a proposed ""fix"" by President Obama. So let me try to put things in perspective.The ACA is really a ""Health Insurance Reform Act"" -- its greatest impact is to increase the number of insured individuals, to guarantee essential benefits, and to regulate health insurance companies. Perhaps most importantly, it promises health insurance no matter what your preexisting conditions are.Today, 49 percent of Americans get their insurance from their employer and 28 percent are on government insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid. Combined, this represents nearly 80 percent of the population and they are largely unaffected directly by ACA. Another 15 percent are uninsured and they are being required to buy insurance; many of them will be helped with subsidies. Then there are 5 percent of Americans who have individual plans, and half of them are receiving letters from their insurance companies cancelling their policies.  These individual health plans vary. Some are Cadillac plans and they likely are not being cancelled because they meet the new benefits requirements. But many are ""junk"" or substandard health insurance, and they are being axed. Often, you only realize you have a substandard plan when you get ill. I have patients who stop coming to the clinic after the few initial visits and then become so ill they have to be admitted to the hospital. When I ask them why they stopped taking their lifesaving medicine and making clinic visits, their response is simple: ""My insurance ran out.""We know such substandard insurance plans abound. Of all the bankruptcies in America, 60 percent are due to medical bills, and 78 percent of these, are among patients who had health insurance and paid their monthly premiums. Imagine, going bankrupt from medical bills when you have health insurance. This defeats the purpose of having insurance. The ACA helps individuals by standardizing insurance benefits into 10 essential categories which include coverage for hospitalization, maternity, chronic disease and mental health, among others.Some say the ACA standardization is an upgrade of the insurance coverage. But I don't believe it's an upgrade from ""economy to the business class"" -- it's more like having all the basic safety features. It's like going from a single engine Cessna to a commercial plane. That insurance coverage offered on the telephone pole for $25 a month and those policies being cancelled fall into this category. The transition from substandard policy to standardized coverage will be difficult. A 30-year-old man is upset because he now has to pay a higher premium than a 30-year-old woman has to pay. But honestly, discriminating against a young woman by having her pay higher health insurance premiums because she might bear children one day is morally unacceptable. To ease the transitions, the ACA had a ""grandfather clause"" -- which is where the phrase ""If you like your coverage you could keep it"" originated. However it was only if no changes where made to it after March 2010 when the law was passed. The ""fix"" President Obama has proposed is to extend the grandfather clause.  Another major impact of ACA on health insurance is stricter regulation. Now, insurance companies are required to spend 80 to 85 percent of the premium money towards clinical care services (not administration) -- and any additional money has to be refunded. In 2012, under the ACA, $1.1 billion dollars were returned to policyholders through refunds. Such regulations ensure that insurance companies don't make a killing off of policyholders.The biggest question looming on the mind of most Americans is probably this: How will all these changes impact premiums? It's hard to tell. But it will not be a repeat of the decade before the ACA, where premiums doubled and many were dropped from their insurance just when they needed it most. Yet, the transition will be a bumpy ride.For more by Manoj Jain, MD MPH, click here.For more on health news, click here."

Even after revamps of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal to health coverage in 36 states, and improvements to some state-run insurance exchanges, technological problems and a tight time frame pose major challenges to people looking for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Those include uninsured people and insured people whose policies expire Dec. 31, risking potentially costly gaps in their health benefits.The coming days could strain the insurance exchanges, rendering a stark verdict on whether the Obama administration's weeks-long effort to fix HealthCare.gov was enough to handle an expected surge in people trying to get a health plan, while working through backlogs of pending applications. Failure would mean more than frustration for people trying to get covered, as those who fall through the cracks will be at risk of huge medical expenses if they become ill or injured in 2014.The risks of failure were clearly evident Friday, when HealthCare.gov was inoperable, the Wall Street Journal reported.After more than two months of frustrating struggles with HealthCare.gov and the federal exchange's telephone customer service system, Sharon Van Daele, a retiree in Tucson, Ariz., feels tantalizingly close to the finish line and intends to cross it by this weekend. ""I'm trying desperately to get this resolved before the 23rd,"" said Van Daele, 64. ""It's been a long and difficult road. I started this on Oct. 4,"" she said. Van Daele's application was held up by a litany of problems that no one could help with, until she used the option made available this month to delete an application and start over, which she did last week. ""It was smooth -- very smooth. When I started in early October, it was horrible,"" said Van Daele, a cancer survivor. She's currently enrolled in a temporary Obamacare program for people who can't get private coverage, the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, which expires next month. Van Daele thinks she can get a comparable policy for about $250 a month, including the tax credits she will receive. ""Now I'm seeing a light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.If she's able to complete the process in time, Van Daele will follow a rapidly growing number of people who've used the insurance exchanges to sign up for coverage in recent weeks.Although nationwide enrollment in private coverage through the exchanges has a long way to go toward the 7 million people the Congressional Budget Office initially projected would enroll by the end of the sign-up period on March 31, the pace has picked up, and the share of enrollments threatened by faulty data delivered to insurance companies appears to be shrinking.Through the end of November, nearly 365,000 people enrolled in private insurance via the exchanges, and more than 800,000 were deemed eligible for Medicaid, the Department of Health and Human Services announced last week. And Obama announced on Friday that half a million people have signed up in December alone, suggesting the pace of signups has accelerated.In some state-run health insurance marketplaces, new figures could portend a big uptick by the end of the year. Enrollments into private insurance via Covered California sped up to more than 17,000 a day this week, and more than 50,000 people signed up from Monday to Wednesday. The jump brings Covered California's total enrollment above 200,000 since October, the exchange announced Thursday. New York, Kentucky, Connecticut and other states reported similar increases.Ahead of the Dec. 23 deadline, the federal government and several state exchanges have taken steps to ease the messy transition into 2014, as has the insurance industry. The federal government has increased staffing at its call centers to more than 12,000 people, and is reaching out directly to consumers who haven't completed their applications, senior administration officials told reporters Thursday. The insurance exchanges in California, Connecticut, Kentucky, New York and Washington state have taken similar measures, executives said during a conference call with reporters hosted by the advocacy group Families USA on Wednesday.On Thursday, the administration revealed that individuals whose policies were canceled because they don't meet the Affordable Care Act's standards won't be subject to the law's individual mandate, and will be allowed to buy bare-bones catastrophic plans originally intended for people younger than 30 or those who demonstrated financial hardship. Senior administration officials estimated this option will apply to fewer than 500,000 people.""If people are trying to get coverage by Jan. 1, have a policy that's running out and need that coverage, we are committed to getting them through the system,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on HuffPost Live Thursday.Insurance companies agreed this week to accept customers' first premium payments until Jan. 10 while still guaranteeing coverage on New Year's Day if people had enrolled on time. State-run exchanges in Maryland, Rhode Island, Oregon, Washington state and Minnesota extended their enrollment or payment dates even further.Insurance companies like Health Care Service Corp., a Chicago-based company that operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in five states, and Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna also have geared up for the pre-holiday rush by bolstering their customer service and sales teams, according to spokespeople for the companies.""We've staffed up for it. We know that there's a crunch,"" said Lisa Rubino, the executive at Long Beach, Calif.-based Molina Healthcare who oversees its exchange business in nine states. ""There's a lot of folks looking to enroll,"" she said.Concerns linger, however, about the federal exchanges' ability to provide insurers with accurate data about their new customers, which would jeopardize people's enrollments. And the situation in several states, such as Oregon, Maryland and Hawaii, is considerably shakier. ""We are aware of the fact that we are going to have to struggle with folks who went through the Cover Oregon process but somehow did not get to us in a timely manner,"" said Dawn Bonder, CEO of Health Republic Insurance of Oregon, based in Lake Oswego. ""What we've been encouraging folks to do is, you can buy our plan directly through our website, and put your application into Cover Oregon immediately,"" she said.In spite of indications that enrollment is rising, and stories of failures-turned-potential-successes like Sharon Van Daele, other consumers continue to struggle with the balky system.Alan Wells of Bluff City, Tenn., was eager to get into the exchanges and tried to start the process in October. But the 61-year-old retired information technology professional is still stuck. ""I kind of gave up,"" Wells said.Wells is looking to replace the COBRA plan he's had since his involuntary retirement, which costs $340 a month. Wells' only income is Social Security, so he expects the law's tax credits would save him money. But he's been stymied at every turn, including his most recent attempt on Thursday. ""I'm going to try it periodically,"" Wells said. ""When it works, it will work.""This story has been updated with December's enrollment number."

Only Texas beats the uninsured population of the Sunshine State, where 24.8 percent of residents under 65 were uninsured in 2011, the most recent year figures were available from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Associated Press reports. Of those 3.8 million uninsured Floridians, more than 500,000 are younger than 19, according to the Miami Herald. Despite the alarming rates, Florida has moved to thwart the expansion of Medicaid, a key component of the ACA. The state refused to enlarge the program using federal funds and also declined to set up a state-run exchange. While Governor Rick Scott (R) led an unsuccessful push to overturn the ACA in court, Florida's House republicans turned their backs on the Senate's bipartisan expansion plan, choosing to use $300 million in state funds to purchase coverage for 130,000 Floridians instead of federal grants that would cover an estimated 1.1 million residents. By insisting on an alternative to the ACA, Florida turned away an estimated total of $50 billion in federal funding spread over the next decade to a number of crucial programs -- including a federally funded, voluntary home visitation program proven to prevent child abuse, infant drug dependency, and unemployment. State Rep. Matt Hudson (R-Naples), then chair of the state's Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee, told the Times in 2011 that the state was not required to accept federal grants. “I do not believe that act is the right thing for the country or the right thing for Florida,” he said, ""and I am not going to start implementing things that I don’t believe in.""Florida voters rejected a symbolic amendment against the ACA last fall -- and Scott eventually endorsed expansion -- but the legislature didn't stop there. Scott and others approved a law last month requiring a disclosure form that will tell policyholders how the Affordable Care Act will impact their premiums. An ""incredible waste of money,"" Florida Consumer Action Network's Bill Newton called the move, while others criticized the state for knowingly using inaccurate numbers to describe the cost of expansion. Scott even raised privacy concerns over data that will collected by ""navigators"" hired to help low-income Floridians negotiate the new national insurance exchanges. ""In states like Florida that seem determined to sabotage reform,"" wrote the Times editorial board, ""the uninsured may have a very hard time getting the coverage they need and deserve."""
14143	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/05/obamacare-premiums_n_3869782.html	News	0	Healthcare	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"The premiums for coverage available on the health insurance exchanges created by President Barack Obama's health care reform law will vary widely from state to state, according to a new Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of data published by 17 states and the District of Columbia.Retail prices for health insurance can be considerably different based in part on the cost of health care services where a person lives, even within the same state, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Wednesday. Premiums also vary based on age, family size and tobacco use. But under Obamacare, prices cannot be based on someone's medical history and patients with preexisting condition cannot be turned away. The law also mandates a set of minimum benefits that includes hospitalizations, prescription drugs and maternity care.The prices included in the report don't include health benefits provided by employers because the health insurance exchanges are intended for the uninsured and those who don't get job-based health plans.The actual premiums for the health plans on the exchanges have been a chief unknown since Obama enacted the health care law in 2010 and although complete information won't be available until the exchanges open, the Kaiser Family Foundation examined detailed data published by state authorities to create a snapshot of what coverage will cost.In Baltimore, a 40-year-old will be able to buy a so-called bronze health insurance plan for as little as $146 a month, compared to $336 a month in Burlington, Vt., not including the savings from tax credits available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level -- $45,960 for a single person this year -- according to the report.The health insurance exchanges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are slated to open Oct. 1 for small businesses, uninsured people, and for people who don't get health benefits at work, to comparison shop and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance. People who get health benefits from large employers or who are enrolled in government programs like Medicare don't need to use the exchanges. Employers provide coverage to 150 million U.S. residents, according to census data, and virtually all large firms are expected to continue doing so next year despite the Obama administration's one-year delay of the law's requirement that large companies cover workers or pay a penalty.The exchanges will sell four tiers of health insurance -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum -- indicating how generous the coverage is. Bronze plans will tend to have the lowest premiums, but expose consumers to the highest possible out-of-pocket costs and platinum plans will have the highest prices but the lowest additional expenses. Those younger than 30 can purchase so-called catastrophic insurance with minimal coverage at a lower price, but cannot apply federal tax credits to these plans. The Kaiser Family Foundation didn't compare the premiums on the health insurance exchange with the cost of health insurance for those who don't get health benefits at work today, however. The new law's guaranteed benefits, prohibition against turning down people with preexisting conditions will make health insurance on this market too different from what's currently available, the report says.""These changes make direct comparisons of exchange premiums and existing individual market premiums complicated, and doing so would require speculative assumptions and data that are not publicly available,"" it says. Some people, most likely young adults who don't qualify for financial assistance, may see higher prices as a result.The variation isn't limited to bronze plans, the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis reveals. ""The lowest cost exchange silver exchange plan available range in cost for a 40-year-old from $194 per month in Portland, Oregon, to $395 per month for a 40-year-old in Burlington, Vermont, before tax credits,"" the report says. Under Obamacare, people whose incomes range from poverty, $11,490 for a single person this year, and 400 percent of poverty may be eligible for tax credits to buy private insurance. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are running their own exchanges while the federal government will at least partly manage exchanges, also called marketplaces, in the remaining states. ""Most people buying their own insurance will qualify for premium tax credits, which will significantly lower the cost of their premiums,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation report says. The foundation also notes that premiums released so far are lower than projected by the Congressional Budget Office.People who earn up to 133 percent of poverty, or $15,282 for an individual this year, can enroll in Medicaid if they live in the District of Columbia or one of the 24 states that are expanding the program under the law. The Kaiser Family Foundation examined insurance company filings to state regulators in 17 states and the District of Columbia and analyzed the prices in the largest cities in each jurisdiction for people at ages 25, 40, and 60. At least two health insurance companies are offering products in all of the locations included in the report. California has the largest number of companies participating in its exchange, Covered California, at 12, while HealthSource RI in Rhode Island and Maine's federally run marketplace each have two companies.  Source: Henry J. Kaiser Family FoundationEligibility for tax credits via the exchanges is determined based on the maximum amount of a person's income they must spend on health insurance and the price of the second-cheapest silver-level health insurance plan where they live. In addition to the tax credits for annual premiums, people who earn up to two-and-a-half times poverty can qualify for additional subsidies to cover their out-of-pocket costs like copayments and deductibles. Most legal residents of the United States must obtain coverage or face a tax penalty under the law's individual mandate. Source: Henry J.

On Thursday, Obama sought to heighten awareness of such parts of the health care law that already are in effect, ahead of a major campaign to enroll a targeted 7 million more people in health insurance starting Oct. 1.""If you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance -- could be through your employer or through Medicare or through Medicaid -- you already have an array of new benefits in place,"" Obama said during remarks at the White House. ""You don't have to wait until Oct. 1. You're already getting benefits even if you don't know if it's because of the Affordable Care Act.""Obama's speech is part of a growing campaign by the White House and its allies to push back against Republican attacks on the 3-year-old law and to improve woeful public understanding and weak support for its mandates and benefits for health insurance consumers. Obamacare's health insurance exchange marketplaces for people who don't get health benefits at work and for small companies are set to open in less than three months, amid questions about the administration's preparedness and resistance from Republican-led states.The administration faces significant challenges to getting those health insurance exchanges ready for the six-month enrollment period that begins in October, and it is embarking on a major effort to promote enrollment in health insurance and Medicaid among people -- especially the young, healthy, and poor -- who are uninsured or currently buy their own health insurance. The difficulty of the task and doubts about the administration's readiness are underscored by the White House's decision to delay a separate requirement that large employers cover their workers of face penalties of up to $3,000 per worker.The biggest parts of the health care law not yet online -- and the hardest measures to put into place -- will affect the uninsured. ""Our broken health care system threatened the hopes and dreams of families and business across the country who feared that one illness or one accident could cost them everything they spent a lifetime building. Step by step, we're fixing that system,"" Obama said Thursday. ""Affordable health care is not some privilege just for the few. It's a basic right that everybody should be able to enjoy."" But he also must assuage concerns of the majority of Americans who already are covered by job-based health insurance and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that Obamacare will upend their benefits. The president sought to promote the insurance rebates as an example of how the law has positively affected currently insured people.""Millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies, but instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill, they were pleasantly surprised with a check,"" he said. ""Most folks wouldn't know when that check comes in that this was because of Obamacare.""Obama also touted the news, reported Wednesday by The New York Times, that health insurance premiums in New York state will decline by as much as half under Obamacare next year, not counting the tax credits available to low- and middle-income people. Health insurance premiums in 10 states and the District of Columbia will be lower on average than projected by the Congressional Budget Office, the Department of Health and Human Services reported in an analysis released Thursday. Premiums will vary greatly from state to state and based on individuals' ages and other factors, and will be higher for some people next year.On average, the lowest premium for a ""silver"" plan -- the second-least-generous of four levels of coverage available to anyone on the exchanges -- in those states will be $321 a month for a single person, compared to the $392 the CBO predicted, according to HHS. That represents an 18 percent difference, although the prices in those states could change before October.HHS produced charts comparing the lowest and second-lowest average premiums for a silver-level plan in those 10 states and the District of Columbia. The first bar on the right represents the department's analysis of the CBO projections and the second shows the average across the states. New Mexico will have the lowest average health insurance premiums among the states, at $226, while the highest will be in Vermont, at $400, according to the analysis.Republican opposition to Obamacare remains fierce, and the GOP brushed aside Obama's messages about New York's premiums and other positive effects of the law, emphasizing instead its potential negatives, like that some Americans may pay more for coverage next year. The House voted Wednesday to to repeal parts of the law, marking nearly 40 such attempts to eliminate, scale back or defund Obamacare since 2011.""The picture that the president paints of his health care law looks nothing like the reality facing struggling American families,"" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a press release after Obama's speech Thursday. ""House Republicans will continue our efforts to fully repeal the president’s health care law in its entirety once and for all.""In his speech, Obama acknowledged political opposition to the law was affecting his administration's ability to carry it out and criticized House Republicans for ""re-fighting these old battles.""But it's resistance to Obamacare at the state level that is having a more tangible impact on the law's reach. Just 16 states and the District of Columbia elected to manage their own health insurance exchanges, leaving the federal government responsible for the remainder, and as many as half of states won't expand Medicaid to more poor people under the law.""In states that are working hard to make sure that this law delivers for their people, what we're seeing is that consumers are getting a hint of how much money that's going to be saved because of this law,"" Obama said, citing California, New York, Oregon and Washington state, where health insurance premiums for next year beat estimates.""It's hard, it's a big country, and the health care industry is massive,"" he said. ""As we implement, there are going to be glitches and there are going to be certain states that, for political reasons, are resisting implementation. And we're just steadily working through all that stuff.""This story has been updated with additional information on health insurance premiums, quotes from President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), and background information."

Democratic lawmakers blasted the proposal this week because it would force women to anticipate being raped, ThinkProgress reported. ""Forcing women to decide whether they want to buy 'rape insurance' and even compelling parents to make the unfathomable decision about whether to buy it for their daughters is truly despicable,"" State Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer (D) said Monday. ""Requiring Michigan women to plan ahead for an unplanned pregnancy is not only illogical, it’s one of the most misogynistic proposals I have ever seen in the Michigan Legislature.""More than 80 percent of private insurance plans currently cover abortions, so the measure would have a broad effect. Michigan lawmakers passed the same bill last year, but Governor Rick Snyder (R) vetoed it, saying he does not ""believe it is appropriate to tell a woman who becomes pregnant due to a rape that she needed to select elective insurance coverage.""But anti-abortion activists were able to collect enough signatures on a petition this year to force a vote on the measure again. If the Republican-controlled legislature approves it, it will automatically become law, even if Snyder does not sign it. If lawmakers do not pass it, citizens will consider it as a ballot measure in 2014. Right to Life Michigan gathered protesters this week who had been born as a result of rape and incest to speak out in support of the measure. ""We are people, we are not exceptions,"" Mary Rathke, a 34-year-old from Essexville whose birth mother was raped, told reporters. The group's president, Barbara Listing, compared rape and incest to car accidents and floods earlier this year. ""It’s simply, like, nobody plans to have an accident in a car accident, nobody plans to have their homes flooded,"" Listing said. ""You have to buy extra insurance for those."""

""The website that was supposed to do this all in a seamless way has had way more glitches than I think are acceptable,"" Obama said during a Tuesday interview with KCCI television in Des Moines, Iowa. But the administration won't disclose exactly what's wrong with the health insurance exchange website, or when consumers can expect to see the promise of convenient, one-stop shopping for health benefits and financial assistance fulfilled.Time remains for these problems to be resolved, but not much. ""If things aren't resolved in three weeks, we've got some serious, serious problems,"" said Timothy Jost, a law professor and health care reform expert at Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Va., and an Obamacare supporter. ""I don't think we're anywhere close to there yet, but if the whole thing collapses, it'll be another generation before we get this problem fixed.""The White House vowed to fix the problem and said people are managing to sign up for health care. ""The website is unacceptable, but we're working to improve it and the product is good,"" said White House official Tara McGuinness. ""Across the country people today are getting access to affordable care. We're going to work intensely for the next six months to make sure we meet the demand. We're going to make affordable health care accessible through the website, through the phone, in communities across the country, and with in-person assistance.""The stakes are high for uninsured people, individuals and families who buy their health insurance directly and the entire health care industry. Without a functioning health insurance exchange, many people too sick or too poor to get health insurance under the old rules will remain shut out of the system. The millions of Americans who already buy their own insurance will face major disruptions. Health insurance companies could experience a nightmare scenario where the bulk of the individuals who brave the frustrating sign-up process are those who are sick, desperate for coverage and expensive to treat.And anyone who isn't able to get coverage because of the exchanges' problems could confront the prospect of tax penalties through no fault of their own.For Obama and the Democrats who've stood behind Obamacare during four years of relentless attacks from Republicans -- including a face-off that led to a 16-day government shutdown and a threat of U.S. default -- failure of this magnitude would discredit a core premise of this presidency, that government can do big things to improve Americans' lives.Although there are signs of incremental improvement, HealthCare.gov is unable to reliably allow consumers to create accounts, verify their identifies, apply for tax credits available to low- and middle-income people or shop for health insurance plans. Insurers are receiving bad enrollment data and states are reporting difficulties in accessing the federal system.The administration won't say how many people have signed up so far, but its reported goal of enrolling 500,000 people this month appears difficult to reach. Some thousands of dogged shoppers appear to have signed up for plans on the federal health insurance exchanges, also called marketplaces. But others have become discouraged, and traffic to HealthCare.gov has waned, according to one independent analysis. People working to help consumers are using paper applications for financial assistance that eventually will have to be entered into the computer system.If the administration does succeed in getting the website in working order in the coming weeks, the system will be strained by a backlog of pending applications and a crush of consumers frantically trying to get their coverage in place before the new year.Consumers have until Dec. 15 to choose a plan for Jan. 1, and until Feb. 15 to avoid being hit with tax penalties for violating the law's mandate that individuals obtain health insurance. The 2014 enrollment period ends March 31. The administration insists it's doing everything it can to get HealthCare.gov into shape. In states operating their own health insurance exchanges, a small but growing number of people are signing up.""We really do need to get this thing resolved pretty quickly. And then, of course, the longer you wait to resolve it, the more you have piling up for the last minute with the risk of another crash,"" Jost said. Robert Laszewski, a health care industry consultant, is skeptical that the health insurance exchanges' information technology failings can be mitigated in time to prevent chaos. ""The fix might be to take it down and start over,"" he said. ""I don't know what the best-case scenario for these guys fixing this thing is, but it's got to be two or three weeks, minimum.""The urgency is underscored not only by the fact that the low-income Americans and the 48 million uninsured -- those whom the law was primarily intended to benefit -- won't get the help they were promised. There's also the plight of those who currently have coverage they bought themselves that now has to be replaced, said Laszewski, who is president of Alexandria, Va.-based Health Policy and Strategy Associates. That represents about 3.6 percent of the population, according to census data.Many health insurance products currently on the market don't meet Obamacare's benefit standards and consumer protections so they are being discontinued. Consumers with these plans are the most likely to see rate increases next year, especially if they earn too much to get tax credits. ""They've got to convert to a new policy -- no ifs, ands or buts about it,"" Laszewski said.And while people who currently pay for their own health insurance are likely to do whatever they can to remain covered, buying a plan directly from an insurance carrier or using a private online broker isn't what Obamacare promised, and tax-credit subsidies aren't available without the federal system. Moreover, these private companies aren't prepared to deal with millions of customers who were supposed to be using the government marketplace, Laszewski said. Under these circumstances, the lion's share of the people who do whatever is necessary to sign up through HealthCare.gov are likely to be the sickest and most expensive to cover because they have the greatest need, Laszewski said. That would make the pool of people covered very costly, causing health insurers to lose money and likely rethink whether they want to participate in the exchanges, he said. ""The fundamental threat to Obamacare is we don't get enough healthy people in the pool to keep the rates reasonable, and they are in grave danger of that problem,"" he said. If these problems persist longer -- weeks, months, a whole year -- the entire Obamacare project falls apart, Laszewski said: ""It's a holy shit moment.""This article has been updated to include White House comments."

Kaiser Family foundation estimates. Enrollment via the insurance exchanges began Oct. 1, but has been hampered by the failed launch of HealthCare.gov, the federal portal to the marketplaces in more than 30 states, and technical problems affecting several of the state-run exchanges.Residents of five states -- Texas, California, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania -- represent more than 40 percent of the people who would qualify for tax credits across the country, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. California and New York are operating their own insurance exchanges, while the other states are part of the federal system. The report includes breakdowns of how many people are eligible for tax credits in every state.Source: Henry J. Kaiser Family FoundationThe insurance exchanges are intended for people who are uninsured or who buy insurance on their own because they don't get health benefits from their employers. Those already covered by job-based health coverage or government programs like Medicare and Medicaid don't need to use the exchanges.The Affordable Care Act provides two kinds of financial assistance based on income. People who earn up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $46,000 for a single person, are eligible for tax credits to reduce the cost of their monthly insurance premiums. In addition, people who earn up to 250 percent of the poverty level, or about $29,000, can get additional subsidies to cut out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copayments. Subsidies mainly will go to younger, working people, according to an analysis published by Families USA in April.The value of these subsidies will differ based on the price of health insurance, which varies greatly by state and by factors such as age. Although millions of people will get tax credits large enough to cover the full cost of their insurance, others will get smaller subsidies, and people earning above 400 percent of the poverty level will have to pay full price. In some cases, those premiums will be higher than prices available on the current health insurance market. Although the Kaiser Family Foundation projects close to 30 million people could be using the exchanges, actual enrollment during the first year is expected to be much lower. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 7 million people will use the exchanges to obtain private health insurance for 2014, and that 6 million of them will qualify for tax credits. The poor performance of HealthCare.gov and ongoing issues in a few states could suppress enrollment, although the Obama administration maintains it will have the federal web portal functional by the end of the month, enabling people to sign up. Consumers have until Dec. 15 to choose a health plan that will be in place on Jan. 1, and the enrollment period ends March 31.HuffPost Readers: Did you receive a cancellation notice or a similar letter from your insurance company?

14290	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/06/obamacare-virginia-governor_n_4229062.html	News	0	Healthcare	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON –- Two weeks before Virginia's gubernatorial election Tuesday, Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli's pollster e-mailed his senior campaign advisers with the latest polling results. They weren't good.  ""There is nothing in the data that suggests it's not all that bad,"" pollster Glen Bolger wrote. ""It's pretty bad.""  Cuccinelli was down 9 percentage-points among voters labeled ""10's"" by the campaign because they were considered most likely to vote, trailing Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe 38 percent to 47 percent. Cuccinelli was also down 33 percent to 44 percent among all the voters surveyed, with 10 percent for Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis.   Public polling was about the same. The HuffPost Pollster average on Oct. 18 gave McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, an 8.5-point lead, 45.5 to 37 percent. Bolger informed the Cuccinelli brain trust that the numbers were terrible for a few reasons: ""We are being badly outspent, and the shutdown/end game has not been successful at revving up Republicans OR deflating Democrats.""  The claim by Bolger and by many Republicans now, in the wake of a much narrower than expected, 2.5-point McAuliffe win on Tuesday, is that the numbers closed in in the last two weeks as Cuccinelli honed in on Obamacare. He stressed his early opposition to the law in 2010 as attorney general, just as the law kicked in, suffering massive implementation problems.   The takeaway, then, for some, is that Obamacare became a millstone that almost dragged McAuliffe from a sure victory to an epic collapse.  ""Despite being outspent by an unprecedented $15 million, this race came down to the wire because of Obamacare,"" Cuccinelli said in his concession speech Tuesday night.  The problem is, there's not much evidence for this. Closer to Election Day, on Nov. 1, Cuccinelli campaign manager Chris LaCivita e-mailed supporters and claimed that among the ""10's,"" McAuliffe had just a 1-point lead. This wasn't from a poll done by the campaign, however. Bolger told HuffPost on Wednesday that the Oct. 18 poll was the last one the campaign conducted. ""Had no more money,"" he wrote in an e-mail. (LaCivita did not respond to an e-mail asking what he had based his Nov. 1 claim on.)  In addition, the public polling itself was not as volatile as people thought. In mid-July, McAuliffe began opening a lead, and the HuffPost/Pollster average of the public polling showed that advantage at around 5 points for most of August and September, and at 7 points in October, all the way up to Election Day. A cluster of polls showing McAuliffe up by double digits in mid- to late October, followed by two polls showing him up only four points and two points, respectively, created the impression of a tightening race.  Late last week, in a briefing with reporters, McAuliffe's pollster said that their internal polling had showed the race steady for a month.  ""Our margin both in the head-to-head and in the three-way race are exactly what they were a month ago,"" Geoff Garin, the Democratic pollster, said. Garin didn't say then what the margin was, but in a phone conversation the same day he told HuffPost's Mark Blumenthal that it was 4 points. The day after the election, Garin said, ""Terry’s lead from mid-summer on was always in the 2-4 range.""  Voter modeling conducted for McAuliffe by a group of former Obama campaign analytics experts gave McAuliffe a 2-point lead. McAuliffe's team believes they drove up Cuccinelli's negatives over the summer with attack ads, and the race never moved from there. McAuliffe communications director Brennan Bilberry said Wednesday that the Cuccinelli number showing the Republican trailing by 11 in mid-October was ""lunacy.""  Here's why the Democrats might be right, and why the Republican theory that Obamacare gave Cuccinelli momentum may be wrong: the Democrats continue to hold a data advantage over Republicans. The quality of their voter information is better, but perhaps more importantly, there is a greater cultural willingness among Democratic pollsters and campaigns to do surveys and voter targeting based on enhanced voter files. And so McAuliffe’s polling, predictive modeling and voter targeting was, quite likely, vastly superior to Cuccinelli's and to the public polling. If that is the case, it is a repeat of what happened in 2012, when Mitt Romney's pollsters, and the public pollsters, were outclassed by the Obama machine and its deadly combination of rigorous quantitative analysis and a vast army of ground volunteers vacuuming up large quantities of raw data and feeding it back to headquarters.  Because of the 2012 election and the massive amount of resources thrown into Virginia by President Obama's reelection campaign, the Democrats said they had better data on which to base their predictive models for who was going to vote, who they were going to vote for and who was open to being persuaded.  ""We just have richer data. We've been collecting more data and we've been using the same file more consistently for the past few years,"" McAuliffe campaign manager Robby Mook said last week.  This data edge drove the McAuliffe campaign's decisions on how to conduct its polling, which then dictated the results it got. It also drove the campaign's decisions on how to allocate ground-game resources, and early voting effort, as well as TV ad strategy.  If Republicans had hard data showing them closing to within a point or two, wouldn't that have drawn money for more ads into the race in the last few days? The fact that this didn't happen suggests the GOP was flying blind in Virginia, and that they are still struggling to catch up to Democrats in the realm of data-driven campaigns.  Although Republicans have promised that they are going to leapfrog the Democrats in running data-centric campaigns, the bottom line is they are trying to make up ground that has been lost over several years, which will take time to rectify.  ""The problem is not that this stuff takes a ton of money to figure out once you have the data. The problem is the gathering of the data is so fucking labor intensive and requires so much work,"" said one Republican operative. ""The richer the data you have, the better targeting you can do.""  That explains why the Republican National Committee dedicated its resources in Virginia to building out a ground operation. They spent $3 million on the race, but an RNC official acknowledged that their efforts were also “building the party’s presence in Virginia.”  “We went into this race working with the campaigns about what they needed to win based on their plans. We committed to funding/running the ground games and minority engagement –- that’s what we did,” the RNC official said.   The residue of the 2012 Obama campaign also helped McAuliffe with his ground game. The Democrat claimed to have 13,513 volunteers working for the campaign in the last four days, and said his campaign knocked on over 2 million doors and made 2 million phone calls. Cuccinelli said he doubted these numbers, but neither his campaign nor the RNC ever disclosed their own ground-game numbers, despite repeated requests before and after Election Day. None of this is to say that Obamacare is not a political problem for Democrats, and could play a big role in the 2014 midterms. “They have to get it fixed and they have to get it fixed fast,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost’s Sam Stein. But it’s not clear that in Virginia, Obamacare played the role some Republicans say it did. "

Software and hardware upgrades put in place since late October have been effective, said Jeffrey Zients, the Obama aide overseeing the repair effort to the online portal for health insurance enrollment in more than 30 states.""HealthCare.gov on Dec. 1 is night and day from where it was on Oct. 1,"" when the health insurance exchanges debuted, Zients said during a conference call with reporters Sunday. ""While we still have work to do, we've made significant progress with HealthCare.gov working smoothly for the vast majority of consumers."" The website can now handle 50,000 users at a time, which was the original goal, and 800,000 visitors a day, he said.The early consumer experience of Obamacare's health insurance exchanges was characterized by crashes, error messages, long wait times and faulty information, threatening the rollout of Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.December could now prove a crucial month for the first year of enrollment via the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces. Consumers who want health coverage in effect on Jan. 1 have until just Dec. 23 to select a health plan via the exchanges -- including many whose current policies don't meet Obamacare standards and can't be renewed for next year. A crush of consumers scrambling to get health insurance for the new year could test the rigor of the administration's fixes, and Zients said traffic to HealthCare.gov spiked over the Thanksgiving holiday compared a typical weekend, although he didn't provide figures. HuffPost readers: Do you plan to try HealthCare.gov or a state-run health insurance exchange website in December? Tell us about your experience -- email jeffrey.young@huffingtonpost.com. Please include your phone number if you're willing to be interviewed.Poor enrollment during the first month, when only about 106,000 people were able to enroll in private insurance via the exchanges, left the administration far from the 7 million projected to sign up by the end of the enrollment period on March 31. During that same time period, 1.5 million people had completed applications and more than 200,000 were pending, suggesting that demand for coverage is high.Almost 20,000 people signed up using HealthCare.gov between Nov. 24 and Nov. 26, the most so far in a three-day stretch, The New York Times reported Friday. And enrollment in some state-run health insurance exchanges, such as those in California, Kentucky, New York and Washington state, accelerated during November.Health insurance consumers who failed to get through the application and enrollment process during the first two months of the sign-up period will be the administration's first targets, Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during the Sunday conference call.""While we certainly want to and will invite new consumers into the site, our focus is on making sure that those who have tried to enroll in the past several weeks are able to successfully complete that process,"" Bataille said.A large majority of visitors to HealthCare.gov should now be able to submit an application for health coverage and enroll into a plan online, Bataille said. ""About five weeks ago, we were seeing only about 30 percent of consumers with information on hand able to complete the application successfully online. Today, we're now more in the zone of about 80 percent of users being able to do that same process successfully,"" she said.The remaining consumers can still use alternate methods to enroll, such as the health insurance exchanges' telephone hotline, Bataille said. And people can purchase health plans directly from insurers or from agents and brokers, although tax credits to cut the cost of coverage are available only via the exchanges in most cases. The administration is testing a system that would let people apply for tax credits directly through 16 insurers in Florida, Ohio and Texas, and the early results are ""encouraging,"" Bataille said.In late October, the White House placed Zients in charge of the overhaul effort, and the Department of Health and Human Services appointed Quality Software Services Inc., a unit of the health insurance company UnitedHealth Group that is one of the exchanges' main architects, as lead contractor. Since that time, administration officials have maintained that HealthCare.gov would work for most users by the end of November.Zients said that goal has been met and emphasized that work on improving the website and its underlying technology will continue through March. The team repairing HealthCare.gov made more than 400 software fixes and upgraded the hardware supporting the system using a ""punch list"" of identified problems.""Over the last five weeks, we've made substantial progress working through the punch list. We've executed hundreds of software fixes and hardware upgrades and the site is now stable and operating at its intended capacity with greatly improved performance,"" Zients said. HealthCare.gov's failure rate has dropped from about 6 percent in October to 0.75 percent as of Friday, according to a report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services on Sunday. The website was up and running 95 percent of the time as of Saturday, not counting scheduled maintenance, like an 11-hour period this weekend when applications and enrollments were offline -- an improvement from a low of 43 percent two months ago, the report says.Source: Department of Health and Human ServicesSource: Department of Health and Human ServicesSome problems remain unresolved and consumers and health insurance companies will still face difficulties, Bataille said. ""With any web project, there is not a magic moment but a process of continual improvement over time and we will continue to make enhances in the days, weeks and months ahead,"" she said.Health insurance companies have reported receiving incorrect information about their new customers since the beginning of the enrollment period and the administration is still working to fix these issues. Problems with the data HealthCare.gov sends to insurance issuers were a major part of the administration's push over recent says, Bataille said. Whether these flaws have been adequately addressed -- and whether consumers can be confident their enrollments are complete and their coverage will be effective next month -- won't be fully clear until more people sign up, Bataille said.""We need to see increased volumes of traffic and transactions, which we anticipate seeing over the course of the weekdays, to make sure that we get information from issuers and see the success rates they are having with the fixes put in place this week,"" Bataille said.Read the progress report on HealthCare.gov:  Healthcare.gov Progress Report"

House Bill 845, sponsored by Rep. Charles Van Zant (R-Keystone Heights), would make it a third-degree felony in Florida to perform an abortion based on the race or gender of the fetus. In his closing statements on Thursday, Van Zant accused Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers of intentionally targeting black people. ""The fact is, 80 percent of abortion clinics nationwide are located in minority neighborhoods where 43 percent of all black babies are aborted,"" Van Zant said, according to the Tampa Bay Times.""In America alone, without the Nazi Holocaust, without the Ku Klux Klan, Planned Parenthood and other abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973,"" he said. ""This is called discriminatory targeting."" Several black lawmakers became insulted during the debate, and at least five women walked out. Rep. Barbara Watson (D-Miami), one of the members who left, told HuffPost in a phone interview that she felt as if Van Zant was manipulating information to reflect his personal beliefs about abortion. ""I don't appreciate anyone trying to explain what any other ethnic group's lifestyle is and what they do, when you really don't have any authority to interpret it,"" she said. ""I think the women and people of color in that chamber deserve an apology from him, but I don't know that it would actually change his point of view."" Rep. Darryl Rouson (D-St. Petersburg) said he felt the bills' sponsors were disingenuous in their mission to save the black population from abortion. ""If these representatives truly care about even the subject matter of black genocide, I've got a few bills they could file,"" he said. ""That's what got me upset. They could have talked about the bill and its intent without trying to use black genocide and black babies to sway a vote.""Van Zant was not immediately available for comment. Anti-abortion activists have long accused Planned Parenthood of targeting African Americans, but a 2011 fact-check by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research organization, showed that only 9 percent of abortion clinics are located in predominantly black neighborhoods, while 63 percent of clinics are in non-Hispanic white neighborhoods. While black women have a disproportionately high abortion rate compared to other ethnic groups, Guttmacher research shows that could be attributed to higher rates of poverty among black women and the fact that 69 percent of pregnancies among black women are unintended, compared with 40 percent of pregnancies among whites. Florida representatives passed the anti-abortion bill after a long, fiery debate on Thursday by a vote 71-44, sending it to the state Senate. Rouson said that bill cosponsor Rep. Keith Perry (R-Gainesville) wrote him a personal letter after the vote to apologize for offending him. Rouson said he hopes the legislature can focus on something else now. ""I've been up here five sessions now, and every last one we're dealing with abortion bills,"" he said. ""You would think we could deal with some women's rights issues or things of great governmental concern, other than every year coming back and trying to do something with abortion.""UPDATE: 6:10 p.m. -- Rep. Keith Perry acknowledged in a phone interview with HuffPost on Friday that he did send an apology letter to Rouson out of a concern that he had offended him. But Perry said he stands by the comments he made on the House floor. ""What I did was speak some facts about percentages of abortion that are performed, and the ratios [for black women] far exceed the norm of the population,"" he said. ""And I'm not saying the facts are wrong, because they weren't, but the way it was presented, it certainly offended [members of the black caucus].""Perry added, ""The concern is whether or not there's a strategic marketing approach by people who provide abortions to target certain groups. I don't know if they do or not, but there's a concern that some people may share."""

""Buy Health Insurance,"" it touted with premiums as low as $25 a month. I was tempted. Health insurance, for me and for most Americans, is a necessary part of life, similar to home rent or mortgage, grocery bills and gasoline. Insurance is essential because a hospitalization for a few days costs $10,000 and medical bills for a major illness can lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments. So it is no wonder that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare, has created anxiety among many Americans. And, without doubt, the ACA has caused the health insurance market to go into upheaval, with a nonfunctional healthcare.gov website, with unexpected insurance cancellation notices, and now with a proposed ""fix"" by President Obama. So let me try to put things in perspective.The ACA is really a ""Health Insurance Reform Act"" -- its greatest impact is to increase the number of insured individuals, to guarantee essential benefits, and to regulate health insurance companies. Perhaps most importantly, it promises health insurance no matter what your preexisting conditions are.Today, 49 percent of Americans get their insurance from their employer and 28 percent are on government insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid. Combined, this represents nearly 80 percent of the population and they are largely unaffected directly by ACA. Another 15 percent are uninsured and they are being required to buy insurance; many of them will be helped with subsidies. Then there are 5 percent of Americans who have individual plans, and half of them are receiving letters from their insurance companies cancelling their policies.  These individual health plans vary. Some are Cadillac plans and they likely are not being cancelled because they meet the new benefits requirements. But many are ""junk"" or substandard health insurance, and they are being axed. Often, you only realize you have a substandard plan when you get ill. I have patients who stop coming to the clinic after the few initial visits and then become so ill they have to be admitted to the hospital. When I ask them why they stopped taking their lifesaving medicine and making clinic visits, their response is simple: ""My insurance ran out.""We know such substandard insurance plans abound. Of all the bankruptcies in America, 60 percent are due to medical bills, and 78 percent of these, are among patients who had health insurance and paid their monthly premiums. Imagine, going bankrupt from medical bills when you have health insurance. This defeats the purpose of having insurance. The ACA helps individuals by standardizing insurance benefits into 10 essential categories which include coverage for hospitalization, maternity, chronic disease and mental health, among others.Some say the ACA standardization is an upgrade of the insurance coverage. But I don't believe it's an upgrade from ""economy to the business class"" -- it's more like having all the basic safety features. It's like going from a single engine Cessna to a commercial plane. That insurance coverage offered on the telephone pole for $25 a month and those policies being cancelled fall into this category. The transition from substandard policy to standardized coverage will be difficult. A 30-year-old man is upset because he now has to pay a higher premium than a 30-year-old woman has to pay. But honestly, discriminating against a young woman by having her pay higher health insurance premiums because she might bear children one day is morally unacceptable. To ease the transitions, the ACA had a ""grandfather clause"" -- which is where the phrase ""If you like your coverage you could keep it"" originated. However it was only if no changes where made to it after March 2010 when the law was passed. The ""fix"" President Obama has proposed is to extend the grandfather clause.  Another major impact of ACA on health insurance is stricter regulation. Now, insurance companies are required to spend 80 to 85 percent of the premium money towards clinical care services (not administration) -- and any additional money has to be refunded. In 2012, under the ACA, $1.1 billion dollars were returned to policyholders through refunds. Such regulations ensure that insurance companies don't make a killing off of policyholders.The biggest question looming on the mind of most Americans is probably this: How will all these changes impact premiums? It's hard to tell. But it will not be a repeat of the decade before the ACA, where premiums doubled and many were dropped from their insurance just when they needed it most. Yet, the transition will be a bumpy ride.For more by Manoj Jain, MD MPH, click here.For more on health news, click here."

The development also comes just days before HealthCare.gov, the online portal for individual and family health coverage in more than 30 states, is supposed to be working better after its troubled first two months.Small businesses that want to utilize the federally run SHOP exchanges, and the tax credits worth up to half the cost of insurance that are available to some firms, will have to sign up through an insurance agent or broker or directly with a health insurance company, an administration official explained via email. In an attempt to mitigate the failure of the online application and enrollment process that was supposed to be in place, small businesses can submit their applications for tax credits whenever they file their taxes rather than in advance, the official wrote.“This new delay announcement is a disappointment but not a surprise. Small businesses continue to be low on the priority list during the Obamacare implementation process,"" Kevin Kuhlman, manager of legislative affairs at the National Federation of Independent Business, said in a written statement. ""The continued delays add to uncertainty and contribute to the decision of many owners to take early renewals of their small-group plans.” The National Federation of Independent Business opposed the Affordable Care Act and was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, which the Supreme Court ultimately upheld.The administration previously said online enrollment on the SHOP exchanges would be available by the end of this month, following earlier delays. Prior to Wednesday's announcement that the administration would facilitate enrollment via insurers, agents and brokers, paper applications were the only means small companies could employ to utilize the SHOP exchanges. Maryland also delayed its state-run SHOP exchange, though other states' exchanges are operational. The federal government is operating SHOP exchanges in more than 30 states, and the remainder are being run by states.""Small businesses will able to enroll directly into a SHOP plan through an insurer, agent or broker, and get can certified for a tax credit after they enroll. We will also offer an improved comparison shopping feature online so small businesses can choose a plan before enrolling in one,"" Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday.Unlike the federal- and state-run health insurance exchanges for individuals and families that limit sign-up to a certain period during the year, the SHOP exchanges are supposed to allow companies to enroll workers at any time. Still, companies with current benefits that expire at the end of the year have until just Dec. 23 to choose a health plan that will be in effect on Jan. 1, the official wrote.The delay of the SHOP exchanges is partly a byproduct of the administration's scramble to get HealthCare.gov reliably working for individual consumers, Bataille indicated. ""It was important for us to prioritize the functionality that would enable consumers, individually, to shop and enroll online in coverage,"" she said.Online enrollment won't be possible on the SHOP exchanges until next year for benefits that will be available in 2015, the administration said.Earlier this year, the administration delayed another key component of the SHOP exchanges. Under health care reform, small business employees were supposed to be able to choose among any of the plans available on the exchanges. For 2014, employers will select the coverage for all workers instead.This post has been updated with additional information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ended his symbolic filibuster Wednesday as Senate rules forced him to stop talking. Senators then voted to push ahead with the bill to fund the government that the Texan and his allies had tried to stall all night long.Cruz quit at noon to a smattering of Republican applause, ceding the floor at the technical start of a new legislative day after holding forth for more than 21 hours. He could have spoken longer, but had to stop for good at 1 p.m. for a vote to proceed with debate on the spending bill.The Senate voted unanimously to do so, including Cruz.Cruz is trying to block the spending bill, already passed by the House last week, even though it contains the provisions he requested to defund President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Money to keep the government open runs out Sept. 30, and Cruz is seeking to block the bill because he doesn't want Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to have the opportunity to amend the measure.The Texas senator has pointed to the next procedural vote in the process on Friday or Saturday -- to end debate -- as the key one in the fight. After that, Reid would be able to amend the bill with just 51 votes.But killing the legislation in the Senate would guarantee a government shutdown, and senators on both sides of the aisle would prefer to move the spending portion quickly, in hopes of leaving enough time to work out some sort of deal with the House.Still, Cruz, aided by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and several other senators, talked through the night, hoping to stall the process.Cruz spoke at seemingly infinite length, comparing his desire to defund Obamacare to the battle against the Nazis, the American Revolution, and other moments that he said were similar in that people said some fight couldn't be won.He resorted to many well-worn talking points against the health care law, and also sprinkled in the sorts of odd references that can crop up when someone talks for so long, reading Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters via C-Span, claiming that his dad invented that dish, and even channeling Darth Vader in response to a line from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).""I will confess that that phrase, a 'rebellion against oppression,' conjured up to me the rebel alliance fighting against the empire, the empire being the Washington, D.C., establishment,"" Cruz said on Wednesday morning. ""I wondered if at some point we were going to see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forth and say in a deep voice, 'Mike Lee, I am your father.'""""This is a fight to restore freedom to the people,"" he added, completing the analogy. ""This is a fight to get the Washington establishment -- the empire -- to listen to the people.""Cruz's talkathon would have constituted the fourth longest filibuster in modern history, but Democrats have been calling it a ""faux filibuster"" because it had no chance to stop the vote, which was already determined under the chamber's rules.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) emerged shortly after Cruz yielded the floor to commend the Texas senator for holding the floor ""for nearly a day, speaking passionately about an issue that unites every single Republican.""But McConnell had been noticeably absent from Cruz's talkathon after stating Tuesday that he disagreed with his colleague's approach, which he said would put House Republicans in a ""tough spot.""The biggest opposition to Cruz's tactics came from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has butted heads with the junior senator all year. In a lengthy floor speech ahead of the vote, McCain dubbed Cruz's marathon a case of ""extended oratory.""""I can't call it a filibuster because filibusters delay passage of legislation,"" McCain said.He added that Obamacare was ""a major issue in the [2012] campaign.""""I campaigned all over America for two months everywhere I could, and in every single campaign rally I said, 'And we have to repeal and replace Obamacare,'"" McCain said. ""Well, the people spoke. They spoke, much to my dismay, but they spoke and they reelected the president of the United States.""""Now, that doesn't mean that we give up our efforts to try to repeal and replace Obamacare, but it does mean that elections have consequences,"" he added."
14396	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/02/white-house-obamacare-website_n_4374136.html	News	0	Healthcare	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"By David Morgan and Lewis KrauskopfDec 2 (Reuters) - A surge of visitors clogged the U.S. government's revamped healthcare insurance shopping website on Monday, signaling that President Barack Obama's administration has a way to go in fixing the portal that showcases his signature domestic policy.Facing its first big test since officials proclaimed over the weekend that they had met their deadline to make HealthCare.gov run smoothly for the ""vast majority"" of users, the site performed markedly better than it did during its disastrous launch two months ago - but was still short of the crisply running insurance marketplace Obama once touted.By 12 p.m. ET (1700 GMT), the website had logged 375,000 visitors, the White House said, nearly half the 800,000 daily users the refurbished site is supposed to be able to handle.In states such as New jersey, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Texas and North Carolina, the rush of traffic led to the deployment of a new feature on the site - a waiting page that said there were ""a lot of visitors right now,"" and put people in line to be serviced, usually within minutes or even seconds.That was viewed as significant progress for a website that has become the face of perhaps one of the biggest crises of Obama's administration, one that has undermined the Democratic president's promotion of an activist government and threatened to become a drag on Democrats in next year's elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.But HealthCare.gov's hiccups on Monday fueled questions about whether it will be able to enroll several million uninsured and under-insured Americans in private insurance programs by the end of March - a major goal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.More immediately, the website will be pushed further by waves of visitors seeking to sign up for insurance by Dec. 23, the deadline to get coverage that begins Jan. 1.For all of the efforts by tech specialists to improve the site, officials still are scrambling to repair and install functions on the ""back end"" of the Obamacare system that are needed to finalize enrollments with insurers. That could create another headache for the administration starting in January, if the enrollments for some who sign up for coverage via the website are not finalized before their coverage is supposed to begin.""The real challenges remain, and that's downstream,"" said Rick Howard, research director for the technology consultant Gartner. ""The real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is.""The administration said that in meetings with insurers and healthcare officials this week, it will refocus attention efforts to nail down functions for handling insurance payments, including federal subsidies for low-income consumers buying coverage under Obamacare.Without those functions working properly, HealthCare.gov and websites for 14 state-run marketplaces could have difficulty operating in 2014.At the White House on Monday, Obama spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that ""the work is not done"" on the website.Carney added that the waiting page that some visitors saw was created in part because officials knew that Monday would put a strain on the system.""We absolutely anticipated that on this day in particular, because it is the first workday after the deadline we set ... to make sure that the website was functioning effectively for the vast majority of users, we would see a surge in visitors,"" Carney said. ENCOURAGING NUMBERSFor the White House and supporters of Obamacare, the encouraging news on Monday was that the pace of enrollments in healthcare programs has increased dramatically since Oct. 1, when the administration's enthusiastic launch of HealthCare.gov was quickly tempered by problems with the website that allowed few people to enroll.Preliminary government data indicated that about 100,000 people chose a health plan through HealthCare.gov during November, as officials and tech specialists scrambled to improve the site's capacity, according to a source familiar with the issue. In October, only about 27,000 had enrolled via the site.The federally run HealthCare.gov site handles enrollments for 36 states. The 14 other states and Washington, D.C., have their own exchanges under Obamacare. The state-run exchanges have had fewer technical problems and generally are in states that are most enthusiastic about Obamacare, so their enrollments figures have been relatively high, including 80,000 in California and 50,000 in New York.Official November data will be released in two weeks. But if the November estimate for HealthCare.gov enrollments is correct, it means at least 290,000 people have signed up for private insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.That is still far short of the administration's projection in September that nearly 500,000 people would sign up through the insurance marketplaces in the first month, according to documents obtained by congressional investigators.Ultimately, 7 million Americans were expected to sign up for private health insurance offered through the online marketplaces for 2014, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).The website's issues have put that goal in doubt, and administration officials have begun playing down the importance of getting 7 million enrollees in Obamacare for 2014. On Monday, Carney emphasized that the CBO, not the White House, that produced that estimate for total enrollment.

His story was one that was all too common in the age of Obama, Cruz concluded.Well, it turns out that Connelly isn't the biggest fan of Cruz. What's more, he is actually a beneficiary of the very health care law that Cruz was protesting during his speech. And in an appearance on MSNBC Friday morning, Connelly explained just how ironic it was that the senator would use his story to bludgeon the president and the Affordable Care Act.""A friend of mine called me the next morning as I was on the way to an optometrist appointment ....

Only Texas beats the uninsured population of the Sunshine State, where 24.8 percent of residents under 65 were uninsured in 2011, the most recent year figures were available from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Associated Press reports. Of those 3.8 million uninsured Floridians, more than 500,000 are younger than 19, according to the Miami Herald. Despite the alarming rates, Florida has moved to thwart the expansion of Medicaid, a key component of the ACA. The state refused to enlarge the program using federal funds and also declined to set up a state-run exchange. While Governor Rick Scott (R) led an unsuccessful push to overturn the ACA in court, Florida's House republicans turned their backs on the Senate's bipartisan expansion plan, choosing to use $300 million in state funds to purchase coverage for 130,000 Floridians instead of federal grants that would cover an estimated 1.1 million residents. By insisting on an alternative to the ACA, Florida turned away an estimated total of $50 billion in federal funding spread over the next decade to a number of crucial programs -- including a federally funded, voluntary home visitation program proven to prevent child abuse, infant drug dependency, and unemployment. State Rep. Matt Hudson (R-Naples), then chair of the state's Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee, told the Times in 2011 that the state was not required to accept federal grants. “I do not believe that act is the right thing for the country or the right thing for Florida,” he said, ""and I am not going to start implementing things that I don’t believe in.""Florida voters rejected a symbolic amendment against the ACA last fall -- and Scott eventually endorsed expansion -- but the legislature didn't stop there. Scott and others approved a law last month requiring a disclosure form that will tell policyholders how the Affordable Care Act will impact their premiums. An ""incredible waste of money,"" Florida Consumer Action Network's Bill Newton called the move, while others criticized the state for knowingly using inaccurate numbers to describe the cost of expansion. Scott even raised privacy concerns over data that will collected by ""navigators"" hired to help low-income Floridians negotiate the new national insurance exchanges. ""In states like Florida that seem determined to sabotage reform,"" wrote the Times editorial board, ""the uninsured may have a very hard time getting the coverage they need and deserve."""

The number has obviously exceeded expectations,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said at a news briefing.""To make further improvements, we are doing several things at once, including adding server capacity and making software changes to make the system more efficient to handle higher volume.""IT experts told Reuters last week they believed flaws in the system's architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems of the first week.One expert told Reuters the site's design triggered too many requests to the server simultaneously, which created a situation similar to when hackers attack a site, known as a distributed denial of service attack.Carney said a particular component of the system within the account registration function was not able to handle the high volume, causing problems for consumers at the registration process.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ""has put up a gate at the front end of the system that places visitors into a waiting room and lets them in at a particular pace, so that the surge in volume does not cause the problems that it caused in the past,"" Carney said.""Thus far, we've reduced waiting room times by a third and are increasingly moving more users through the system, but we're not satisfied with the performance.""In response to the early glitches, supporters of the law have pointed to the fact that enrollment in the online healthcare exchanges is set to run through the end of March, allowing for several months to work out the kinks.Including separate websites run by individual states alone, the exchanges are expected to enroll 7 million Americans next year, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

""There was some hope that once the Supreme Court ruled in July and then once an election occurred there would be a sense that, 'This is the law of the land, let's get on board, let's make this work.' And yet we will find ourselves having state by state political battles.""One factor that contributed to the law's unpopularity for a large segment of the American public is the fact that its benefits have taken several years to impact people directly. Only in 2014 will many of its broadest benefits take effect, extending health coverage to millions more people.At the same time, Republican governors and legislatures in states including Texas, Louisiana and South Carolina have refused to set up state-run exchanges where individuals would be able to buy insurance and have rejected the law's provision to allow more low-income people to enroll in Medicaid insurance.""It is very difficult when people live in a state where there is a daily declaration, 'We will not participate in the law,' for them to figure out whether they are going to benefit,"" Sebelius said at an event at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, presented in collaboration with Reuters.Opponents of Medicaid expansion have argued that states could find themselves saddled with untenable financial burdens if the federal government later cut back its funding to the program.Loudest among them has been the voice of Texas' Republican Governor Rick Perry, who has described the Medicaid program as ""a broken system.""Other prominent Republicans have sought to compromise - in Florida, Governor Rick Scott has sought, so far unsuccessfully to persuade his legislative colleagues to accept the Medicaid expansion.The law also faces continued opposition from corners of the $2.8 trillion U.S. healthcare industry.Sebelius, addressing the issue of feared increases in health insurance premiums because of the law, said competition to provide a set of mandated basic benefits would help.""For the first time ever in the history of the United States, they'll have to compete for service and customers, not by cherry-picking the market (and) trying to figure out who can only insure people who promise never to get sick,"" she said.Sebelius is one of a handful of members of Obama's cabinet to stay on for the president's second term in office.

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said Tuesday, in another sign of a growing split in the Republican Party.""I want to defund this bill, but I also want a way to do it that kills it,"" Coburn, who was one of the health care law's most vocal opponents when it passed, said in a Senate floor speech.He argued that the plan by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and several other tea party-backed senators to try and strip funds for the law from a September government funding bill simply won't work.The reason, Coburn argued, is that most of the spending in Obamacare is mandatory, and the spending cannot be touched, even if the GOP were to shut down the rest of the government. He cited a new Congressional Research Service report that found as much.""There's not a legislative method that we have that is capable of defunding it short of 67 votes in the U.S. Senate, short of two-thirds [of the] votes in the U.S. House,"" Coburn said, referring to the number of votes needed to override the presidential veto that would be sure to block any attempt to defund the law.Nevertheless, Lee said that the GOP has an obligation to try.He and Cruz argued that if the House passed a bill to fund all of the government except for Obamacare and the president blocked it, it would be the White House shutting down the government, not the GOP. They also contended that this year was Republicans' last real chance to stop the health care law before it is fully implemented, and said any members of the GOP who don't stand against it now are essentially guaranteeing the law will continue to exist.""Defund it, or own it,"" Lee said to his colleagues. ""If you fund it, you're for it.""Cruz told reporters shortly before taking to the floor that Americans would essentially be hooked on the law if it's not blocked by the start of next year.""Jan. 1 is when the exchanges start and subsidies start. And the administration's plan is to get as many people as possible addicted to the sugar, addicted to the subsidies,"" Cruz said, arguing that entitlements never get repealed.""It is an iron rule of politics that those who receive subsidies, inevitably, after they start receiving those subsidies, fight to retain those subsidies,"" Cruz said. ""They want as many people as possible receiving those subsidies in order to ensure that they remain a permanent aspect of the economy.""But other Republicans, like Coburn, think a shutdown showdown is doomed to not only fail, but to make Americans angry at the GOP, potentially harming chances to win fights in other areas, from tax reform and the debt ceiling later this year to next year's elections.Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) has called the defunding gambit the ""dumbest idea"" he's ever heard. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) warned against it, while Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Americans were tired of GOP-led debt ceiling and government shutdown ""shenanigans."" Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said shutting down the government was ""foolish.""Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) added her criticism to the chorus Tuesday, saying the plan was simply not realistic, and that it was both bad policy and bad politics.""The American people want commonsense solutions,"" Collins told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""They don't want us to pursue policies that are pointless, that are going to end in governments shutting down, more partisanship, more gridlock. They want us to actually get things done.""Even conservative Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) was not willing to join Lee, Cruz and company, although he opposes Obamacare.""We all agree and have voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. Our conference is united on that,"" he told HuffPost. ""Now we're just working through what's the best tactic or strategy to do it. So we're working through that, and obviously there are different opinions. Nobody wants the government to shut down. Nobody wants that to happen.""Nevertheless, Cruz said he saw a path, saying that ""August is a critical period"" to convince the public to put pressure on lawmakers while they are on their month-long recess.""If we see a grassroots tsunami, if we see millions of Americans stand up and say, 'Stop giving speeches about Obamacare, stop casting symbolic votes that don't do anything, and actually stand and fight,' if senators, if members of the House actually listen to their constituents, I believe we will return and come September... I believe we will succeed in getting either 41 senators in the Senate to stand together, or 218 members in the House to stand together. That's the path to winning this fight,"" Cruz said. The 41 senators he referred to are the number needed to filibuster a bill in the Senate.Cruz -- who argued on the Senate floor that no ""parade of horribles"" materialized when the GOP shut down government for several weeks in the Clinton era -- told reporters that Republicans need to stop being afraid of being blamed.""Republicans actually will have to stand up and fight and win the argument, and say, 'No, we have voted to fund the federal government. We want to keep the federal government funded, and why is President Obama threatening to shut down the federal government in order to force Obamacare down the American people's throats?'""During the shutdowns in 1995, the GOP took adamant positions on the budget while Clinton signaled willingness to negotiate. The showdowns are widely credited with aiding Democrats in the 1996 elections. "

Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said as he left a closed-door meeting of the House Republican conference on Saturday afternoon.During the meeting, GOP leaders announced plans to advance a bill that would keep the government funded beyond Sept. 30 in exchange for a one-year delay of Obamacare and repeal of its medical device tax. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) declared the proposal dead on arrival a couple hours later.But conservatives were jubilant as they left the meeting, and they identified Cruz as the force that pushed a reluctant GOP leadership to the brink.""I think Ted Cruz did a huge service to the nation and to the cause of Republicanism,"" Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) told The Huffington Post.""[He played] an excellent role,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.). ""I think what he's done is strengthened our hand. He's made the case that we need to act and act decisively, and so I think we have a lot to credit him for.""Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) called Cruz's role ""huge.""""He's been the rallying flag that has pulled Republicans around conservatives,"" Fleming said. ""Just the mere fact that he's out there talking, that he's had petitions going, that he did a 21-hour [speech] that was highlighted in the media … all of these things are building energy among Republicans and conservatives who are unified in the fact that we oppose Obamacare.""Cruz, along with his main ally Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), spent much of the summer mounting a full-fledged campaign to include a provision defunding Obamacare in a bill to fund the government. He starred in robocalls and television and radio ads, and raised millions for a possible White House bid in 2016, all while ramping up pressure on the House to yield to his demands.At first, House Republicans seemed content to pass a continuing resolution that defunded Obamacare and leave it to Cruz to filibuster any attempts by Reid to amend it. The Texas senator failed to gather enough support from his colleagues to mount a filibuster and embarked on a 21-hour floor speech anyway.As the Cruz show ran its course, House GOP leaders looked unlikely to tamper with Obamacare once again in their next government funding offer. They instead shifted focus to the pending debt ceiling fight, unveiling plans to seek a one-year delay in the implementation of Obamacare in exchange for raising the nation's borrowing limit.But once again, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) found himself up against Cruz.National Review reported that Cruz told House conservatives in a Thursday conference call to oppose leadership's fiscal strategy. Two days after the call, GOP leaders once again hinged funding for the government on Obamacare and dramatically raised the odds of a shutdown.Some Republicans denied that Cruz was responsible.""That's a different body over there,"" said Rep.

The number has obviously exceeded expectations,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said at a news briefing.""To make further improvements, we are doing several things at once, including adding server capacity and making software changes to make the system more efficient to handle higher volume.""IT experts told Reuters last week they believed flaws in the system's architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems of the first week.One expert told Reuters the site's design triggered too many requests to the server simultaneously, which created a situation similar to when hackers attack a site, known as a distributed denial of service attack.Carney said a particular component of the system within the account registration function was not able to handle the high volume, causing problems for consumers at the registration process.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ""has put up a gate at the front end of the system that places visitors into a waiting room and lets them in at a particular pace, so that the surge in volume does not cause the problems that it caused in the past,"" Carney said.""Thus far, we've reduced waiting room times by a third and are increasingly moving more users through the system, but we're not satisfied with the performance.""In response to the early glitches, supporters of the law have pointed to the fact that enrollment in the online healthcare exchanges is set to run through the end of March, allowing for several months to work out the kinks.Including separate websites run by individual states alone, the exchanges are expected to enroll 7 million Americans next year, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

A new study has found that Corbett's decision might end up costing the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Expanding Medicaid in Pennsylvania would have increased the annual amount of money the state receives from the federal government by around $2 billion, adding about $200 million in state revenue every year, according to a new study by the RAND Corporation, the nation's largest independent health policy research program. The study's findings contradict remarks made by the governor during his budget address last month when he said that “without serious reforms, [Medicaid expansion] would be financially unsustainable for the taxpayers."" Medicaid expansion, which the Supreme Court ruled states could opt in or out of, would increase medical coverage to families that earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Many Republican governors have opposed the measure.Had Pennsylvania opted into Medicaid expansion, the state would have received around $6 billion in federal funding for health care programs in 2014, according to the study. That's $2 billion more than it will receive without expanding Medicaid. The increase in funding would have added 35,000 jobs and provided a $3 billion boost in economic activity, according to the study.“This is money that is coming into the state that wouldn’t otherwise,” RAND mathematician and lead study author Carter Price told The Huffington Post. “There are certainly substantive benefits, in that you have more people covered, more revenue coming in the state and more jobs.”But Price cautions that the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare will eventually come with a cost. Starting in 2017, the federal government will begin to pay less of the state costs of the expansion, causing Pennsylvania's revenue increases to decline over time. "
14555	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/25/obamacare-website-headaches_n_4161042.html	News	0	Healthcare	None	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"By Caroline HumerNEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Americans hitting roadblocks on the new U.S. government-run healthcare website have been contacting insurers directly and enrolling in plans away from the federal marketplace, representing a lost opportunity for President Barack Obama's landmark reform.Since its launch on Oct. 1, technical problems have stalled Healthcare.gov, the website meant to help millions of uninsured Americans sign up for coverage as part of the biggest U.S. social program since Medicare plans for the elderly launched in the 1960s.Nearly a dozen insurance companies offering plans on the exchange who were interviewed by Reuters say they have received at most a trickle of enrollments through the federal marketplace serving 36 states, some of them with errors that require the insurers to separately verify information about applicants.At the same time, consumer inquiries at insurance company call centers and websites are up, in some case even double the amount of normal traffic. When they hear from potential customers who appear to qualify for government subsidized plans, they take phone numbers, create shopping baskets for the plans they like and send them to Healthcare.gov to verify eligibility.But if the shoppers do not qualify for a subsidy, insurers say they sell them a plan directly. More often than not, those plans are individual policies that are not available on the government-run exchange. PHONES RINGING 'OFF THE HOOK'Health First Health Plans in Florida, one of nine insurers selling individual plans in the state through Healthcare.gov, has sold only a handful of exchange-based plans through the government marketplace.But its phones have been ringing ""off the hook"" since Oct. 1, said Jason Alford, director of individual and marketplace sales. Many of the sales are for plans that extend coverage from 2013 into 2014 and that do not include many of the government program's most significant benefit requirements.""We have begun taking a number of off-exchange applications,"" Alford said.A chain of five Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance plans, including BCBS of Texas and BCBS of Oklahoma, said it is also sending buyers who qualify for subsidies to the exchange, while those who do not qualify for subsidies have been buying off exchange plans more often.""I'm very hopeful that individuals will come back and purchase the product,"" said Kurt Kossen, vice president of retail at parent company Health Care Service Corp, referring to customers who get information about a plan but do not buy it on the spot.The move off exchanges is another way in which the Healthcare.gov problems may jeopardize the administration's efforts to sign up as many as 7 million Americans for coverage on the exchanges in their first year, including an estimated 2.7 million young and healthy members needed to make the system work financially.The administration and the contractors it has hired say they are working around the clock to fix the problems. The government said on Thursday that about 700,000 applications have been submitted so far for coverage through Healthcare.gov and 14 insurance exchanges run by states.The loss of potential customers could become more critical if the federal exchange is not fixed in time for an expected influx of enrollments by Dec. 15, the last day to sign up and have benefits available on Jan. 1.Dan Mendelson, Chief Executive Officer at Avalere Health, which has been tracking the exchanges closely, said although he expects the Healthcare.gov problems to be solved, ""There is a void right now and the void is being filled in many cases by insurers engaging directly with patients.""He said that ""ultimately there will be a modest uptick in the off-exchange products as a result of this."" WHITE HOUSE PROMISES FIXWhite House officials on Wednesday met with chief executives of 12 leading insurance companies, including Aetna Inc, Humana Inc and WellPoint Inc. The administration promised to fix problems with enrollment data sent to the health plans and address issues that have prevented insurers from directly enrolling consumers who are eligible for subsidies.For some small insurers selling only on the exchange, the technology issues have affected all of their business. Community First Health Plans in San Antonio, Texas said that it was still experiencing technical problems and that the volume of sales was small. Community Health Choice in Houston, Texas said sales from the federal exchange had been slow.""I see that every day the system is getting a little bit easier,"" said Daisy Morales, vice president of marketing and outreach.Some insurers are selling 2013 plans that extend into 2014 and do not have all the benefits required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly called ""Obamacare,"" making them less costly.As a result, a shift to off-exchange products could signal that more healthy consumers will not be part of the Obamacare exchanges.In the first year of the exchanges, insurers are reimbursed by the Obamacare risk adjustment program if they enroll very sick people. The more people in the pool, the lower the risk, and in the health insurance market, lower risk has meant more competition and lower premium prices.""I can't give you a magic number, but insurers need a big enough pool of risk,"" said Jay Angoff, a former official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who now works as a lawyer at Mehri & Skalet in Washington DC.Jefferies & Co analyst David Windley said that a weaker enrollment in Obamacare exchanges, with a final tally of a few million consumers, could mean the risk pool has a higher concentration of sick consumers.It would mean ""that the healthy ones tried and gave up (on enrollment) and the sick ones were the persistent ones that actually got through the process,"" Windley said.In 2014, risk adjustment payments would help cover any hit that insurers take because of the sicker population. After that, it could mean higher premiums and therefore more government spending per person on subsidies.WellPoint Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said in an interview that the company, which has the largest presence on exchanges among health insurers, is selling both exchange-based products and off-exchange products from its websites. It sends people eligible for subsidies to Healthcare.gov.""It messes the timing up a little, just because those off exchange can get in a little bit sooner,"" DeVeydt said. ""It doesn't change the outlook. None of these policies start until Jan. 1 anyway.""At the same time, WellPoint on Wednesday told investors it would not yet give a forecast for 2014 financial results due to uncertainty over how the Obamacare exchanges will work next year."

The economy seems to be on the right track. Just last week the stock market reached record highs and the jobless rate fell to its lowest point in four years. The war in Iraq is over and most American troops are scheduled to be out of Afghanistan by the end of next year. The GOP appears to have lost the advantage to Democrats on gun control and immigration, and abortion and gay rights are no longer the reliable campaign wedge issues they once were.That leaves ObamaCare and ""big government spending"" as just about the only issues that remain for right-leaning candidates, barring any unforeseen domestic or global calamity. But if their campaigns against ObamaCare next year are as successful as their campaigns against it were in the 2010 midterms -- and the White House and supporters of the law are once again asleep at the switch -- GOP candidates might not need anything else to talk about to take both houses of Congress.When Barack Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, there was wide support for health care reform, and Republican strategists knew it. They realized they might be able to turn reform into a winning issue for their candidates by mounting a campaign to make people afraid of what the Democrats might try to do. So just as Congress was beginning preliminary work on what eventually became the Affordable Care Act, GOP message guru Frank Luntz persuaded his clients to condemn whatever the Democrats proposed as a ""government takeover of health care.""Even though the bill that ultimately became law was anything but a government takeover, GOP lawmakers and candidates never missed an opportunity to insist that it was. Luntz' sound bite was repeated hundreds of times in floor speeches by Republican members of Congress in the hours before the House voted on its version of the bill on November 7, 2009.Their fear-based campaign worked so well to influence public opinion that GOP candidates have never stopped using the ""government takeover"" meme, which is why the perception of ObamaCare as being exactly that has become a reality for millions of Americans.When you consider the inadequate job that the White House and the president's supporters have done in explaining how the law benefits just about every one of us -- and never letting us forget why reform was necessary in the first place -- it's little wonder Republicans see opportunity once again.There no doubt will be glitches when the online health insurance exchanges go live on October 1 for the relatively small percentage of Americans who will use them to shop for coverage because their employers don't offer health insurance as an employee benefit. The exchanges will work just fine for the vast majority of people, but there will be some who will have complaints. You can expect the law's critics to give every one of them a voice in their effort to create the impression that the exchanges are a disaster and that the government can't do anything right.Similarly, some people who have been paying relatively low premiums for what they don't realize is junk insurance will be upset when junk insurance is outlawed next year. Because real insurance costs more than junk, some invariably will complain about having to pay higher premiums for coverage that will actually be there if and when they need it.You can also expect that a fair number of folks will squawk when the requirement to have health insurance kicks in on January 1. And you can bet that the opponents of the law will be aided, unwittingly in most but certainly not all cases, by the media. Just as local TV reporters tell us about the drivers who crash into each other instead of the rest of us who get to our destinations unharmed, the media will focus on the glitches. And they'll interview far more complainers than happy campers.I'm betting that Frank Luntz and other Republican strategists have already been hired to craft the sound bites to use against Democrats next year. If the Democrats and consumer advocates who support ObamaCare are not at work developing their own strategies to counter the coming barrage of misleading spin, the GOP will have an excellent chance of controlling Capitol Hill after the next elections."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was bemoaning the ""defeatist attitude"" of his fellow Republican senators, his close ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) acknowledged Obamacare won't be defunded in a bill to keep the federal government open.The Kentucky Republican stood with Cruz in his all-night speech against Obamacare, but later on Wednesday Paul added his name to those who say the writing is on the wall.""I'm not saying we would get everything we want. We don't want to fund [Obamacare] at all, but I'm ready to admit we may not get that,"" Paul told reporters shortly after he voted to begin debate on the government funding bill passed by House Republicans last week. That bill would keep the federal government open beyond Sept. 30, but permanently strips the Affordable Care Act of its funding, as Cruz and his allies have demanded. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is expected to amend the measure to restore funding for the Affordable Care Act in the course of a subsequent procedural vote that requires a simple majority.Republicans, with 46 votes, could stop the bill during the procedural motion; but many of them oppose shutting down the federal government, especially since it wouldn't lead to the end of Obamacare, and the GOP is likely to bear the brunt of the blame.To Cruz, who spoke Wednesday on Rush Limbaugh's radio show, that stance shows that Republicans are ""beaten down.""""The single biggest surprise about arriving to the Senate is the defeatist attitude here,"" Cruz said.While Paul joined Cruz in his 21-hour talkathon -- which outlasted Paul's 13-hour talking filibuster earlier this year -- the senator from the Bluegrass State conceded Wednesday afternoon that the Senate should no longer delay sending a revised continuing resolution to the House GOP leaders, who will only have one day to pass the measure in order to avert a government shutdown.""We've spent a lot of time on this, and it's time to vote,"" Paul said. ""I think the sooner we're done with this, the better chance we have of not having the government shut down.""""I think it's presumptuous of me to tell the House what to do, but I think the goal of everybody should be to try to do something right and at the same time not shut down the government,"" Paul added.The Kentucky senator argued that Reid and President Barack Obama are pushing the country to the brink of a shutdown by refusing to compromise on the health care law, and called for a ""a discussion over how we could make the bill less bad.""""I think if you analyze this situation, this is us saying the bill has many problems. Even one of the authors of the bill says there's problems with the bill,"" Paul said. ""But if they're unwilling to revisit the bill and compromise on anything ... maybe some of you in the media ought to ask ... why are they shutting down the government in order to get everything they want?""Paul was among nearly a dozen Republican signatories on a letter distributed by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) in July that called on the conference to oppose any continuing resolution that included funding for Obamacare. In recent weeks, Cruz and Lee have insisted that any vote to advance the House-passed bill is a vote for Obamacare, because it would enable Reid to keep the health care law funded.Paul was hesitant to share that opinion.""I don't really want to characterize what I think the vote means,"" he said. ""I think that the Republican caucus has been united in its opposition to Obamacare.""""All I know is at this time, my conclusion is -- and apparently a lot of people's conclusion is -- we ought to get to the votes,"" Paul added later, as reporters continued to press him on Cruz's strategy. ""If we're going to send something to the House, I think get something over there sooner rather than later. That's always been my opinion.""He commended Cruz's speech, noting opposition to Obamacare has been a motivating issue for tea party and grassroots activists in the Republican Party.""I don't think you're finding many people out in the countryside or across the country saying, 'Oh, it's a bad idea to stand up to Obamacare,'"" Paul said. ""What makes it difficult is people really probably don't want to shut down the government, and I don't either ... so it is a difficult situation."""

""There was some hope that once the Supreme Court ruled in July and then once an election occurred there would be a sense that, 'This is the law of the land, let's get on board, let's make this work.' And yet we will find ourselves having state by state political battles.""One factor that contributed to the law's unpopularity for a large segment of the American public is the fact that its benefits have taken several years to impact people directly. Only in 2014 will many of its broadest benefits take effect, extending health coverage to millions more people.At the same time, Republican governors and legislatures in states including Texas, Louisiana and South Carolina have refused to set up state-run exchanges where individuals would be able to buy insurance and have rejected the law's provision to allow more low-income people to enroll in Medicaid insurance.""It is very difficult when people live in a state where there is a daily declaration, 'We will not participate in the law,' for them to figure out whether they are going to benefit,"" Sebelius said at an event at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, presented in collaboration with Reuters.Opponents of Medicaid expansion have argued that states could find themselves saddled with untenable financial burdens if the federal government later cut back its funding to the program.Loudest among them has been the voice of Texas' Republican Governor Rick Perry, who has described the Medicaid program as ""a broken system.""Other prominent Republicans have sought to compromise - in Florida, Governor Rick Scott has sought, so far unsuccessfully to persuade his legislative colleagues to accept the Medicaid expansion.The law also faces continued opposition from corners of the $2.8 trillion U.S. healthcare industry.Sebelius, addressing the issue of feared increases in health insurance premiums because of the law, said competition to provide a set of mandated basic benefits would help.""For the first time ever in the history of the United States, they'll have to compete for service and customers, not by cherry-picking the market (and) trying to figure out who can only insure people who promise never to get sick,"" she said.Sebelius is one of a handful of members of Obama's cabinet to stay on for the president's second term in office.

In the United States, only 25 percent of those surveyed in late August in a HuffPost/YouGov poll expressed support for a military strike in reaction to the lethal chemical weapons attack blamed widely on the regime of Syrian president Bashar Assad. A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center and wrapped up Sept. 1 -– almost two weeks after the chemical weapons attack -– found only 29 percent in favor of a strike. In France, where President Francois Hollande has pledged to join the United States in taking on Syria, public support for military intervention has been running at 45 percent, according to a recent CSA survey for Atlantico. Another poll conducted by Ifop for the newspaper Le Figaro found 55 percent in favor of intervention, yet only 41 percent approved of France joining in a military response.In Britain, where polls have long shown consistent opposition to any form of intervention in Syria, neither allegations of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime nor the push for action from leaders in London and Washington has altered the opinion of a war-weary public. A ComRes poll for the Independent newspaper published on Monday found that only 29 percent of people believe Britain should join the United States in launching air strikes against Syria to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, while 57 percent are outright opposed. Four out of five people assert that any military action against Syria requires the approval of the United Nations.ComRes chairman Andrew Hawkins told The Huffington Post UK that he doesn’t believe a forthcoming report from the United Nations weapons inspectors will “move the dials, and neither would further chemical crimes by Assad -– at least on the scale seen so far.” In Germany, public opinion has been running 58 percent against striking Syria, according to public television. And in Italy a recent poll by the IPR Institute found that 52 percent of the public opposed an attack on Syria even absent Italian involvement. About 57 percent of Italians opposed allowing Italian military bases to be used in assisting foreign strikes engaged in strikes.No polls have been conducted to gauge Canadian opinion on military intervention, but fatigue from involvement in Afghanistan and a few anti-Syrian-intervention protests suggest Canadians are not eager to jump in. Canada has signaled that it will not offer military support for a potential U.S.-led strike on Syria, while lending voice to calls for action.Signs of public opposition from around the globe resonate as a rebuke to the Obama administration as it presses to unleash weapons on Syria in response to a chemical weapons attack there blamed for the deaths of some 1,400 people.Public resistance reflects a marked predilection against military intervention following disastrous wars involving foreign forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. This sentiment appears to run especially deep in France, which played a leading role in interventions in Libya and Mali over the past two years. “In Mali, France went in alone, and in Libya, it was the spearhead,"" Jerome Fourquet, who heads the Opinion department at Ifop, told Le Huffington Post. ""Public opinion considers it not the job of the French to be the world’s policeman.” Public opposition also speaks to a palpable distrust of the intelligence touted in Washington as justification for firing on Syria. Memories of the run-up to the Iraq war and bogus claims that then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction have carried over to the conflict at hand.Among the British public, the ComRes poll found that 62 percent of voters felt the “experience of the Iraq war means that Britain should keep out of any military conflicts in the Middle East for the foreseeable future.""Another poll conducted by Survation for the Mail on Sunday newspaper found that 81 percent of people opposed to military action cited Iraq as an influence. Around 40 percent said that calls for air strikes in Syria by former Prime Minister Tony Blair –- a leading architect of the Iraq war -- had weakened, rather than strengthened the British government’s case.Much of the public opposition to Syria strikes reflects the fact that the conflict there is viewed as a confined event -– a humanitarian disaster, yes, and a potentially dangerous regional crisis, but not a direct threat to people living in the countries being asked to marshal a military response.Governments in Washington, London, France and Ottawa have portrayed the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons as a threat to humanity everywhere -– the sort of cruelty and incivility that cannot be allowed with impunity. Yet despite efforts by President Barack Obama to stoke fears of chemical-weapon attacks against Americans and their allies, few people outside Syria fear for their own safety.Hawkins, the ComRes chairman described “two key requirements” to gaining public support for military intervention abroad -- first, “a credible threat to the security of British citizens” and, second, “a reasonable prospect of success.""Neither appears to apply to the Syria crisis, leaving those leaders pursuing military strikes at direct odds with their publics.Still, analysts note that public opinion on armed intervention tends to be volatile, with patriotic surges and an impulse to support military forces typically following initial armed strikes.Such was the dynamic in France in the case of Libya. In early March 2011, the French public was largely opposed to intervention in Libya, with only 36 percent expressing support in polls. But less than a month later, following the first French strikes in Libya, public support surged to 66 percent.“What we saw was a patriotic reflex with public opinion rallying to the flag,"" Fourquet said. ""All the more so because risks were limited, as the intervention consisted exclusively of air strikes.” And yet this same tendency for public opinion to fluctuate tends to work in reverse when military campaigns drag on: By the summer of 2011, as Moammar Gadhafi's regime fell in Libya, French approval for continued national involvement had just slipped below the 50 percent mark.Another source of public unease is a sense that the military strikes could provoke an unforeseen regional conflagration, requiring a larger and more perilous intervention. So warns even a former member of the Syrian National Council, the coalition of opposition parties seeking to oust Assad.""I could theoretically favor targeted and limited strikes, to exercise pressure and relaunch the political process, because there will be no military solution,"" the former SNC member, Randa Kassis, said in an exclusive interview with HuffPost Maghreb. ""But the problem with these strikes is the response of the regime. How will Western countries react then? Have they considered the risk. If one response leads to the next, what will the consequences be? A regional war, perhaps? I am against intervention, because we don't know the consequences.""

The document detailed how there was no proof Iraq was connected to 9/11 or tied to al Qaeda's role in 9/11, that Iraq neither had WMDs nor was it a threat to the U.S., lacking intention and capability to attack. Unfortunately, not enough members of Congress performed due diligence before they approved the war.Here are some key questions which President Obama has yet to answer in the call for congressional approval for war against Syria. This article is a call for independent thinking and congressional oversight, which rises above partisan considerations. The questions the Obama administration needs to answer before Congress can even consider voting on Syria:Claim #1. The administration claims a chemical weapon was used.The UN inspectors are still completing their independent evaluation.Who provided the physiological samples of sarin gas on which your evaluation is based? Were any other non-weaponized chemical agents discovered or sampled? Who from the United States was responsible for the chain of custody? Where was the laboratory analysis conducted? Were U.S. officials present during the analysis of the samples? Does your sample show military grade or lower grade sarin gas? Can you verify that your sample matches the exact composition of the alleged Syrian government composition?  Further reading: Brown Moses blog; McClatchy News report; Global Research report.Claim #2: The administration claims the opposition has not used chemical weapons.Which opposition? Are you speaking of a specific group, or all groups working in Syria to overthrow President Assad and his government? Has your administration independently and categorically dismissed the reports of rebel use of chemical weapons which have come from such disparate sources as Russia, the United Nations, and the Turkish state newspaper? Have you investigated the rumors that the Saudis may have supplied the rebels with chemicals that could be weaponized?Has the administration considered the ramifications of inadvertently supporting al Qaeda-affiliated Syrian rebels?Was any intelligence received in the last year by the U.S. government indicating that sarin gas was brought into Syria by rebel factions, with or without the help of a foreign government or intelligence agents?Further reading: Global Research report; Wall Street Journal article; Reuters story; Zaman story (in Turkish -- see Google translate from Turkish to English); Atlantic Sentinel story; AP storyClaim #3: The administration claims chemical weapons were used because the regime's conventional weapons were insufficientWho is responsible for the conjecture that the reason chemical weapons were used against the Damascus suburbs is that Assad's conventional weapons were insufficient to secure ""large portions of Damascus""?Claim #4: The administration claims to have intelligence relating to the mixing of chemical weapons by regime elements Who saw the chemical weapons being mixed from August 18th on? Was any warning afforded to the Syria opposition and if not, why not? If, on August 21st a ""regime element"" was preparing for a chemical weapons attack, has an assessment been made which could definitively determine whether such preparation (using gas masks) was for purpose of defense, and not offense?Further reading: McClatchy report; Brown Moses blog  Claim #5: The administration claims intelligence that Assad's brother ordered the attack What is the type of and source of intelligence which alleges that Assad's brother personally ordered the attack? Who made the determination that Assad's brother ordered the attack, based on which intelligence, from what source?Further reading: hereClaim #6: The administration claims poison gas was released in a rocket attack Who was tracking the rocket and the artillery attack which preceded the poison gas release? Did these events occur simultaneously or consecutively? Could these events, the rocket launches and the release of poison gas, have been conflated? Based upon the evidence, is it possible that a rocket attack by the Syrian government was aimed at rebels stationed among civilians and a chemical weapons attack was launched by rebels against the civilian population an hour and a half later? Is it possible that chemical weapons were released by the rebels -- unintentionally? Explain the 90-minute time interval between the rocket launch and chemical weapon attacks. Has forensic evidence been gathered at the scene of the attack which would confirm the use of rockets to deliver the gas? If there was a rocket launch would you supply evidence of wounds from the rockets impact and explosion? What is the source of the government's analysis? If the rockets were being tracked via ""geospatial intelligence,"" what were the geospatial coordinates of the launching sites and termination locations?Further reading: FAIR.org reportClaim #7: The administration claims 1,429 people died in the attack Secretary Kerry claimed 1,429 deaths, including 426 children. From whom did that number first originate? Further reading: McClatchy report  Claim #8: The administration has made repeated references to videos and photos of the attack as a basis for military action against Syria When and where were the videos taken of the aftermath of the poison gas attack?Further reading: FAIR.org reportClaim #9: The administration claims a key intercept proves the Assad regime's complicity in the chemical weapons attack Will you release the original transcripts in the language in which it was recorded as well as the translations relied upon to determine the nature of the conversation allegedly intercepted? What is the source of this transcript? What was the exact time of the intercept? Was it a U.S. intercept or supplied from a non-U.S. source? Have you determined the transcripts' authenticity? Have you considered that the transcripts could have been doctored or fake? Was the ""senior official,"" whose communications were intercepted, a member of Assad's government? How was he ""familiar"" with the offensive? Through a surprised acknowledgement that such an attack had taken place? Or through actual coordination of said attack? Release the transcripts! Was he an intelligence asset of the U.S., or our allies? In what manner had he ""confirmed"" chemical weapons were used by the regime? Who made the assessment that his intercepted communications were a confirmation of the use of chemical weapons by the regime on August 21st? What is the source of information that the Syrian chemical weapons personnel were ""directed to cease operations""? Is this the same source who witnessed regime officials mixing the chemicals? Does the transcript indicate whether the operations they were ""directed to cease"" were related to ceasing conventional or chemical attacks? Will you release the transcripts and identify sources of this claim? Do you have transcripts, eyewitness accounts or electronic intercepts of communications between Syrian commanders or other regime officials which link the CW attack directly to President Assad? Who are the intelligence officials who made the assessment -- are they U.S. intelligence officials or did the initial analysis come from a non-U.S. source?Further reading: FAIR.org report and AP story; Washington Post editorial  Claim #10: The administration claims that sustained shelling occurred after the chemical weapons attack in order to cover up the traces of the attack Please release all intelligence and military assessments as to the reason for the sustained shelling, which is reported to have occurred after the chemical weapons attack. Who made the determination that was this intended to cover up a chemical weapon attack? Or was it to counterattack those who released chemicals? How does shelling make the residue of sarin gas disappear?Further reading: hereThe American people have a right to a full release and vetting of all facts before their elected representatives are asked to make a decision of great consequence for America, Syria and the world. Congress must be provided answers prior to the vote, in open hearings, not in closed sessions where information can be manipulated in the service of war. We've been there before.

14854	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-paul/third-plenum-_b_4289143.html	Opinion	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"As trumpeted across the media, the four day meeting of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party has ended, and China's leaders announced that among the decisions were an ""easing of"" its one-child family policy and the abolition of its ""re-education through labor"" camps. As much as these policy changes are being trumpeted as evidence of how far China has come, they really are a reminder of how far China and its leaders have to go.In the wake of the shutdown of the federal government last month, Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping took the opportunity to remind the world of the failings of the American political system. Year after year, as China's foreign exchange reserves have piled up, the leaders of the regime have gone to great pains to critique America for its profligacy and political instability, among myriad other failings. China's much heralded rise, and its ambitions to supplant American leadership, reflect not just its growing economic and military power, but the values of frugality, stability and conservatism Chinese leaders eagerly contrast with the chaos and moral decay of the west.Little is ever said amidst these frequent rebukes of the role that America has played in enabling the resuscitation of the Chinese people, to say nothing of the Chinese Communist Party itself, from the depths of economic calcification reached in the 1970s. Much is made of the success of the market reforms instituted under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping beginning in 1978, and indeed the growth trajectory of China's GDP has been extraordinary. But the success of China's economic transformation could not have happened absent the free trade policies of the United States, and to a lesser extent western Europe, that enabled that growth.Under American global leadership since the end of World War II, international trade policies have uplifted the Asian continent out of severe poverty. Japan led the way, in the wake of the devastation of WWII, building a manufacturing juggernaut enabled by American business insight and market access. The Japanese model of export driven economic growth and development then became the model for the Asian tiger nations of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, which like Japan have risen from abject poverty a half-century ago to among the highest levels of per capita income in the world.That was the American half-century. As we opened our markets, our share of global GDP steadily declined. Our trade policies actively supported the rise of Asia out of poverty and the globalization of our leading corporations. That real middle class incomes stagnated at home should have come as no surprise. It was simple economics.But the Asian Tigers, and even Japan, were relatively small countries, who as trading partners were able to build their domestic economies around export trade with America without destroying the host upon which they fed. Through that economic period, there were unintended consequences that exacerbated the challenges we now face. The combined reinvestment of Asian nation trade surpluses in US dollars -- and the similar practice embraced by OPEC nations selling us oil -- led to relative stability in the US dollar and enabled steady increases in US borrowing without the increases in US interest rates or declines the value of dollar assets that would otherwise have undermined Asian growth.But it was trade in goods and services with China and India, respectively, that ultimately showed the limit of the export driven model, as the damage to the US economy and middle class has now become too extreme to ignore. The challenges we now face -- underinvestment in infrastructure, chronic deficit spending, and socially debilitating inequality -- have conspired to contribute to the fraught domestic politics that President Xi now trumpets as the rationale for the world to turn to China for future leadership. China's gleaming new cityscapes -- and the Chinese dream of Xi's rhetoric -- are being built not upon the ingenuity of the Chinese system, but instead upon the hollowing out of the American economy.The policy changes Xi and his colleagues announced this week only draw attention to the depravity that remains central to the Chinese system. Even as there is a rising wealthy population within the Chinese elite and urban cores, economic growth within China remains dependent upon the Foxconn-style factory model that is one step short of a slave economy. The Communist Party social and economic policies continue to drive Chinese peasants from their land while securing billions of dollars in stolen wealth for Party members. Dissent and banned religious practice remains punishable by prison and the Orwellian ""re-education"" that is to be moderated, but not eliminated, under recently announced Party reforms.The Party plans to modify the decades old one-child policy is perhaps the most shocking reminder of the starkly immoral nature of Communist Party control over the most intimate aspects of Chinese personal life. Unauthorized pregnancies continue to be aborted by force up until birth, and children found to have been born in violation of the law remain at risk of being ""confiscated"" by police. The proposed may relax the rules surrounding who is to be allowed more than one child, but does nothing to curtail this most fundamental power of State control over the population.This week, the US aircraft carrier George Washington arrived in the Philippines from Hawaii. The stories were so familiar from other disasters in recent years. The helicopters arriving over the horizon, coming to the aid of the population devastated by Typhoon Haiyan needing not just food and water, but the most basic help from building and securing aid distribution capacity, to recovering, identifying and burying the dead. The carrier and accompanying ships brought aid, logistics and people trained and capable of responding to the need on the ground.Nine years ago, in the days following the 2004 tsunami, it was the US carrier Abraham Lincoln and the Navy hospital ship Mercy that steamed from the Persian Gulf to Banda Aceh, that city on the northern tip of Sumatra that had born the brunt of the tsunami and seen tens of thousands of its residents die. Like Banda Aceh, the Philippines are located close to the Chinese mainland -- just 700 miles from Hong Kong -- yet once again it was an American flotilla that steamed over 5,000 miles to bring critical aid, while the Chinese sat on their hands.Last month, President Xi trumpeted China's rising essential role in the region at the Asia-Pacific meetings that President Obama chose not to attend due to turmoil in Washington. Yet just a few weeks later, he was nowhere to be seen as the people of the Philippines faced their crisis. The Chinese government committed just $100,000 to the Philippines relief effort after the typhoon struck.President Xi has a long way to go to build the credibility of China as a modern state to be looked to by the world for leadership. Just the name of its recent meeting, the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party, is a reminder that while much in the world has changed over the past quarter century -- from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Arab spring -- China remains a throwback the Cold War era. As much as Xi would like to show the world the face of a man whose time in Iowa left him an admirer of American freedoms, the pronouncements from his first plenum are a stark reminder of the deep corruption and cruelty that lie at the heart of the Chinese system, and of the ghosts of Tiananmen that still haunt the Chinese leadership.But it is the response to Typhoon Haiyan that has demonstrated how far China has to go before it will be embraced as a global leader. Leadership is not just about words at meetings of world leaders, or reserves held bank vaults, but about conduct in the world. It is not about what you do to build up your own country, but what you do to uplift others. President Xi and his colleagues disappeared this week when their neighbors across the water were crying in pain, and their inaction spoke volumes. Because, at the end of the day, leadership is not about ideology or rhetoric, it is about showing up."

""In my experience, I've learned unless you stand up to that bully, they ask for more and more and more.""He said Obama should cancel plans to meet Putin in Moscow for a bilateral summit next month that was expected take place during the U.S. president's trip to Russia for the G20 gathering.Schumer said he also would call on Obama to ""urge our allies, if it were possible,"" to try to move the G20 summit from St. Petersburg to another country.The White House has left unclear whether Obama would stop in Moscow after Russia granted asylum to Snowden, a former intelligence contractor wanted in the United States for leaking details of government surveillance programs.Schumer said that because of the Snowden matter, ""the relationship between the United States and Russia ... is more poisonous than at any time since the Cold War.""Also speaking on CBS, Republican Congressman Paul Ryan said he agreed with Schumer that there should be consequences for Russia's actions.Ryan, a former vice presidential candidate and influential voice within his party, accused the Obama administration of appeasement with its policy, known as the ""reset,"" begun in 2009, of trying to improve U.S.-Russia relations.General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the ABC program ""This Week"" that Russia's actions were disappointing.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Sunday suggested that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has lost his credibility in fighting global terrorism.McCain argued on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the government's vast surveillance program is not ""necessarily wrong"" because it operates under court oversight. Paul, who appeared on ""Fox News Sunday,"" has taken the opposite position, calling the government's phone records monitoring program an ""extraordinary invasion of privacy.""Asked to square the two positions by CNN host Candy Crowley, McCain said that Paul was wrong about the terrorism threat in the days before the Boston Marathon bombings. ""Just prior to the Boston bombing, he said the battlefield was no longer in America,"" McCain told Crowley.McCain was referring to a Paul appearance on Fox News in April. ""It's different overseas than it will be here,"" Paul said in that appearance. ""Which gets precisely to the argument I have with some other Republicans who say, 'Well, the battlefield is everywhere, there is no limitation.' President Obama says this. Some members of my party say the battle has no geographic limitations and the laws of war apply. It's important to know that the law of war that they're talking about means no due process.""McCain isn't the first to suggest that the Boston bombings should serve to chasten Paul. A post-bombings Wall Street Journal editorial also took issue with the Kentucky senator's April remarks.""Boylston Street sure looked like a battlefield on Monday, and so did Watertown on Thursday night,"" The Journal wrote in its editorial. ""The artificial distinction is Mr. Paul's focus on geography. The vital distinction for public safety is between common criminals, who deserve due process protections, and enemy combatants at war with the U.S., wherever they are.""McCain's disagreement with Paul on foreign policy and terrorism was previously highlighted by Paul's lengthy March filibuster of President Barack Obama's drone program, a move that McCain dismissed as ""wacko.""""Americans' suspicions have been aroused by ... the IRS, Benghazi [scandals],"" McCain acknowledged on Sunday.But in an apparent reference to Congress, he said, ""I don't think the government should be briefed on every program like this.

""I'm not asking you to take my word for it, read for yourself.""But while the report assessed with ""high confidence"" that the Syrian government had used a nerve agent in the Aug. 21 attack, which U.S. intelligence believes killed at least 1,429 people including 426 children, it stopped short of conclusively demonstrating that Syrian President Bashar Assad himself, as opposed to a more junior officer, had ordered it. Details on what led the intelligence community to its conclusion were slim in the unclassified version of the report released to the public.""We know that for three days before the attack, the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons personnel were on the ground in the area, making preparations,"" Kerry said.The preparations included, he said, putting on gas masks.""This is what Assad did to his own people,"" Kerry said. If the US and world allowed ""a thug and a murderer like Bashar al-Assad"" to get away with gassing his own people, he added, ""there will be no end to the test of our resolve and the dangers that will flow from those others who believe that they can do as they will.""“We do assess that [Assad] is the decision-maker, and that he's ultimately in charge of deployment,” a senior administration official said in a conference call with reporters on Friday afternoon.The only question remaining in the aftermath of the chemical attack, Kerry said, was, ""what are we and the world going to do about it?"" Presumably referencing a ""red line"" that President Barack Obama drew last August on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, Kerry also said the United States had to act because its credibility and interests were on the line.“Our intelligence community has carefully reviewed and re-reviewed the information regarding this attack,” Kerry said on Friday. “It has done so more than mindful of the Iraq experience, and we will not repeat that moment.”Over the past week, a series of intelligence community leaks have indicated that the evidence behind the chemical attack -- and specifically the question of what role Assad himself played in ordering it -- remains relatively weak. In an Associated Press report on Thursday, one government official was quoted as saying the data was “no slam dunk.”""It's unclear where control lies,"" another U.S. intelligence official told Foreign Policy earlier in the week. ""Is there just some sort of general blessing to use these things? Or are there explicit orders for each attack?""The release by the Obama administration on Friday sought to address those intelligence gaps, although it did not offer specific data on the link between Assad and the attack. Instead, it focused on circumstantial indications: the fact that the chemical-laden rockets were all fired from regime-held areas into rebel-held ones, and an intercepted communication from a senior regime official that apparently confirmed the use of the weapons.The Syrian government's motivation for launching a massive chemical weapons strike that was sure to cross Obama's ""red line"" remained unclear.The intelligence assessment said the regime's ""frustration"" with its inability to clear swaths of the Damascus suburbs home to opposition forces ""may have"" contributed to its decision. Independent analysts were puzzled by the Syrian move, with some suggesting it could have been a mistake by a lower-ranking official.The Obama administration's findings closely mirror those in a similar brief released Thursday by British intelligence just before the U.K. parliament voted down Prime Minister David Cameron's bid to have the country take part in a strike against Syria, by a vote of 285-272.It was a stunning defeat for Cameron, who acknowledged after the vote that ""the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action"" and said that the government would ""act accordingly.""The British assessment concluded that it was “highly likely” that the Syrian regime had been behind the attacks, and that there was “no credible intelligence or other evidence” to support allegations that other forces, such as the rebels themselves, might have carried them out. But it also acknowledged having limited insight into the regime's “precise motivation” for using chemical weapons, particularly at a moment when United Nations chemical-weapons inspectors were staying at a hotel just miles away.The British parliament's rejection of military action in Syria sparked questions on whether the U.S. would ""fly solo"" in its operation, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel also refused her government's assistance for airstrikes in Syria. But French President Francois Hollande expressed his willingness Friday to proceed with plans to strike Syria over its use of chemical weapons. ""The chemical massacre of Damascus cannot and must not remain unpunished,"" Hollande said.The administration's intelligence brief was designed to assuage the concerns of both the public and a deeply uneasy Congress. Polls indicate that the American public is highly skeptical of launching a strike on Syria without congressional backing.Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have urged the president to hold more consultations with members of Congress and not act unilaterally. Many Republicans, joined by a growing number of Democrats, have demanded a vote in Congress to authorize the use of military force.While the White House is unlikely to seek congressional approval, the administration stepped up its deliberations with lawmakers Thursday. Obama called House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), whose office followed up with a statement calling on the president to provide a more robust explanation to both members of Congress and the American public.Top administration officials also held a 90-minute conference call Thursday evening with congressional leaders and the chairs and ranking members of national security committees. During the call, lawmakers were briefed on the administration's approach and rationale for military involvement by Kerry, national security advisor Susan Rice, defense secretary Chuck Hagel, director of national intelligence James Clapper, and Sandy Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said after the call that he would support ""surgical, proportional military strikes,"" but the administration ""would be far better off if they seek [congressional] authorization.""Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, told The Huffington Post that members of Congress who sit on the relevant intelligence committees have ""been continually supplied with classified info.""She added that they will receive the classified version of Friday's chemical weapons assessment ""at some point today,"" and that the administration will hold classified briefings for its staff this afternoon.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a statement on the Thursday briefing in which she said Assad had acted ""outside the realm of basic human rights."" But she added that she agreed with Boehner and other members that the administration must engage in further consultation with Congress and provide greater transparency into the decision-making process and timing.""The case needs to be made to the American people,"" Pelosi said. ""It is clear that the American people are weary of war.""UPDATE: 2:50 p.m. -- Obama addressed reporters at the White House later on Friday, emphasizing that he had not made any decisions about what actions the U.S. will take against Syria but adding that he is considering a ""limited narrow act.""""We're not considering any open ended commitment,"" Obama said. ""We're not considering any boots on the ground approach.""""We are looking at the possibility of a limited, narrow act that would help make sure that not only Syria but others around the world understand that the international community cares about maintaining this chemical weapons ban,"" he said. ""I have not made a final decision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm, but as I've already said, I have had my military and our team look at a wide range of options. We have consulted with allies. We've consulted with Congress.""The president acknowledged that many people, including himself, are ""war weary.""""There is a certain weariness, given Afghanistan. There is a certain suspicion of any military action post-Iraq,"" Obama said, adding that he appreciated the skepticism. ""It’s important for us to recognize that when over a thousand people are killed, including hundreds of innocent children, through the use of a weapon that 98 or 99 percent of humanity says should not be used even in war, and there is no action, then we’re sending a signal … that is a danger to our national security.""Matt Sledge reported from New York, Sabrina Siddiqui reported from Washington, D.C., and Joshua Hersh reported from Beirut, Lebanon."

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced a resolution Friday calling on President Barack Obama to recommend an alternative location for the upcoming September G-20 summit in St. Petersburg, should Russia continue to provide shelter for National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.The resolution also states that Russia is damaging its relations with the United States and should immediately hand Snowden over to American authorities so he can stand trial. Snowden faces charges of espionage for releasing classified information on the NSA's broad surveillance programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post in June. After initially hiding out in Hong Kong, Snowden headed for Moscow where he has been stuck in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo International Airport since June 23. He applied for temporary asylum in Russia on Tuesday, though President Vladimir Putin has said the whistle-blower is expected to leave the country as soon as he can. Graham has been at the forefront of lawmakers urging the Russian government to extradite Snowden, going so far as to suggest the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi should be boycotted if Russia grants Snowden asylum. The White House declined to speculate on Graham's idea; House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said the South Carolina senator was ""dead wrong.""Graham and Schumer recently strengthened their bipartisan relationship while working together on comprehensive immigration reform. The duo has also introduced a media shield law to protect reporters from leak investigations by the Justice Department. Whether they have support for their latest measure on Snowden remains unclear, but the senators issued a statement Friday citing the Russian government's recent actions in Iran and Syria as additional reason to penalize it.""On multiple fronts, Russia is becoming one of the bad actors in the world,"" said Graham. ""Russia continues to provide cover to the Iranian nuclear program and sell sophisticated weapons to the Assad regime in Syria to butcher tens of thousands of its own citizens. For Russia to grant temporary asylum to Mr. Snowden on top of all this would do serious damage to our relationship. It is past time we send a strong message to President Putin about Russia's actions and this resolution will help accomplish that goal.""""Time and time again. President Putin is too eager to stick a finger in the eye of the United States -- whether it is arming the murderous Assad regime in Syria, supporting Iran's nuclear development or now providing shelter and Russian state protection to Edward Snowden,"" said Schumer. ""Enough is enough. It's time to send a crystal clear message to President Putin about Russia's deplorable behavior, and this resolution will do just that."""

Yet the president never mentioned the continuing genocide conducted in several parts of Sudan by President Omar al-Bashir.  There was a time when Mr. Obama expressed outrage over the mass murder and aerial bombardment of civilians in the Darfur region of western Sudan. In 2007, the then-presidential hopeful said the Western world's silence regarding the slaughter in Sudan would leave ""a stain on our souls.""  Now President Obama has joined that silence. These days, to learn about what is transpiring in Sudan, one must turn to Radio Dabanga, broadcasting from Denmark. A recent report described the bombardment of a Darfur village called Abu Tega, which was ""completely burned and the population fled in all directions.""  President Obama's critics have denounced his foreign-policy choices, which they believe have weakened the global credibility of the U.S. But Mr. Obama has managed to avoid scrutiny about his most tragic foreign failure: standing by as Sudan's Islamic regime perpetrates a slaughter against its own citizens who belong to non-Arab ethnic groups. Bashir continues a 10-year annihilation, slaughtering many tens of thousands, and very likely more.  Previous American presidents have betrayed a similar callous disregard for the taking of human life. Most notably Bill Clinton, who did nothing to stop genocidal assaults in Rwanda, where the Hutus slaughtered 800,000 Tutsis in 1994. Mr. Clinton has come to see this inaction as his most historic dereliction of duty. He has since admitted that the international community was complicit in mass murder abroad when the U.S. could have acted to save a few hundred thousand lives.  ""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began,"" Mr. Clinton said on a reconciliation tour in Rwanda in 1998. ""We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. ... We owe to all the people in the world our best efforts to organize ourselves so that we can maximize the chances of preventing these events.""  Mr. Clinton's regrets offer a cautionary tale. President Obama and his current National Security Adviser Susan Rice would agree -- or at least they did when in 2007, they separately condemned the Bush administration for its inaction in Sudan, specifically citing the Clinton administration's failure in Rwanda. Both proclaimed that the U.S. should never again fail to intervene when innocents are being slaughtered.  Mr. Obama has cited humanitarian reasons to intervene in a crisis when politically convenient. He entered Libya ""to prevent a bloodbath,"" despite no mass slaughter of civilians in the country. This disingenuous explanation only damaged his credibility as a humanitarian, though it did placate the international human-rights community.  So why does Sudan not deserve the same consideration? An enormous number of civilian lives are at stake in Darfur. Bashir's assaults against the people of Sudan have escalated in intensity. Some three million people are living -- if you can even call it that -- in refugee camps with wretched conditions. They lack even food, water, sanitation and basic medical attention. Hundreds of thousands of children are growing up malnourished with stunted growth and damaged cognitive abilities. If they survive, they are left without an education to a lifetime of suffering, with many likely eventually succumbing to disease.  And the camps are hardly safe. Bashir's henchmen continue to attack them, and torch villages and fields, indiscriminately murder roughly 10,000 people per month. Still more Darfuris continue to die from disease and other causes at alarming rates, with the dead no longer even counted. The world is unaware of the carnage because the region is closed to the international community and media. Even many key U.N. and humanitarian personnel have been expelled recently.  There is a moral imperative to help the people of Darfur, which President Obama once articulated well. In 2007 he said, ""Today we know what is right, and today we know what is wrong. The slaughter of innocents is wrong. Two million people driven from their homes is wrong. Women gang raped while gathering firewood is wrong. And silence, acquiescence and paralysis in the face of genocide is wrong."" He made his solution clear: ""We've got to have a protective force on the ground.""  Yet those suffering in Darfur can expect no such ""protective force."" For reasons that are unclear, Sudan doesn't meet Mr. Obama's threshold for action. His words at the U.N., including generic rhetoric ""that it is in our interest to see a Middle East and North Africa that is peaceful and prosperous,"" offer little hope if any. Mr. Obama has abandoned his own moral standards and left the people of Darfur to perish.  ______________  Ms. Farrow, an activist and actor, is filming ""The Darfur Archives,"" documenting the cultural traditions of the Darfur tribes targeted for elimination.

The young Kim rose to power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. But is the 30-year-old ""Dear Leader"" the only one pulling North Korea's political strings? HuffPost World investigates. THE INSTITUTIONSThe International Crisis Group explains that the Korean Workers Party (KWP) is North Korea's main political organ. The 124 members of the party's Central Committee select a General Secretary, the 10-member Secretariat, a 14-member Politbureau, a Presidium and the members of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC). As the ICC notes, the party structure fully support the dictatorship. Deceased leader Kim Jong Il is the party's ""Eternal Secretary,"" while Kim Jong Un is First Secretary. Kim Jong Un also heads the powerful National Defense Commission (NDC), a position that gives him control over the armed forces. Powerful figures in the regime can take up different mandates within the party or the security apparatus over time and can even combine several positions. THE FIGURESKim Kyong Hui Since the death of her brother Kim Jong Il, Kim Kyong Hui has become one of North Korea's most powerful officials. The Dear Leader's 66-year-old aunt was appointed the most important member of the KWP's Politburo and first among members of the Secretariat. In addition, she was made a general in the army. Jang Song Thaek Kim Kyong Hui's husband, Jang Song Thaek, is deputy chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission and an alternate member of the Politburo, Reuters explains. The Soviet-trained technocrat was first spotted  in a general's uniform in the wake of Kim Jong Il's death. Kim Jong Un's aunt and uncle were crucial figures in the transition of power after Kim Jong Il's death in December 2011. John Park of the U.S. Institute for Peace told the Associated Press after the former leader's passing that the powerful couple are ""key pillars"" of the young Kim's reign. While analysts speculated the duo's power would gradually decline as young Kim gained ruling experience, thus far, the duo's influence has not waned -- as evidenced by their frequent appearances flanking their nephew on official events. ABC points out that the leader's aunt and uncle were present on stage when Kim reaffirmed his country's commitment to nuclear weapons during a speech on March 31. This power couple appears to occasionally live through its version of drama, too. According to ABC, Jang did not support North Korea's long-range missile launch last December, ""but was overruled by his wife."" Kim Kyong Hui, Kim Jong Un and Jang Song Thaek in December 2011.

The 70-year-old Pak has been a confidant to the Kim family and earlier served as prime minister from 2003 until 2007. He was tasked with implementing economic reforms to lift the country out of poverty, but was dismissed when the measures appeared to fail. Pak is closely associated with Jang Song Thaek and Kim Kyong Hui, Reuters notes, and while his reappointment is meant to strengthen Kim's grip on power, it makes the young leader ""dangerously dependent"" on the power duo.

Ri became the head of the North Korean army, was a member of the Politburo and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC). Although Ri was initially considered close to the new leader, the army chief was dismissed from all official posts in July 2012. The BBC's Seoul correspondent Lucy Williamson noted at the time that while Ri's resignation was officially attributed to ""illness,"" a health crisis was unlikely the real reason for the purge. As the Crisis Group explains: ""Senior officials normally remain in office despite poor health, even terminal illness."" Kim Jong Un solidified his control of the army following Ri's removal.

As it is, the country is on the brink. We know that Lebanon's fractious sect-based political system has been strained by the Syrian war. Some Lebanese have crossed into Syria to support the warring sides and that, as an extension of this, there have been retaliatory attacks within Lebanon. But more than the violence or the fear of renewed civil war, what has put Lebanon on the brink is the flood of Syrian refugees who are overwhelming the country, threatening it with economic collapse and its capacity to survive as a state. It is only right that the world has focused attention on the terrible plight of Syria's refugees. But the enormity of this human tidal wave that has hit Lebanon must also be considered. According to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHRC) there are currently 790,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with an estimated 75,000 coming each month. This number does not include the more than 250,000 Syrians living in Lebanon as migrant workers. Given current projections, the UN agency estimates that if the Syrian war continues apace, by the end of this calendar year, Syrian refugees will constitute about one-quarter of Lebanon's total population. The refugee crisis has affected Lebanon on many levels. Because Lebanon has not built refugee camps, the Syrian exiles have moved into communities across the entire country. Many have crowded into low income apartments, resulting in a housing shortage and a spike in rental rates -- as much as 44 percent in some areas. This in turn has pushed poorer Lebanese out of the housing market -- forcing them to become internally displaced in their own country. Other Syrians have formed informal ""tent cities"" in towns and villages throughout Lebanon creating additional stress on host communities. The UNHRC estimates that there are 1,400 of these settlements. Because the Syrian refugees have flooded the job market, often willing to work for less, official statistics now report that average wages have plummeted and 20 percent of Lebanese are now unemployed. There are additional strains on the economy. The World Bank projects that Lebanon's GDP will decline by 2.9 percent each year from 2012 to 2014. Government revenues will decrease by $1.5 billion annually, while government expenditures are expected to rise by over $1 billion each year, owing to the increased demand for services. As a result, it is projected that an additional 170,000 Lebanese will be forced into poverty this year. The problems don't end there. The 90,000 Syrian children registered in local schools have created a serious over-crowding problem in the educational system -- with additional strains reported in the health care, public and social service sectors. Water, gas and electricity rates have all increased by 7.4 percent in the last year. Some medicines are now in short supply and with winter fast approaching the stress on the food supply, housing, health care, and other services will only grow. In this context, it is important to recall that last winter; there were only about 150,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon -- while this winter the number will be at least eight times that number! It should be expected that this situation might lead to social tensions within Lebanon. Polling data establishes that many Lebanese have become resentful. Many Lebanese poor see their country being overrun, resulting in: their inability to find work; having to settle for lower wages; and forcing them to face increased costs for food and services. They resent the fact that the Syrian refugees receive international assistance, while they must do without. All of this has created a new level of communal tensions. Since Lebanon has had a long and conflicted history with its neighbor, and since Lebanon's internal relationships remain unresolved, the added dimension of over one million Syrian refugees has only compounded an already fragile situation. The UNHRC's representative in Lebanon has written that given all these strains, which no country should be expected to bear, Lebanon has so far held up quite well. She writes ""Lebanon stands as an example of generosity in the face of crisis. Despite misunderstandings and tensions, everyday acts of kindness are commonplace."" But she warns, ""Without more international support, the patience and hospitality of host communities may wear thin. Continuing neglect will stoke rising tensions and raise the risk that the...Syrian civil war will become a regional war."" This said, Lebanon demands immediate attention. I cannot disagree with the push to rid Syria of chemical weapons, convene a Geneva II Summit to find a way to end that country's long war, and provide more assistance to alleviate the humanitarian crisis created by the massive population displacement created by the war. But Lebanon can no longer be ignored. The country need urgent support. It needs support to strengthen its capacity to deal with this crisis: the army needs assistance to help control the border and provide internal security; and the government and relief agencies need assistance to provide support to Lebanon's poor and those who have been displaced in their own country by the influx of refugees. Our concern for what is happening to Syria and Syrians, cannot and must not drown out our concern for Lebanon and its people. If we continue to ignore Lebanon, in short order, that country might collapse under the weight of the pressures to which it has been subjected. Lebanon requires attention."

The documents reveal broad disagreement over a host of key positions, and general skepticism that an agreement can be reached by year-end. The Obama administration has urged countries to reach a deal by New Year's Day, though there is no technical deadline.One memo, which was heavily redacted before being provided to HuffPost, was written ahead of a new round of talks in Singapore this week. Read the full text of what HuffPost received here. (Note: Ellipses indicate redacted text. Text in brackets has been added by a third party.) Another document, a chart outlining different country positions on the text, dates from early November, before the round of negotiations in Salt Lake City, Utah. View the chart here. HuffPost was unable to determine which of the 11 non-U.S. nations involved in the talks was responsible for the memo.""These are not U.S. documents and we have no idea of their authorship or authenticity,"" a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said. ""Some elements in them are outdated, others totally inaccurate."" The spokesman declined to specify which parts were outdated or inaccurate.The Obama administration has been leading negotiations on the international trade accord since 2010. The countries involved in the talks include Australia, Brunei, Chile, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.One of the most controversial provisions in the talks includes new corporate empowerment language insisted upon by the U.S. government, which would allow foreign companies to challenge laws or regulations in a privately run international court. Under World Trade Organization treaties, this political power to contest government law is reserved for sovereign nations. The U.S. has endorsed some corporate political powers in prior trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the scope of what laws can be challenged appears to be much broader in TPP negotiations.""The United States, as in previous rounds, has shown no flexibility on its proposal, being one of the most significant barriers to closing the chapter, since under the concept of Investment Agreement nearly all significant contracts that can be made between a state and a foreign investor are included,"" the memo reads. ""Only the U.S. and Japan support the proposal.""Under NAFTA, companies including Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly have attempted to overrule Canadian regulations on offshore oil drilling, fracking, pesticides, drug patents and other issues. Companies could challenge an even broader array of rules under the TPP language.New standards concerning access to key medicines appear to be equally problematic for many nations. The Obama administration is insisting on mandating new intellectual property rules in the treaty that would grant pharmaceutical companies long-term monopolies on new medications. As a result, companies can charge high prices without regard to competition from generic providers. The result, public health experts have warned, would be higher prices around the world, and lack of access to life-saving drugs in poor countries. Nearly every intellectual property issue in the November chart is opposed by a broad majority of the 12 nations. The December memo describes 119 ""outstanding issues"" that remain unresolved between the nations on intellectual property matters. The deal would obligate nations to develop many standards similar to those in the United States, where domestic prescription drug prices are much higher than costs in other nations.Also according to the December memo, the U.S. has reintroduced a proposal that would hamper government health services from negotiating lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. The proposal appears to have been universally rejected earlier in the talks, according to the memo. Australia and New Zealand have medical boards that allow the government to reject expensive new drugs for the public health system, or negotiate lower prices with drug companies that own patents on them. If a new drug does not offer sufficient benefits over existing generic drugs, the boards can reject spending taxpayer money on the new medicines. They can also refuse to pay high prices for new drugs. The Obama administration has been pushing to ban these activities by national boards, which would lock in big profits for U.S. drug companies. Obamacare sought to mimic the behavior of these boards to lower domestic health care costs by granting new flexibilities to U.S. state agencies for determining drug prices. The U.S. is also facing major resistance on bank regulation standards. The Obama administration is seeking to curtail the use of ""capital controls"" by foreign governments. These can include an extremely broad variety of financial tools, from restricting lending in overheated markets to denying mass international outflows of currency during a financial panic. The loss of these tools would dramatically limit the ability of governments to prevent and stem banking crises.""The positions are still paralyzed,"" the December memo reads, referring to the Financial Services Chapter. ""The United States shows zero flexibility.""Previously leaked TPP documents have sparked alarm among global health experts, Internet freedom activists, environmentalists and organized labor, but are adamantly supported by American corporations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Obama administration has deemed negotiations to be classified information -- banning members of Congress from discussing the American negotiating position with the press or the public. Congressional staffers have been restricted from viewing the documents.This story has been updated with a comment from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and to specify that prescription drug flexibilities under Obamacare are provided to state boards."

""President Nelson Mandela was one of the greatest leaders of our lifetime,"" he wrote.

""So let me say to those conservatives who don’t want to honor Nelson Mandela, what would you have done?""Responding to conservatives who dismiss Mandela as a communist, Gingrich added, ""Actually Mandela was raised in a Methodist school, was a devout Christian, turned to communism in desperation only after South Africa was taken over by an extraordinarily racist government determined to eliminate all rights for blacks."" As Ta-Nehisi Coates at the Atlantic pointed out, Gingrich's support for Mandela is not new or an attempt to rewrite history.""Newt Gingrich was among a cadre of conservatives who opposed the mainstream conservative stance on Apartheid and ultimately helped override Reagan's unconscionable veto of sanctions,"" he wrote, adding, ""When Gingrich compliments Mandela on his presidency he doesn't do so within the context of alleged African pathologies, but within the context of countries throughout the world. It's a textbook lessons in 'How not to be racist,' which is to say it is a textbook lesson in how to talk about Nelson Mandela as though he were a human being.""Watch Gingrich's video:Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also encountered a fair amount of vitriol last week when he honored Mandela in a Facebook post, writing, ""Nelson Mandela will live in history as an inspiration for defenders of liberty around the globe… Because of his epic fight against injustice, an entire nation is now free.”When CNN host Candy Crowley asked Gingrich if he believed his and Cruz's critics were fellow conservatives, the former House speaker said they were people who bought into ""a rationale that defined everybody who was in any way in rebellion against the established system in the third world as anti-American."""

""For this diplomatic option to have a chance at succeeding, the threat of a U.S. military action, the credible, real threat of U.S. military action, must continue,"" he declared.At the same hearing, Kerry said any diplomacy ""cannot be a process of delay. This cannot be a process of avoidance.""He later added that any agreement must include binding consequences if Syria fails to comply, and lawmakers moved to rewrite pending legislation along the same lines.Obama himself ""wasn't overly optimistic about"" prospects for a solution at the U.N., said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, after his party's rank and file met privately for lunch in the Capitol with the president. He quoted Obama as saying that even if a credible plan could be worked out, it could be difficult to push through the U.N. Security Council. And, indeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin said such a U.N. effort could work only if ""the American side and those who support the USA in this sense reject the use of force.""The president readied his speech against an unpredictable chain of events stemming from a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on Aug. 21 that the Obama administration swiftly blamed on Assad's government.U.S. officials say more than 1,400 died in the episode, including at least 400 children, and other victims suffered uncontrollable twitching, foaming at the mouth and other symptoms typical of exposure to chemical weapons banned by international treaty. Other casualty estimates are lower, and Assad has said the attack was launched by rebels who have been fighting to drive him from power in a civil war that has so far claimed the lives of more than 100,000 civilians.Assad's patron, Russia, has blocked U.S. attempts to rally the Security Council behind a military strike. But Monday, after a remark by Kerry, it spoke favorably about requiring Syria to surrender control of its chemical weapons, and the Syrian foreign minister did likewise.The foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said Tuesday that his government was ready to turn over its chemical weapons stockpile in line with Russia's proposal in order ""to thwart U.S. aggression."" He also said Syria was prepared to sign an international chemical convention it has long rejected – a step it can take on its own at any time without U.S. or U.N. supervision.Syria has long refused to provide an accounting of the size of its stockpile, rarely referring in public to its existence. According to an unclassified estimate by the French government, it includes more than 1,000 tons of ""chemical agents and precursor chemicals,"" including sulfur mustard, VX and sarin gas.Obama has said frequently he has the authority as commander in chief to order a military strike against Assad regardless of any vote in Congress, and he has consistently declined to say whether he would do so if lawmakers refuse to approve the legislation he is seeking.The response in Congress to support such a strike has been lukewarm at best – as underscored during the day when liberal Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and conservative Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., both announced their opposition.Markey, who was elected to the seat that Kerry vacated when he joined the Cabinet, said the legislation under consideration was too broad, ""the effects of a strike are too unpredictable, and ... I believe we must give diplomatic measures that could avoid military action a chance to work.""Said Mulvaney: ""While I am concerned about taking no action, it strikes me that international law cannot be upheld via unilateral attack by the United States.""And Rep. James Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on committees dealing both with military and intelligence matters, said he feared that ""Iran and Russia could cause serious damage"" to the United States if they retaliated with a cyberattack.Yet Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, said, ""It would be inimical to our country's standing if we do not show a willingness to act in the face of the use of chemical weapons and to act in a limited way to address that use alone.""Hours before Obama's speech from the White House's East Room, Hoyer added, "" I don't think there's any doubt that failure to do so would weaken our country, create a more dangerous international environment and to some degree undermine the president of the United States.""Earlier, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell became the first congressional leader to come out against legislation giving the president authority for limited strikes. ""There are just too many unanswered questions about our long-term strategy in Syria,"" he said.By contrast, Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, the top two Republicans in the House, have endorsed Obama's request.Given the uncertainty of diplomatic maneuvering, no vote is expected for several days, if then.""If something can be done diplomatically, I'm totally satisfied with that. I'm not a blood and thunder guy. I'm not for shock and awe,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in a reference to the massive display of firepower that opened the war in Iraq nearly a decade ago.Still, there was ample skepticism in Congress about the United Nations as well as Russia's true intentions, as well as Syria's willingness to be bound by international agreements.""There is an overwhelming view it would be preferable if international law and the family of nations could strip Syria of the chemical weapons,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""And there's a large view we should let that process play out for a little while.""Said Boehner: ""Clearly, diplomacy is always a better outcome than military action. But I will say that I'm somewhat skeptical of those that are involved in the diplomatic discussions today.""This post has been updated with video of Obama's speech."

Snowden revealed his identity in a Guardian piece published on Sunday. After approaching the media with bombshell revelations about the NSA's secret programs, he left the United States for Hong Kong and holed himself up in a hotel room for three weeks.The Washington Post reported that a guest by the name of Edward Snowden had been staying at the Mira Hotel, but checked out Monday. It is unclear whether Snowden is still in Hong Kong. Hong Kong-based correspondents have been trying to hunt him down, staking out a number of hotels that matched the description Snowden gave to the Guardian. The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill reported that ""media scrums"" were forming at hotels in the city, while USA Today described the search as a ""media manhunt."" Snowden told the Guardian that he chose Hong Kong as a refuge for its ""spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent."" In an interview with the Associated Press, The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald said that Snowden fled to Hong Kong because he ""doesn't really trust the judicial system in the United States to give him a fair trial."" The revelation, however, has sparked speculation about whether his choice was a wise one. The current treaty between Hong Kong and the U.S. guarantees extradition unless China believes that doing so would hurt ""defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy"" — an exception that some experts say is rare. The New York Times reported Monday that the government is ""seen as likely to extradite"" Snowden if the U.S. requests it to do so, while New York magazine's Joe Coscarelli predicted that China will do what is necessary to avoid a ""diplomatic crisis."" The New Yorker's Evan Osnos also questioned Snowden's choice, writing that ""going to Hong Kong out of devotion to free speech is a bit like going to Tibet out of a devotion to Buddhism; the people love it, though they live under authorities who intervene when they choose."" Other experts imagined some scenarios where Snowden might be granted asylum. The Global Post's Benjamin Carlson also reported that Hong Kong is currently changing its procedure for reviewing applications for asylum, which might work in Snowden's favor if asylum seekers are allowed to stay in the city until a new procedure is put in place. Ironically, a full-page ad in Monday's New York Times touted ""the Hong Kong advantage"" when it comes to business opportunities in the city. ABC News editor Jon Williams tweeted a picture, writing, ""Ed Snowden hoping so."""

We don't need anyone.

If it really did it would have intervened a long time ago.""""The United States and Russia are playing with Syria; we mean absolutely nothing to them. The same is true of the United Nations, which accuses the regime of crimes against humanity and keeps talking and talking, as if that would solve anything.

That suggested Venezuela may help Snowden, who is stranded in Moscow after flying there from Hong Kong on June 23, to find a safe haven.Snowden's bid for Icelandic citizenship hit an impasse earlier on Friday when the country's parliament voted not to debate it before the summer recess.Afterwards, WikiLeaks announced that Snowden had applied to another six countries for asylum, adding to a list of more than a dozen countries which he has already asked for protection.The anti-secrecy organization, which has been supporting Snowden's efforts to find a safe haven since his exit from Hong Kong 12 days ago, said on Twitter it could not reveal the names the countries due to ""attempted U.S. interference"".

Sherry Rehman, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United States, is under investigation by Pakistani police for allegedly blasphemous remarks she made more than two years ago on a Pakistani talk show, Agence France-Press reports. If convicted, Rehman could be sentenced to death. A senior police official confirmed to AFP on Tuesday that authorities had begun investigating Rehman on orders from the Pakistani Supreme Court. According to CBS, the case is a response to a 31-year-old Pakistani businessman's complaint to authorities, in which he singled out Rehman for remarks she made during a Nov. 30, 2010, appearance on Dunya TV news program “Dunya Meray Aagay.” Rehman's contentious statements were made during a discussion about Aasia Bibi, an impoverished Pakistani Christian woman who had been sentenced to death a few weeks earlier for allegedly insulting the Prophet Muhammed.In Pakistan, anyone who insults the Prophet (even indirectly or implicitly) can be given a death sentence or life imprisonment. Recently, a 14-year-old girl named Rimsha Masih was arrested and jailed for allegedly burning pages from the Quran. She was later freed after a Muslim cleric was accused of framing her.Over 1,200 people have been charged with blasphemy in Pakistan since the harsh law was enacted in 1986, according to English-language Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Critics of the measure say the law is often used to persecute religious minorities or settle personal vendettas.While there have been no verified reports of anyone being officially executed, angry lynch mobs have reportedly bypassed the judicial system and carried out the executions themselves. The Guardian notes that when influential Pakistani politician Salman Taseer was assassinated by his own bodyguard in 2011, the security guard was said to have told police he killed Taseer for advocating against the country's blasphemy laws.Rehman, who was appointed Ambassador to the U.S. in November 2011, has campaigned against Pakistan's blasphemy laws herself. She received death threats in 2010 after drafting a bill to abolish the death penalty for blasphemy, DNA India reports. Rehman was later pressured by her own party to drop the bill.

Barack Obama declared, early in his first presidential campaign, that he would be willing to meet with the leaders of estranged nations like Iran and Syria without preconditions, he was roundly chastised by both Democrats and Republicans alike for naivete.But now, after six arduous, solitary years of standing by a policy of preferring accord with rogue nations over recourse to full-on war, his approach seems to be on the verge of bearing fruit. In Syria, President Bashar Assad has agreed to open his chemical weapons program to international oversight, and eventual destruction, after a furious round of diplomacy involving Secretary of State John Kerry and top Russian diplomats. And in Iran, a new, moderate president has responded to a personal letter from Obama, engaging in direct communication for the first time in years and hinting that he might be willing to pull back from his country's controversial nuclear program in exchange for a reduction of painful economic sanctions.None of the developments has occurred without context or notes of caution, but it's nevertheless a remarkable turn of events for a president whose foreign policy, even a month ago, appeared to be in hapless disarray. If the diplomatic tracks in Syria and Iran pan out, proponents say they could point the way to the resolution of two of the most significant international crises facing the nation, without any American-caused warfare. ""The administration's willingness to show both strength and smarts is paying off,"" said Joel Rubin, the director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund and a former State Department official, who has worked to promote conflict resolution in the Middle East through discourse.""On Syria, the president demonstrated that there was a clear point that he did not want the regime to pass, and then took a window of opportunity to cut a deal that actually advances American security interests even more,"" Rubin added. ""An ancillary benefit has been that it's demonstrated to the Iranians that the U.S. is thinking before it's shooting, and that's a pretty new trend for the U.S.""Next week, the new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, travels to New York for the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). His arrival brings perhaps the greatest hope for a diplomatic breakthrough between Washington and Tehran in recent memory, and in turn, a possible vindication of Obama's refusal to condone military strikes against the country.The Obama administration has yet to confirm whether any United States officials plan to meet with Iranian counterparts in New York. Nonetheless, the prospect of such a meeting has diplomatic circles buzzing.""If there's a meeting between the United States and Iran on the sidelines of UNGA, that will be huge,"" said a senior Obama administration official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations. Such a meeting would almost certainly be held well below the presidential level, the official said, most likely between the Iranian foreign minister and a senior U.S. diplomat like Wendy Sherman, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, or Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns. It's also possible that a ""chance encounter"" between Obama and Rouhani could be arranged in the halls of the UN. ""Sherman and Burns have the most experience communicating with Iran,"" said the official. ""But whoever it is, it would be a momentous meeting, because this kind of open, direct talks haven't happened in 34 years."" The past week has seen a number of unprecedented overtures from Rouhani, including a rare interview with an American news outlet and writing an op-ed, published Friday in the Washington Post, in which he called for a new era of ""constructive engagement"" between Iran and the West.The Iranian government also released nearly a dozen prisoners ahead of Rouhani's visit to the U.S., something that experts say often happens before international forays, but rarely includes such domestic political detainees as the women's rights activist Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was released on Wednesday.And in his interview with NBC this past week, Rouhani said that his country had no intention of ever developing nuclear weapons, adding that he has ""complete authority"" to negotiate a deal over the peaceful components of the nuclear program.""This is probably the best opportunity that I can think of [for a breakthrough],"" said Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council and a longtime advocate of the U.S. taking a less heavy-handed approach to diplomacy with Iran. ""Right now, Rouhani has unprecedented flexibility.""Skeptics have suggested that Rouhani may have less freedom to maneuver within the hardline elements of his country than he's suggested, especially on the question of the nuclear program. But even some of the most ardent Western dissenters on the regime's capacity to moderate say that the current moment represents one of the greatest openings for dialogue in memory.Jeffrey Feltman, the U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs, and a former top Middle East official in the Bush administration where he often struck a hard line on Iran, said recently that in meetings with the foreign minister in Tehran he has detected an openness to negotiating on Syria.""It's hard for us to imagine any solution in Syria that doesn't somehow have an Iranian role,"" Feltman told CNN last week. ""The Iranians stated that they understand that we need to get to a political solution. I don't think from my conversations that I had in Iran that the Iranians see it in their interest to see the situation [in Syria] continue or deteriorate.""Parsi believes that in winning a surprise electoral victory over conservatives, Rouhani has actually earned himself a brief window of opportunity to make a deal with the West -- but it's one that must be struck quickly.""You have to assume he has six months or so where he can get his way, and where the conservatives will have to be on their best behavior,"" Parsi said. ""This is a moment when he has maximum flexibility -- it will either expand if he gets a deal, or it will be lost if he doesn't. If the U.S. fails to reciprocate, we will be forced to deal with the hardliners six months from now.""Not everyone agrees that Obama deserves full credit for pursuing diplomacy at the expense of other tactics. After all, while he has avoided troops-on-the-ground combat in places like Iran and Syria, he hasn't slowed his deadly policy of drone strikes in hot zones like Yemen and Pakistan.And to some participants in the Obama administration's earlier days, the talk of dialogue and diplomacy in places like Iran was often more talk than practice -- the recent openings from Assad and Rouhani, they argue, have essentially fallen in his lap.""I think he was not looking for diplomacy with Iran or Syria,"" said Vali Nasr, the dean of Johns Hopkins University’s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, and a former State Department policy adviser. ""Now that it has come his way, he will be judged by whether he makes diplomacy work.""Others -- including some of Obama's own advisers -- argue that to the extent Obama deserves credit for the possible breakthroughs, it is instead because he turned against his espoused belief in dialogue, and showed a credible threat against the regimes: For Syria, it was the recent talk of cruise missile strikes, they say; for Iran, it was years of crushing economic sanctions.""It was that threat of force from President Obama that changed the calculus around the chemical weapons issue [in Syria], and allowed for this diplomatic progress,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters on a conference call Friday. But while it's true that Obama hasn't always held true to the ideals of his early campaign days -- first-term talk of engagement ""grounded in mutual respect"" eventually gave way to tough rhetoric about ""painful sanctions"" and nuclear red lines -- he consistently resisted the hardline pull, from hawkish members of Congress and Israeli allies, toward a preventative military strike. ""There is too much loose talk of war,"" Obama said about U.S. and Israeli threats toward Iran, in a powerful 2012 speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.For observers like Parsi, it is actually this softer side that has done the most to earn the present detente with Iran.""What Iranians are largely reacting to now is that Rouhani got a congratulatory letter from Obama. That's not toughness -- that is a huge concession given to the Iranians,"" said Parsi. ""When Iranians are convinced that the other side wants to take military action, the only way they know to respond and try to prevent it is to show how high the costs would be, not to suddenly show flexibility.""It's a notion promoted by some of the sharpest minds in U.S. policy. Earlier this year, Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, told the Los Angeles Times that without the promise of a softer touch, a strong sanctions regime would only harden Iranian interlocutors.“Sanctions are easy to do, and afterwards we can tell ourselves that, ‘by God, we’ve really stuck it to them,’” he said. “But it seems to me that the more you press this regime, the more they dig in.”""Sanctions and pressure are useless if you don't get something for them,"" added Rubin. ""There are going to be some people in Washington who say, 'see, the sanctions are working, let's keep the pedal to the floor and we'll push them over completely and get everything that we want.' But that's not how it works. What the president's saying is, 'let's test them.'""Officials say those tests are likely to come down to technical issues, such as whether Iran is willing to reduce the number of nuclear centrifuges it currently has in operation. Progress on this front could signal ""whether perhaps there's a place for the U.S. and Iran to meet in the middle,"" said the administration official. ""It's going to be technical specifications, not speeches or tweets or op-eds, that will be the crucial components in determining whether or not there will ever be a true thaw between the two countries."" Joshua Hersh reported from Beirut, and Christina Wilkie reported from Washington."

So, it is utter nonsense when we are told that Israel is reluctant to move forward on a deal with the Palestinians because it does not ""feel the love"" from America and the Obama administration in view of the secret American negotiations with Iran and the interim nuclear deal signed by Iran and the P5+1 powers. It is similarly baseless when we are told that the interim deal with Iran coupled with the effort to negotiate an end to the war in Syria demonstrate that Washington is preparing to turn its attention away from the region and somehow that provides a legitimate reason for Israel to back off its negotiations with the Palestinians.The claim by those in Israel and in the American Jewish community that President Obama has ""thrown Israel under the bus"" in entering the interim deal with Iran just doesn't stand up to scrutiny. In narrowly framing the only deal that would be acceptable to Israel as one that would stop the Iranians from any kind of nuclear enrichment, Prime Minster Netanyahu has set the bar too high to be realistic. It is not credible that Iran would agree to such a deal, however strong the sanction regime. The result is that the only alternative to Netanyahu's deal would be a war with Iran, with all the uncertainties as to what would be accomplished and the possibilities of costly escalation. The Obama administration, fully reflecting the view of the American people, does not want a war unless every other possibility for a peaceful resolution has been explored and has failed. What Israel, Saudi Arabia and those other nations opposed to the Iranian deal can contribute of great value is in depth intelligence, in carefully monitoring the actions of the Iranians to insure that they are indeed carrying out the terms of the deal and when the interim period has ended, determining whether Iran is closer to a nuclear capability than it was before. In addition, those nations in opposition can help the United States maintain the full force of the sanctions that have not been lifted under the terms of the agreement and apply pressure on nations and businesses not to allow sanctions to weaken during the interim period so that they can be fully reinstated if they have to be. As for the impact of the Iranian deal on Israel's relationship with the Palestinians -- long before the secret negotiations with Iran had begun, in these pages and elsewhere I, like others, questioned whether Prime Minister Netanyahu truly sought a two state solution with the Palestinians. We pointed to his personal history as well as the effect any deal would have in destroying his political coalition. And we also noted that the Palestinian issue was not in the forefront of concerns of the Israeli people, although a strong commitment from their leaders could probably convince them to accept a two state deal. Now, that the period for negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians set by Secretary Kerry is one third completed, it does not appear that the parties have made significant enough progress to lead to the belief that a deal ultimately can be reached. This has nothing to do with America's diplomatic efforts regarding Iran. In fact, the why of the failing negotiations does not really matter. What does matter is that they are failing and there is little hope for a negotiated resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The question now is what can replace that approach.There are some in the United States and the region who would now call on the Obama Administration to offer bridging solutions to the parties. These proposals range from the President providing suggestions to resolve specific issues to his presenting a defined plan covering all the points and pressuring the parties to accept the plan as presented. In light of the political position that the President finds himself -- a difficult opposition looking for any reason to attack him and a declining popularity -- it would be surprising if he used what little leverage he has to provide any forcible action in this arena.Another approach being suggested by some in Israel calls for a ""framework agreement"" that would outline some of the key elements of a final status agreement such as the percent of West Bank areas allocated to each party but not resolve all the claims. It is suggested that this approach be coupled with financial programs that help move the Palestinian closer toward a viable state. However, it is hard to believe that this approach will be acceptable to the Palestinians, even though it is offered coated with financial incentives. The Palestinian leaders will most likely see it as a further delay of their ambition for statehood, allowing Israel time to expand its settlement program, notwithstanding any commitment to the contrary in the agreement. The other possibility is some form of unilateral withdrawal by Israel even without a mutual agreement. This solution would appeal to those like Israeli author Ari Shavit who argue that Israel should separate itself from the Palestinians for its own benefit but that it should not expect a ""peace"" between them ever to work effectively. For my own part, as a Zionist who has long advocated that Israel avoid a bi-national state or absorbing any large part of the Palestinian population to ensure that it maintains its position as a democratic and Jewish state (see my HuffPost blog A Message From A Long Standing Zionist To The Israeli People, 08/08/2013), I would personally support unilateral withdrawal if a two state solution was impossible to achieve. However, at this time, such a unilateral approach has no significant support in Israel and after the perception of the result of unilateral withdrawal in Gaza and Lebanon, notwithstanding the reality of the benefit of those actions, unilateral action is highly unlikely.Unhappily, the failure of the effort by Secretary Kerry to bring the parties together will leave a vacuum and no one can predict what will fill it. We are already seeing the beginnings of violence on both sides and one can only hope that it does not erupt in a significant way as it has in the past. Most likely we will see a continued drift along current lines where Israel expands settlements and the Palestinians turn to the UN and International pressure on Israel in the form of boycotts and divestiture. One has to wonder whether this will cause more real damage to Israel than Iran's efforts to achieve nuclear capability. At least, in the latter situation Israel has the overwhelming nuclear capability to face Iran down and also has the United States umbrella of support. What will it have to protect it if somehow it is seen as engaging in apartheid actions? I hope that day never comes; but the expansionist course now being followed by Israel has that danger attached to it.

Baker and Lisa RichwineAug 20 (Reuters) - New cable network Al Jazeera America introduced itself to viewers on Tuesday with reports on political strife in Egypt and the impact of climate change on U.S. cities, shortly after a major pay TV distributor declined to carry the channel.The decision by AT&T's U-verse pay-TV service stemmed from a contract dispute over terms to carry the new network, AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said. Al Jazeera responded by suing AT&T for breach of contract in Delaware Chancery Court.Globally, Al Jazeera is seen in more than 260 million homes in 130 countries. But the new U.S. channel funded by the emir of Qatar has so far had difficulty getting distributors, in part because Al Jazeera was perceived by some as being anti-American during the Iraq war.Before AT&T's announcement, Al Jazeera America said it would be available in more than 40 million homes, about 40 percent of U.S. pay TV households and roughly half the reach of Time Warner Inc's CNN. U-verse was launched in 2006 and had 5 million video customers at the end of June in markets such as Texas and California.""We could not reach an agreement with the owner that we believed provided value for our customers and our business,"" AT&T spokesman Siegel said.Al Jazeera America said in a statement AT&T had ""unilaterally"" deleted the network and ""presented us with circumstances that were untenable - an affiliate that has willfully and knowingly breached its contractual obligations.""The network said it had ""no choice"" but to file a lawsuit over the matter.Defining the new channel's mission clearly will be crucial for Al Jazeera to gain a foothold in the United States, according to advertisers, executives and industry experts.In its first hour at midafternoon, Al Jazeera pledged to cover ""issues that matter to America and the world beyond."" Anchors said they would provide in-depth coverage of stories ignored by other media outlets, with bureaus in cities they considered underserved such as Nashville and Detroit.Al Jazeera America hired ABC news veteran Kate O'Brian to be its president and hired on-air talent like CNN veterans Ali Velshi and Soledad O'Brien.Its news coverage kicked off with reports on Egypt, a Georgia elementary school shooting and wildfires in the western United States, topics covered by cable news competitors on Tuesday. Al Jazeera America also reported on a hunger strike by inmates protesting conditions in California prisons and Kodak's plan to rebound from bankruptcy.It turned to sports with an interview of retired slugger Gary Sheffield about baseball's steroids scandal. A show called ""Inside Story"" explored the impact of climate change on U.S. cities and working conditions in Bangladeshi factories.Audience ratings data were not yet available. COVERAGE DESCRIBED AS BALANCEDMedia critic Howard Kurtz, speaking on rival Fox News Channel, said Al Jazeera America's early coverage was ""not much different, at least so far, than what you might see on Fox News, CNN or MSNBC."" One top story on Egypt was ""right down the middle"" in terms of balance, he said.The network is airing six minutes of commercials per hour, below the 15 to 16 minute average on other cable news outlets. Executives indicated they are willing to lose money in the near term.Advertisers on Tuesday included Procter & Gamble Co's Gillette for its Fusion razors and phone service provider Vonage .U-verse is the second TV provider after Time Warner Cable to drop the network since it acquired Current TV in January and replaced it with Al Jazeera America. Comcast, DirecTV, Dish and Verizon are carrying the network.Merrill Brown, a former media executive who helped launch cable news network MSNBC, said Al Jazeera America may need to pay distributors if it wants to reach more viewers, particularly since it is not owned by a media conglomerate that can package it with other channels to gain leverage in negotiations.""It's hard to believe they are going to get this thing nationally distributed without paying for carriage,"" Brown said.

President Barack Obama ended up calling Andy Rosenthal, the paper’s editorial page editor, and a couple weeks later Rosenthal and the Times editorial board went to the White House for an off-the-record meeting with the president. But that wasn’t the last time Obama met with Times editorial board members. On Aug. 29, the president again sat down for an off-the-record discussion with Rosenthal and some members of the editorial board, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Times opinion columnists David Brooks, Gail Collins and Ross Douthat also attended, but editors for the paper's news pages did not.The meeting came amid the White House’s push for military intervention in Syria, one of the topics discussed that day. The Times editorial board hadn't explicitly come out for or against a strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad before the meeting, and soon after the paper still expressed concerns about the administration taking action without congressional approval and broad international support. On Aug. 26, The Times editorial board had stressed that the White House should try exhausting diplomatic efforts before striking Syria. The paper noted that while “Assad’s use of chemical weapons surely requires a response of some kind, the arguments against deep American involvement remain as compelling as ever.”Two days later, The Times editorial board wrote that more answers were needed from the administration on Syria. ""Obama has yet to spell out how that response would effectively deter further use of chemical weapons,"" the paper said.On the afternoon of Aug. 30, Secretary of State John Kerry made the case that Syria had used chemical weapons, signaling that U.S. retaliation for crossing a ""red line"" drawn by Obama could be imminent. But the Times still seemed unconvinced that immediate action was the best course. In an editorial posted online Aug. 30 and in the next day's paper, Times editors wrote that “even in the best of circumstances, military action could go wrong in so many ways; the lack of strong domestic and international support will make it even more difficult.”The Times also noted that Obama's “approach on Syria now seems wholly at odds with the strong position” he took as a candidate in 2007. Obama had told the Boston Globe at the time that “the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.”On the evening of Aug. 30, Obama reportedly decided to seek congressional approval for a strike during a talk with chief of staff Denis McDonough. He announced his decision publicly the following day. Rosenthal did not respond to requests for comment about the Aug. 29 meeting and a Times spokeswoman declined to discuss the specifics of that gathering or the the 2011 meeting reported by Wolffe.“We did meet with the Obama White House about two years ago and that meeting was off the record,” a Times spokeswoman said. “We met with them again recently under the same restriction, which we intend to honor.” Throughout his presidency, Obama has held off-the-record meetings with prominent news anchors, columnists and commentators, including Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein, MSNBC host Ed Schultz and Arianna Huffington, president, chair and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group.But the Obama White House has long seemed particularly interested in getting its point of view across in the Times, and the president has said he reads all the paper's columnists. In April, a former adviser said the Times is the only paper Obama reads. In his book, Wolffe describes how after each negative Times editorial, ""the president would summon his communications team to discuss the critical coverage."" He also included a 2011 anecdote about the White House communications team wondering whether calling Rosenthal through the Times' directory would lead to an announcement over the paper's general PA system. (It wouldn’t.)The anecdote is surprising given that Rosenthal has spoken in the past about the Obama White House's efforts to reach out to him. In March 2009, Rosenthal told this reporter that he had already received “more unsolicited offers for participation from the Obama people in 45 days” than during the eight years of George W. Bush's presidency."

""This unjustified filibuster obstructed the majority of Senators from expressing their support.

North Korea deems its nuclear arms a ""treasured sword"" and has vowed never to give them up.Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, ending a trip to the region dominated by concern about North Korea, stressed his interest in a diplomatic solution.""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang,"" he said. ""North Korea must take meaningful steps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of international behavior.""On Sunday evening, Kerry appeared to open the door to talking without requiring the North to take denuclearization steps in advance. Beijing, he said, could be an intermediary.But on Monday White House spokesman Jay Carney said North Korea would have to ""commit itself in a verifiable way to denuclearization"" first, which has long been the U.S. position.""If North Korea shows that it's serious about pursuing that path, then negotiations are the course through which that can be achieved,"" Carney told reporters.Earlier, Kerry said he believed China, the North's sole economic and political benefactor, should put ""some teeth"" in efforts to persuade Pyongyang to alter its policies.The Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, warned on Monday that tensions could get out of control.""It does not matter if it is intentional or accidental, even the smallest thing could cause the situation to change rapidly and perhaps get totally out of control,"" the paper said. ON GUARDSouth Korean and U.S. officials said last week North Korea appeared set to test-launch a medium-range missile as a show of strength linked to Monday's anniversary of the birth of North Korean state founder Kim Il-Sung.North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests but it was not believed to be near weapons capability.South Korea said it remained on guard against any missile launch and it regretted the North's rejection of an offer of talks made last week by President Park Geun-hye. It said the offer would remain on the table.Missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea are both banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions, which were expanded after its third nuclear test, in February.President Barack Obama is under pressure from Republicans in Congress to respond forcefully should North Korea launch a missile.""I maintain that the United States should treat any North Korean missile launch as a threat to our national security and our allies, and that we should shoot it down once it leaves North Korean airspace,"" said Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who is influential on defense issues.The aim of the North's aggressive acts, analysts say, is to bolster the leadership of Kim Jong-un, the 30-year-old grandson of the nation's founder, or to force the United States to hold talks with the North.The North has also been angry about annual military exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces, describing them as a ""hostile"" act. The United States dispatched B52 and B2 stealth bombers from their bases to take part.Yoji Koda, a former commander in chief of the Japanese naval fleet, told Reuters he believed North Korea's threats were part of a ""calculated provocation"", not a prelude to an attack.He said indications the United States was softening a forceful stance to the North had given its leader Kim Jong-un the opportunity to tone things down.""This has enabled North Korea to declare victory and sheathe its swords,"" he said.Kim Il-Sung led his country from its founding in 1948 through the 1950-53 Korean War and until he died in 1994. His son, Kim Jong-il, then took over.KCNA, the North's news agency, reported that people were flocking to a statue of Kim Il-Sung, saying, ""My father, our great leader"".""This sincere expression comes from the bottom of their hearts,"" it said.Kim Jong-un, the third Kim to rule in Pyongyang, attended a midnight celebration of his father's and grandfather's rule with top officials, including his kingmaker uncle Jang Song-thaek.North Korean defectors said army units were expected to contribute for the celebration of Kim's birthday and in turn, the government, which has struggled to feed its people, had handed out extra rations of rice and corn.""People are decorating streets for political events. It's never like war time,"" said Seo Jae-pyoung, a defector who lives in South Korea who spoke last week to an acquaintance in the North. ""The government, which normally can't distribute rice, has already given about one week or two week's special rations.""North Korea has repeatedly stressed that it fears the United States wants to invade it and has manipulated the United Nations to weaken it. During the weekend, the North rejected the overture by new South Korean President Park as a ""cunning"" ploy.""We will expand in quantity our nuclear weapons capability, which is the treasure of a unified Korea ... that we would never barter at any price,"" Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's titular head of state, told a gathering of officials and service personnel applauding the achievements of Kim Il-Sung.

Then the declaration had the weight of history behind it: Dotcom himself was arrested in 2012 on piracy charges in New Zealand based on information gathered illegally by the New Zealand government at the behest of U.S. authorities. (A New Zealand judge later ruled the search warrants invalid.)Now, in the wake of yet more government spying revelations and the loss of other encrypted options, Mega CEO Vikram Kumar reminded ZDNet's Rob O'Neill that Mega is still committed to building an encrypted email service. According to Kumar, Mega is ""doing some hugely cutting-edge stuff.""Kumar's statement has generated a lot of attention on tech blogs across the web -- not all of it complimentary. Evan Dashevsky of TechHive called the rumored email service just the latest resume padding in Dotcom's ""history of troublemaking."" But Lauren Hockenson of Gigaom remarked that Dotcom was really going all-in on privacy. In addition to filling the void left by other shutdown services, she wrote, he's also ""creating a VC [venture capital] firm that brings up encryption-focused companies.""Admittedly, the news seems far more exciting in the current context than it was when Dotcom first announced he was building encrypted email in February. Back then, the world was awash in encrypted email services: Tormail; Silent Mail; Lavabit, Snowden's reported service. Now those services are gone, and Lavabit's webpage bears a warning from Ladar Levinson, its founder: ""Without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States."" Mega's email service, if it comes to fruition, might tempt many of the privacy-conscious now bereft of a satisfactory alternative. Since his unfortunate brush with spying, Dotcom has started making a name for himself as an encryption advocate. Mega calls itself ""the Privacy Company"" and automatically encrypts every file uploaded to it.In a January interview with the English-language TV station Russia Today, Dotcom spoke strongly about online privacy. ""My goal is, within the next five years, I want to encrypt half of the Internet,"" he said. ""Just reestablish a balance between a person -- an individual -- and the state."" And true to the advice of Levinson, Mega's servers aren't hosted in the United States. The storage service is currently based in New Zealand. If that country's surveillance policies become too invasive, Dotcom told TorrentFreak, he'll move his company's infrastructure to Iceland. "

We don't need anyone. We count on the help of God, and he will guide us to final victory.""However, he said that while ""we can't expect anything from the United States, but if they finally decide to attack we will take advantage of the situation and launch an offensive against the regime's military bases and against the airport in order to take control of Aleppo.""Abu Tawfiqa, a commander of the Liwa al-Fatah brigade, said ""we don't want an attack, but if it happens the United States will find a very powerful ally on the ground.""The two brigades held a ceremony on Friday at a former military academy north of Aleppo to mark the agreement to unite their forces, which they claim number 13,000 across the country.Abu Feras, spokesman for Al-Tawhid, said ""the international community doesn't care what happens to Syria. If it really did it would have intervened a long time ago.""""The United States and Russia are playing with Syria; we mean absolutely nothing to them. The same is true of the United Nations, which accuses the regime of crimes against humanity and keeps talking and talking, as if that would solve anything. They have been talking for 30 months and done absolutely nothing.""A man standing nearby, interjected: ""Obama is a liar. He won't keep his word. He said he would attack if Assad used chemical weapons against the civilian population. What more does he need to intervene and put an end to this slaughter.""Hassan al-Mara, a former school teacher turned fighter, agreed with the man.""You are right, the West has let us down again. America and Europe have shown that their threats were no more than cheap propaganda.""Aleppo, once the commercial capital of the country, had been relatively untouched by the Syria conflict which has killed more than 110,000 people since it flared in March 2011.In summer 2012, rebels seized key districts of the city, and the army has been struggling to recapture them ever since. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the fighting and relentless regime bombing.Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved."

In the United States, only 25 percent of those surveyed in late August in a HuffPost/YouGov poll expressed support for a military strike in reaction to the lethal chemical weapons attack blamed widely on the regime of Syrian president Bashar Assad. A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center and wrapped up Sept. 1 -– almost two weeks after the chemical weapons attack -– found only 29 percent in favor of a strike. In France, where President Francois Hollande has pledged to join the United States in taking on Syria, public support for military intervention has been running at 45 percent, according to a recent CSA survey for Atlantico. Another poll conducted by Ifop for the newspaper Le Figaro found 55 percent in favor of intervention, yet only 41 percent approved of France joining in a military response.In Britain, where polls have long shown consistent opposition to any form of intervention in Syria, neither allegations of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime nor the push for action from leaders in London and Washington has altered the opinion of a war-weary public. A ComRes poll for the Independent newspaper published on Monday found that only 29 percent of people believe Britain should join the United States in launching air strikes against Syria to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, while 57 percent are outright opposed. Four out of five people assert that any military action against Syria requires the approval of the United Nations.ComRes chairman Andrew Hawkins told The Huffington Post UK that he doesn’t believe a forthcoming report from the United Nations weapons inspectors will “move the dials, and neither would further chemical crimes by Assad -– at least on the scale seen so far.” In Germany, public opinion has been running 58 percent against striking Syria, according to public television. And in Italy a recent poll by the IPR Institute found that 52 percent of the public opposed an attack on Syria even absent Italian involvement. About 57 percent of Italians opposed allowing Italian military bases to be used in assisting foreign strikes engaged in strikes.No polls have been conducted to gauge Canadian opinion on military intervention, but fatigue from involvement in Afghanistan and a few anti-Syrian-intervention protests suggest Canadians are not eager to jump in. Canada has signaled that it will not offer military support for a potential U.S.-led strike on Syria, while lending voice to calls for action.Signs of public opposition from around the globe resonate as a rebuke to the Obama administration as it presses to unleash weapons on Syria in response to a chemical weapons attack there blamed for the deaths of some 1,400 people.Public resistance reflects a marked predilection against military intervention following disastrous wars involving foreign forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. This sentiment appears to run especially deep in France, which played a leading role in interventions in Libya and Mali over the past two years. “In Mali, France went in alone, and in Libya, it was the spearhead,"" Jerome Fourquet, who heads the Opinion department at Ifop, told Le Huffington Post. ""Public opinion considers it not the job of the French to be the world’s policeman.” Public opposition also speaks to a palpable distrust of the intelligence touted in Washington as justification for firing on Syria. Memories of the run-up to the Iraq war and bogus claims that then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction have carried over to the conflict at hand.Among the British public, the ComRes poll found that 62 percent of voters felt the “experience of the Iraq war means that Britain should keep out of any military conflicts in the Middle East for the foreseeable future.""Another poll conducted by Survation for the Mail on Sunday newspaper found that 81 percent of people opposed to military action cited Iraq as an influence. Around 40 percent said that calls for air strikes in Syria by former Prime Minister Tony Blair –- a leading architect of the Iraq war -- had weakened, rather than strengthened the British government’s case.Much of the public opposition to Syria strikes reflects the fact that the conflict there is viewed as a confined event -– a humanitarian disaster, yes, and a potentially dangerous regional crisis, but not a direct threat to people living in the countries being asked to marshal a military response.Governments in Washington, London, France and Ottawa have portrayed the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons as a threat to humanity everywhere -– the sort of cruelty and incivility that cannot be allowed with impunity. Yet despite efforts by President Barack Obama to stoke fears of chemical-weapon attacks against Americans and their allies, few people outside Syria fear for their own safety.Hawkins, the ComRes chairman described “two key requirements” to gaining public support for military intervention abroad -- first, “a credible threat to the security of British citizens” and, second, “a reasonable prospect of success.""Neither appears to apply to the Syria crisis, leaving those leaders pursuing military strikes at direct odds with their publics.Still, analysts note that public opinion on armed intervention tends to be volatile, with patriotic surges and an impulse to support military forces typically following initial armed strikes.Such was the dynamic in France in the case of Libya. In early March 2011, the French public was largely opposed to intervention in Libya, with only 36 percent expressing support in polls. But less than a month later, following the first French strikes in Libya, public support surged to 66 percent.“What we saw was a patriotic reflex with public opinion rallying to the flag,"" Fourquet said. ""All the more so because risks were limited, as the intervention consisted exclusively of air strikes.” And yet this same tendency for public opinion to fluctuate tends to work in reverse when military campaigns drag on: By the summer of 2011, as Moammar Gadhafi's regime fell in Libya, French approval for continued national involvement had just slipped below the 50 percent mark.Another source of public unease is a sense that the military strikes could provoke an unforeseen regional conflagration, requiring a larger and more perilous intervention. So warns even a former member of the Syrian National Council, the coalition of opposition parties seeking to oust Assad.""I could theoretically favor targeted and limited strikes, to exercise pressure and relaunch the political process, because there will be no military solution,"" the former SNC member, Randa Kassis, said in an exclusive interview with HuffPost Maghreb. ""But the problem with these strikes is the response of the regime. How will Western countries react then? Have they considered the risk. If one response leads to the next, what will the consequences be? A regional war, perhaps? I am against intervention, because we don't know the consequences.""

The Cable writes:An Obama administration official who reviewed the document, which was classified at the ""secret"" level, detailed its contents to The Cable. ""We can't definitely say 100 percent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 was used in Homs on Dec. 23,"" the official said.U.S. and NATO representatives have warned the embattled Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons would trigger an international reaction. ""The possible use of chemical weapons would be completely unacceptable for the whole international community and if anybody resorts to these terrible weapons I would expect an immediate reaction from the international community,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in December, according to Reuters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist network based in Britain, claimed in December that six Syrian rebels had died after inhaling smoke in the city of Homs. The Observatory said that the fighters inhaled ""white smoke without a smell"" and that they ""felt dizzy and suffered headaches."" Some reportedly suffered seizures. Al Jazeera received two videos in the wake of the Dec. 23 assault, which purport to show the aftermath of the attack. Syria denied the December accusations and said it would not use chemical weapons against its citizens. While the U.S. has said the use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line,"" the administration has refrained from specifying what action it would consider.The State Department declined to comment to The Cable. Activists estimate more than 60,000 people have died since the start of the conflict in Syria in March 2011. "

Sherry Rehman, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United States, is under investigation by Pakistani police for allegedly blasphemous remarks she made more than two years ago on a Pakistani talk show, Agence France-Press reports. If convicted, Rehman could be sentenced to death. A senior police official confirmed to AFP on Tuesday that authorities had begun investigating Rehman on orders from the Pakistani Supreme Court. According to CBS, the case is a response to a 31-year-old Pakistani businessman's complaint to authorities, in which he singled out Rehman for remarks she made during a Nov. 30, 2010, appearance on Dunya TV news program “Dunya Meray Aagay.” Rehman's contentious statements were made during a discussion about Aasia Bibi, an impoverished Pakistani Christian woman who had been sentenced to death a few weeks earlier for allegedly insulting the Prophet Muhammed.In Pakistan, anyone who insults the Prophet (even indirectly or implicitly) can be given a death sentence or life imprisonment. Recently, a 14-year-old girl named Rimsha Masih was arrested and jailed for allegedly burning pages from the Quran. She was later freed after a Muslim cleric was accused of framing her.Over 1,200 people have been charged with blasphemy in Pakistan since the harsh law was enacted in 1986, according to English-language Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Critics of the measure say the law is often used to persecute religious minorities or settle personal vendettas.While there have been no verified reports of anyone being officially executed, angry lynch mobs have reportedly bypassed the judicial system and carried out the executions themselves. The Guardian notes that when influential Pakistani politician Salman Taseer was assassinated by his own bodyguard in 2011, the security guard was said to have told police he killed Taseer for advocating against the country's blasphemy laws.Rehman, who was appointed Ambassador to the U.S. in November 2011, has campaigned against Pakistan's blasphemy laws herself. She received death threats in 2010 after drafting a bill to abolish the death penalty for blasphemy, DNA India reports. Rehman was later pressured by her own party to drop the bill.

That's his decision, he is an adult, he is a person who is responsible for his own agency,"" Lon Snowden said, standing beside Kucherena at Sheremetyevo airport.""I am his father, I love my son and I certainly hope I will have an opportunity to see my son,"" Snowden said.Edward Snowden was the source of disclosures about U.S. government surveillance that included details about a program that collected e-mails, chat logs and other types of data from companies such as Google Inc and Facebook Inc.""I really have no idea what his intentions are,"" Lon Snowden said, citing his lack of direct contact with him.But he said he believed Snowden had not been involved in the publication of any information since he arrived in Russia and was ""simply trying to remain healthy and safe"".Directly from the airport, he and the lawyer drove to a state television studio to give an exclusive live interview, indicating the visit was under strong government control.Kucherena, who said he last saw Edward Snowden on Wednesday, expressed hope the former intelligence contractor would soon find a job in Russia - possibly in IT or human rights sector - because he has largely run out of his savings and was living modestly, mainly of donations.He also said the fugitive American lived under security in Russia and was avoiding publicity because of the U.S. chase after him. NO HANDOVERSnowden, who worked as a systems administrator at a U.S. National Security Agency facility in Hawaii, fled to Hong Kong in June and then flew to Moscow. The United States annulled his passport and urged nations in Latin America and elsewhere not to take him in or help him find refuge from U.S. prosecution.President Vladimir Putin rejected repeated American pleas to hand Snowden over to the United States but has denied Russia had any role in Snowden's disclosures or that its intelligence agencies were working with him in any way.Putin has used Snowden's case to accuse the United States of preaching to the world about rights and freedoms it does not uphold at home.After Snowden was granted asylum, on Aug. 1, U.S. President Barack Obama pulled out of a summit with Putin that had been scheduled for early September in Moscow, but then met Putin at a G20 summit in St. Petersburg.Edward Snowden is in the running for the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, a European human rights award whose past winners include Nelson Mandela and Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The winner is to be chosen on Thursday."

""Obviously, our concern at this point is for the safe return of the two U.S. citizens.""Pirate attacks off Nigeria's coast have jumped by a third this year as ships passing through West Africa's Gulf of Guinea, a major commodities route, have come under threat from gangs wanting to snatch cargoes and crews.The U.S.-flagged C-Retriever, a 222-foot (67 metre) vessel owned by U.S. marine transport group Edison Chouest Offshore, was attacked early Wednesday, UK-based security firm AKE and two security sources said. The company was not immediately available for comment.A U.S. defense official said the State Department and FBI were leading the American response to the incident. A second defense official said the U.S. Marine Corps has a small training unit in the region but it was not clear if it would get involved.However, representatives for the Nigerian Navy said they were aware of the incident and taking action. ""We have directed the central Naval Command to see to their rescue. So our men are on top of the situation,"" spokesman Kabiru Aliyu told Reuters.U.S. Navy officials have grown increasingly concerned about piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea and are working with local authorities there to strengthen their ability to patrol the region and better share information.The White House said on Thursday it is increasingly concerned about the rise in piracy off the coast of West Africa.""More broadly, we are concerned by the disturbing increase in the incidence of maritime crime, including incidents of piracy off the coast of West Africa, specifically in the Gulf of Guinea,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters at a briefing.Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has called the region a potential ""hot spot"" after a visit to four countries surrounding the gulf in August. He told Defense News in September the Navy was working closely with Gabon, Senegal, Sao Tome and Ghana to help fight an increase in illegal trafficking of drugs, people and arms.""The piracy threat is spreading even further through the waters of West Africa, and the attacks have been mounting, even as global rates of reported piracy are at their lowest since 2006,"" said Michael Frodl of U.S.-based consultancy C-Level Maritime Risks. CONTRAST TO HORN OF AFRICAUnlike the dangerous waters off Somalia and the Horn of Africa on the east coast of Africa, through which ships now speed with armed guards on board, many vessels have to anchor to do business off West African countries with little protection.This makes them targets for criminals and raises insurance costs. Kidnapped sailors and oil workers taken in Nigerian waters are usually released after a ransom is paid.In a separate incident, three Nigerian soldiers were killed on Tuesday when armed robbers attacked a vessel carrying construction workers in the creeks of oil-producing Rivers state, the army said on Thursday.Piracy has regained attention in the U.S. recently since the release of a movie earlier this month chronicling an April 2009 hijacking of a U.S. ship by Somali attackers.The incident involved a cargo ship seized off the Horn of Africa later rescued by the U.S. Navy, which sent two ships and Navy SEALS to intervene."
16090	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-s-goodman/american-strike-syria-chemical-weapons_b_3844085.html	Opinion	0	International News	None	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"Only a cynic could absorb the sight of children wrapped in body bags outside Damascus following the apparent chemical weapons attack and not feel a primal urge to see those who unleashed such evil punished.Only an innocent could contemplate a world in which a brutal dictator can deploy such weapons without consequence and feel secure.Yet only someone who has willfully dismissed the tragic lessons of the last dozen years could countenance the Obama administration unleashing its own lethal weapons against Syria absent the authority of the United Nations Security Council and without the active participation of a multi-national coalition. (And, no, France and Australia do not constitute enough.)Only those who have forgotten how the United States and its allies wound up in a catastrophic war in Iraq could now charge toward military confrontation with Syria, absent a clear and credible annunciation of the intelligence that supposedly ties Bashar Assad's government to the chemical weapons attack, and without an agreed upon plan for how to handle the potential repercussions. Yes, the Syria conflict of today and the Iraqi misadventure undertaken a decade ago present two different circumstances, as many experts have already emphasized. Iraq was in no way related to the incident that -- at least publicly -- provoked the American-led war, the attacks of Sept. 11 delivered by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda partners-in-terrorism. In Syria, Assad has for years been meting out horrific brutality on those who oppose him, with visibly lethal consequences. The crime for which he now stands accused fits a pattern.Where the case for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was manufactured from the beginning, the likelihood that Assad's government really was responsible for the chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb appears far more plausible.And where the government of George W. Bush was palpably intent on waging a broad and transformational military campaign against longtime enemies in the wake of Sept. 11, President Barack Obama could not be more reluctant to take on the battle before him. He made his name as the man who opposed the Iraq war from inception. He has finally charted a course out of the companion disaster in Afghanistan.But in one crucial regard, the rush to strike Syria is indeed reminiscent of the ill-fated march into Iraq: It would undermine the very thing it is premised on defending -- international norms and a supposed code of decency.Put aside the bloviating about spreading freedom and democracy that accompanied the plunge into Iraq and go back to the narrative that sold the campaign -- the bogus intelligence that then-Secretary of State Colin Powell shared with the U.N. in seeking its blessing for the war: Iraq was a threat to the community of nations. Its very existence raised the prospect of mushroom clouds, as Bush's national security adviser at the time Condoleeza Rice famously intoned. That was nonsense, a fact that needs no rehash here. Iraq's then-President Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction. Even if he had, using them against the U.S. or a regional ally would have amounted to suicide -- the sort of basic common sense understanding that had enabled Saddam to endure for decades.And now here is Obama, declaring in a television interview with PBS, that part of the reason Americans ought to fear Syria is that ""chemical weapons that can have devastating effects could be directed at us.""Let us generously assume that this is merely unfortunate rhetoric, the usual fear-mongering employed by a commander in chief needing to prepare a dubious public that a now-inevitable military strike is in the national interest. The realpolitik conversation has it that the strike has two aims: to make clear that American dictates are to be taken seriously -- in this case, Obama's delineation of a red line barring chemical weapons -- and to reinforce an international agreement making such means beyond the pale.Both of these supposed aims would be ill-served by a strike on Syria absent the active assent and support of other actors around the globe, and not least the U.N.Making a case for a strike based on the first of these two notions, David Ignatius puts it this way in a column in The Washington Post: ""What does the world look like when people begin to doubt the credibility of U.S. power? Unfortunately, we're finding that out in Syria and other nations where leaders have concluded they can defy a war-weary United States without paying a price.""But that's an idea that urgently needs updating, a frame that retains greatest currency only in the place of its minting -- Washington. In much of the world, governments and peoples fundamentally inclined to casting their lot with the U.S. have spent much of the past decade assaulted by realities that challenge those proclivities. And this is hardly of help to the narrow American interest or broader multinational concerns. A self-appointed global cop seen as morally reprobate, hypocritical and dismissive of the laws it is supposed to enforce does no favors to stability or security, let alone loftier aspirations like justice and progress on problems like climate change. Begin with the ill-conceived, poorly executed post-war occupation of Iraq, and the torture of combatants there in American-run military prisons. Consider the kidnapping of suspected militants by American authorities on streets of multiple cities, and the detention of the people seized in the cells of Guantanamo, a festering sore on the American image as moral authority. Contemplate the drone strikes unleashed by a superpower on villagers stuck in places that constitute venues for a nominal global war on terror. These are not realities that will simply be forgotten by the intended audience for the military strikes in Syria, those powers who are supposed to deduce that international norms are really operative. You can't run torture prisons one day and the next day all but unilaterally unleash missile strikes as moral curative without being seen as a less-than-honest broker among the very community of nations in whose name you act. You need a coalition, backing from the U.N. And if you don't get those things, taking action may well be worse than no action at all.Obama must surely understand this as deeply as anyone. At home, his presidency traces its existence to American revulsion over the parochial, faith-based, fact-free reign of his predecessor. Around the world, his embrace as a moral authority -- his Nobel Peace Prize! -- reflects a deep sense of relief that the reckless cowboy who occupied the White House before had been replaced by a thoughtful, sophisticated person with international experience and respect for other cultures and values.The standard for the legitimacy of a strike on Syria ought to be very high -- high enough to require a clear motive and objective, and a demonstrably shared plan of action among a multitude of global actors. But the U.N is missing. The Arab League is missing. Even Great Britain is now on the sidelines. It is fair to shame and pressure these powers to go along. It may be imperative. But failing to curry such support does not constitute justification for going it almost alone.If the objective is indeed defending international norms, how can one justify a strike authorized only by the U.S. and two stalwart allies? If this is about international law, how can one countenance rushing ahead before the U.N. inspectors complete their work and issue a report? If this is really about justice, is there no place for due process and critical scrutiny of the intelligence before letting loose with lethal power?And let us not kid ourselves in the face of a concerted rhetoric effort by the Obama administration to downgrade what is really unfolding. We hear of narrow limited strikes, targeted surgical procedures, and it's as if robots will reach into Syria, avoid all the people, and defang the military capabilities of the Assad regime. But what is being prepared -- by most accounts a two-day bombardment of Syrian installations with cruise missiles fired from American destroyers -- is an act of war. It may well prove to be a justified act of war, provided it is supported by a community of nations and based on credible intelligence. But war is what this is.War, it ought to go without saying, is a risky, unpredictable pursuit. You fire missiles at another country and people will die. If we have learned anything from the past decade, it's that military campaigns have unintended consequences. We could miss the intended targets or learn that the things we were aiming at had other uses than those we understood. We could provoke a strike on Israel from Iran. We could incite unforeseen violence from the Assad regime. And when one of those things happens and some fresh hell breaks loose, genuine moral leadership capable of speaking for international norms had best be supported by more than a couple of far-flung allies going along on a ride that has not been adequately mapped out.For Obama, this poorly sold, as-yet ill-defined intervention into another seething conflict in the Middle East presents grave risks: He could wind up representing the sort of American power defined by his predecessor, the shoot first-contemplate later mode of operation that has served no interests beyond the Islamist militants for whom such violence functions as a valuable recruiting aid."

As it is, the country is on the brink. We know that Lebanon's fractious sect-based political system has been strained by the Syrian war. Some Lebanese have crossed into Syria to support the warring sides and that, as an extension of this, there have been retaliatory attacks within Lebanon. But more than the violence or the fear of renewed civil war, what has put Lebanon on the brink is the flood of Syrian refugees who are overwhelming the country, threatening it with economic collapse and its capacity to survive as a state. It is only right that the world has focused attention on the terrible plight of Syria's refugees. But the enormity of this human tidal wave that has hit Lebanon must also be considered. According to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHRC) there are currently 790,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with an estimated 75,000 coming each month. This number does not include the more than 250,000 Syrians living in Lebanon as migrant workers. Given current projections, the UN agency estimates that if the Syrian war continues apace, by the end of this calendar year, Syrian refugees will constitute about one-quarter of Lebanon's total population. The refugee crisis has affected Lebanon on many levels. Because Lebanon has not built refugee camps, the Syrian exiles have moved into communities across the entire country. Many have crowded into low income apartments, resulting in a housing shortage and a spike in rental rates -- as much as 44 percent in some areas. This in turn has pushed poorer Lebanese out of the housing market -- forcing them to become internally displaced in their own country. Other Syrians have formed informal ""tent cities"" in towns and villages throughout Lebanon creating additional stress on host communities. The UNHRC estimates that there are 1,400 of these settlements. Because the Syrian refugees have flooded the job market, often willing to work for less, official statistics now report that average wages have plummeted and 20 percent of Lebanese are now unemployed. There are additional strains on the economy. The World Bank projects that Lebanon's GDP will decline by 2.9 percent each year from 2012 to 2014. Government revenues will decrease by $1.5 billion annually, while government expenditures are expected to rise by over $1 billion each year, owing to the increased demand for services. As a result, it is projected that an additional 170,000 Lebanese will be forced into poverty this year. The problems don't end there. The 90,000 Syrian children registered in local schools have created a serious over-crowding problem in the educational system -- with additional strains reported in the health care, public and social service sectors. Water, gas and electricity rates have all increased by 7.4 percent in the last year. Some medicines are now in short supply and with winter fast approaching the stress on the food supply, housing, health care, and other services will only grow. In this context, it is important to recall that last winter; there were only about 150,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon -- while this winter the number will be at least eight times that number! It should be expected that this situation might lead to social tensions within Lebanon. Polling data establishes that many Lebanese have become resentful. Many Lebanese poor see their country being overrun, resulting in: their inability to find work; having to settle for lower wages; and forcing them to face increased costs for food and services. They resent the fact that the Syrian refugees receive international assistance, while they must do without. All of this has created a new level of communal tensions. Since Lebanon has had a long and conflicted history with its neighbor, and since Lebanon's internal relationships remain unresolved, the added dimension of over one million Syrian refugees has only compounded an already fragile situation. The UNHRC's representative in Lebanon has written that given all these strains, which no country should be expected to bear, Lebanon has so far held up quite well. She writes ""Lebanon stands as an example of generosity in the face of crisis. Despite misunderstandings and tensions, everyday acts of kindness are commonplace."" But she warns, ""Without more international support, the patience and hospitality of host communities may wear thin. Continuing neglect will stoke rising tensions and raise the risk that the...Syrian civil war will become a regional war."" This said, Lebanon demands immediate attention. I cannot disagree with the push to rid Syria of chemical weapons, convene a Geneva II Summit to find a way to end that country's long war, and provide more assistance to alleviate the humanitarian crisis created by the massive population displacement created by the war. But Lebanon can no longer be ignored. The country need urgent support. It needs support to strengthen its capacity to deal with this crisis: the army needs assistance to help control the border and provide internal security; and the government and relief agencies need assistance to provide support to Lebanon's poor and those who have been displaced in their own country by the influx of refugees. Our concern for what is happening to Syria and Syrians, cannot and must not drown out our concern for Lebanon and its people. If we continue to ignore Lebanon, in short order, that country might collapse under the weight of the pressures to which it has been subjected. Lebanon requires attention."

Thousands of citizens, virtually all of them Sunni Muslims, have been gathering in public squares to protest the oppressive Shiite-led government in Baghdad. Sleeping in tents and wielding Twitter feeds and YouTube accounts, the young Sunnis have attempted to take democracy, and a certain sectarian disaffection, into their own hands.It's not quite the Iraqi Arab Spring -- although that's what it's been tentatively called by some -- but it is a reminder of the stark failure of nearly a decade of American-led warfare in that country.When President George W. Bush announced the invasion into Iraq in March 2003, the goal was to remove a dangerous dictator and his supposed stocks of weapons of mass destruction. It was also to create a functioning democracy and thereby inspire what Bush called a ""global democracy revolution.""The effort was supposed to be cheap -- to require few troops and even less time. Instead, it cost the United States $800 billion at least, thousands of lives and nearly nine grueling years (see the graphic below for a further breakdown of various costs). The toll on the people of Iraq were even greater. A decade of war left chaos and impoverishment, hundreds of thousands of citizens dead and millions more displaced, and a vicious sectarianism that still threatens to rip the country apart at the seams. The government of Nouri al-Maliki, which has reportedly interfered with independent government bureaucracies and ordered the arrest of his Sunni vice president on trumped-up terrorism charges, often rules in a manner more befitting the autocrat the U.S. invaded to remove. ""Here is a country that's being liberated,"" proclaimed Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a few days into the invasion, even as the first signs of the chaos to come began to stir. ""Here are people that are going from being repressed and held under the thumb of a vicious dictator, and they're free.""Instead, today in Fallujah, the site of two of the war's largest and most devastating military campaigns, the very best that can be said is that two years late to the party -- not 10 years early -- the Arab Spring has arrived. But the government the people are rising up against is the very one the U.S. installed.What does it mean to say that the war in Iraq was a wasted effort? Last month, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction filed a final report that found $8 billion of U.S. development aid had been ""wasted outright,"" in the words of Wired magazine.But nearly eight times as much money -- $60 billion -- was spent rebuilding the country on the whole, with very little to show for it. And more than 10 times that amount -- $800 billion -- was spent on the mission overall, a boondoggle that left more than 4,000 American service members dead, 32,000 more wounded, and an authoritarian government in place that is little better -- and possibly, owing to its closer ties to Iran, worse -- than the one that was taken out. Was any of that money wasted? Was any of it not?"

A man, identified by local media as Alcibia Rivera, then enters the room and cuts the lights. Through the blurry images, it appears that he then removes the woman from the chair and rapes her on the floor. When the lights turn back on -- apparently because someone tried to enter the room -- the man hops up and the woman appears to move. The lights then turn back off and the man appears to pull up his pants and return the woman to a chair. People return to the room to check on the woman. Toward the end of the video, when she tries to stand up, she falls to the floor.The video was reportedly taken on Dec. 20, after a holiday party at which Rivera and others allegedly drank too much. After being posted on YouTube, local news stations ran with the story this week, and it later appeared on international news sites including Spain’s ABC and the U.S. blog Jezebel.Alcibia Rivera, who belongs to the governing Movement Toward Socialism (MAS, in Spanish) denies wrongdoing and says he’ll cooperate with an investigation, according to Bolivian daily La Razón. “They’re saying that is was rape, but that wasn’t rape,” Alcibia Rivera said, according to La Razón.MAS’s ethics committee kicked Alcibia out of the party, along with legislator Javier Humana, who was involved in the incident. The allegations drew condemnation from Bolivian President Evo Morales, who said Alcibia Rivera had committed a “serious error.” Bolivian prosecutors say they’ll take action against local media for showing the video, saying it endangers the victim.

The Cable writes:An Obama administration official who reviewed the document, which was classified at the ""secret"" level, detailed its contents to The Cable. ""We can't definitely say 100 percent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 was used in Homs on Dec. 23,"" the official said.U.S. and NATO representatives have warned the embattled Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons would trigger an international reaction. ""The possible use of chemical weapons would be completely unacceptable for the whole international community and if anybody resorts to these terrible weapons I would expect an immediate reaction from the international community,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in December, according to Reuters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist network based in Britain, claimed in December that six Syrian rebels had died after inhaling smoke in the city of Homs. The Observatory said that the fighters inhaled ""white smoke without a smell"" and that they ""felt dizzy and suffered headaches."" Some reportedly suffered seizures. Al Jazeera received two videos in the wake of the Dec. 23 assault, which purport to show the aftermath of the attack. Syria denied the December accusations and said it would not use chemical weapons against its citizens. While the U.S. has said the use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line,"" the administration has refrained from specifying what action it would consider.The State Department declined to comment to The Cable. Activists estimate more than 60,000 people have died since the start of the conflict in Syria in March 2011. "
16184	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-paul/third-plenum-_b_4289143.html	Opinion	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"As trumpeted across the media, the four day meeting of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party has ended, and China's leaders announced that among the decisions were an ""easing of"" its one-child family policy and the abolition of its ""re-education through labor"" camps. As much as these policy changes are being trumpeted as evidence of how far China has come, they really are a reminder of how far China and its leaders have to go.In the wake of the shutdown of the federal government last month, Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping took the opportunity to remind the world of the failings of the American political system. Year after year, as China's foreign exchange reserves have piled up, the leaders of the regime have gone to great pains to critique America for its profligacy and political instability, among myriad other failings. China's much heralded rise, and its ambitions to supplant American leadership, reflect not just its growing economic and military power, but the values of frugality, stability and conservatism Chinese leaders eagerly contrast with the chaos and moral decay of the west.Little is ever said amidst these frequent rebukes of the role that America has played in enabling the resuscitation of the Chinese people, to say nothing of the Chinese Communist Party itself, from the depths of economic calcification reached in the 1970s. Much is made of the success of the market reforms instituted under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping beginning in 1978, and indeed the growth trajectory of China's GDP has been extraordinary. But the success of China's economic transformation could not have happened absent the free trade policies of the United States, and to a lesser extent western Europe, that enabled that growth.Under American global leadership since the end of World War II, international trade policies have uplifted the Asian continent out of severe poverty. Japan led the way, in the wake of the devastation of WWII, building a manufacturing juggernaut enabled by American business insight and market access. The Japanese model of export driven economic growth and development then became the model for the Asian tiger nations of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, which like Japan have risen from abject poverty a half-century ago to among the highest levels of per capita income in the world.That was the American half-century. As we opened our markets, our share of global GDP steadily declined. Our trade policies actively supported the rise of Asia out of poverty and the globalization of our leading corporations. That real middle class incomes stagnated at home should have come as no surprise. It was simple economics.But the Asian Tigers, and even Japan, were relatively small countries, who as trading partners were able to build their domestic economies around export trade with America without destroying the host upon which they fed. Through that economic period, there were unintended consequences that exacerbated the challenges we now face. The combined reinvestment of Asian nation trade surpluses in US dollars -- and the similar practice embraced by OPEC nations selling us oil -- led to relative stability in the US dollar and enabled steady increases in US borrowing without the increases in US interest rates or declines the value of dollar assets that would otherwise have undermined Asian growth.But it was trade in goods and services with China and India, respectively, that ultimately showed the limit of the export driven model, as the damage to the US economy and middle class has now become too extreme to ignore. The challenges we now face -- underinvestment in infrastructure, chronic deficit spending, and socially debilitating inequality -- have conspired to contribute to the fraught domestic politics that President Xi now trumpets as the rationale for the world to turn to China for future leadership. China's gleaming new cityscapes -- and the Chinese dream of Xi's rhetoric -- are being built not upon the ingenuity of the Chinese system, but instead upon the hollowing out of the American economy.The policy changes Xi and his colleagues announced this week only draw attention to the depravity that remains central to the Chinese system. Even as there is a rising wealthy population within the Chinese elite and urban cores, economic growth within China remains dependent upon the Foxconn-style factory model that is one step short of a slave economy. The Communist Party social and economic policies continue to drive Chinese peasants from their land while securing billions of dollars in stolen wealth for Party members. Dissent and banned religious practice remains punishable by prison and the Orwellian ""re-education"" that is to be moderated, but not eliminated, under recently announced Party reforms.The Party plans to modify the decades old one-child policy is perhaps the most shocking reminder of the starkly immoral nature of Communist Party control over the most intimate aspects of Chinese personal life. Unauthorized pregnancies continue to be aborted by force up until birth, and children found to have been born in violation of the law remain at risk of being ""confiscated"" by police. The proposed may relax the rules surrounding who is to be allowed more than one child, but does nothing to curtail this most fundamental power of State control over the population.This week, the US aircraft carrier George Washington arrived in the Philippines from Hawaii. The stories were so familiar from other disasters in recent years. The helicopters arriving over the horizon, coming to the aid of the population devastated by Typhoon Haiyan needing not just food and water, but the most basic help from building and securing aid distribution capacity, to recovering, identifying and burying the dead. The carrier and accompanying ships brought aid, logistics and people trained and capable of responding to the need on the ground.Nine years ago, in the days following the 2004 tsunami, it was the US carrier Abraham Lincoln and the Navy hospital ship Mercy that steamed from the Persian Gulf to Banda Aceh, that city on the northern tip of Sumatra that had born the brunt of the tsunami and seen tens of thousands of its residents die. Like Banda Aceh, the Philippines are located close to the Chinese mainland -- just 700 miles from Hong Kong -- yet once again it was an American flotilla that steamed over 5,000 miles to bring critical aid, while the Chinese sat on their hands.Last month, President Xi trumpeted China's rising essential role in the region at the Asia-Pacific meetings that President Obama chose not to attend due to turmoil in Washington. Yet just a few weeks later, he was nowhere to be seen as the people of the Philippines faced their crisis. The Chinese government committed just $100,000 to the Philippines relief effort after the typhoon struck.President Xi has a long way to go to build the credibility of China as a modern state to be looked to by the world for leadership. Just the name of its recent meeting, the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party, is a reminder that while much in the world has changed over the past quarter century -- from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Arab spring -- China remains a throwback the Cold War era. As much as Xi would like to show the world the face of a man whose time in Iowa left him an admirer of American freedoms, the pronouncements from his first plenum are a stark reminder of the deep corruption and cruelty that lie at the heart of the Chinese system, and of the ghosts of Tiananmen that still haunt the Chinese leadership.But it is the response to Typhoon Haiyan that has demonstrated how far China has to go before it will be embraced as a global leader. Leadership is not just about words at meetings of world leaders, or reserves held bank vaults, but about conduct in the world. It is not about what you do to build up your own country, but what you do to uplift others. President Xi and his colleagues disappeared this week when their neighbors across the water were crying in pain, and their inaction spoke volumes. Because, at the end of the day, leadership is not about ideology or rhetoric, it is about showing up."

So, it is utter nonsense when we are told that Israel is reluctant to move forward on a deal with the Palestinians because it does not ""feel the love"" from America and the Obama administration in view of the secret American negotiations with Iran and the interim nuclear deal signed by Iran and the P5+1 powers. It is similarly baseless when we are told that the interim deal with Iran coupled with the effort to negotiate an end to the war in Syria demonstrate that Washington is preparing to turn its attention away from the region and somehow that provides a legitimate reason for Israel to back off its negotiations with the Palestinians.The claim by those in Israel and in the American Jewish community that President Obama has ""thrown Israel under the bus"" in entering the interim deal with Iran just doesn't stand up to scrutiny. In narrowly framing the only deal that would be acceptable to Israel as one that would stop the Iranians from any kind of nuclear enrichment, Prime Minster Netanyahu has set the bar too high to be realistic. It is not credible that Iran would agree to such a deal, however strong the sanction regime. The result is that the only alternative to Netanyahu's deal would be a war with Iran, with all the uncertainties as to what would be accomplished and the possibilities of costly escalation. The Obama administration, fully reflecting the view of the American people, does not want a war unless every other possibility for a peaceful resolution has been explored and has failed. What Israel, Saudi Arabia and those other nations opposed to the Iranian deal can contribute of great value is in depth intelligence, in carefully monitoring the actions of the Iranians to insure that they are indeed carrying out the terms of the deal and when the interim period has ended, determining whether Iran is closer to a nuclear capability than it was before. In addition, those nations in opposition can help the United States maintain the full force of the sanctions that have not been lifted under the terms of the agreement and apply pressure on nations and businesses not to allow sanctions to weaken during the interim period so that they can be fully reinstated if they have to be. As for the impact of the Iranian deal on Israel's relationship with the Palestinians -- long before the secret negotiations with Iran had begun, in these pages and elsewhere I, like others, questioned whether Prime Minister Netanyahu truly sought a two state solution with the Palestinians. We pointed to his personal history as well as the effect any deal would have in destroying his political coalition. And we also noted that the Palestinian issue was not in the forefront of concerns of the Israeli people, although a strong commitment from their leaders could probably convince them to accept a two state deal. Now, that the period for negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians set by Secretary Kerry is one third completed, it does not appear that the parties have made significant enough progress to lead to the belief that a deal ultimately can be reached. This has nothing to do with America's diplomatic efforts regarding Iran. In fact, the why of the failing negotiations does not really matter. What does matter is that they are failing and there is little hope for a negotiated resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The question now is what can replace that approach.There are some in the United States and the region who would now call on the Obama Administration to offer bridging solutions to the parties. These proposals range from the President providing suggestions to resolve specific issues to his presenting a defined plan covering all the points and pressuring the parties to accept the plan as presented. In light of the political position that the President finds himself -- a difficult opposition looking for any reason to attack him and a declining popularity -- it would be surprising if he used what little leverage he has to provide any forcible action in this arena.Another approach being suggested by some in Israel calls for a ""framework agreement"" that would outline some of the key elements of a final status agreement such as the percent of West Bank areas allocated to each party but not resolve all the claims. It is suggested that this approach be coupled with financial programs that help move the Palestinian closer toward a viable state. However, it is hard to believe that this approach will be acceptable to the Palestinians, even though it is offered coated with financial incentives. The Palestinian leaders will most likely see it as a further delay of their ambition for statehood, allowing Israel time to expand its settlement program, notwithstanding any commitment to the contrary in the agreement. The other possibility is some form of unilateral withdrawal by Israel even without a mutual agreement. This solution would appeal to those like Israeli author Ari Shavit who argue that Israel should separate itself from the Palestinians for its own benefit but that it should not expect a ""peace"" between them ever to work effectively. For my own part, as a Zionist who has long advocated that Israel avoid a bi-national state or absorbing any large part of the Palestinian population to ensure that it maintains its position as a democratic and Jewish state (see my HuffPost blog A Message From A Long Standing Zionist To The Israeli People, 08/08/2013), I would personally support unilateral withdrawal if a two state solution was impossible to achieve. However, at this time, such a unilateral approach has no significant support in Israel and after the perception of the result of unilateral withdrawal in Gaza and Lebanon, notwithstanding the reality of the benefit of those actions, unilateral action is highly unlikely.Unhappily, the failure of the effort by Secretary Kerry to bring the parties together will leave a vacuum and no one can predict what will fill it. We are already seeing the beginnings of violence on both sides and one can only hope that it does not erupt in a significant way as it has in the past. Most likely we will see a continued drift along current lines where Israel expands settlements and the Palestinians turn to the UN and International pressure on Israel in the form of boycotts and divestiture. One has to wonder whether this will cause more real damage to Israel than Iran's efforts to achieve nuclear capability. At least, in the latter situation Israel has the overwhelming nuclear capability to face Iran down and also has the United States umbrella of support. What will it have to protect it if somehow it is seen as engaging in apartheid actions? I hope that day never comes; but the expansionist course now being followed by Israel has that danger attached to it.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who had asked whether the Justice Department believed President Barack Obama had the legal authority to order a targeted strike against an American citizen located within the United States.The Obama administration, Holder said, rejected the use of military force where ""well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat."" But in theory, it'd be legal for the president to order such an attack under certain circumstances, Holder said.""The question you have posed is therefore entirely hypothetical, unlikely to occur, and one we hope no president will ever have to confront. It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States,"" Holder wrote. ""For example, the president could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances like a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001,"" Holder continued, referring to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Holder said he would ""examine the particular facts and circumstances"" if such an emergency were to arise.Paul, who had threatened to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan as CIA director over secrecy about the U.S. drone program, said in a statement that Holder's ""refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening -- it is an affront the Constitutional due process rights of all Americans."" Holder's letter was first reported by Adam Serwer of Mother Jones.Holder is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a Justice Department oversight hearing on Wednesday morning. Earlier in the day, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the administration had agreed to allow members of the committee to see all of the Office of Legal Counsel memos relating to the targeted killing of American citizens."

Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, said in a statement earlier on Tuesday that the senator's staff hasn't spoken to the White House on immigration, but that they didn't necessarily want to anyway. ""Senator Rubio's office has never discussed immigration policy with anyone in the White House,"" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. ""To be clear: That’s fine with us -- we actually think Congress should write the policy; not the White House.

John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). The four Democratic members of the group met with Obama last week to update him on the status of the talks. But Rubio's relationship with the White House, at least publicly, has been more fraught. The senator quickly decried the draft legislation leaked on Saturday, saying in a statement that it could be damaging to the discussions going forward. “It’s a mistake for the White House to draft immigration legislation without seeking input from Republican members of Congress,"" Rubio said. ""President Obama’s leaked immigration proposal is disappointing to those of us working on a serious solution. ... If actually proposed, the president’s bill would be dead on arrival in Congress, leaving us with unsecured borders and a broken legal immigration system for years to come.""He also released a statement last week accusing the administration, and in particular Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, of seeming to try to hurt reform efforts. Napolitano testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and said border concerns should not prevent broader immigration reform. The ""gang of eight"" plan would only allow immigrants to earn green cards after certain border metrics were met, a trigger not included in the White House draft legislation, but would allow other reforms to take place immediately, including allowing provisional status for undocumented immigrants. The White House has come out strongly against a piecemeal approach that requires passing border security enforcement measures first and other immigration provisions later, but has not specifically stated it would oppose a trigger such as the one in the ""gang of eight"" framework.Rubio, though, said Napolitano should have embraced the plan if the administration was ""serious"" about reform.""Secretary Napolitano’s refusal to accept this bipartisan principle at today’s Senate hearing is discouraging for those of us who are serious about permanently fixing America’s immigration system,"" Rubio said in a statement after the committee hearing. ""By continuing to oppose a key security principle with bipartisan backing, Secretary Napolitano and this Administration appear to be laying the groundwork to scuttle the bipartisan effort in the Senate.""UPDATE: 1:55 p.m. -- Rubio spokesman Alex Conant tweeted later that the White House had met with ""gang of eight"" staff, despite his statement that they never discussed immigration policy. Rubio spokesman Alex Conant clarified further by email. ""We have never discussed immigration policy with anyone from the White House,"" he said. ""The Administration has sent some agency officials to brief staff at the bipartisan group meetings, but they've never asked for our input. (And, frankly, we've never asked for theirs.) We've never received a call or email from Cecilia Munoz or anyone else at the White House asking for our input as they draft their bill.""UPDATE: 5:10 p.m. -- President Barack Obama called Graham, McCain and Rubio later on Tuesday to discuss immigration reform, the White House announced. Flake, the fourth Republican member of the ""gang of eight,"" was unable to speak with the president because he was traveling, according to the White House. During the calls, which build on conversations that have taken place at the staff level, the President reiterated that he remains supportive of the effort underway in Congress, and that he hopes that they can produce a bill as soon as possible that reflects shared core principles on reform. The President has made clear that he believes commonsense reform needs to include strengthening border security, creating an earned path to citizenship, holding employers accountable, and streamlining legal immigration. As the President made clear when he met with Democratic Senators involved in the process last week, that while he is pleased with the progress and supportive of the effort to date, he is prepared to submit his own legislation if Congress fails to act. He thanked the Senators for their leadership, and made clear that he and his staff look forward to continuing to work together with their teams to achieve needed reform.Conant said Rubio ""appreciated"" Obama's call. ""Rubio said he feels good about ongoing negotiations in Senate,"" Conant tweeted. "

Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Sunday that Democratic aides in the Senate are drafting new language for an authorization of military force in Syria, Politico reports. Speaking after some members of Congress returned early from recess to attend closed-door briefings on the situation in Syria, Leahy said the draft legislation offered by President Barack Obama on Saturday was too broad. “I know it’s going to be amended in the Senate,” Leahy said, according to Politico.On Saturday, Obama submitted to Congress a draft resolution authorizing the use of military force in response to Syrian President Bashar Assad's suspected use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians. The measure would allow the president to use force in a “necessary and appropriate” way.""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said during a Saturday statement.According to the Washington Post, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) also expressed hesitation over the draft's language.“I think the biggest question I heard is that the president’s request is open-ended,” Roberts said. “That has to be rectified, and they simply said in answer to that that they would work with the Congress and try to come back with a more prescribed resolution. But I’m not too sure that the people who answered that are the people that have that decision to make.”According to Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), about 100 to 150 lawmakers attended the classified briefing. "

""For this diplomatic option to have a chance at succeeding, the threat of a U.S. military action, the credible, real threat of U.S. military action, must continue,"" he declared.At the same hearing, Kerry said any diplomacy ""cannot be a process of delay. This cannot be a process of avoidance.""He later added that any agreement must include binding consequences if Syria fails to comply, and lawmakers moved to rewrite pending legislation along the same lines.Obama himself ""wasn't overly optimistic about"" prospects for a solution at the U.N., said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, after his party's rank and file met privately for lunch in the Capitol with the president. He quoted Obama as saying that even if a credible plan could be worked out, it could be difficult to push through the U.N. Security Council. And, indeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin said such a U.N. effort could work only if ""the American side and those who support the USA in this sense reject the use of force.""The president readied his speech against an unpredictable chain of events stemming from a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on Aug. 21 that the Obama administration swiftly blamed on Assad's government.U.S. officials say more than 1,400 died in the episode, including at least 400 children, and other victims suffered uncontrollable twitching, foaming at the mouth and other symptoms typical of exposure to chemical weapons banned by international treaty. Other casualty estimates are lower, and Assad has said the attack was launched by rebels who have been fighting to drive him from power in a civil war that has so far claimed the lives of more than 100,000 civilians.Assad's patron, Russia, has blocked U.S. attempts to rally the Security Council behind a military strike. But Monday, after a remark by Kerry, it spoke favorably about requiring Syria to surrender control of its chemical weapons, and the Syrian foreign minister did likewise.The foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said Tuesday that his government was ready to turn over its chemical weapons stockpile in line with Russia's proposal in order ""to thwart U.S. aggression."" He also said Syria was prepared to sign an international chemical convention it has long rejected – a step it can take on its own at any time without U.S. or U.N. supervision.Syria has long refused to provide an accounting of the size of its stockpile, rarely referring in public to its existence. According to an unclassified estimate by the French government, it includes more than 1,000 tons of ""chemical agents and precursor chemicals,"" including sulfur mustard, VX and sarin gas.Obama has said frequently he has the authority as commander in chief to order a military strike against Assad regardless of any vote in Congress, and he has consistently declined to say whether he would do so if lawmakers refuse to approve the legislation he is seeking.The response in Congress to support such a strike has been lukewarm at best – as underscored during the day when liberal Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and conservative Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., both announced their opposition.Markey, who was elected to the seat that Kerry vacated when he joined the Cabinet, said the legislation under consideration was too broad, ""the effects of a strike are too unpredictable, and ... I believe we must give diplomatic measures that could avoid military action a chance to work.""Said Mulvaney: ""While I am concerned about taking no action, it strikes me that international law cannot be upheld via unilateral attack by the United States.""And Rep. James Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on committees dealing both with military and intelligence matters, said he feared that ""Iran and Russia could cause serious damage"" to the United States if they retaliated with a cyberattack.Yet Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, said, ""It would be inimical to our country's standing if we do not show a willingness to act in the face of the use of chemical weapons and to act in a limited way to address that use alone.""Hours before Obama's speech from the White House's East Room, Hoyer added, "" I don't think there's any doubt that failure to do so would weaken our country, create a more dangerous international environment and to some degree undermine the president of the United States.""Earlier, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell became the first congressional leader to come out against legislation giving the president authority for limited strikes. ""There are just too many unanswered questions about our long-term strategy in Syria,"" he said.By contrast, Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, the top two Republicans in the House, have endorsed Obama's request.Given the uncertainty of diplomatic maneuvering, no vote is expected for several days, if then.""If something can be done diplomatically, I'm totally satisfied with that. I'm not a blood and thunder guy. I'm not for shock and awe,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in a reference to the massive display of firepower that opened the war in Iraq nearly a decade ago.Still, there was ample skepticism in Congress about the United Nations as well as Russia's true intentions, as well as Syria's willingness to be bound by international agreements.""There is an overwhelming view it would be preferable if international law and the family of nations could strip Syria of the chemical weapons,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""And there's a large view we should let that process play out for a little while.""Said Boehner: ""Clearly, diplomacy is always a better outcome than military action. But I will say that I'm somewhat skeptical of those that are involved in the diplomatic discussions today.""This post has been updated with video of Obama's speech."

Santorum went on to argue that other than Obama's drone policy, the president has not ""confronted radical Islam.""""I'm not in the business of defending Barack Obama,"" Scarborough said. ""But if you talk to people in the intelligence community, they will tell you that Al Qaeda is busted, it's broken, it's splintered ...

The board added: Obama administration officials often talk about the balance between protecting secrets and protecting the constitutional rights of a free press. Accusing a reporter of being a 'co-conspirator,' on top of other zealous and secretive investigations, shows a heavy tilt toward secrecy and insufficient concern about a free press.The Times editorial was just one in a chorus of hard-hitting attacks on Obama's media policy that have surfaced in the wake of the Justice Department investigations. Journalists were outraged by the inquiries into the AP and Fox News reporter James Rosen. In particular, members of the media took issue with the Justice Department labeling Rosen a possible ""co-conspirator"" in a leak case for the crime of trying to get a source to give up information.The New Yorker reported on Tuesday that the investigation into Rosen was even broader than previously suspected, as the DOJ seized records from at least five different numbers used by Fox News and two different White House lines. That followed the Associated Press' revelation that the DOJ had secretly obtained months of phone records for at least seven individual journalists across 20 phone lines while searching for the government official responsible for leaking information about a CIA-thwarted terror plot.Obama's hyper-aggressive leak policy—and his administration's potential equation of routine journalistic interaction with criminality—is nothing new. But the fury in the pages and on the websites of elite outlets about these positions certainly is.The Times' criticism echoed that of many other journalists and press freedom groups.On Tuesday, the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists sent an outraged letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, in which it warned that the DOJ's secret subpoenas for over 20 AP phone lines ""represent a damaging setback for press freedom in the United States."" This came on the heels of a letter signed by over 50 media outlets which made similar arguments.Wednesday also saw Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank lash out at Obama:The Rosen affair is as flagrant an assault on civil liberties as anything done by George W. Bush’s administration, and it uses technology to silence critics in a way Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of.To treat a reporter as a criminal for doing his job — seeking out information the government doesn’t want made public — deprives Americans of the First Amendment freedom on which all other constitutional rights are based. Guns? Privacy? Due process? Equal protection? If you can’t speak out, you can’t defend those rights, either. "

Brennan, a 25-year veteran of the CIA, has served as Obama's top counterterrorism aide since 2009. If confirmed, he will fill the post left vacant by David Petraeus, who resigned in November after admitting to an extramarital affair. ""In John Brennan the men and women of the CIA will have the leadership of our nation's most skilled intelligence professionals,"" said Obama. """"That unique combination of smarts and strength that he claims comes from growing up in New Jersey."" The audience laughed.""People in the White House. But John is legendary in the White House even for working hard,"" said Obama, adding that he wasn't sure if Brennan had slept in four years.The president recounted a story when a reporter on Martha's Vineyard, Mass. asked if Brennan had any downtime. ""I don't do downtime,"" said Brennan, according to Obama.Acting CIA Director Michael Morrell praised Brennan's ""deep experience.""Brennan said, ""Leading the agency that I served would be the greatest privilege, as well as the greatest responsibility, I have had in twenty-five years.""""I consider myself neither a Republican nor a Democrat,"" he said.The Associated Press reports:Brennan, 57, spent a quarter-century at the CIA. He served as station chief in Saudi Arabia and in a variety of posts, including deputy executive director, during the Bush administration.His tenure at the agency during Bush's presidency drew criticism from liberals when Obama considered naming him CIA director after the 2008 election. Brennan denied being involved in what the government called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" during the Bush administration, but still withdrew his name from consideration.In a letter to Obama at the time, Brennan said he was ""a strong opponent of many of the policies of the Bush administration, such as the pre-emptive war in Iraq and coercive interrogation tactics, to include waterboarding."" Many people consider waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods to be torture.White House officials say they don't expect Brennan to face similar trouble this time around given his four years of service in the Obama administration.... However, Brennan's nomination will likely put a spotlight on the administration's controversial drone program. Brennan was the first Obama administration official to publicly acknowledge the highly secretive targeted killing operations."

A passage of Cheney's ""In My Time"" claimed that Rice had ""tearfully admitted"" to the vice president that she had been wrong to urge Bush to apologize over false allegations about Iraq's attempts to develop weapons of mass destruction.Rice pushed back on Cheney's claims at the time.""It certainly doesn't sound like me, now, does it?""

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who waged a 13-hour filibuster on Wednesday over Obama's secret use of drones to carry out targeted killings. Throughout the effort, Paul, along with a dozen other Republican senators, demanded to know whether Obama believed he had the right to order drone strikes on U.S. citizens on U.S soil.Carney said the answer is no.""It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the president have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?,'"" Carney read aloud. ""The answer to that question is no.""The administration sparked a furor over the matter earlier this week when, in another letter to Paul, Holder said the administration could technically use military force to kill an American on U.S. soil in an ""extraordinary circumstance"" but has ""no intention of doing so."" Republican outrage peaked with Paul's hours-long filibuster of John Brennan's Senate confirmation to the CIA. The White House stayed mum throughout the filibuster, as did most Senate Democrats.Carney said Holder's latest letter should ease the ""great deal of confusion"" over the president's authority over drones in the United States, which is ultimately regulated by the Constitution.""The president has not and would not use drone strikes against Americans citizens on American soil,"" Carney said. ""The legal authorities that exist to use lethal force are bound by, constrained by, the law and the Constitution. The issue here isn't the technology .... Whether it's a drone strike or a gun shot, the law and the Constitution apply in the same way.""Paul said later that Holder's letter had satisfied his concerns and that he was prepared to let Brennan's nomination vote proceed.""Hooray!"" Paul said on Fox News, where he learned of the letter and its contents. ""For 13 hours yesterday, we asked him that question. So there is a result and a victory. Under duress, and under public humiliation, the White House will respond and do the right thing.""Shortly after, Paul said during a CNN appearance that he is ""quite happy"" with Holder's response, and that he only wished it didn't take so long to get an answer.""I'm disappointed it took a month and a half and a root canal to get it,"" he said.This article was updated after publication with comments from Rand Paul."
16426	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/05/stanley-mcchrystal-memoir_n_2412437.html	News	0	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- How was it that Stanley McChrystal, a revered combat leader who reached the pinnacle of his career as the four-star general commanding the longest and perhaps most complex political-military conflict in American history, fell so fast, so dramatically, so quickly?And why is it that three and a half years after McChrystal took command in Afghanistan, with yet another new military campaign plan designed to win the war, that the United States seems no closer to a satisfying end to the conflict?In a new memoir, My Share of the Task, to be published Monday, McChrystal comes at these questions only obliquely. But he acknowledges a critical error: Unlike previous successful wartime leaders -- Dwight Eisenhower comes to mind -- he maintains that he wouldn't and didn't play politics. A reader finishing these nearly 400 pages suspects he disdained the political machinations that in Washington were determining the course of the war he was prosecuting thousands of miles away.""I resolved to try to steer clear of politics,” he explains. “That wasn't easy."" Nor, he acknowledges, 31 months after he was forced to resign, was it smart.McChrystal insists that he sought to emulate the traditional ideal of the professional soldier -- to operate as far as possible outside of the sometimes-messy business of backroom statecraft.But, as his memoir makes clear, his attempt to avoid politics created a deeper problem. In the fall of 2009, McChrystal was assembling an ambitious new counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan, just as the Obama White House was struggling to extricate itself from the deeply unpopular war. It was a time of intense and sometimes ugly partisan infighting with leaks and rumors raging through the White House, Pentagon, Capitol Hill and the 24-hour media.At issue was the very course of the war: Shut it down and bring the troops home, or ramp up the effort to win.What the nation badly needed at that critical juncture was a wartime commander who could not only inspire troops in battle, but could lead in the political arena as well. It needed a warrior who understood what was possible in Afghanistan and how to do it, someone who could knit together a coalition of support from such antagonists like Vice President Joe Biden, who favored a massive troop withdrawal, and Sen. John McCain, who was thundering for a massive troop increase.In hindsight, McChrystal writes in an exasperatingly passive voice, ""there were political realities outside my view ... I recognized, perhaps too slowly, the extent to which politics, personalities and other factors would complicate a course that, under the best of circumstances, would be remarkably difficult to navigate.""That a man so clearly talented -- a brilliant combat leader, most would acknowledge -- a voracious reader of history, a warrior fiercely dedicated, fanatically hardworking, demanding of and tender toward his troops -- could be blindsided by political intrigue and his own missteps, mirrors the ancient truths of Greek tragedy.There was bad blood between the White House and the military long before McChrystal handed in his resignation in June 2010.That was hours after Rolling Stone portrayed the lean, four-star commando as ""The Runaway General"" who coerced an intimidated President Barack Obama into sending more warfighters to Afghanistan and then engaged his staff in a few rounds of bashing the clueless civilian-politicians in Washington.It's hard to imagine how a seasoned professional soldier -- a West Pointer who studied Clausewitz (""War is not merely a political act, but also a real political instrument""), who dramatically expanded and led secretive hunter-killer teams across Iraq and two dozen other countries, who served in Washington as director of the Joint Staff and had risen to four-star rank -- never seems to have developed the political antenna to warn of approaching threats, or to have mastered the basic mechanics of political maneuver.Things got so bad, McChrystal relates, that he was shocked to find that while he was trying to fine-tune the Afghanistan War strategy, the Obama White House in the late fall of 2009 was still grappling with the question on the minds of most Americans: What exactly was the U.S. trying to accomplish in Afghanistan?Or, as an exhausted infantryman put it to McChrystal during one of the general's battlefield tours: ""Why are we here, Sir? What's the point?""At just under 400 pages, McChrystal's memoir, written in 22 months and approved after an exhaustive Pentagon review, never clears up that question -- and dances away from other issues with scant explanation.Many readers, for instance, might skip to the episode (page 387) in which he and his staff allowed Michael Hastings, a reporter for Rolling Stone -- a magazine known for its anti-war passion -- generous and extended access to their operations and private lives. Apparently, McChrystal never gave this decision a second thought until he was awakened at 2 a.m. on June 22, 2010, with the news that the article had been published and ""it's really bad.""His first thought: ""How in the world could that story have been a problem?""McChrystal takes just a page and a half to recount the incident, from that moment to the president's acceptance of his resignation. Readers will search in vain for an explanation of whether the general and his staff did and said what had been reported; if they did, why; or why precisely they allowed Hastings such unrestricted access. In short, were they guilty, and if so, what the heck were they thinking?In true stoic warrior form, McChrystal simply takes responsibility: ""Regardless of how I judged the story for fairness or accuracy, responsibility was mine. And its ultimate effect was immediately clear to me.""In similar fashion, McChrystal skips lightly over issues which deserve fuller explanation.In April 2004, for instance, Spec. Pat Tillman of the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment was accidentally shot and killed by fellow troops during a firefight in eastern Afghanistan. McChrystal says he immediately advised the Special Operations and Central Commands that an investigation was underway but that early evidence pointed to friendly fire as the cause of his death.Under intense pressure from the Bush White House, which wanted to portray Tillman as a combat hero, Tillman's family was led to believe that he died courageously under enemy fire. That misleading explanation was drafted by McChrystal's staff and approved by the general.But he dismisses the entire episode by concluding that ""any errors, which I should have caught, were not the result of any intention to misrepresent or mislead … to this day I am saddened by Ranger Tillman's death, as I am for the loss of every service member I served with, and for the pain such losses cause each family.""Only rarely in his memoir does McChrystal allow a glimpse behind his public persona as the stoic, unfeeling warrior. In one telling anecdote, he relates going on a daytime raid with Army Rangers on a house of suspected insurgents in Ramadi, Iraq.The Rangers moved quickly and gathered a group of local men from inside and around the buildings on the concrete parking areas in the front. To ensure security, as they moved to identify each man, they had him lie on the pavement with his hands behind his head. One Iraqi was notably older than the others, and a young Ranger, without instruction, retrieved a white plastic chair for him from an automotive maintenance shop. As was normally the case, even in daytime, there were no women in the immediate area. But I saw a boy, probably about four years old, standing near one of the men, no doubt his father. As the Rangers motioned for the men to lie down on the ground, I watched the boy. He stood quietly, as if confused, then, mimicking his father, the child lay down on the ground. He pressed one cheek flat against the pavement so that his face was turned toward his father and folded his small hands behind his head. As I watched, I felt sick. I could feel in my own limbs and chest the shame and fury that must have been coursing through the father, still lying motionless. Every ounce of him must have wanted to pop up, pull his son from the ground, stand him upright, and dust off the boy's clothes and cheek. To be laid on the ground in full view of his son was humiliating. For a proud man, to seemingly fail to protect that son from similar treatment was worse. As I watched, I thought, not for the first time: It would be easy for us to lose.But the war went on. ""We could only hope the residents understood these raids were necessary,"" McChrystal writes, and a few pages later adds: ""Our war demanded relentless focus and a hardening of natural emotions.""Yet it comes as no surprise that a man who devoted eight years to combat in two brutal and bloody wars, himself the son of an Army general who fought in Korea and Vietnam, feels profoundly the valor of shared sacrifice among men at war. Of war itself, McChrystal has almost nothing to say: no musing, at the end of his long career of service, about why he fought, and to what end, whether in the future the use of violent force could be or should be avoided. Or, more usefully, how to bridge the gap of mistrust between senior military leaders and the civilians they serve.In a mea culpa of sorts, McChrystal offers that he sought as a senior commander to follow the ethic proposed by Samuel Huntington in his classic 1957 work, The Soldier and the State.Huntington, McChrystal writes, ""argued that a military commander should endeavor to operate as independently of political or even policy pressures as possible. And yet I found, as much as I wanted my role to be that prescribed by Huntington, the demands of the job made this difficult. The process of formulating, negotiating, articulating and then prosecuting even a largely military campaign involved politics at multiple levels that were impossible to ignore.""The counterpoint to his distaste for politics is one which readers might ponder. At a time when few Americans volunteer to serve, when the military seems a world away from the American mainstream, he takes just a moment to reflect on the nature of war and the community of those who volunteer to take part in it.On a long helicopter flight north across Iraq on Christmas Eve 2009, hunched against the cold blast of air from an open hatch, he reflects that this is where he feels most comfortable.I knew from history that war comes with frightening regularity, often fought over the same ground and similar causes as previous conflicts. Wars often begin with enthusiastic vigor but typically settle into costly, dirty business characterized for soldiers by fear, frustration and loneliness.... I felt the unbroken tradition of commitment to a mission, and a fierce commitment to one another. Like the generation they followed and those they now led, they came forward when called and sacrificed when needed. They did so quietly, often in shadows, with no expectation of reward. They were no better than their grandfathers, and not a bit worse."

Because, naturally, the Alex Jones conspiracy set is pretty sure that the tornadoes that hit Moore, Okla. were probably maybe some sort of ""false flag"" event, brought on by the ""weather weapons"" that of course the federal government has at its disposal, for the purpose of ... incurring massively expensive disasters on ourselves? This probably makes sense to somebody.Via Raw Story:Conspiracy talk show host Alex Jones, increasingly a favorite of conservative media for his extremely vocal support of gun rights, outed himself Tuesday as a tornado truther by telling a caller on his show, “Of course there’s weather weapons stuff going on.”Jones, a longtime proponent of the idea that the U.S. government can manipulate and even produce weather systems like tornadoes and hurricanes, went on to say that if people saw helicopters or small aircraft in the area, then “you better bet your bottom dollar they did this.”“But, who knows if they did?” he asked. “You know, that’s the thing. We don’t know.”As Max Rivlin-Nadler points out, conspiracy theorists who believe in ""weather weapons"" primarily focus their paranoid worries on HAARP -- the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, not the Muse album of the same name (though Muse frontman Matt Bellamy has similar fixations). The program is ""a scientific endeavor aimed at studying the properties and behavior of the ionosphere, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and defense purposes."" As HAARP draws funding from the U.S. Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (the folks what brought you the Internet!), it seems only logical to conclude that HAARP is actually being used to manipulate the weather and cause hurricanes -- if by ""logical to conclude"" you mean, ""left alone in a room filling with some sort of gas that makes your brain feel all wibbly-wobbly.""Normally, you'd see people sort of decrying the toxic influence of Jones and his ilk, but in a counterintuitive way, I like to see Jones' continued existence as evidence of the fact that a certain baseline of charity and prosperity still exists in America, that accommodates the notion that one can be a crazy conspiracy nutter as your job, in the same way a few people can make their living as ""ghost hunters."" Had Jones been an original Jamestown colonist, his colleagues would have probably greeted his ravings with a genial, ""Shut up and farm something, nutsauce, we are dying."" For a little while, anyway. Then the Jamestown colonists would have just murdered him and, as we now know, eaten him. Because he knows the secrets! (The secret being that he is delicious.)""Yay, America,"" is what I think I'm saying, okay?[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?] "

General Assembly to announce Brazil would adopt legislation and technology to protect it from illegal interception of communications.Rousseff last week called off a high-profile state visit to the United States scheduled for October over reports that the U.S. National Security Agency had been spying on Brazil and Rousseff's email.After opening with diplomatic pleasantries and a condemnation of the shopping mall attack in Kenya, Rousseff launched into a blistering attack on U.S. spying, calling espionage among friendly nations ""totally unacceptable.""""Meddling in such a manner in the lives and affairs of other countries is a breach of international law and, as such, it is an affront to the principles that should otherwise govern relations among countries, especially among friendly nations,"" Rousseff told the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.U.S. President Barack Obama was en route to the United Nations while Rousseff spoke. He then followed Rousseff on the podium as the first and second national leaders to address the General Assembly.Postponing the state visit, which as to have included a dinner at the White House, was a rare and diplomatically severe snub by Brazil. No new date has been set.The report by Brazil Globo's news program Fantastico on National Security Agency spying was based on documents that journalist Glenn Greenwald obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Greenwald, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, was one of the journalists to first report Snowden's leaks of classified information on previously secret U.S. telephone and internet surveillance efforts.Rousseff's state visit was conceived to highlight cooperation between the two biggest economies in the Americas and Brazil's emergence over the past decade as a regional power.Rousseff said Brazil will adopt legislation and technology to protect it from illegal interception of communications."

He suggested withdrawing security clearances and imposing other administrative sanctions could suffice in certain cases.“The President agrees with the Justice Department’s recommendation and has directed his team to explore how the Administration could more effectively use alternatives in appropriate cases,” Lehrich told HuffPost.DOJ’s report is available here. The full statement from Lehrich:“The President appreciates the Justice Department’s work to revise their guidelines, and he believes this report is an important step towards finding the balance between dealing with dangerous leaks of classified national security information and protecting the rights of journalists to freely gather and report the news. He also continues to believe that Congress should quickly pass media shield legislation and looks forward to working with them to do so.“Additionally, as the Justice Department states in its report, pursuing a criminal investigation and prosecution is not always the most efficient and effective way to address leaks of classified information. There are circumstances in which leaks are better addressed through administrative means, such as withdrawal of security clearances or imposition of other sanctions. The President agrees with the Justice Department’s recommendation and has directed his team to explore how the Administration could more effectively use alternatives in appropriate cases.”

They are not secret, in that every member of Congress has been briefed,"" he said during a speech in San Jose, Calif. ""These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.""""Your duly elected representatives have consistently been informed,"" he said.News outlets revealed this week that vast spying programs began under President George W. Bush and have continued under Obama. The Guardian reported Wednesday that the National Security Agency had obtained a court order to collect phone records from Verizon Wireless customers, while The Washington Post reported Thursday of the existence of a program launched in 2007 called PRISM, which tracks information from nine leading U.S. Internet companies: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, YouTube, Apple, PalTalk and Skype.In response to a question after his speech, Obama defended the programs as essential to combating terrorist threats. ""They may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism,"" he said.He also argued that some have overstated the impact of the programs. ""Some of the hype we've been hearing over the past day or so -- nobody has listened to the content of people's phone calls,"" he said.""I welcome this debate and I think it's healthy for our democracy,"" he continued. ""I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate.""Obama portrayed the programs as a trade-off between security and civil liberties. ""I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security, and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society,"" he said.He also expressed his displeasure that the domestic spying programs' existence was leaked to the press. ""I don't welcome leaks,"" he said. ""There's a reason these programs are classified.""The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations. Obama ran as an antidote to Bush's policies in 2008, but the reports reveal that he has continued many of them, leading to concerns over the reach of the national security state.Obama went on to defend those who operated the programs as ""professionals."" ""In the abstract, you can complain about 'Big Brother' and how this is a potential program run amok. But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance,"" he said.Disclosure: The Huffington Post is owned by AOL, which has denied knowledge of the PRISM program."

John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Sunday suggested that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has lost his credibility in fighting global terrorism.McCain argued on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the government's vast surveillance program is not ""necessarily wrong"" because it operates under court oversight. Paul, who appeared on ""Fox News Sunday,"" has taken the opposite position, calling the government's phone records monitoring program an ""extraordinary invasion of privacy.""Asked to square the two positions by CNN host Candy Crowley, McCain said that Paul was wrong about the terrorism threat in the days before the Boston Marathon bombings. ""Just prior to the Boston bombing, he said the battlefield was no longer in America,"" McCain told Crowley.McCain was referring to a Paul appearance on Fox News in April. ""It's different overseas than it will be here,"" Paul said in that appearance. ""Which gets precisely to the argument I have with some other Republicans who say, 'Well, the battlefield is everywhere, there is no limitation.' President Obama says this. Some members of my party say the battle has no geographic limitations and the laws of war apply. It's important to know that the law of war that they're talking about means no due process.""McCain isn't the first to suggest that the Boston bombings should serve to chasten Paul. A post-bombings Wall Street Journal editorial also took issue with the Kentucky senator's April remarks.""Boylston Street sure looked like a battlefield on Monday, and so did Watertown on Thursday night,"" The Journal wrote in its editorial. ""The artificial distinction is Mr. Paul's focus on geography. The vital distinction for public safety is between common criminals, who deserve due process protections, and enemy combatants at war with the U.S., wherever they are.""McCain's disagreement with Paul on foreign policy and terrorism was previously highlighted by Paul's lengthy March filibuster of President Barack Obama's drone program, a move that McCain dismissed as ""wacko.""""Americans' suspicions have been aroused by ... the IRS, Benghazi [scandals],"" McCain acknowledged on Sunday.But in an apparent reference to Congress, he said, ""I don't think the government should be briefed on every program like this.

Military cuts also will affect spending by civilian and uniformed personnel at businesses near military bases in every state, no matter how big the military industry, he said.“There is a lot to be done coordinating at the state level,"" DiGiovanni told the lieutenant governors. He cited Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown (D) for assembling a group that helped prepare for potential military base cuts in the past, and for having a plan to lobby federal officials to protect military installations in his state. DiGiovanni told the lieutenant governors they also should prepare for overseas military cuts, which will shift more activity to U.S. installations. With 200,000 military personnel returning from full time duty overseas, there will be more training at bases, he said. Those personel will contribute to the local economy, but they may spark increased complaints from base neighbors about noise and traffic. At the same time, DiGiovanni did note that there has been a greater culture of the different military services working together with the budget cuts, including at bases around the country. He said that state leaders can continue to see that going forward. “Sequestration and this whole fiscal environment is going to require the services to work together to accomplish the mission,"" he said. ""The resources they’ve had won’t be there anymore.”Kansas is a role model in protecting the military economy, said Patrick O'Brien, director of the Defense Department Office of Economic Adjustment,. O'Brien said lieutenant governors in the past have headed state planning groups to study the impact of military bases and industries on the state economy and how to have state government serve their needs. The lieutenant governors association has long advocated the flexible nature of state lieutenant governors' offices as a way for the officials to be involved in a variety of areas of policy, including those impacting the military and economic development.

Unfortunately, not enough members of Congress performed due diligence before they approved the war.Here are some key questions which President Obama has yet to answer in the call for congressional approval for war against Syria. This article is a call for independent thinking and congressional oversight, which rises above partisan considerations. The questions the Obama administration needs to answer before Congress can even consider voting on Syria:Claim #1. The administration claims a chemical weapon was used.The UN inspectors are still completing their independent evaluation.Who provided the physiological samples of sarin gas on which your evaluation is based? Were any other non-weaponized chemical agents discovered or sampled? Who from the United States was responsible for the chain of custody? Where was the laboratory analysis conducted? Were U.S. officials present during the analysis of the samples? Does your sample show military grade or lower grade sarin gas? Can you verify that your sample matches the exact composition of the alleged Syrian government composition?  Further reading: Brown Moses blog; McClatchy News report; Global Research report.Claim #2: The administration claims the opposition has not used chemical weapons.Which opposition? Are you speaking of a specific group, or all groups working in Syria to overthrow President Assad and his government? Has your administration independently and categorically dismissed the reports of rebel use of chemical weapons which have come from such disparate sources as Russia, the United Nations, and the Turkish state newspaper? Have you investigated the rumors that the Saudis may have supplied the rebels with chemicals that could be weaponized?Has the administration considered the ramifications of inadvertently supporting al Qaeda-affiliated Syrian rebels?Was any intelligence received in the last year by the U.S. government indicating that sarin gas was brought into Syria by rebel factions, with or without the help of a foreign government or intelligence agents?Further reading: Global Research report; Wall Street Journal article; Reuters story; Zaman story (in Turkish -- see Google translate from Turkish to English); Atlantic Sentinel story; AP storyClaim #3: The administration claims chemical weapons were used because the regime's conventional weapons were insufficientWho is responsible for the conjecture that the reason chemical weapons were used against the Damascus suburbs is that Assad's conventional weapons were insufficient to secure ""large portions of Damascus""?Claim #4: The administration claims to have intelligence relating to the mixing of chemical weapons by regime elements Who saw the chemical weapons being mixed from August 18th on? Was any warning afforded to the Syria opposition and if not, why not? If, on August 21st a ""regime element"" was preparing for a chemical weapons attack, has an assessment been made which could definitively determine whether such preparation (using gas masks) was for purpose of defense, and not offense?Further reading: McClatchy report; Brown Moses blog  Claim #5: The administration claims intelligence that Assad's brother ordered the attack What is the type of and source of intelligence which alleges that Assad's brother personally ordered the attack?

Did these events occur simultaneously or consecutively? Could these events, the rocket launches and the release of poison gas, have been conflated? Based upon the evidence, is it possible that a rocket attack by the Syrian government was aimed at rebels stationed among civilians and a chemical weapons attack was launched by rebels against the civilian population an hour and a half later? Is it possible that chemical weapons were released by the rebels -- unintentionally? Explain the 90-minute time interval between the rocket launch and chemical weapon attacks. Has forensic evidence been gathered at the scene of the attack which would confirm the use of rockets to deliver the gas? If there was a rocket launch would you supply evidence of wounds from the rockets impact and explosion? What is the source of the government's analysis? If the rockets were being tracked via ""geospatial intelligence,"" what were the geospatial coordinates of the launching sites and termination locations?Further reading: FAIR.org reportClaim #7: The administration claims 1,429 people died in the attack Secretary Kerry claimed 1,429 deaths, including 426 children.

What is the source of this transcript? What was the exact time of the intercept? Was it a U.S. intercept or supplied from a non-U.S. source? Have you determined the transcripts' authenticity? Have you considered that the transcripts could have been doctored or fake? Was the ""senior official,"" whose communications were intercepted, a member of Assad's government? How was he ""familiar"" with the offensive? Through a surprised acknowledgement that such an attack had taken place? Or through actual coordination of said attack? Release the transcripts! Was he an intelligence asset of the U.S., or our allies? In what manner had he ""confirmed"" chemical weapons were used by the regime? Who made the assessment that his intercepted communications were a confirmation of the use of chemical weapons by the regime on August 21st? What is the source of information that the Syrian chemical weapons personnel were ""directed to cease operations""? Is this the same source who witnessed regime officials mixing the chemicals? Does the transcript indicate whether the operations they were ""directed to cease"" were related to ceasing conventional or chemical attacks? Will you release the transcripts and identify sources of this claim? Do you have transcripts, eyewitness accounts or electronic intercepts of communications between Syrian commanders or other regime officials which link the CW attack directly to President Assad?

The Coast Guard was called. Onlookers remained at a distance for safety. And the answer surprised everyone. As first reported by the Florida Keys Keynoter, it turns out the bright orange, 20-foot long, missile-shaped object was a $570,000 Air Force drone that had been shot down during a training mission in January -- 800 miles away, near Tyndall Air Force base in the Florida Panhandle. ""As soon as we heard, we had people on the way,"" Lt. Col. Lance Wilkins, commander of Tyndall's 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron, told the Keynoter, explaining that the Air Force would repair and reuse the drone. According to an official fact sheet, the BQM-167 drone is ""a high-performance, remotely-controlled subscale aerial target used to provide a threat-representative target drone to support the Air-to-Air Weapon System Evaluation Program and other Air Force and Department of Defense air-to-air test and evaluation programs.""NBC News reports that Tyndall airmen have launched BQM-167s about 600 times since 2007, according to Wilkins, initially losing 16 of them at sea. Of the missing, nine were later recovered. The others, like the Keys drone, presumably slipped into currents in the Gulf of Mexico and headed to sea. ""You would think that they would have awesome beacon tracking or at least GPS enabled on the thing,"" Roger Grimes, one the boaters who radioed the Coast Guard, told the Keynoter. And who can blame South Floridians for being cautious? In 2011, a live Navy mine washed ashore in Miami Beach, causing the bomb squad to evacuate the sand.A month later, a Miami Gardens family found a live grenade in their backyard.UPDATE, Friday noon: Lt. Col. Lance Wilkins, commander of Tyndall's 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron, told HuffPost that the drones used for live fire exercises -- including the one that floated to the Keys -- are equipped with a tracking beacon. But batteries don't last forever, he said, and the drone's GPS can be ""thwacked"" out of service when struck by an anti-drone practice missile traveling at several thousand miles per hour. Though boats are pre-positioned to retrieve the drones after an exercise, weather doesn't always cooperate with a safe recovery. ""For us to recover these we have to have weather that is acceptable risk,"" Wilkins said, ""because we have to put a diver in the water to hook up the drone and get it on the back of the boat.""Wilkins told HuffPost the Air Force has been using the types of drones launched for live fire exercises since the 1950s, and his unit will attempt to retrieve a fallen drone three days in a row before damage from prolonged exposure usually sinks them.

""For example, the president could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances like a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001,"" Holder continued, referring to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Holder said he would ""examine the particular facts and circumstances"" if such an emergency were to arise.Paul, who had threatened to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan as CIA director over secrecy about the U.S. drone program, said in a statement that Holder's ""refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening -- it is an affront the Constitutional due process rights of all Americans."" Holder's letter was first reported by Adam Serwer of Mother Jones.Holder is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a Justice Department oversight hearing on Wednesday morning. Earlier in the day, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the administration had agreed to allow members of the committee to see all of the Office of Legal Counsel memos relating to the targeted killing of American citizens."

Then the declaration had the weight of history behind it: Dotcom himself was arrested in 2012 on piracy charges in New Zealand based on information gathered illegally by the New Zealand government at the behest of U.S. authorities. (A New Zealand judge later ruled the search warrants invalid.)Now, in the wake of yet more government spying revelations and the loss of other encrypted options, Mega CEO Vikram Kumar reminded ZDNet's Rob O'Neill that Mega is still committed to building an encrypted email service. According to Kumar, Mega is ""doing some hugely cutting-edge stuff.""Kumar's statement has generated a lot of attention on tech blogs across the web -- not all of it complimentary. Evan Dashevsky of TechHive called the rumored email service just the latest resume padding in Dotcom's ""history of troublemaking."" But Lauren Hockenson of Gigaom remarked that Dotcom was really going all-in on privacy. In addition to filling the void left by other shutdown services, she wrote, he's also ""creating a VC [venture capital] firm that brings up encryption-focused companies.""Admittedly, the news seems far more exciting in the current context than it was when Dotcom first announced he was building encrypted email in February. Back then, the world was awash in encrypted email services: Tormail; Silent Mail; Lavabit, Snowden's reported service. Now those services are gone, and Lavabit's webpage bears a warning from Ladar Levinson, its founder: ""Without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States."" Mega's email service, if it comes to fruition, might tempt many of the privacy-conscious now bereft of a satisfactory alternative. Since his unfortunate brush with spying, Dotcom has started making a name for himself as an encryption advocate. Mega calls itself ""the Privacy Company"" and automatically encrypts every file uploaded to it.In a January interview with the English-language TV station Russia Today, Dotcom spoke strongly about online privacy. ""My goal is, within the next five years, I want to encrypt half of the Internet,"" he said. ""Just reestablish a balance between a person -- an individual -- and the state."" And true to the advice of Levinson, Mega's servers aren't hosted in the United States. The storage service is currently based in New Zealand. If that country's surveillance policies become too invasive, Dotcom told TorrentFreak, he'll move his company's infrastructure to Iceland. "

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced a resolution Friday calling on President Barack Obama to recommend an alternative location for the upcoming September G-20 summit in St. Petersburg, should Russia continue to provide shelter for National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.The resolution also states that Russia is damaging its relations with the United States and should immediately hand Snowden over to American authorities so he can stand trial. Snowden faces charges of espionage for releasing classified information on the NSA's broad surveillance programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post in June. After initially hiding out in Hong Kong, Snowden headed for Moscow where he has been stuck in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo International Airport since June 23. He applied for temporary asylum in Russia on Tuesday, though President Vladimir Putin has said the whistle-blower is expected to leave the country as soon as he can. Graham has been at the forefront of lawmakers urging the Russian government to extradite Snowden, going so far as to suggest the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi should be boycotted if Russia grants Snowden asylum. The White House declined to speculate on Graham's idea; House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said the South Carolina senator was ""dead wrong.""Graham and Schumer recently strengthened their bipartisan relationship while working together on comprehensive immigration reform. The duo has also introduced a media shield law to protect reporters from leak investigations by the Justice Department. Whether they have support for their latest measure on Snowden remains unclear, but the senators issued a statement Friday citing the Russian government's recent actions in Iran and Syria as additional reason to penalize it.""On multiple fronts, Russia is becoming one of the bad actors in the world,"" said Graham. ""Russia continues to provide cover to the Iranian nuclear program and sell sophisticated weapons to the Assad regime in Syria to butcher tens of thousands of its own citizens. For Russia to grant temporary asylum to Mr. Snowden on top of all this would do serious damage to our relationship. It is past time we send a strong message to President Putin about Russia's actions and this resolution will help accomplish that goal.""""Time and time again. President Putin is too eager to stick a finger in the eye of the United States -- whether it is arming the murderous Assad regime in Syria, supporting Iran's nuclear development or now providing shelter and Russian state protection to Edward Snowden,"" said Schumer. ""Enough is enough. It's time to send a crystal clear message to President Putin about Russia's deplorable behavior, and this resolution will do just that."""

""Congress must deal with immigration directly, and in a compassionate and practical manner.""Cannella was one of 15 lawmakers who signed a letter released Thursday asking the state's Congressional delegation to ""act on reform this year to put this challenge behind us."" A sixteenth lawmaker, state Senator Andy Vidak of Bakersfield, sent his own letter.A landmark immigration overhaul passed by the Democratic-led U.S. Senate in June includes a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants currently living illegally in the United States, but it faces scant chance of passage in its current form in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.The California lawmakers calling for an overhaul - who comprise nearly half of the Republican delegation to the state legislature - are pushing back against the party's national leaders for a variety of reasons. The state relies heavily on its agricultural, construction and hospitality businesses, all of which depend on immigrant labor.The state's demographics also work against a highly conservative approach to immigration: A recent study showed that 7 percent of California's population, or about 2.6 million people, are living in the country illegally.The California Republican party has suffered years of damage politically from prior efforts to crack down on illegal immigration to the state, including backing a 1994 ballot initiative that would have denied public education, health care and other services the undocumented.Simply calling on Congress to pass reform would not erase all those years worth of mistrust and animosity, but it is the right thing to do, Cannella said. 'REPUBLICANS CARE ABOUT YOU'Republican State Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, who represents parts of San Diego County, said he wanted to send Latinos the message that his party understands their concerns.""To the Spanish speakers of California: Republicans care about you,"" Chavez said, before reading somewhat haltingly from a statement in Spanish.Failing to address immigration reform would have economic implications as well as political ones, said Robert Lapsley, president of the Business Roundtable of California, who also spoke at the event.""If we don't get this done, it's going to impact our entire economy,"" Lapsley said.Throughout the nation in recent months, representatives of industries that rely heavily on immigrant labor have been lobbying Republican representatives to support reform.In Minnesota, business executives have peppered Republican U.S. Representative John Kline with questions on immigration at several private events, said Bill Blazar, a vice president at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce.In Colorado, a group of six business executives who collectively donated nearly $500,000 to Republicans in the 2012 election wrote a letter in July to the state's four Republican House members last month urging them to support changes in immigration laws.In Arizona, where state law requires police to question those they stop and suspect of being in the country illegally about their immigration status, business leaders have argued that a hard-line stance is not the political winner it once was.In California, the farm, hospitality and construction businesses could not survive ""without the hard work and skill provided by immigrant communities,"" said State Senator Tom Berryhill, a fourth-generation farmer and the son of a former Secretary of Agriculture.""For Congress to put off once again enacting a policy that allows a reasonable path to citizenship for a group of people that contribute so much to the California economy is just wrong,"" said Berryhill, who represents parts of the Sierra Nevada and the agricultural San Joaquin Valley.

16797	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/18/new-york-times-obama-syria_n_3949419.html	Opinion	1	National Security	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"NEW YORK -- In his new book, The Message, MSNBC.com editor Richard Wolffe describes how the Obama White House grew frustrated in 2011 with The New York Times after some negative editorials ran in the paper. President Barack Obama ended up calling Andy Rosenthal, the paper’s editorial page editor, and a couple weeks later Rosenthal and the Times editorial board went to the White House for an off-the-record meeting with the president. But that wasn’t the last time Obama met with Times editorial board members. On Aug. 29, the president again sat down for an off-the-record discussion with Rosenthal and some members of the editorial board, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Times opinion columnists David Brooks, Gail Collins and Ross Douthat also attended, but editors for the paper's news pages did not.The meeting came amid the White House’s push for military intervention in Syria, one of the topics discussed that day. The Times editorial board hadn't explicitly come out for or against a strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad before the meeting, and soon after the paper still expressed concerns about the administration taking action without congressional approval and broad international support. On Aug. 26, The Times editorial board had stressed that the White House should try exhausting diplomatic efforts before striking Syria. The paper noted that while “Assad’s use of chemical weapons surely requires a response of some kind, the arguments against deep American involvement remain as compelling as ever.”Two days later, The Times editorial board wrote that more answers were needed from the administration on Syria. ""Obama has yet to spell out how that response would effectively deter further use of chemical weapons,"" the paper said.On the afternoon of Aug. 30, Secretary of State John Kerry made the case that Syria had used chemical weapons, signaling that U.S. retaliation for crossing a ""red line"" drawn by Obama could be imminent. But the Times still seemed unconvinced that immediate action was the best course. In an editorial posted online Aug. 30 and in the next day's paper, Times editors wrote that “even in the best of circumstances, military action could go wrong in so many ways; the lack of strong domestic and international support will make it even more difficult.”The Times also noted that Obama's “approach on Syria now seems wholly at odds with the strong position” he took as a candidate in 2007. Obama had told the Boston Globe at the time that “the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.”On the evening of Aug. 30, Obama reportedly decided to seek congressional approval for a strike during a talk with chief of staff Denis McDonough. He announced his decision publicly the following day. Rosenthal did not respond to requests for comment about the Aug. 29 meeting and a Times spokeswoman declined to discuss the specifics of that gathering or the the 2011 meeting reported by Wolffe.“We did meet with the Obama White House about two years ago and that meeting was off the record,” a Times spokeswoman said. “We met with them again recently under the same restriction, which we intend to honor.” Throughout his presidency, Obama has held off-the-record meetings with prominent news anchors, columnists and commentators, including Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein, MSNBC host Ed Schultz and Arianna Huffington, president, chair and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group.But the Obama White House has long seemed particularly interested in getting its point of view across in the Times, and the president has said he reads all the paper's columnists. In April, a former adviser said the Times is the only paper Obama reads. In his book, Wolffe describes how after each negative Times editorial, ""the president would summon his communications team to discuss the critical coverage."" He also included a 2011 anecdote about the White House communications team wondering whether calling Rosenthal through the Times' directory would lead to an announcement over the paper's general PA system. (It wouldn’t.)The anecdote is surprising given that Rosenthal has spoken in the past about the Obama White House's efforts to reach out to him. In March 2009, Rosenthal told this reporter that he had already received “more unsolicited offers for participation from the Obama people in 45 days” than during the eight years of George W. Bush's presidency."

Marcus Fulton ruled that President Barack Obama's comments on military sexual assault could affect the sentencing in two cases, according to Stars and Stripes.During pretrial hearings in the cases, Fulton said “unlawful command influence” derived from Obama's remarks could influence a potential sentencing in the two cases, according to according to court documents obtained by Stars and Stripes. The judge's ruling could have an impact on other sexual assault cases in the military.On May 7, Obama said he has “no tolerance” for sexual assault in the military.""I expect consequences,” Obama said. “So I don’t just want more speeches or awareness programs or training, but ultimately folks look the other way. If we find out somebody’s engaging in this, they’ve got to be held accountable – prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged. Period.”Stars and Stripes reports on the ruling:The judge’s pretrial ruling means that if either defendant is found guilty, whether by a jury or a military judge, they cannot receive a bad conduct discharge or a dishonorable discharge. Sailors found guilty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice’s Article 120, which covers several sexual crimes including assault and rape, generally receive punitive discharges.“A member of the public would not hear the President’s statement to be a simple admonition to hold members accountable,” Fulton stated. “A member of the public would draw the connection between the ‘dishonorable discharge’ required by the President and a punitive discharge approved by the convening authority.“The strain on the system created by asking a convening authority to disregard [Obama’s] statement in this environment would be too much to sustain public confidence.”Obama has made several comments chastising sexual assault in the military, at one point directing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to ""step up our game exponentially"" to prevent further incidents. Obama has also expressed concern over how military sexual assaults ""threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong.""""That's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes, because they've got no place in the greatest military on Earth,"" Obama said in a May address to U.S. Naval Academy graduates.According to an annual report released by the Department of Defense in May, sexual assaults occurred at an average of more than 70 per day in the United States military during 2012.Click here for more on Fulton's ruling from Stars and Stripes."

Salaries and benefits soared far above civilian compensation, military bases and housing were refurbished, support services like day care, family counseling and on-base college courses were expanded.Now comes the reckoning. These personnel costs, necessary and warranted for those bearing the burden of war, are threatening to wreck the military, squeezing the accounts meant to fix or replace gear worn from a decade of war, for research and development, and for new missions in, say, Africa.So stubbornly are personnel costs rising that at the current rate of increase, they would consume the entire defense budget by the year 2039, leaving well-paid troops standing around with their tanks, ships and airplanes rusting and out of gas.The problem has been evident for years -- the past two defense secretaries have called personnel costs ""unsustainable."" But neither the Obama White House nor Congress has signalled its willingness to tackle the issue by proposing bold reductions in pay and benefits -- or by deep cuts in the active-duty force.In his confirmation hearing Thursday, former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) will get a chance to weigh in on the issue as the nominee for defense secretary. He has said nothing in public on the issue, and his background gives little clue: as a successful businessman he's cognizant of the bottom line; as a former combat infantryman, his heart may make him to reluctant to touch the grunts' pay stubs.But with deep cuts in defense spending barrelling down toward the Pentagon, some defense officials and outside experts fear that the opportunity for thoughtful reforms may be passing. Personnel costs are likely to be cut -- but perhaps not wisely. A freeze on hiring of new civilian personnel, for instance, could demolish plans to hire more mental health care providers for returning troops suffering from post-traumatic stress, even though Ash Carter, deputy defense secretary, has vowed to protect such programs ""to the extent feasible.""Military pay and benefits ""are the third rail of budget planning in the Defense Department,"" said Gordon Adams, a defense economist who oversaw the post-Cold War defense drawdown during the Clinton administration. With no long-term budget deal in sight and no long-term planning in the works, the shrinking of the Defense Department ""will happen year by year -- more ankle-biting than systematic planning,"" Adams said.Pentagon spending plans are getting slammed by the automatic cuts under sequestration, scheduled to take place on March 1; by the likelihood that Congress will pass no new defense spending bill, leaving the Pentagon confined, under a continuing resolution to last year's defense budget plan; and by long-term spending cuts which have yet to be made.But the impact is real. The Pentagon has been spending money it expected from the 2013 budget proposed last year by the White House. Cranking back to conform to last year's budget levels will be painful, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno said recently, requiring the Army to squeeze $6 billion out of its operations and maintenance accounts by Oct. 1. These are funds that pay for fuel, training, some family support programs and vehicle maintenance.And while Pentagon officials have vowed not to cut family programs, a continuing resolution, rather than a new 2013 budget, will not allow the Army to move money from one operations account to another -- it all gets cut, Odierno said. ""People have been in denial about this ongoing trend, and now the accumulated impact of it is coming home,"" said Clark Murdock, a former senior planner at the Pentagon and a senior analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.But the data is clear. Since 2001, total military compensation, including pay and benefits, grew by 20.5 percent, while comparable private-sector civilian pay did not increase at all, according to a broad Pentagon review of pay and compensation released last year. The cost of military compensation rose steeply even though the size of the active-duty force grew by only 3 percent during that period.Part of the reason was that Congress mandated that military personnel should get an annual pay raise 1 to 1.5 percent higher than the Employment Cost Index, which measures civilian earnings.Thus, a sergeant's base pay and housing allowance rose 20.5 percent between 2001 and 2009, when the average enlisted military member was earning $50,747 in base pay and housing -- not including other allowances and bonuses. Officer pay rose 9.1 percent, to an average of $94,700.Congress also demanded that the Pentagon absorb a larger share of the housing costs of military families. Their housing allowance was bumped up by 5.7 percent in 2007, another 4.7 percent in 2008 and 5 percent in 2009. Currently, the Pentagon pays all housing costs for families who live off base. Other benefits include shopping at on-base commissaries, which typically save military shoppers about 30 percent on groceries.Base pay and housing allowance boosts the income of an Army master sergeant with 10 years of service, living at Fort Drum, N.Y., to $84,666.48 a year, according to the current Pentagon pay tables. This sergeant would pay a tax rate of 15 percent, a $6,417.40 tax advantage over civilians.An Army captain with six years of service with the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, earns $85,330.80 a year in pay and housing allowance -- not counting bonuses, tax-free danger pay for service in a war zone and other benefits. A brigadier (one-star) general at Fort Drum, with 16 years of service, is earning $131,652 a year plus a housing allowance of $2,247 per month.""The fiscal reality facing us means that we also have to look at the growth in personnel costs which are a major driver of budget growth and are, simply put, on an unsustainable course,"" soon-to-retire Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in October 2011. Months later, the White House included in its budget proposal a timid increase of between $31 and $128 a month in the health insurance premiums paid by military retirees, unchanged since 1985. That proposal was trashed by Congress.But in the new era of budget austerity and tough choices, that kind of congressional protection may not last.""Our folks are worried about whether they're going to get paid, what support services aren't going to be there to help them and their families,"" said Joyce Raezer, executive director of the National Military Family Association. She defended the increases in pay and benefits by saying, ""We've been at war. We've had to pay for people to be at war.""The inevitable cuts in defense spending could, if not managed properly, hurt military families, she said. For instance, whittling down the size of the active duty force could put more of a burden on families if the global missions the military is expected to fill aren't reduced as well. ""We are going to be an on-call force, there is going to be trouble somewhere, and if there are fewer people, the ones left will be on call more often,"" said Raezer, a long-time military spouse.She also worries that cuts in family support programs will drive reductions in mental health services just at a time when they are most needed.""We're not saying all these programs will be needed forever,"" said Raezer. But in all the talk about budget cuts and dwindling resources, she said, there is no thoughtful plan to reduce spending in a rational way.""What we see coming,"" she said, ""is budget cuts first -- and then figuring out how to do with less.""Clarification: Language has been added to clarify the calculations of base pay and allowance increases for specific members of the military. Original language in the headline and copy referring to ""Lavish Benefits"" was inaccurate and reflected neither the views of David Wood nor The Huffington Post. We regret the mischaracterization."

He also told CNBC that it would not pass without changes.His office also raised eyebrows a few weeks ago when it circulated a memo to other Senate staff listing 21 concerns with the bill and ideas for changing what would be the biggest overhaul of federal immigration law in decades.Frank Sharry, head of the immigration advocacy group America's Voice, said Rubio's comments made him ""anxious"" and cautioned that the lawmaker must avoid taking his message too far.""Rubio is uniquely qualified to talk to conservatives about immigration reform,"" Sharry said. ""On the other hand, if he thinks now that he's the face of immigration reform, that he's going to drive this bill in a direction that makes it less palatable for the progressive coalition that created the political space for reform, it's going to be a huge problem.""Rubio, however, has said that failure to heed his concerns could endanger the prospect of overhauling immigration law, an issue that has historically divided conservatives and the American left.As the most high-profile conservative in the bi-partisan ""Gang of Eight"" senators who labored for months to craft the legislation, Rubio will play a key role when it comes up for debate in the Democratic-controlled chamber.Selling the bill is a delicate balancing act for Rubio. His comments are intended to build trust with conservatives, who have traditionally opposed immigration reform, but he must avoid alienating Democrats, whose support is also vital for passage.While enactment of the bill could help Rubio's overall presidential prospects, it could cost him support in crucial early-voting conservative states such as Iowa and South Carolina.Rubio has won credit from Democrats for backing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Pushing the economic case for the bill's passage, Rubio argues that new visa programs for foreign workers could boost America's global competitiveness, especially in the technology sector.Yet he has often qualified his support by making clear he favors toughening the enforcement provisions of the bill, which are seen as politically necessary to get many Republicans' support for giving legal status to undocumented immigrants.In a town hall-style appearance on Fox News last week, Rubio said he wanted to see the bill go farther to boost security on the southern U.S. border with Mexico. Asked about conservatives' mistrust of the Obama administration on border enforcement, he replied, ""You've hit on the exact point.""Rubio promised to consider revisions that would put Congress in charge of creating a border security plan rather than the Department of Homeland Security as currently called for in the bill. ""Unless we get people's confidence that we are going to secure the border, this bill won't pass,"" he said. SELLING TO CONSERVATIVESAs a frequent guest on conservative radio and television programs, Rubio has a broad platform. And his arguments have converted some talk show hosts, including Mike Gallagher who acknowledged recently that he had been won over to supporting the central focus of the bill.But David Leopold, general counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which supports immigration reform, said Rubio was ""pushing the envelope.""""Rubio needs to back up this bill,"" Leopold said. ""To offer a bill, to sit down and roll up your sleeves and write a bill with Democrats - I'm not going to discount that that took guts - but in that same vein, he needs to go into his caucus and sell this bill as a champion and not as a critic.""Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, which supports immigration reform, said some of Rubio's comments were ""off-putting.""But he added that Rubio's approach might turn out to be a shrewd way of reaching out and showing fellow conservatives that he is listening to their concerns. ""He does have a difficult role in trying to sell this package to conservatives.""Rubio's spokesman Alex Conant emphasized that the lawmaker was not the only member of the Gang of Eight to say publicly that more work was needed to pass the bill in the Senate.Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a Cuban-American from New Jersey, told Univision in an interview that the supporters ""don't currently have"" the minimum 60 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate.""After the last four or five months, I don't think anybody should question Senator Rubio's commitment to passing immigration reform,"" Conant said. That commitment is ""why he says we need to be open-minded about criticisms and we need to be open-minded about improving the bill,"" Conant said.Fitz warned that Rubio ""may be creating expectations that aren't going to be able to be met"" in terms of promises to toughen border security.Other Republican members of the Senate's Gang of Eight, including Senators John McCain, Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham, also are expected to push for the bill within their party.""I think Rubio is critical,"" said Rebecca Tallent, a former aide to McCain who is now director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, which supports immigration reform.""He speaks to a lot of the folks who wouldn't necessarily be inclined to vote for something like this but Senator McCain brings the historical context and has a leadership role within the party and is good at building coalitions,""In at least one recent closed-door meeting with Republicans, Rubio was even more blunt than he has been in public about what he sees as the bill's flaws, according to participants.""The message was not, 'Listen, I've come up with a really good bill that we need to support it.' It was, 'This is a terribly flawed bill but it moves the ball forward and over the next weeks and months, it will move ever rightward,'"" said a conservative who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity."

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced on the Senate floor Wednesday he intended to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan as director of the CIA, citing concerns about President Barack Obama's policy on civil liberties.""I will speak until I can no longer speak,"" Paul said.Paul, an outspoken libertarian, pointed to what he called the abuses of executive power and civil liberties under Obama's administration. In particular, he objected to the contents of a letter he received from Attorney General Eric Holder that asserted the U.S. government had the legal authority to kill a U.S. citizen on American soil.""Where is the Barack Obama of 2007?"" he asked, referring to then-presidential candidate Obama's criticism of Bush-era violations of civil liberties. ""If there were an ounce of courage in this body, I would be joined by many other senators,"" he added. ""Are we going to give up our rights to politicians?""Paul had asked the Justice Department about the constitutionality of drone strikes and whether they could be used agains U.S. citizens. Holder responded in a letter that conceded the military could authorize a drone strike on U.S. soil. ""It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States,"" Holder wrote.Paul elaborated on his concern Wednesday: ""When I asked the president, 'Can you kill an American on American soil,' it should have been an easy answer. It’s an easy question. It should have been a resounding an unequivocal, ‘No.’ The president’s response? He hasn’t killed anyone yet. We’re supposed to be comforted by that. The president says, ‘I haven’t killed anyone yet.’ He goes on to say, ‘And I have no intention of killing Americans. But I might.’ Is that enough? Are we satisfied by that?""Paul started his filibuster speech around 11:45 a.m. Unlike most modern filibusters, the Kentucky senator is actually attempting to talk through the whole thing -- like Jimmy Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" -- rather than simply raising his hand to object and requiring 60 votes to proceed. The last ""talking"" filibuster was in 2010, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), spoke out against extending the Bush-era tax cuts. Filibuster reform advocates have proposed returning to this old-fashioned style.""I will not sit quietly and let him shred the constitution,"" Paul said of Obama, later adding that getting an answer from the president on drone strikes was like ""pulling teeth."" The White House declined to comment Wednesday.Paul's speech drew on the work of bloggers from both the left and right who have criticized the president on civil liberties, such as Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian and Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic. Kevin Williamson of the National Review also earned a mention for a piece he wrote asking whether under Obama's standards the Nixon and Johnson administrations should have bombed college campuses.""To be bombed in your sleep? There's nothing American about that,"" Paul said. ""There's nothing constitutional about that.""Last week, Paul voted for the nomination of Chuck Hagel as defense secretary -- another key Obama national security appointment -- after first voting against cloture on the matter, saying he was using his vote to try to get more information about Hagel.Brennan's confirmation was expected as soon as Wednesday, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. Following Paul's filibuster, the aide was still ""cautiously optimistic"" that once the senator ended his speech a time agreement for a vote could be reached.Paul also used his filibuster Wednesday to speak out against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He conceded that he would have supported the Afghanistan war at the outset, but said it had since become far wider than its initial response to the Sept. 11 attacks.""The problem is as this war has dragged on, they take that authorization of use of force to mean pretty much anything, and so they have now said that the war has no geographic limitations,"" he said. ""So it's really not a war in Afghanistan, it's a war in Yemen, Somalia, Mali. It's a war in unlimited places.""Paul went on to reprimand Congress for ceding its authority to govern U.S. wars. ""Were we a body that cared about our prerogative to declare war, we would take that power back,"" he said. ""But I'll tell you how poor -- and this is on both sides of the aisle -- how poor is our understanding or belief in retaining that power here.""WATCH: Paul's filibuster live on CSPAN-2.This is a developing story. Updates will appear below:Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined the filibuster just before 3 p.m., giving Paul a break after more than three hours of speaking. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) then took over for Lee just after 3:10 p.m. ""You must surely be making Jimmy Stewart smile,"" he said. Paul resumed speaking around 3:45 p.m, and the filibuster went bipartisan just before 4:00 pm, when Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) joined in. Wyden said he intended to vote for Brennan's confirmation, but added that the nomination provided an opportunity to seek more information on the Obama administration's legal documentation for targeted killings. He said the Senate Intelligence Committee had gotten that information.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came to the Senate floor to ask a question of Paul just before 4:20 p.m. Rubio did not criticize the administration's targeted-killings policy per se, but he defended the Senate's right to ask questions of presidential appointment nominees. Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) joined the filibuster just before 4:40 p.m. The Georgia senator, who is retiring in 2014, said that he thought the administration should be capturing and interrogating more suspected militants, rather than launching drone strikes at them. He said that he did not support the nomination of John Brennan.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took to the floor at about 4:45 p.m. to try to invoke cloture on the Brennan nomination to allow the vote to happen Wednesday night.Sen. Paul (R-Ky.) said he would be happy to vote, but that he hasn't gotten the answer he wanted, and therefore objected to holding the vote.The filibuster showed no signs of stopping as it entered its eighth hour Wednesday evening. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) read aloud supportive tweets. ""I think the technical term for what the Twitterverse is doing right now is called 'blowing up,'"" he said.Meanwhile, Obama and several Republican senators were dining at the Jefferson Hotel, meeting in an attempt to find a replacement plan for the automatic spending cuts that took effect March 1.Just after 9:15 p.m., Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) joined the filibuster as it neared 10 hours.Close to 11:30 p.m., Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) took to the Senate floor, followed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell expressed support for Paul's efforts, and said that he would not support Brennan's nomination if Reid invoked cloture. "

It called on recipients to contact members of the House of Representatives who might support reform and urge them to vote against it.Members of the ""gang of eight,"" a bipartisan group that drafted a reform bill passed by the Senate in June, argued that their legislation would aid the government's efforts to detect people who overstayed their visas by requiring airports to track both entries and exits to the United States.Sen.

17066	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/05/stanley-mcchrystal-memoir_n_2412437.html	Opinion	1	National Security	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- How was it that Stanley McChrystal, a revered combat leader who reached the pinnacle of his career as the four-star general commanding the longest and perhaps most complex political-military conflict in American history, fell so fast, so dramatically, so quickly?And why is it that three and a half years after McChrystal took command in Afghanistan, with yet another new military campaign plan designed to win the war, that the United States seems no closer to a satisfying end to the conflict?In a new memoir, My Share of the Task, to be published Monday, McChrystal comes at these questions only obliquely. But he acknowledges a critical error: Unlike previous successful wartime leaders -- Dwight Eisenhower comes to mind -- he maintains that he wouldn't and didn't play politics. A reader finishing these nearly 400 pages suspects he disdained the political machinations that in Washington were determining the course of the war he was prosecuting thousands of miles away.""I resolved to try to steer clear of politics,” he explains. “That wasn't easy."" Nor, he acknowledges, 31 months after he was forced to resign, was it smart.McChrystal insists that he sought to emulate the traditional ideal of the professional soldier -- to operate as far as possible outside of the sometimes-messy business of backroom statecraft.But, as his memoir makes clear, his attempt to avoid politics created a deeper problem. In the fall of 2009, McChrystal was assembling an ambitious new counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan, just as the Obama White House was struggling to extricate itself from the deeply unpopular war. It was a time of intense and sometimes ugly partisan infighting with leaks and rumors raging through the White House, Pentagon, Capitol Hill and the 24-hour media.At issue was the very course of the war: Shut it down and bring the troops home, or ramp up the effort to win.What the nation badly needed at that critical juncture was a wartime commander who could not only inspire troops in battle, but could lead in the political arena as well. It needed a warrior who understood what was possible in Afghanistan and how to do it, someone who could knit together a coalition of support from such antagonists like Vice President Joe Biden, who favored a massive troop withdrawal, and Sen. John McCain, who was thundering for a massive troop increase.In hindsight, McChrystal writes in an exasperatingly passive voice, ""there were political realities outside my view ... I recognized, perhaps too slowly, the extent to which politics, personalities and other factors would complicate a course that, under the best of circumstances, would be remarkably difficult to navigate.""That a man so clearly talented -- a brilliant combat leader, most would acknowledge -- a voracious reader of history, a warrior fiercely dedicated, fanatically hardworking, demanding of and tender toward his troops -- could be blindsided by political intrigue and his own missteps, mirrors the ancient truths of Greek tragedy.There was bad blood between the White House and the military long before McChrystal handed in his resignation in June 2010.That was hours after Rolling Stone portrayed the lean, four-star commando as ""The Runaway General"" who coerced an intimidated President Barack Obama into sending more warfighters to Afghanistan and then engaged his staff in a few rounds of bashing the clueless civilian-politicians in Washington.It's hard to imagine how a seasoned professional soldier -- a West Pointer who studied Clausewitz (""War is not merely a political act, but also a real political instrument""), who dramatically expanded and led secretive hunter-killer teams across Iraq and two dozen other countries, who served in Washington as director of the Joint Staff and had risen to four-star rank -- never seems to have developed the political antenna to warn of approaching threats, or to have mastered the basic mechanics of political maneuver.Things got so bad, McChrystal relates, that he was shocked to find that while he was trying to fine-tune the Afghanistan War strategy, the Obama White House in the late fall of 2009 was still grappling with the question on the minds of most Americans: What exactly was the U.S. trying to accomplish in Afghanistan?Or, as an exhausted infantryman put it to McChrystal during one of the general's battlefield tours: ""Why are we here, Sir? What's the point?""At just under 400 pages, McChrystal's memoir, written in 22 months and approved after an exhaustive Pentagon review, never clears up that question -- and dances away from other issues with scant explanation.Many readers, for instance, might skip to the episode (page 387) in which he and his staff allowed Michael Hastings, a reporter for Rolling Stone -- a magazine known for its anti-war passion -- generous and extended access to their operations and private lives. Apparently, McChrystal never gave this decision a second thought until he was awakened at 2 a.m. on June 22, 2010, with the news that the article had been published and ""it's really bad.""His first thought: ""How in the world could that story have been a problem?""McChrystal takes just a page and a half to recount the incident, from that moment to the president's acceptance of his resignation. Readers will search in vain for an explanation of whether the general and his staff did and said what had been reported; if they did, why; or why precisely they allowed Hastings such unrestricted access. In short, were they guilty, and if so, what the heck were they thinking?In true stoic warrior form, McChrystal simply takes responsibility: ""Regardless of how I judged the story for fairness or accuracy, responsibility was mine. And its ultimate effect was immediately clear to me.""In similar fashion, McChrystal skips lightly over issues which deserve fuller explanation.In April 2004, for instance, Spec. Pat Tillman of the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment was accidentally shot and killed by fellow troops during a firefight in eastern Afghanistan. McChrystal says he immediately advised the Special Operations and Central Commands that an investigation was underway but that early evidence pointed to friendly fire as the cause of his death.Under intense pressure from the Bush White House, which wanted to portray Tillman as a combat hero, Tillman's family was led to believe that he died courageously under enemy fire. That misleading explanation was drafted by McChrystal's staff and approved by the general.But he dismisses the entire episode by concluding that ""any errors, which I should have caught, were not the result of any intention to misrepresent or mislead … to this day I am saddened by Ranger Tillman's death, as I am for the loss of every service member I served with, and for the pain such losses cause each family.""Only rarely in his memoir does McChrystal allow a glimpse behind his public persona as the stoic, unfeeling warrior. In one telling anecdote, he relates going on a daytime raid with Army Rangers on a house of suspected insurgents in Ramadi, Iraq.The Rangers moved quickly and gathered a group of local men from inside and around the buildings on the concrete parking areas in the front. To ensure security, as they moved to identify each man, they had him lie on the pavement with his hands behind his head. One Iraqi was notably older than the others, and a young Ranger, without instruction, retrieved a white plastic chair for him from an automotive maintenance shop. As was normally the case, even in daytime, there were no women in the immediate area. But I saw a boy, probably about four years old, standing near one of the men, no doubt his father. As the Rangers motioned for the men to lie down on the ground, I watched the boy. He stood quietly, as if confused, then, mimicking his father, the child lay down on the ground. He pressed one cheek flat against the pavement so that his face was turned toward his father and folded his small hands behind his head. As I watched, I felt sick. I could feel in my own limbs and chest the shame and fury that must have been coursing through the father, still lying motionless. Every ounce of him must have wanted to pop up, pull his son from the ground, stand him upright, and dust off the boy's clothes and cheek. To be laid on the ground in full view of his son was humiliating. For a proud man, to seemingly fail to protect that son from similar treatment was worse. As I watched, I thought, not for the first time: It would be easy for us to lose.But the war went on. ""We could only hope the residents understood these raids were necessary,"" McChrystal writes, and a few pages later adds: ""Our war demanded relentless focus and a hardening of natural emotions.""Yet it comes as no surprise that a man who devoted eight years to combat in two brutal and bloody wars, himself the son of an Army general who fought in Korea and Vietnam, feels profoundly the valor of shared sacrifice among men at war. Of war itself, McChrystal has almost nothing to say: no musing, at the end of his long career of service, about why he fought, and to what end, whether in the future the use of violent force could be or should be avoided. Or, more usefully, how to bridge the gap of mistrust between senior military leaders and the civilians they serve.In a mea culpa of sorts, McChrystal offers that he sought as a senior commander to follow the ethic proposed by Samuel Huntington in his classic 1957 work, The Soldier and the State.Huntington, McChrystal writes, ""argued that a military commander should endeavor to operate as independently of political or even policy pressures as possible. And yet I found, as much as I wanted my role to be that prescribed by Huntington, the demands of the job made this difficult. The process of formulating, negotiating, articulating and then prosecuting even a largely military campaign involved politics at multiple levels that were impossible to ignore.""The counterpoint to his distaste for politics is one which readers might ponder. At a time when few Americans volunteer to serve, when the military seems a world away from the American mainstream, he takes just a moment to reflect on the nature of war and the community of those who volunteer to take part in it.On a long helicopter flight north across Iraq on Christmas Eve 2009, hunched against the cold blast of air from an open hatch, he reflects that this is where he feels most comfortable.I knew from history that war comes with frightening regularity, often fought over the same ground and similar causes as previous conflicts. Wars often begin with enthusiastic vigor but typically settle into costly, dirty business characterized for soldiers by fear, frustration and loneliness.... I felt the unbroken tradition of commitment to a mission, and a fierce commitment to one another. Like the generation they followed and those they now led, they came forward when called and sacrificed when needed. They did so quietly, often in shadows, with no expectation of reward. They were no better than their grandfathers, and not a bit worse."
17091	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/25/barack-obama-hecklers-immigration_n_4338945.html	News	1	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Hecklers interrupted President Barack Obama during a speech on Monday to demand he halt deportations, which have risen to record levels during his time in the White House. ""Our families are separated,"" a young man yelled during remarks in San Francisco at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center. ""Mr. President, please use your executive authority to halt [deportations]. We agree that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, you have the power to stop deportations."" ""Actually, I don't,"" the president replied, ""and that's why we're here."" Other people in the crowd began to yell as well: ""Stop deportations. Yes, we can."" As Obama delivered a speech calling on House Republicans to press forward with immigration reform, the interruption served as a reminder that many advocates are frustrated and ready for the president to take immediate action. Most have been calling for Obama to slow or halt deportations for months or years, but as progress on legislative reform has slowed, they say there's no more time to wait. This year 1,100 people will be forced out of the country each day if removals continue at the same rate as the previous year. Obama has said that he can't simply halt deportations by executive action, although he did so more narrowly for undocumented young people who entered the U.S. as children. He asked for the hecklers to remain in their seats, and said again that such an action would be illegal. ""What you need to know, when I'm speaking as president of the United States and I come to this community, is that if in fact I could solve all of these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so,"" he said. ""But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition."" ""So the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,"" he continued. ""What I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done."" Before the interruption, the president made his pitch to the House GOP to take up immigration reform to deal with a number of different issues, even if they do it through a more piecemeal approach. ""It's Thanksgiving,"" he joked. ""We can carve that bird into multiple pieces.""House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said last week that immigration reform is ""absolutely not"" dead, although without answering questions about the timetable. Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who previously said immigration bills won't go for votes until next year, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that reform ""is going to happen in a step-by-step method."" But so far, it's not clear what pieces House Republicans plan to include. While there are already proposals on border security, high-skilled worker visas and interior enforcement, the GOP has not put any bills on the table to give legal status to undocumented immigrants. House Democrats, joined by three Republicans, introduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill in October and are urging a vote, but House leadership has indicated they won't get one. A poll released Monday from the Public Religion Research Institute found that 63 percent of Americans support allowing undocumented immigrants to eventually become citizens if they meet certain criteria, while 14 percent said they should be given legal residency without a path to citizenship. Only 18 percent said all undocumented immigrants should be deported. Obama said he hopes that Boehner will not let a small minority of immigration reform opponents block the process, and called it ""good news"" that the speaker had repeated his commitment to reform last week.""I believe the speaker is sincere,"" he said. ""I think he genuinely wants to get it done, and that's something we should be thankful for this week."" CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the average number of deportations per day last year. An earlier version listed the daily figure as the total for the year. "

By Friday morning, the country's director of national intelligence had confirmed the existence of a program that, in the words of the Washington Post, involved the NSA ""tapping directly into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies, extracting audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents, and connection logs that enable analysts to track foreign targets.""Americans learned about these things because there were people inside the government who were willing to leak them, and journalists who were willing to report on them. At a time when the Justice Department's surveillance of journalists has aroused deep anger, the flood of new information about the NSA's activities is a reminder of the vital need for those journalists to be able to do their jobs without fear.The Guardian's explosive piece on Wednesday about the NSA's continual tracking of Verizon customers was a classic leak story. Glenn Greenwald, the blogger who broke the news for the paper, told the Times that his source was ""a reader of mine"" who ""knew the views that I had and had an expectation of how I would display them.""That leak then inspired more reporting, as leaks often do. People could watch media outlets trying to outgun each other on Thursday as they sought to round out the story of the surveillance programs. They could read the Wall Street Journal's report that AT&T and Sprint were also involved in the data-mining program, or watch an NBC News segment which said that ""a secret surveillance program is collecting the telephone records of every single one of us."" They could learn that two senators had been sending cryptic warnings to them for years about how horrified they might be if they learned about the extent of the surveillance. They could hear people they had voted into office admit that the program had been ongoing for seven years.On Thursday, the Post and the Guardian upped the stakes when they reported about the so-called ""PRISM"" program that accessed the Internet companies (including AOL, HuffPost's parent company). Again, it was a classic whistleblowing case, as the Post vividly reported.The paper identified its source as a ""career intelligence officer"" who had been horrified about what he was seeing:Firsthand experience with these systems, and horror at their capabilities, is what drove a career intelligence officer to provide PowerPoint slides about PRISM and supporting materials to The Washington Post in order to expose what he believes to be a gross intrusion on privacy. “They quite literally can watch your ideas form as you type,” the officer said.It appears likely, if reports are to be believed, that that officer will be hunted down by the government whose secrets he has just exposed.All of this information was completely secret on Wednesday morning. Two days later, the entire federal government apparatus had been forced to acknowledge its existence, and hundreds of millions people were much more aware of the huge size of the American surveillance state. As the Associated Press's Matt Apuzzo tweeted, ""THIS is why America needs 'leakers.'"""
17151	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-ditz/obama-insider-threat_b_3588818.html	News	0	National Security	None	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"Faced with a public backlash at the revelation of NSA surveillance against the average American citizen, the Obama Administration has responded with a new program, dubbed the ""Insider Threat"" program, which aims to preempt future whistleblowers from speaking out. The system works by encouraging government workers to rat out any coworkers they suspect of being potentially inclined to blow the whistle before any leaks are even attempted, with an eye toward rooting out potential ""threats"" and intimidating rank-and-file workers against even daring to risk revealing information about government crimes and abuses. It wasn't supposed to be this way. President Obama ran his initial campaign on a pledge for transparency and a promise to enhance whistleblower protection, both of which have been scrapped. Instead, the administration now forwards the narrative that whistleblowers by their very nature are a threat to national security, and that all government actions that aren't explicitly publicized by the White House are secrets as a matter of course. Government hostility to whistleblowers is nothing new, of course. Though the claims of grave danger stemming from making the public and ""the enemy"" (in many cases the two seem identical for the career bureaucrat) never pan out, whistleblowers have always faced threats both overt and covert, and attempted retaliation from all levels of government. In the past the worst of this retaliation was extralegal -- President Nixon ordered a break-in at the psychiatrist of whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg in the hope of uncovering something to use against him. That's no longer the case, however, as in spite of laws like the Whistleblowers Protection Act (WPA) of 1989 the retaliation against recent whistleblowers has primarily focused on threats of huge prison sentences, and in an era of secret laws and secret courts, those threats have more force now than in the past.The WPA, and efforts to enhance it like the No-FEAR Act, have at their core an exemption for ""national security,"" and in recent administrations the attempt to label anything and everything as a matter of national security has left them treating these laws as though they essentially don't exist. That's where the Insider Threat program comes in. Detailed by McClatchy newspapers in recent weeks, the new scheme encourages all agencies of the federal government to come up with their own disparate anti-whistleblower rules, at the center of which will be a threat to punish anybody who even suspects a potential whistleblower and doesn't turn them in. The details of the initiative get more terrifying the deeper one delves into them, with the conclusion that recent divorcees and people with perceived money troubles have to be turned in, and will face preemptive action against them, likely ending their careers on mere suspicion that they couldn't be trusted, when the chips are down, to continue betraying the public trust in the name of secrecy. With the ""national security"" exemption in the law, the administration may feel the initiative is secure, but the reality is that any efforts to use the exemption must pass muster in a court. Even in this security-mad era, no court is going to buy that the Department of Education or others implementing this program have real concerns that an internal whistleblower uncovering abuse is truly threatening the nation as a whole. Though it may take quite some time to get fleshed out in court, it is plain that the administration's hostility to whistleblowers has gone from pathological to downright illegal, as the Insider Threat program is explicitly designed to discriminate against whistleblowers (or even would-be whistleblowers) in ways banned under federal law.This level of hostility toward the public's right to know cannot be permitted, nor simply left for the courts to resolve. Congress should immediately push initiatives to bolster protections for whistleblowers to the extent that a sitting president can no longer threaten the entire class of government employees. From Peter Buxtun's revelation of the Tuskegee experiments of the 1960's to the wiretapping and torture revelations of today, whistleblowers have provided an essential check against government overreach and abuse. Now more than ever that's a check we need in place. Jason Ditz is news editor at Antiwar.com, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the cause of non-interventionism.

Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Sunday that Democratic aides in the Senate are drafting new language for an authorization of military force in Syria, Politico reports. Speaking after some members of Congress returned early from recess to attend closed-door briefings on the situation in Syria, Leahy said the draft legislation offered by President Barack Obama on Saturday was too broad. “I know it’s going to be amended in the Senate,” Leahy said, according to Politico.On Saturday, Obama submitted to Congress a draft resolution authorizing the use of military force in response to Syrian President Bashar Assad's suspected use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians. The measure would allow the president to use force in a “necessary and appropriate” way.""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said during a Saturday statement.According to the Washington Post, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) also expressed hesitation over the draft's language.“I think the biggest question I heard is that the president’s request is open-ended,” Roberts said. “That has to be rectified, and they simply said in answer to that that they would work with the Congress and try to come back with a more prescribed resolution. But I’m not too sure that the people who answered that are the people that have that decision to make.”According to Rep.

""But for some reason I kept this material.""According to CNN, Lewinsky and Clinton began their sexual relationship in November of 1995, two years before this tape was allegedly recorded. The scandal broke in 1998, however, after Linda Tripp contacted the office of Whitewater Independent Counsel Ken Starr and revealed she had recorded Lewinsky allegedly talking about the affair.The magazine also published what it says is a complete transcript of the allegedly 3 minute, 47 second audiotape. ""Hi handsome,"" the reported transcript begins. ""I couldn't bear the idea of sitting down to write you another note. So I though I would tape it, hope that's ok.""In the transcript, Lewinsky goes on to say she has ""two proposals"" for Clinton, ""neither of which is you not seeing me.""""You can't refuse me because I'm too cute and adorable and soon I won't be here anymore to pop over,"" she continues, according to the transcript. ""I could take all my clothes off and start... well.. I know you wouldn't enjoy that? But, I hope to see you later, and I hope you will just follow my script and do what I want.""Although the National Enquirer is often written off as a salacious spreader of gossip and unsubstantiated tall tales, it should be noted that the tabloid has broken some national scandals -- perhaps most notably one-time presidential candidate John Edward's 2006 affair."

House Speaker Thom Tillis (R-Charlotte) announced Thursday afternoon that the bill would not be receiving a vote in the full House, effectively dropping the measure. Loretta Boniti, a reporter for News 14 Carolina, broke the news on Twitter, and it was confirmed in a breaking news alert posted on the home page of wral.com, a Raleigh-based television station. Tillis' decision followed several days of national media attention on the bill, which also said that the state government did not have to listen to federal court rulings and was exempt from the requirements of the First Amendment. The bill, which was drafted by state Reps. Carl Ford (R-China Grove) and Harry Warren (R-Salisbury), was intended to address an issue in Rowan County, where the ACLU has filed a lawsuit against the county commission in an attempt to block commissioners from having a Christian prayer at the beginning of meetings. The North Carolina measure responds to the ACLU suit by declaring that each state is ""sovereign"" and no federal court can prevent a state from ""from making laws respecting an establishment of religion."" Though  Warren, one of the bill's authors, told HuffPost Live that the measure was not seeking to create a state religion, the drafted legislation would clearly allow for such an action. SECTION 1. The North Carolina General Assembly asserts that the Constitution of the United States of America does not prohibit states or their subsidiaries from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.SECTION 2. The North Carolina General Assembly does not recognize federal court rulings which prohibit and otherwise regulate the State of North Carolina, its public schools, or any political subdivisions of the State from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.The North Carolina bill seeks to play the First Amendment both ways. It says that the state is exempted from the establishment clause under the First Amendment, which establishes the ""separation of church and state."" The clause reads that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an Establishment of Religion."" But the North Carolina bill asserts that prohibition does not apply ""to states, municipalities, or schools,"" and that North Carolina could establish a state religion. The bill then goes further, portraying this reasoning as a protection of the freedom of religion, including the state lawmakers' right to exercise their own religious beliefs.In fact, in a series of cases stretching back nearly a century, the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment does cover state governments. Judicial precedent has held that any such proposals on the establishment of religion must have secular, legislative purpose; cannot inhibit or advance religion; and cannot be ""an excessive government entanglement with religion.""An explanation on why Tillis decided to kill the measure was not posted and a Tillis spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The media firestorm regarding the legislation comes as Tillis is considering a bid for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) next year. Tillis was not a co-sponsor of the bill, which originally drew 11 GOP supporters, including Tillis' deputy, Majority Leader Edgar Starnes (R-Hickory) and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Justin Burr (R-Albemarle). Three additional Republicans had signed on as co-sponsors since the bill was first introduced on Monday. "

During an interview with CNN, Mariano said that Christie could suffer a heart attack or stroke during his tenure. ""I'm worried about this man dying in office,"" she said. His response? Take a family history. According to an AP and HuffPost report, Christie told the doctor to ""shut up"" unless she had personally examined him and learned about his family history of heart risk. Undeterred, Mariano responded (via an interview with Bloomberg), saying that ""you don't have to be a doctor to see that he is obese.""Who is right? And is it possible to be healthy and obese? As Christie said on The Late Show with David Letterman, ""I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life.""""Obesity leads to an increase risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. Those are risk factors for heart disease, but so is smoking and family history,"" Dr. Robert Michler, chairman of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, told HuffPost. ""Hundreds of thousands of people who are obese reach old age and even die without having a heart attack or stroke.""It's an important distinction: Obesity is not a condition that causes heart attacks directly. Instead, it increases the risk of developing chronic conditions like major heart disease, high cholesterol and hypertension and those, in turn, often result in heart attack and stroke. Does the obese Christie, 50, have a higher chance of developing one of these conditions and of subsequently dying of a cardiac event? Yes. But that doesn't mean he will. According to New York University's Langone Weight Management Center, about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related complications, though 35.7 percent of the U.S. population is obese (about 112 million people), according to the latest estimates from the CDC. And, as a recent study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found, obesity in and of itself is not a good predictor of health status. They found that during a six year period, obese study participants were no more likely to die than their healthy-weight counterparts if they didn't have one of the chronic diseases associated with obesity, like Type 2 diabetes or hypertension. Early death may not be the primary outcome of obesity, but illness abounds. Obesity is associated with heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, sleep apnea and other respiratory problems, and even some cancers. It also exacerbates other conditions, like asthma, for which Christie has previously been hospitalized. Although we don't know the governor's BMI or weight information, it is relevant to his overall heart attack risk. According to NYU Langone, an obese person has an average of six times the heart disease risk as a non-obese person. And that risk increases depending on how obese you are. In the Framingham Heart Study, a famous, longitudinal study of overall cardiac risk, researchers found that for every increment increase in an adult man's BMI, there was an associated five percent increased risk of heart failure. What's interesting is that obese heart failure patients have better outcomes and are less likely to die than heart failure patients with a healthy weight -- something that doctors refer to as the ""heart failure paradox,"" explains Michler.Stroke risk, which Mariano also expressed concern about, increases with BMI, as well: for every increment increase of BMI, the risk of ischemic stroke goes up four percent and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke increases six percent. Despite his bluster and understandable dismay that a doctor who hasn't examined him would speculate about his health, it seems as though the risks of remaining so profoundly overweight have begun to sink in. ""I have been remarkably healthy,"" Christie told Letterman. ""My doctor continues to warn me my luck is going to run out relatively soon. So, believe me, it is something that I am very conscious of."""

A similar bill introduced by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) in 2012 sparked protests in the hallway outside of Franks' congressional office. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) introduced an amendment that would make it a crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion in order to evade parental consent laws. An amendment offered by Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) would ban abortions that are performed because of the gender of the fetus, and another offered by Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) would allow hospital or health care workers to opt out of participating in an abortion procedure or dispensing emergency contraception if they morally object to it. The fifth amendment, introduced by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), would stop all U.S. dollars to the United Nations Population Fund, an international organization that provides family planning and reproductive health services to women around the world.

And this operation was apparently a moneymaker; White boasted of making more than $15,000 in a slow month, reports the Washington Post. That money was made with the help of what the Baltimore City Paper colorfully describes as a ""harem of correctional officers,"" accused of secreting items in and out of the jail and otherwise aiding BGF members in their pursuits. Four of the correctional officers said to have helped in the business side of the gang's activities gave birth to White's children; two of those four also got tattoos of his name, one on her neck, the other on the wrist.

Mike Lee (R-Utah) declared on Monday that he and other congressional Republicans would be willing to shut down the federal government in order to block further implementation of President Barack Obama's health care reform law.Speaking on Fox News, Lee said Republicans determined that refusing to fund Obamacare was the ""last stop"" before the individual mandate and the law's health insurance exchanges are set to go into effect at the beginning of next year.“Congress of course has to pass a law to continue funding government -- lately we’ve been doing that through a funding mechanism called a continuing resolution,"" Lee said. ""If Republicans in both houses simply refuse to vote for any continuing resolution that contains further funding for further enforcement of Obamacare, we can stop it. We can stop the individual mandate from going into effect.”Lee added that his effort, which he said was backed by ""13 or 14"" Senate Republicans and a host of House Republicans, wouldn't target popular Obamacare provisions that already had gone into effect, like a measure that allows children to remain on their parents' health insurance until the age of 26.Congress passed a continuing resolution in March, temporarily funding the government for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Lee is suggesting that Republicans refuse to vote on a future measure to fund the government, setting up another standoff that would put critical government functions at risk.The threat comes just days after House Republicans took their 38th vote to repeal part or all of Obamacare. Their latest move followed the Obama administration's announcement that it was delaying the law's employer mandate for a year, a decision that Republicans used to support their claims that Obamacare is unworkable.Lee similarly suggested in a Friday interview on WBAL 1090 AM that he and other Republicans would be willing to shut down the government.“I’ll utilize every procedural mechanism at my disposal to do it,” he said. “I generally don’t signal in advance what procedural maneuvers exactly I’ll use because it’s usually not good strategy.

So far I have got, I don’t know, 13 or 14 Senate Republicans who have joined me. I think a corresponding effort is starting to be kicked off in the House.

It's true! For all we know, these are living organisms that endure excruciating nerve stimulation when exposed outside of the male reproductive system.There are those who would argue that we are regulating men's bodies and taking away their freedom to make their own healthcare choices, but as our conservative brethren have pointed out in many a debate on rape culture, men simply can't control their sexual urges on their own as per the landmark legal reasoning of ""boys will be boys."" Therefore, they need help and incentives.To that end, I am proposing a bill in the Texas Legislature that does the following:1. Ejaculation of semen outside of an active effort to procreate is banned. Some would make the case that we should allow exemptions for cases of rape, incest, or if the man's life is in danger, but this is all nonsense and doesn't correspond with our strong, Texas values. A life is a life. Just consider if our great governor Rick Perry had been ejaculated by his father during a self-pleasuring act.In the event Section 1 isn't passed, we should include further restrictions that make it incredibly difficult for men to masturbate without facing criminal prosecution:2. Men who masturbate must apply for a state permit, pay a $500 fee for that permit, undergo a transanal sonogram to view the internal route sperm must take to leave the male body, be counseled by a physician on the benefits of a celibate lifestyle, and view a two-hour video on the modern genocide that is male masturbation.3. Men who obtain masturbation permits are only permitted to do so in designated areas for such activities, specifically masturbation centers that receive licensing by the state.4. The state will be limited to a total of six masturbation centers in order to better monitor this activity, all of which will be placed at least 200 miles outside towns with populations greater than 20,000 residents. We must think of the children who could see a sign for one of these centers.5. Male members of the Texas Legislature are examples to all men everywhere and thus, should submit to daily external and internal swab samples when the Legislature is in session that will be analyzed for evidence that masturbation has occurred.6. In order to evaluate charges that unsanctioned masturbation has occurred by a male member of the Texas Legislature, a Committee to Understand Male Masturbation (CUMM) will be formed to determine if reported transgressions should result in the impeachment of investigated members.7. To avoid bias in these investigations, CUMM will be composed entirely of women in the Texas Legislature. All testimonies given on this subject will be limited to the approval of the committee.8. The Chairwoman of CUMM could hold a possible bias if she is heterosexual, and therefore, it is advised that she be a lesbian to avoid impropriety in oversight of this committee.We love men and believe they are the bedrock of the Texas family. We are only choosing to do what's best for them and avoid a breakdown in the societal order of this state.TWITTER: @cmclymer"

But the argument did not justify letting its lawsuit proceed, he wrote.Wednesday's decision upheld a November 2011 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.James Dabney, a lawyer for Already, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did Nike.Wednesday's decision may help companies such as Nike rival Adidas SE and luxury goods makers Coach Inc and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, which often sue to prevent alleged imitators from interfering with their revenue streams and customer goodwill.The case began in 2009, when Nike claimed in a lawsuit that Already's Sugar and Soulja Boy shoes infringed Nike's trademark on the stitching, eyelet panels and other features of Air Force 1. Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, launched the low-cut Air Force 1 sneaker in 1982 and sells millions of them each year.After Already countersued to void the trademark, Nike dropped its lawsuit, believing Yums was not a commercial threat, and gave a promise in the form of a covenant not to sue Already.But Already, based in Arlington, Texas, refused to drop its own case and accused Nike of dropping the original lawsuit to deprive courts of jurisdiction. DOROTHY'S RUBY SLIPPERSRoberts, however, said that allowing Already's lawsuit to continue would encourage large and small companies to use litigation as a ""weapon"" rather than as a last resort to settle disputes, which could discourage innovation.""Accepting Already's theory may benefit the small competitor in this case,"" he said. ""But lowering the gates for one party lowers the gates for all. As a result, larger companies with more resources will have standing to challenge the intellectual property portfolios of their more humble rivals - not because they are threatened by any particular patent or trademark, but simply because they are competitors in the same market.""Roberts also agreed with Nike that Already was unlikely to produce any shoe that would not be protected.""If such a shoe exists, the parties have not pointed to it, there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it, and we cannot conceive of it,"" Roberts wrote. ""It sits, as far as we can tell, on a shelf between Dorothy's ruby slippers and Perseus' winged sandals.""Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred in the decision, saying that other companies should not assume they can automatically end rivals' trademark cases with covenants similar to Nike's.Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor joined Kennedy's concurrence.Two companies with well-known trademarks, clothing maker Levi Strauss & Co and automaker Volkswagen AG, filed briefs supporting Nike.The case is Already LLC v.

The Justice Department was investigating a leak that was responsible for an AP story on a thwarted Al Qaeda terror plot that was published around this time last year. ""Who knows what kind of irrevocable harm this has caused,"" Maddow said, adding that confidential sources would probably question speaking to the AP again, after knowing that the Justice Department obtained the news organization's phone records. Maddow said that while a senator, Obama supported a federal shield law and co-sponsored 2007 legislation that was eventually killed by a Republican filibuster. Once he became president, the only actions Obama took surrounding federal shield law legislation was to limit that protection when it came to issues of national security.On Wednesday, the Obama administration asked Sen. Schumer to reintroduce federal shield law legislation from 2009. In response to that legislation, Maddow said, ""Yes, right. That is a good start.

17485	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/03/de-blasio-bratton_n_4378748.html	News	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Bill de Blasio, the soon-to-be mayor of New York, surged to prominence over the summer while promising to reform the city’s police department.He said he would scale back the rampant use of stop and frisk, the controversial practice of stopping suspects and frisking them for guns and drugs, which led to hundreds of thousands of arrests of mostly black and Latino New Yorkers on minor marijuana charges. And he vowed to dismiss the current police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, who made stop and frisk a keystone of his tenure and vigorously defended it in the press and in court to those who say that the way he has used it infringes on the rights of minorities. But now de Blasio is considering a replacement for Kelly who has arguably done more than anyone else in the United States -- including Kelly himself -- to popularize the use of stop and frisk and other aggressive tactics associated with racial profiling.William Bratton, who led the Boston Police Department in 1993 and oversaw dramatic crime reductions while leading the New York City Police Department from 1994 to 1996 and the Los Angeles Police Department from 2002 to 2009, is a superstar cop and a hero to many. But some critics of the aggressive policing methods championed by Kelly say he’s a poor choice to lead the department in a new direction. “He would be terrible,” said Harry Levine, a sociology professor at Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center, who studies marijuana arrests. “Bratton is Kelly policing with charm, charisma, savoir-faire, and unbelievably brilliant PR skills.” Others are less critical. Adhyl Polanco, an NYPD officer who has testified against Kelly’s policies in hearings and trials, said he would welcome Bratton back to the force. Stop and frisk isn’t the problem with the NYPD today, Polanco said. “It’s the abuse that’s the problem.” Whether a potential Bratton appointment is a good or bad thing largely depends on the lens through which you view New York City. Is New York’s transformation into one of the safest cities in the U.S. over the last 20 years an unalloyed success story? Or is it a “tale of two cities” in which the haves keep improving their lot, while the have-nots get stopped and frisked and often thrown in jail by those who see them as criminals in the making? Bratton with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. De Blasio ran a very successful campaign arguing the latter, making it all the more surprising he could choose a police commissioner championed by people who see New York through the first lens. As the head of the NYPD, Bratton was perhaps the first police commissioner in the country to embrace the “broken windows” theory of policing -- the idea that the police can discourage criminals from acting with impunity by using the full force of the law to crack down on vandalism and other petty displays of contempt for the authorities.Bratton unleashed patrol officers to stop people for all sorts of minor and suspected violations, and to frisk them for drugs and guns. During his 27 months as New York’s top cop, the city’s arrest rate soared and reports of serious crimes decreased by 33 percent, an extraordinary decline. Supporters praised Bratton both for his hard-nosed style and his introduction of CompStat, a police-intelligence computer system that allows commanders to track crime and arrest data in real time and essentially encourages officers to make more arrests. But as the arrest rate climbed, so did charges of police misconduct, especially in precincts heavily populated by blacks and Latinos. Kelly, who took over from Bratton’s successor, Bernard Kerik, in 2002, embraced and expanded on Bratton’s tactics in a way that many consider excessive and discriminatory against minorities. An analysis of the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk practice by the New York Civil Liberties Union found that innocent black and Latino New Yorkers were stopped 400,000 times in 2012, far more often than whites. The report also found that police made more arrests for marijuana possession last year than for any other crime, despite support from both Kelly and Mayor Michael Bloomberg for a proposal to decriminalize open possession of small amounts of the drug.In recent years, Bratton has at times seemed eager to distance himself from Kelly’s approach to policing. At a 2012 business group meeting in New York, he compared stop and frisk to chemotherapy, calling it an “intrusive power,” before adding, “applied in the right way, it can have the effect of reducing crime.”Some black and Latino leaders support Bratton's ""right way” of using stop and frisk, largely because of his accomplishments as the police chief in Los Angeles between 2002 and 2009. John Mack, a black civil rights veteran and the former director of the Los Angeles Urban League, offered a full-throated endorsement of Bratton. “He’s sensitive to the importance of a police department not operating like an occupation force in communities of color,” he said. “The broken windows theory, that’s part of his philosophy, but that was not an issue here in Los Angeles.”Mack worked closely with Bratton in LA and says he has personally recommended him to de Blasio. Under Bratton’s leadership, he said, “the police were not just going after every young black African American on the streets of South Los Angeles.” Bratton greets immigrant reform supporters as they march on Hollywood Boulevard on June 24, 2007 in Los Angeles, California. When Bratton arrived in LA, violent crimes were on the rise. The city’s police department faced corruption allegations and operated under federal oversight, and the historically strained relationship between the city’s cops and black residents was as fraught as ever. Soon after taking over the department, Bratton sat down with some of the LAPD’s fiercest critics, including Mack and civil rights attorney Connie Rice, who had filed a number of lawsuits against the department, and asked for their support. He later tapped Rice to investigate allegations that gang officers from a troubled division had stolen drugs and framed suspects. Meanwhile, the officers who served under him were encouraged to build relationships with black and Latino community leaders, including former gang members, in a cooperative effort to reduce gang violence in the city.By the end of his tenure, crime was down 54 percent from 2001, and race relations seemed to be improving. That year, 51 percent of residents said that the police in their communities treated members of all racial and ethnic groups fairly “almost all the time” or “most of the time,” up from 44 percent in 2005, according to a Harvard University study.In November, de Blasio met with Bratton and two other candidates for New York’s top cop job: Philip Banks III and Rafael Pineiro, both of whom currently serve in high-ranking jobs under Kelly. Banks is black, and Pineiro is Latino, but as veterans of Kelly’s department, neither candidate fully represents a break from the NYPD’s recent past.As the city’s public advocate, de Blasio released a report showing that stopping whites was actually more likely to lead to the recovery of guns and drugs than stops of blacks and Latinos, despite the much higher frequency of the latter. He recommended appointing an inspector general to oversee the department’s use of the strategy and passing a bill to protect against racial profiling.Yet de Blasio has stopped short of calling for an end to stop and frisk altogether. His campaign website criticized the “overuse and abuse” of the tactic under Kelly, not the tactic itself.Donna Lieberman, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said she’s heard good things about Bratton from her ACLU colleagues in Southern California. “We have learned from them that his tenure in LA was characterized by a very different relationship with advocates like the Civil Liberties Union than what we have seen with Commissioner Kelly in New York,” she said. “There were lines of communication which don’t exist for us in New York now.”Still, she tempered her praise with words of caution. If Bratton is named commissioner, “we would be very eager to hear about the plans to rein in the excesses with regard to stop and frisk, ‘broken windows,’ and CompStat,” she said. “It starts from the top.”"

During an interview with Nevada Public Radio, Reid warned that he was willing to make drastic changes to Senate rules if action is not taken on the ballooning number of stalled judicial nominees. “All within the sound of my voice, including my Democratic senators and the Republican senators who I serve with, should understand that we as a body have the power on any given day to change the rules with a simple majority, and I will do that if necessary,"" Reid said. ""If the Republicans in the Senate don’t start approving some judges and don’t start helping get some of these nominations done, then we’re going to have to take more action."" The ""nuclear option"" was floated by Reid during filibuster reform talks earlier this year. If taken, the simple majority vote would override the precedent of requiring a two-thirds supermajority to change filibuster rules. However, Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) instead agreed to a scaled-back reform deal in January after Republicans pushed back on Reid's threats. ""No party has ever broken the rules of the Senate to change those rules. I'm glad such an irreparably damaging precedent will not be set today,"" McConnell said in a statement in January. However, Reid's latest comments signal that the precedent may be broken if action is not taken soon on the stalled judicial nominations. As The Washington Post reported earlier this week, 15 nominations are currently awaiting a vote on the Senate floor, including 13 nominees who already cleared unanimous committee votes.In the Nevada Public Radio interview, Reid also pointed to Republican obstruction of Richard Cordray's nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.“We have not been able to confirm a person for that job. They refuse to allow us to bring that up, and -- and he was recess-appointed. Now, we have the Republican-dominated D.C. Court of Appeals who have said, 'look, the president can’t even do recess appointments now,'” Reid told NPR in January of Cordray's nomination. “So, we’re left with few alternatives, and we’re going to have to move forward and do something to change that.”"
17503	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/21/obama-inaugural-address_n_2521206.html	News	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama’s second inaugural address, delivered on a crisp, overcast day at the nation’s capital, was an unapologetic one. The president, who has spent the first four years navigating Washington as much as shaping it, used his platform on Monday to announce that his next four years will be marked by a more assertive approach. The speech wasn't devoid of the classic, Obama-esque ideal that the country itself, and the two political parties in particular, must come together for the common good. But the appeal he made wasn’t so much to the good nature of each individual lawmaker as it was to the need to confront the severity of the issues at hand. The president talked about protecting entitlement programs upon which the elderly and the most vulnerable in society depend. “They do not make us a nation of takers,” he declared, in a clear rebuke to the conservative House Republicans that have been his bête noire. “They free us to take the risks that make this country great.But Obama also gave a nod to items further down on the conventional list of top priorities: climate change and election reform included. The underlying theme was altogether consistent: it is time for the country's reasonable majority to wrest back the agenda. For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial, and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years, and forty years, and four hundred years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall.What the administration now confronts is the issue of legacy. The accomplishments of the first term have given Obama an already exalted status among his base. But inside the White House, there is a tangible sense of hope (and, perhaps, a bit of trepidation) about what’s to come. Immigration reform, the ending of the war in Afghanistan, the protection of gay rights, the passage of gun laws, the execution of health care and banking reform, and the revamping of the tax code and social safety net are all on the docket. The means of addressing them is the great unknown.What Monday’s speech did, more than anything else, is provide a window into those means. This isn’t the same Obama who, upon coming into office amid an economic crisis, called for an end to the politics of division. It was a more jaded, ostensibly realistic Obama, demanding that divided politics no longer be used as an excuse for inaction and promising to not accept such a cynical status quo. What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”   Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing.The president’s supporters and even casual defenders will, undoubtedly, cheer this second inaugural address in a way that they never fully did the first -- a lofty, historic but somewhat unmemorable speech. His critics will take it as affirmation of a liberal agenda that they’ve often warned is coming once the burdens of reelection are gone. Those reactions are predictable and, ultimately, disposable. What matters more is the extent to which the president acts upon the vision he outlined. The second inaugural address showcased an unapologetic president. Time will tell if Monday was just a few lines in a speech or a new, dedicated mindset for the nation's leader.

17510	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/16/rnc-resolution_n_3768906.html	Opinion	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"After much ballyhoo and bellyaching, the RNC has decided that it will officially enshrine its ultimatum to CNN and NBC: cease production on your planned Hillary Clinton movies, or there will be no Republican primary debates on your networks. Or...rather, any such debates will not be sanctioned. Any GOP candidate who appears on any such debates will be...well, I don't know what will happen to them.This ultimatum is the ""news-making"" portion of the resolution the RNC has just passed, in which it makes its displeasure over these Clinton projects known. Or rather, more earnestly known -- obviously these complaints have been in the news for weeks. Deep within the resolution, however, is the acknowledgement that the 2012 primary debates were not beneficial to the GOP, and an outline of a sensible plan to improve the way the party handles its primary season debates in 2016.The ""news-making"" part of the resolution really complicates the ""sensible plan"" part of the resolution, for reasons that I am at a loss to understand.Here is the resolution that was passed:The RNC's paramount complaint is that any sort of Hillary Clinton biopic or documentary amounts to a tacit political endorsement. This has been Reince Priebus' argument from the outset. As I've previously discussed, there is a reality that Priebus is probably missing. One of the proposed ""Hillary Clinton movies"" is actually a documentary that's being created by Charles Ferguson, who helmed the documentary ""Inside Job"" about the financial crisis. It's very likely to be highly critical of Clinton and her husband's administration. As Frank Rich notes: ""It’s impossible to imagine that Ferguson would do a hagiography of Hillary, whose husband’s administration empowered many of the villains in 'Inside Job.'"" Obviously, Rich is making an assumption, but it's not a big leap. The irony I'm imagining, actually, is the CNN documentary providing a lot of fodder for future RNC attack ads. I'm going to go ahead and make plans to write the piece titled, ""RNC Attack Ad Cites CNN Documentary It Tried To Derail.""Now, as for NBC's proposed Clinton project -- it's a biopic, in which Diane Lane will portray Clinton. This sounds to me like it's going to fit more squarely in the parameters of ""hagiography,"" though I'd prefer to call it ""soft focus melodramatic made-for-teevee cheese."" Now, I doubt that this movie will ultimately conclude anything other than the fact that Clinton is an amazing, historical figure. I'd suggest to Priebus, however, that there will nevertheless be a saving grace here: This Clinton movie is likely to be really, really stupid.And as I've previously written, I think Peggy Noonan has sort of grokked what it's going to be like, in the end:It will be a drama about Hillary’s wonderfulness and when it’s done they’ll privately screen it and an executive will say, “We’re going to be accused of liberal bias, we’d better balance it a little.” So they’ll reshoot some scenes and insert things that might make Hillary look bad, but they’ll choose the wrong things, stupid things, and it will make the whole effort look cheesy.So, this is not something that I'd particularly worry about if I were Priebus. In the end, I think we're looking at one project that will, if anything, hurt Clinton and another project that will, if anything, simply prove to be unhelpful to Clinton.What I would worry about, if I were in the RNC, is the way Priebus portrays his party as helpless in the face of a few teevee shows. Whatever happened to ""never let them see you sweat""? This whole ""trembling in the face of some movies about Hillary Clinton"" thing is not a good look. Moreover, while I understand that much of this is simply a bit of ""working the refs"" kabuki, Priebus is actually helping to amplify Clinton's whole phenomenon, when he should be trying to promote what his party and its future candidates are all about.Priebus, however, does have a debate problem, which is addressed in the last part of the RNC resolution. Bringing an ""order to the primary debates"" and ""[ensuring] a reasonable number"" of them? That's a solid plan. Let's definitely never have 20 debates in a primary season again! On this matter, I consider Priebus to be an American hero. (As I'll have to watch all debates that happen, I think of Priebus as being on a mission of mercy, tailored to me, and I really cannot thank him enough.)I also think that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the RNC angling to put its candidates in debates with moderators who are on the same side of the ideological spectrum. Why not? The singular purpose of the party's primary debates is to help its base make determinations between candidates of a similar ideological strain. Even if this means that Fox News' Chris Wallace serves as moderator for all of them, believe me, Wallace will take that task very seriously.Over at the Washington Examiner, Byron York agrees that it's the final part of this resolution that really illuminates what's going on in the back of Priebus' mind:That is what top party officials have wanted to do ever since it became clear that the GOP’s grueling series of twenty-plus debates in 2011 and 2012 created more bloodletting, division, and sometimes embarrassment for the party than enlightenment of voters. Ever since that moment — RNC officials realized it as it was happening but were powerless to stop it — the party has wanted to limit the number of debates and exert more control over who moderated them. That was going to happen even if NBC and CNN had never announced plans for Hillary Clinton programs. And that is what today’s resolution is really all about.The real question, then, is why did this solid plan for improving the primary debates get inextricably tied to this hysterical garment-rending session over a couple of movies? I don't have a good answer to this question. Maybe the RNC is in this place right now where it can't even move forward without some foil at which to take aim. Maybe it thinks that a decision to limit the number of debates will be met with derision and criticism, and so it's putting forth the Clinton movies as a way of insulating itself from criticism. The simplest explanation is probably just that any resolution about debates and debate moderators is going to ""make news,"" and the RNC would rather the headline be, ""RNC Takes Stand Against Clinton Movies,"" as opposed to, ""RNC Admits That Its Last Set Of Primary Debates Was Embarrassing.""Ultimately, however, the RNC is probably not going to get NBC or CNN to bend to its ultimatum. It is not going to be able to stop NBC or CNN (or Telemundo and CNN Espanol) from staging debates. It is not even going to be able to stop Republicans from participating in those debates, if they really want to do so. That's a lot of battles that it can't really win, so why fight them?[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

A Bloomberg National poll released Wednesday found that 55 percent of Americans approve of Obama's performance, his highest rating in the poll since September 2009. The poll also found that 49 percent of respondents believe that the president's proposals to increase government spending in key areas are more likely to spur job creation than GOP-backed efforts to cut both spending and taxes. Additionally, the Bloomberg poll found Republican popularity at a record low. Just 35 percent of respondents said they have a favorable view of the GOP, marking the lowest ratings for the party since the poll began three years ago. The Republican rating also marked a six point drop over the last six months. The poll surveyed 1,003 adults between February 15 and February 18, with a three percent margin of error.Obama's popularity has been on an upward trend in the months since his reelection. A Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted last month found that 60 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the president. In December, a CBS poll showed Obama's strongest numbers since the death of Osama Bin Laden in May 2011. However, the Bloomberg poll wasn't all good news for the president. 55 percent of respondents said they disapprove of how Obama has handled the federal budget deficit, and 49 percent have an unfavorable view with how he has handled the economy.

THE FIRST LADY: We know how busy this time of year is for everyone, so we’re not going to take much of your time. But we did want to take a moment to wish you all a Merry Christmas, from our family to yours. THE PRESIDENT: This is a season for millions of Americans to be together with family, to continue long-held holiday traditions, and to show our gratitude to those we love. And along the way, some of us might even watch a little basketball or eat some Christmas cookies, too. THE FIRST LADY: Here at the White House, over the past few weeks, we’ve had about 70,000 people from all across the country come visit us and look at our holiday decorations.  This year’s theme was “Gather Around: Stories of the Season.” And in every room of the house, we tried to tell a story about who we are as Americans and how we celebrate the holidays together.  And we made certain to highlight some of the most powerful stories we know – the stories of our outstanding troops, veterans, and military families and their service and sacrifice for our country. THE PRESIDENT: Our extraordinary men and women in uniform are serving so that the rest of us can enjoy the blessings we cherish during the holidays. But that means many of our troops are far from home and far from family. They’re spending some extra time on the phone with their loved ones back home. Or they’re setting up video chats so they can watch as the presents are opened. So today, we want all of our troops to know that you’re in our thoughts and prayers this holiday season. And here’s the good news: For many of our troops and newest veterans, this might be the first time in years that they’ve been with their families on Christmas. In fact, with the Iraq war over and the transition in Afghanistan, fewer of our men and women in uniform are deployed in harm’s way than at any time in the last decade. THE FIRST LADY: And that’s something we all can be thankful for. And with more and more of our troops back here at home, now it’s our turn to serve – it’s our turn to step up and show our gratitude for the military families who have given us so much.  And that’s why Jill Biden and I started our Joining Forces initiative – to rally all Americans to support our military families in ways large and small.  And again and again, we have been overwhelmed by the response we’ve gotten as folks from across the country have found new ways to give back to these families through their schools, businesses, and houses of worship. THE PRESIDENT: That’s the same spirit of giving that connects all of us during the holidays. So many people all across the country are helping out at soup kitchens, buying gifts for children in need, or organizing food or clothing drives for their neighbors. For families like ours, that service is a chance to celebrate the birth of Christ and live out what He taught us – to love our neighbors as we would ourselves; to feed the hungry and look after the sick; to be our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper. And for all of us as Americans, regardless of our faith, those are values that can drive us to be better parents and friends, better neighbors and better citizens. THE FIRST LADY: So as we look to the New Year, let’s pledge ourselves to living out those values by reaching out and lifting up those in our communities who could use a hand up.  THE PRESIDENT: So Merry Christmas, everyone. And from the two of us, as well as Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo… THE FIRST LADY: And Sunny, the newest Obama. THE PRESIDENT: We wish you all a blessed and safe holiday season.  THE FIRST LADY: Happy holidays everybody, and God bless.

Republicans are pursuing ""a narrow ideological agenda ... and pushing the government towards shutdown,"" it said.The Senate is not scheduled to meet until mid-afternoon on Monday, 10 hours before a shutdown would begin, and even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage in the fast-approaching end game. If so, a House GOP rank and file that includes numerous tea party allies would soon have to choose between triggering the first partial shutdown in nearly two decades – or coming away empty-handed from their latest confrontation with Obama.Undeterred, House Republicans pressed ahead with their latest attempt to squeeze a concession from the White House in exchange for letting the government open for business normally on Tuesday. ""Obamacare is based on a limitless government, bureaucratic arrogance and a disregard of a will of the people,"" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind.Another Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa of California, reacted angrily when asked whether he would eventually support a standalone spending bill if needed to prevent a shutdown. ""How dare you presume a failure? How dare you? How dare you?"" he said.Apart from its impact on the health care law, the legislation that House Republicans decided to back would assure routine funding for government agencies through Dec. 15. Under House rules, the measure went to the Senate after lawmakers voted 248-174 to repeal the medical tax, then 231-192 for the one-year delay in Obamacare.A companion measure headed for approval assures U.S. troops are paid in the event of a shutdown.The government spending measure marked something of a reduction in demands by House Republicans, who passed legislation several days ago that would permanently strip the health care law of money while providing funding for the government.It also contained significant concessions from a party that long has criticized the health care law for imposing numerous government mandates on industry, in some cases far exceeding what Republicans have been willing to support in the past. Acknowledging as much, Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said that as a conservative he had often found during Obama's presidency that his choice was ""between something bad or (something) horrible.""GOP aides said that under the legislation headed toward a vote, most portions of the health law that already have gone into effect would remain unchanged. That includes requirements for insurance companies to guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions and to require children to be covered on their parents' plans until age 26. It would not change a part of the law that reduces costs for seniors with high prescription drug expenses.One exception would give insurers or others the right not to provide abortion coverage, based on religious or moral objections.The measure would delay implementation of a requirement for all individuals to purchase coverage or face a penalty, and of a separate feature of the law that will create marketplaces where individuals can shop for coverage from private insurers.By repealing the medical device tax, the GOP measure also would raise deficits – an irony for a party that won the House majority in 2010 by pledging to get the nation's finances under control.The Senate rejected the most recent House-passed anti-shutdown bill on a party-line vote of 54-44 Friday, insisting on a straightforward continuation in government funding without health care-related add-ons.That left the next step up to the House – with time to avert a partial shutdown growing ever shorter.For a moment at least, the revised House proposal papered over a simmering dispute between Speaker John Boehner and the rest of the leadership, and tea party conservatives who have been more militant about abolishing the health law that all Republican lawmakers oppose.It was unclear whether members of the rank and file had consulted with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has become the face of the ""Defund Obamacare"" campaign that tea party organizations are promoting and using as a fundraising tool.In debate on the House floor, Republicans adamantly rejected charges that they seek a government shutdown, and said their goal is to spare the nation from the effects of a law they said would cost jobs and reduce the quality of care. The law is an ""attack and an assault on the free enterprise and the free economy,"" said Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas.Democrats disagreed vociferously. ""House Republicans are shutting down the government. They're doing it intentionally. They're doing it on purpose,"" said Rep. Donna Edwards of Maryland, as Republican lawmakers booed from their seats on the floor.In the Senate, there was little doubt that Reid had the votes to block a one-year delay in the health care program widely known as ""Obamacare."" He said the same was true for the repeal of the medical device tax, even though 33 Democrats joined all Senate Republicans in supporting repeal on a nonbinding vote earlier in the year.The 2.3 percent tax, which took effect in January, is imposed on items such as pacemakers and CT scan machines; eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and other items are exempt. Repealing it would cost the government an estimated $29 billion over the coming decade.If lawmakers miss the approaching deadline, a wide range of federal programs would be affected, from the national parks to the Pentagon.Some critical services such patrolling the borders, inspecting meat and controlling air traffic would continue. Social Security benefits would be sent and the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals.The new health insurance exchanges would open Tuesday, a development that's lent urgency to the drive to use a normally routine stopgap spending bill to gut implementation of the law. ___Associated Press writer Alan Fram and radio reporter Gerry Bodlander contributed to this report."

""It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default,"" she wrote. ""There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution.""Palin went on to cite the Constitution's 14th Amendment. ""The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first,"" she wrote. ""We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first.""However, Palin suggested that Obama could face impeachment if he used the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling without congressional approval — an option endorsed in a Courier-Journal op-ed by constitutional lawyer Brianne Gorod. Former President Bill Clinton and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have also urged Obama to invoke the 14th Amendment if necessary. Palin, on the other hand, said any such action would be a ""betrayal"" of future generations.""It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense,"" Palin wrote. ""A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill."""

The Tribune detailed Lazar's exchange with Hatch's receptionist, in which Lazar was allegedly pressed on why she wanted information about Hatch's schedule:The staffer pushed her on what issues she wanted to discuss, but Lazar was reluctant to tell her because she thought that would diminish her chances of seeing Hatch.Lazar wanted to express her opposition to the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which Democrats generally oppose and Republicans generally favor. She wanted to wait until she actually could meet Hatch so she wouldn’t be blown off prematurely.Finally, the staffer told Lazar the senator would be coming to town but had scheduled no town hall meetings and would be too busy to meet with her.Lazar said she then received a phone call from Capitol Hill police the next day, in which an officer told her Hatch's office had issued a complaint identifying her as a suspicious person.Hatch spokeswoman Heather Barney denied Lazar's version of the story and called it an ""isolated incident.""""This does not happen very often at all, but we have to take any sort of protocol when it comes to security seriously,"" Barney told HuffPost.Barney said Lazar never made it clear that she wanted to meet Hatch, asking only questions about the senator's whereabouts and refusing to say exactly what she wanted.""She didn't ask about town hall meetings.

""There are no readouts from big meetings he has with people from the outside, and many of them aren't even on his schedule. This is different from every president I covered. This White House goes to extreme lengths to keep the press away.""The awkwardness between the Obama administration and the White House press is nothing new -- this past summer, for instance, reporters blanched at White House attempts to edit a press pool report. But the latest fracas -- over the lack of access to a golf game that Obama played with Tiger Woods on Sunday -- has brought the journalists' anger out into the open again. Obama eventually had a brief off the record conversation with reporters on Monday night but, judging by Compton's comments, journalists see a deeper issue.Ed Henry, the White House correspondent for Fox News who is also president of the White House Correspondents' Association, made the rounds on Monday to defend the press corps' indignation at being kept from covering the game. He told HuffPost's Michael Calderone on Monday night that the protest was about having a ""minimal level"" of access to Obama, not about a desire to watch him play golf.Two people who see a tempest in a teapot? Henry's Fox News colleagues Bill O'Reilly and Charles Krauthammer. The anchor and pundit dismissed Henry's objections during a conversation on Monday.""It is a trivial issue,"" Krauthammer said.

Thirty-two percent said that they would favor a constitutional amendment making Christianity the official religion of the United States, with 52 percent saying they were opposed. Although a large percentage of Americans said they would favor establishing a state religion, only 11 percent said they thought the U.S. Constitution allowed states to do so. Fifty-eight percent said they didn't think it was constitutional, and 31 percent said they were not sure. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment, which (among other things) prohibits the government from establishing an official religion, also applies to the states.Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say that they would favor establishing Christianity as an official state religion, with 55 percent favoring it in their own state and 46 percent favoring a national constitutional amendment.The relatively high level of support for establishing Christianity as a state religion may be reflective of dissatisfaction with the current balance of religion and politics. Respondents to the poll were more likely to say that the U.S. has gone too far in keeping religion and government separate than they were to say religion and government are too mixed, by a 37-29 percent margin. Only 17 percent said that the country has struck a good balance in terms of the separation of church and state.The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted April 3-4 among 1,000 U.S. adults. The poll used a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The main message that the promo hammered home over and over again was that Americans were being denied the news they deserved on television.Clips of Bill O'Reilly and Al Sharpton were played, and people in different towns were filmed talking about how underserved they felt.""Americans want wider coverage and more real news,"" Richelle Carey, one of the anchors hosting the promo, told viewers.The network also touted its 12 bureaus across the country and vowed to tell stories that weren't airing on its rival channels.The problem for Al Jazeera America is that many millions of people don't have access to those stories. Though the network is available in 40 million households, Al Jazeera America faces a distribution challenge. The network recently took its request directly to viewers, asking potential audience members to ask their cable providers for Al Jazzera America if they do not already provide it. The network's highly anticipated debut was more than 8 months in the making. In January, former Vice President Al Gore  and Joel Hyatt sold Current TV to Al Jazeera. The Doha-based news network said it would replace Current TV's programming and launch a new cable network called Al Jazeera America, which would be based in New York City.The announcement was met with some hostility, as many criticized Gore for selling to a network backed by oil money. ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart described the deal as an ""odd move"" and grilled the former vice president on his decision to sell the network to a ""fossil-fuel-based buyer.""Upon news of the sale, Time Warner Cable, which accounts for 12 million households, dropped the low-performing Current TV. Hyatt told staff in a memo that Time Warner Cable ""did not consent to the sale to Al Jazeera.""Al Jazeera also has a well-known image issue with viewers who stubbornly associate it with anti-Americanism. The initial promo tried to address this head-on, playing clips of Hillary Clinton and John McCain praising Al Jazeera, and showing a man on the street who said, ""It's a business. They're entitled to set up a business.""Originally set to launch in June, Al Jazeera America had to push its launch back a few months as it searched for New York office space, a news director and top talent. The network eventually hired hundreds of employees and plucked some top talent from competing cable news networks. CNN's Ali Velshi left to join Al Jazeera America as a primetime host, and former CNN morning show host Soledad O'Brien signed on as a correspondent. She also inked a documentary production deal. Just last month, former ABC News executive Kate O'Brian was named the network's president."

Bush Presidential Library and Museum opened May 1 on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas after much anticipation. The $250 million library brought together all living presidents for a dedication ceremony on April 25, where they showered praise on the 43rd president of the United States.But according to the Democratic nonprofit group Bridge Project, which focuses on ""exposing the conservative movement's dishonest tactics,"" the library's version of the Bush legacy suffers from selective memory loss. Bridge Project thus created a library of its own Thursday, in the form of a website BushRewrite.org, which the group said will ""rectify the falsehoods and omissions of the Bush library.""The timing coincides with the eighth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a low point of Bush's two-term presidency. The Bush library has already been accused of glossing over Katrina, which killed 1,833 people and destroyed an estimated $81 billion in property. The library overlooks the Bush administration's delayed reaction and includes no pictures of the desperate crowds at the Louisiana Superdome or the New Orleans Morial Convention Center -- images that quickly spurred suggestions that race was a factor in the muted federal response.The halls of the Bush library ignore other disturbing facts, the Bush Rewrite states on the website. The Huffington Post was offered an exclusive look at the website, which says that the Bush White House ""was plagued by a series of scandals and controversies"" and ""policy failures."" It contains pages with what Bridge Project calls a ""stark reminder"" of Bush's true legacy, ranging from the economy, which revisits events preceeding the 2008 financial collapse, to war and national security,  which highlights the Bush administration's torture and rendition programs. The Bush Rewrite also recalls Bush's record on education, environmental policy and Social Security. In some cases, the website displays pictures taken at the Bush Library to underscore the contrast between the museum's more favorable remembrance with media reports.A section called ""The Missing Wing"" is dedicated to controversial moments under Bush's presidency that his library chose not to mention, such as the roles played by Vice President Dick Cheney and senior adviser-turned-deputy chief of staff Karl Rove, the Abu Ghraib prisoner torture scandal, and Bush's support for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.Bridge Project also uses the website to argue that congressional Republicans continue pushing policies that are harmful today.The Bush library contents are ""American fiction,"" Eddie Vale, vice president of Bridge Project, told HuffPost. ""The inaccuracies and omissions are a disservice to the annals of history, but ignoring the lessons of the Bush administration poses a threat to our nation’s future. The failure to recognize the consequences of Bush’s policy decisions is why today’s congressional Republicans are even more ambitious than Bush ever was in pursuing the policies that served as the catalyst for the crises from which we are still recovering."""

As for the latter reason, we agree that this is not an ideal situation, and look forward to rectifying it in the near future…unless, of course, we fall in love with another white guy first.For all of ""SNL's"" staying power -- it has, after all, been on the air for most of four decades -- the one criticism it's never been able to escape is its startling lack of diversity. When ""SNL"" rolled out six new cast members in September, many voiced disappointment. Five of them are white men, and the one female addition, ""despite a heritage which includes Tunisian and Latina roots… has seemingly played just white characters onscreen,"" as NPR points out. That criticism was renewed this week, as Kerry Washington, one of only a few leading black women on television, prepared to host.  Per the Associated Press:The show has had four black women among its regular cast since coming on the air in 1975 with the last one, biracial Maya Rudolph, leaving in 2007. Both Pharoah and Thompson have recently addressed the situation in interviews, with Pharoah even lobbying for a specific comic to be added — Darmirra Brunson of the OWN sitcom ""Love Thy Neighbor.""""It's not like it's not a priority for us,"" producer Lorne Michaels  told the AP last week. ""It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.""Good self-awareness, ""SNL."" Now do something about it!"

After the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act on Wednesday, the restaurant chain's president and chief operating officer, Dan Cathy, apparently tweeted an anti-gay response to the ruling. The court ruled Wednesday morning that DOMA, which barred the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, even in states where the union has already been legalized, is unconstitutional. Following the decision, the Supreme Court also dropped the case for Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban. Upon hearing the news, some celebrated for equality while others complained about how society has changed for the worse. Cathy, who made headlines last summer for saying his company supports the ""biblical definition"" of marriage, stood with the latter camp. The Wall Street Journal's Speakeasy reporter Charles Passy was the first to report that Cathy reportedly tweeted an anti-gay marriage statement following the DOMA verdict. A reader sent Passy the tweet, which said it was a ""sad day"" for the nation and that the ""founding fathers would be ashamed."" The post has been deleted.The tweet is still available on Topsy, an online platform that can index and trackback tweets and web pages. In a statement emailed to The Huffington Post on Thursday, a spokesperson for the fast-food restaurant discussed the company's stance, but wouldn't directly comment on Cathy's tweet. ""Dan Cathy, like everyone in this country, has his own views. However, Chick-fil-A is focused on providing great-tasting food and genuine hospitality to everyone,"" spokesman Jerry Johnston said. Cathy's statement may not come as much of a surprise to some. The COO said in 2012 that ""we are inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, ‘We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,'"" the New York Times noted. A backlash ensued after Cathy confirmed his anti-gay stance and his company was found to have ties to anti-gay groups, but Chick-fil-A claimed its only mission is to ""treat every person with honor, dignity and respect"" regardless of ""belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender."" The famed fried chicken joint has since tried to distance itself from any discrimination. Last September, it was reported that Chick-fil-A stopped donating to right-wing groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Cathy himself even seemed to progress, embracing a more open dialogue and befriending LGBT activist Shane Windmeyer, the founder and executive director of pro-LGBT college group Campus Pride. UPDATE: 2:16 p.m. -- Chick-fil-A spokesman Jerry Johnston reached out to HuffPost Thursday afternoon to explain why Cathy decided to pull the tweet, saying, ""He realized his views didn’t necessarily represent the views of all customers, restaurant owners and employees and didn’t want to distract them from providing a great restaurant experience."""

John Hickenlooper this week blocked the execution of Nathan Dunlap, he called for a statewide conversation about the death penalty. His decision to reprieve the Chuck E. Cheese’s murderer came weeks after Colorado lawmakers killed a bill to abolish capital punishment on grounds that the topic needs more public debate.But no such discussion has yet been planned yet by the politicians. In the meantime, civil rights watchdogs are hoping to advance the conversation in court by continuing to pursue a lawsuit tied to Dunlap’s execution.“Up until two days ago, Colorado was scheduling an execution for this summer. The Governor has taken that execution off the calendar, but he has not taken the death penalty off the public agenda,” Mark Silverstein, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, said Friday. “The public has an interest in learning exactly what the state plans to do the next time an execution [lands on its calendar].”Dunlap was convicted of killing four people in an Aurora Chuck E. Cheese’s restaurant in 1993. He exhausted legal appeals this spring and was scheduled for execution in August. The ACLU sued Colorado’s Department of Corrections on Tuesday seeking access to documentation that would detail how the state planned to put Dunlap to death.Despite Dunlap’s reprieve and the fact that neither of the state’s two other death row inmates are scheduled for execution, the ACLU’s interest in state policies and procedures still stands. The group plans to pursue its legal battle to uncover details about the training, procedures and protocols the corrections department has put in place since executing its last inmate, Gary Davis, in 1997.Of particular concern is how a lethal injection, the state’s method of execution, would be implemented. Davis was killed 15 years ago with three drugs, including a non-lethal dose of barbiturate or anesthetic, followed by a drug that caused paralysis and then a drug that caused death by cardiac arrest. The so-called three-drug cocktail, in which the anesthetic dosage sometimes is too low and doesn’t work, has drawn medical, legal and ethical criticism in several states for causing extreme pain while the prisoner is paralyzed and enduring a heart attack.Colorado law specifically requires lethal injection be carried out by the continuous injection of just one drug.Concerns about the methods to be used in Dunlap’s case heightened last month when corrections officials sent a letter to several pharmacists requesting “sodium thiopental, pentobarbital, pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride, or similar drug or drugs that the CDOC can purchase.” The drug list raised questions about whether corrections officials intended to abide by the one-drug statute, prompting the ACLU to seek copies of communications between the state and pharmacies and a secret document outlining DOC’s execution protocols.Corrections officials refused to disclose those documents. They also declined to comment about the ACLU suit after Dunlap’s reprieve other than to say they intend to conceal the identities of the pharmacists willing to provide the drugs. Officials said they wanted to protect the pharmacists’ privacy and prevent “public pressures” such as protests and boycotts that, as spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson put it, “could interfere with our duty under the statute.”Jacobson said her department is dedicated to carrying out the wishes of its former director Tom Clements, a death penalty opponent who was slain in March and who sought to improve relationships with the ACLU and other groups watchdogging the state prison system. She added that she “doesn’t disagree” that seeking the documents is a way to further the debate about the death penalty in Colorado.“Still, our opinion is that the documents are restricted,” she added. “It looks like we’ll be discussing it in court.”Continued conversation about how exactly Colorado would put inmates to death could affect the likelihood that the state’s two other death row inmates, Sir Mario Owens and Robert Ray, are ever executed. It could also affect sentencing decisions in cases in which the death penalty is being sought, cases such as the one against Edward Montour, whose guilty plea in the 2002 murder of a prison guard was tossed by a judge in April, and James Homes, the alleged shooter in last summer’s Aurora movie theater massacre.The ACLU’s Silverstein says access to the DOC’s secret documents is as relevant as ever.“We’re moving forward. More facts and more details about how executions are carried out will facilitate lots of conversations that need to take place about the death penalty.”Hickenlooper’s announcement Wednesday to block Dunlap’s execution was applauded by dozens of social-justice groups, including the ACLU. Critics have derided Colorado’s capital punishment practices on legal and ethical grounds, including the fact that all three men on death row — Dunlap among them — are African American in a state with a population that’s less than 5 percent black.“Colorado’s system of capital punishment is imperfect and inherently inequitable,” Hickenlooper said in announcing his decision. “Such a level of punishment really does demand perfection.”

17865	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/02/honolulu-police--tattoo-ban_n_4206377.html	News	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Police departments all over the country are imposing tattoo bans of various scope on their officers, but it is unclear what difference these bans make on their abilities to enforce the law.Most recently, the Honolulu Police Department announced a ban on any visible tattoos, piercings or “dental ornaments.” Existing tattoos must be covered with a long sleeve uniform or with makeup. (Yes, makeup.) The new ban raises multiple concerns. Tattoos are a huge part of Hawaii culture, Polynesian tattoos in particular. Many see tattoos not as a fashion statement but as a statement of heritage. Similar issues were raised last year when the London Metropolitan Police banned some tattoos, since a portion of their force came from Pacific islands. A Honolulu resident summed up the second problem best: “Somebody’s going to get a heat stroke,” Beverly Neely told KITV, referring to the suggestion that the officers wear long sleeve uniforms to cover their tattoos. Mark Spencer, then president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, raised the same concern when Phoenix banned tattoos in 2011. “Imagine having to wear long sleeves along with body armor, a gun belt and having to get in and out of a police car 50 times every day,” Spencer told the New York Times. The New Orleans police department is in the process of reviewing its proposed tattoo ban in light of this concern. ""As we reach temperatures close to 100 degrees on some days, it just seems like cruel and unusual punishment, just because you are proud that you served in the U.S. Navy or you put the name of your child on your arm,"" a Fraternal Order of Police spokesman said during this summer’s debate over the ban.Finally, on an island where every branch of the military has at least one base, no doubt the Honolulu PD will also face the problem of a large portion of their officers having military backgrounds. The military has a strong tattoo culture, and veterans wear their ink with pride. Retired military members provide one of the best pools from which police departments could and should recruit.“We're losing a lot of good applicants, especially veterans returning back from Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Vermont State Police Capt. David Notte said last year. Vermont is currently considering loosening its strict policies regarding tattoos in order to give themselves more recruiting options. Baltimore, Los Angeles and New York all have tattoo bans of varying degrees, and smaller departments are clearly trying to follow suit. But what effect do tattoo bans have on the success of the officers? “The absence of visible tattoos gives a more professional appearance to law enforcement officers,"" an NOPD spokesperson argued. Some officers agree, believing a tattoo-less police force will aid in their community interactions. Jeffrey Yzquierdo, who has a full-sleeve tattoo on his arm, had been with the Phoenix Police Department for 11 years when he told the New York Times that he had no problem with a tattoo ban. “Some people want nothing to do with me,” Yzquierdo said, indicating he was frustrated with the public’s negative response towards him because of his tattoos.But many police departments’ bans involve an incredible amount of bureaucracy and nitpicking that possibly takes focus away from much more important concerns. Department bans specify the size of the allowable tattoos, “no greater than 3"" X 3"" size each” and only one on each arm for new hires in Palm Beach County. (For veterans, a little leeway: “No larger than a notecard.”) In Phoenix, tattoos could not be larger than a “3x5 index card.” In departments where the ban only applies to new hires, like Des Moines, current officers had to document by photograph and report every tattoo they already had so that no new tattoo went unnoticed -- or unpunished. As Honolulu moves forward with its tattoo ban, NOPD continues to reconsider its ban. It may be one of the few departments heeding the argument that the police have bigger fish to fry. According to The Advocate, New Orleans loses an average of one police officer every three days. “I think it’s bad for the city,” Police Association of New Orleans President Mike Glasser said. “It accomplishes nothing. I don’t know if it makes for a more professional appearance, but it doesn’t make for more professional policing.”In fact, when the Des Moines Police Department banned tattoos in 2009, police union president Stewart Barnes argued that his tattoos actually helped him do his job. Then 48 years old, Barnes said his ink helped local youth relate to him. “""They come up to me and talk to me about tattoos.” "

It would also repeal a tax on medical devices that helps finance the health care law.The measure would allow employers and insurers to opt out of providing health care services that they find morally or religiously objectionable. The addition reignites the debate over a portion of the health care reform law that requires most insurers to cover women's preventative health care, including contraception.

""We will pledge to oppose, all eight of us, provisions that would destroy the fragile agreement that we have,"" Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the group, told reporters. ""But we're certainly open to amendments, we're certainly willing and glad to have votes on them. This is the beginning of the process, not the end."" The so-called gang of eight -- McCain, Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) -- will release the result of its months-long effort, the full text of immigrant reform legislation, by the end of the day Tuesday. Senators will begin to consider the bill during Judiciary Committee hearings on Friday and Monday, and members of the gang of eight have said they want to give their fellow lawmakers plenty of time to consider the bill and offer suggestions to improve it. But they also know their own agreement was hard won, and any tweaks could damage the balance. ""I want to make sure that we do this the right way, and what we have now is a starting point,"" Rubio told reporters. ""From that point, I encourage my other 92 colleagues to get involved and to offer ideas. I hope sincerely that those that have problems with it don't just offer objections but offer solutions.""There are a number of compromises in the bill, with perhaps the most important over the question of border security and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill would allow undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and eventual citizenship, but that pathway is tied to specific border triggers meant to prevent future unauthorized immigration. This requirement is aimed to reassure lawmakers that the legislation won't be a repeat of a 1986 bill under President Ronald Reagan that was followed by an increase in the number of undocumented immigrants. Legalization under the bill would begin with a new ""registered provisional immigrant status,"" that would allow some undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. before 2012 to stay and work without federal benefits, after a $500 fine and criminal background check. Then nothing can move forward until after certain ""triggers"" that guarantee a plan for and then the implementation of increased border security measures. The bill would put $3 billion toward that effort, and another $1.5 billion toward fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. If the triggers are met, immigrants would be able to apply for lawful permanent status 10 years after beginning the process, then eventually citizenship. There are other controversial provisions as well. The bill would mandate E-Verify, an already existing system to check whether potential employees are eligible to work in the United States. It would eliminate the diversity visa lottery, which allows up to 55,000 people each year to immigrate to the U.S. without work or family ties. While the current legal immigration system places emphasis on family visas, the bill would shift to give half of all visas based on merit, USA Today reported. For now, senators have mostly remained quiet on what amendments they plan to offer, particularly before the full text is released. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) hasn't yet made a decision, but may offer amendments to improve due process in immigration if in his view the bill doesn't adequately address the matter.""They're all written,"" Coons spokesman Ian Koski said of the possible amendments. ""It's just a matter of seeing the final legislation and determining which are necessary.""Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has previously said he will push for same-sex couples to be included in the bill, but as of Tuesday afternoon had not seen the final text of the bill to make a decision on amendments, his spokeswoman said. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who opposes mandating an employment verification system on civil liberty grounds, said he hadn't seen enough of the bill to know whether he'd oppose such provisions. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who opposes key parts of the bill such as a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, said he hasn't yet determined whether he'll try to amend the bill or just attempt to block it. He told reporters he thinks it's ""very possible"" it will fail, and that his concern about the lack of hearings isn't assuaged by the two planned so far, since they're planned for days when some senators will be out of town. ""That gives the indication we're going through the motion of hearings,"" Sessions said. ""And besides, it does appear that the core members of the gang of eight have sort of an agreement that they'll defend all the key provisions of the bill and vote against any amendment.

The White House seems prepared to put its weight into helping the bill pass, which McCain said earlier would be ""very important, particularly with the Democrats."" After meeting with McCain and Schumer, President Barack Obama said in a statement Tuesday the legislation does not include everything he wanted, but he will push for reform. ""This bill is clearly a compromise, and no one will get everything they wanted, including me,"" Obama said. ""But it is largely consistent with the principles that I have repeatedly laid out for comprehensive reform. ... I urge the Senate to quickly move this bill forward and, as I told Senators Schumer and McCain, I stand willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that comprehensive immigration reform becomes a reality as soon as possible."" Even if the bill passes the Senate, it could be a non-starter in the House, where lawmakers are working on their own compromise for immigration reform. When asked whether he could imagine the House picking up the Senate's bill, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), one of those working on a deal, said they're more likely to do their own. ""The scenario would be assuming the Senate passes it, and I'm not sure the Senate can pass it,"" Labrador said. ""We'll just have to see what they do, we're going to have our own regular order, our own process."""

'Twas ever thus, but now, ""big banks"" are doing so more overtly, and with more gusto, and with all kinds of interesting people helping them out. Per the WSJ:The banks have hired longtime, influential Washington hands to deflect regulatory and political pressure to strengthen their finances and to sell assets. Regulators and some lawmakers have raised concern that large banks remain ""too big to fail"" and could require another government bailout in the event of a new financial meltdown.The effort by banks marks a lobbying turning point for the industry, which adopted a mostly low-profile stance to new regulations in the wake of the financial crisis.Of course, most of us are nominally invested in the idea that the Obama administration is working to keep the excesses of these banks in check. I mean, just today, Bloomberg reminded everyone that President Barack Obama greeted the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act thusly: “Because of this reform, the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street’s mistakes...There will be no more taxpayer-funded bailouts -- period.”So, it would be quite reasonable to extract the notion, from that statement, that the Obama White House is fully on board with keeping tight rules on banks in place. Interestingly enough, however, someone who worked very hard to ensure Obama would be reelected to a second term does not appear to agree. Let's go back to that Wall Street Journal piece:Regulators and lawmakers increasingly are signaling that more work is needed to lessen the risk posed by large, complex banks, including bigger capital cushions and minimum amounts of expensive long-term debt.The moves by banks include pushing back against bipartisan legislation sponsored by Sens. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, and Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, that would sharply increase capital cushions at large banks to the point where most analysts expect firms would be forced to shrink.Stephanie Cutter, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, and Ed Gillespie, a former Bush administration official, are providing strategic advice to Bank of America on several issues, including efforts to break up the banks. Morgan Stanley recently hired Michele Davis, a top aide to former Bush administration Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, to help bolster the firm's credibility in Washington.So, Stephanie Cutter (who I guess may also soon be repping Bank Of America's point of view on a rebooted ""Crossfire"" for CNN?) is working to undermine ""tight rules"" on banks? That seems like an odd thing for someone who supported Obama's reelection to do. Or does it? Is the implication here that Obama would not sign Brown-Vitter? Or that he contends that ""bigger capital cushions"" are not required?It could mean that the White House isn't all that sincere about reining in the banks, maybe. It could also mean that the Obama White House will be battling its own adviser in the parking lot with tridents. I've not heard back from Cutter since I emailed her to ask, ""HUH WHAT NOW?"" But the day is young.By the way, here is a fun fact that pertains to why tighter rules on banks, specifically those designed to prevent ""Too Big To Fail"" failures, might be of pertinent interest to normal human Americans. Per Bloomberg, today:The firms that rate the creditworthiness of banks say the likelihood of a government rescue hasn’t gone away. Because of the implicit promise of bailouts, Moody’s Investors Service, the second-largest U.S. ratings company, has boosted the scores for the six banks. Each increase in credit grade makes borrowing less expensive.In a March 27 report, Moody’s displays a bar chart of its credit ratings for the banks in blue. In green bars, it shows Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo would be rated two grades lower if the taxpayer backstop didn’t exist. Moody’s boosted Morgan Stanley’s score by two grades for the same reason, even though it had downgraded that bank in June 2012.The scores for Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan (JPM) are three grades lower in the green bars.Debt sold by the holding companies of Bank of America and Citigroup (C), the second- and third-biggest U.S. banks by assets, would fall to junk status without the implicit government guarantee, Moody’s Senior Vice President David Fanger says.“They have a high probability of government support,” Fanger says.""Government guarantee"" means ""taxpayer guarantee,"" in the above construction. Taxpayer wealth is, to the banks' perspective, an implied asset on their balance sheet. So it's no wonder they don't worry about being overleveraged, and want to resist further regulations.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

Gurung, a HuffPost blogger and FLOTUS favorite, has outfitted Michelle on more occasions than we can count on two hands. Naturally, the designer took to Twitter to express his excitement Friday night, as the exclusive interview aired on a special edition of “20/20.”Michelle's navy blue, black and pea green dress was well-coordinated with POTUS' blue tie and navy blue suit.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), served up a stemwinder this week, laying out God’s positions on the death penalty, guns in schools, gay marriage, communism and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), all in an impassioned 45 minutes.The Cuban-American creationist quoted Bible verses that he said described God’s hardline position on capital punishment. “You know, the Bible is so clear,"" he said.

God ordains the death penalty!”He brushed off “all these people that want to come home with their violins to tell you, ‘Oh, we need to show mercy,'"" declaring that the death penalty rightly shows no mercy.On the subject of mass shootings on school campuses, Cruz blamed Democrats who have lobbied for gun control in response to the atrocities. “Look at all the massacres that we’ve had in the last year or two that the left is using to try to tell us that we need to control guns. Every one of those was in a gun-free zone,” Cruz said, amid exclamations of “Amen!” and “Exactly!” from the audience.“You want to eliminate school massacres? Have the teachers carry [guns]! … How stupid can you be?” Cruz said. An audience member answered, “It’s doggone stupid!”Cruz also spoke at length against same-sex marriage, arguing, “It was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.” He said the legalization of gay marriage would lead to a deluge of hate speech claims. “After this homosexual marriage law gets passed, do you know what the next thing that is coming very soon is? ... Hate speech,” Cruz said. “You preach Romans chapter one in your church, you’re going to be called before a court for hate speech. Now what are you gonna do? Are you going to take that page and cut it out of your Bible? Because it’s not politically correct? So it’s going to come to a head.”More broadly, the senator's father warned that “social justice very quickly leads to socialism and ultimately communism.” He squeezed in a jab at the National Rifle Association's past support for the Senate majority leader, asking, “How can you call yourself righteous and go endorse Harry Reid?”Cruz attacked President Barack Obama as a “king” and a “tyrant,” before closing with “God bless you all.”The event at which Cruz spoke was sponsored by the gun rights advocacy group OK2A and the anti-government Tulsa 9.12 Project.

After Justice Antonin Scalia asked a lawyer in the case what would be the equivalent of prayer for a nonreligious person, Breyer interjected, ""Perhaps he’s asking me that question and I can answer it later.""The poll found that 45 percent of Americans think a potential justice's religious beliefs should not be relevant during the nominations process, while 36 percent said the president should take those beliefs into account. Republicans were especially likely to disapprove of the idea of nominating an atheist justice (56 percent to 26 percent), while pluralities of Democrats (49 percent to 34 percent) and independents (42 percent to 34 percent) said they would approve.Republicans were about equally divided on whether the president should take religious beliefs into account when choosing a nominee: 43 percent said he should, 41 percent said he should not. Democrats, by 47 percent to 36 percent, and independents, by 46 percent to 33 percent, said he should not. Born-again Christians were also especially likely to think religious beliefs should be considered during the nominations process (53 percent) and to disapprove of the idea of an atheist Supreme Court nominee (65 percent).

The letter, he told the committee, said his college ""violated the standards for diversity because we didn't have enough dark ones, I guess, is what they meant."" According to Michigan-focused news site MLive, lawmakers at the meeting immediately criticized Arnn for using “offensive” language, but he did not apologize. Instead, Arnn went on to say: “The State of Michigan sent a group of people down to my campus, with clipboards ... to look at the colors of people’s faces and write down what they saw. We don’t keep records of that information. What were they looking for besides dark ones?"" A Michigan Department of Education spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that officials visited Hillsdale in 1998 for a routine evaluation of the school’s teacher preparation program. During that visit, they noted the ethnicity of the students and faculty members in the program. Several hours after Arnn made his initial statements, Hillsdale College issued an official apology. “No offense was intended by the use of that term except to the offending bureaucrats,"" read the statement, which was published by MLive. It further said that while Arnn was sorry if offense was taken, his greater concern “is the state-endorsed racism the story illustrates.""Located in Hillsdale, Mich., the small liberal arts institution over which Arnn presides was founded in 1844. According to its website, the school ""was the first American college to prohibit in its charter any discrimination based on race, religion or sex, and became an early force for the abolition of slavery.” Hillsdale does not receive state or federal subsidies and avoids “federal mandates and control,” another page on its site says. An alum told MLive he believes Arnn’s comments were misunderstood. “I think this was Dr. Arnn’s way to indicate that he was offended with what they were doing in taking clipboards and walking around campus to record the color of students’ skin,” James Joseph, a 2010 graduate, told the outlet. “He’s a very magnanimous man with a generous and charitable spirit, but he doesn’t stand on public piety.”Hillsdale College is notably conservative. In 2012, the Young America Foundation ranked it one of the most conservative colleges in the country. The Hillsdale Collegian also reported that in 2012, Arnn’s most substantial campaign donation was to tea party favorite Congressman Tim Walberg. "

I had young children and no idea how to care for them. Shortly after I decided to separate from my husband, I met a man who I fell deeply in love with and decided to be with him at all costs. He graduated from North Carolina State University and was working as a contracted Geologist at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. Against the wishes of my family and friends, I moved to Maryland to live with him. We had lived there for a short while when he applied for a civilian job for the Defense Department as a Geologist in Aberdeen, Maryland. He had to apply for a secret security clearance for this job. He was cleared for the security clearance and got the job. We then moved to Harford County, Maryland into his childhood home. We married shortly after that. Once I had planted my feet in Maryland, I became the wife he had always wanted -- picket fence and all. He refused to let me work and wanted me to pamper him the way he felt he deserved to be pampered, and I obliged. When my girls came to Maryland, he raised them as if he were their father. He was very involved in their schooling and extra-curricular activities. I was so thankful to be married to a man who cared so much for them. He became involved in county politics, community projects, etc. We took wonderful vacations to Hawaii several times, Alaska, cross country trips. At times, I would miss North Carolina and my childhood friends but that was behind me now. Although I did not realize it at the time, we were living his life. The life he wanted.On April 15, 2010, 11 years into my marriage, I had just gotten home from taking my daughter to school (she had a month to go before graduating) when the phone rang at 7:30am. It was my husband telling me that he was being detained. I had no idea what he meant by this until I finally realized that he had been arrested. I thought for sure it had to be a road rage incident or some kind of mistake. He told me that he loved me and that he didn't blame me if I divorced him. He hung up before he told me what had happened. Within minutes of that phone call, my entire property was swarmed by police -- exactly like you would see on television. I ran outside to see what was going on, but the police would not tell me anything. They told me that I was to stay with an officer and wait for the detectives to get there. When the detectives arrived, I was told that my husband had been arrested for taking pictures outside of the window of a teenage girl's bathroom. I could not hear anything they told me. I could not breathe. I could not believe that this was true. For nine hours, my house was no longer mine. It belonged to the police. They took what they wanted out of it and did to it what they pleased. The aftermath was mine to deal with. My husband was bailed out of jail by his family and re-arrested on May 3, 2010 by the feds. This is when I learned that he had thousands of pictures and videos on his government issued computer, mostly of my daughter but also of her friends and other young girls in our community. The story became big news in Maryland and D.C. News crews were showing up at my house, our mailbox was continually bashed in, I was ostracized by my own town as if they thought I had something to do with it. To add insult to injury, I came to find out that this man that I loved so dearly had been arrested in the early '90s in the state of Ohio for doing the same exact thing! All the security clearances for his jobs with the United States government did me nor all the girls he sexually violated any good.In August 2010, he was charged with two counts of child pornography in the Maryland Federal Courts and was sentenced to serve 12 years at Fort Dix Federal Prison in New Jersey. He believes that that government is using him as an example and that what he did has been blown way out of proportion. I believe the only regret he has is that he got caught. I also believe that when he does get out, he will do this again.On April 15, 2010, my life came to a crashing halt. One phone call and the life that I knew and thought I loved was over and done. There are no words to describe the agonizing pain that I went through. Getting out of bed was impossible. I ceased to function at all. My heart was broken and all I wanted was to make the pain stop. I had a neighbor who was like a surrogate mother to me force me out of the bed and to my doctor. My doctor sent me to a therapist. Slowly, ever so slowly, I was moving again. I began re-connecting with my long lost friends from childhood on Facebook and eventually moved back to Charlotte, North Carolina where I was born and raised and where I belonged. There are a few things I have learned from this nightmare and they are this: When your family and friends strongly discourage you from doing something, listen. Whomever you may become involved with, background check them thoroughly. This may seem impersonal but it will save you from ever having to go through a needless hell like I did. And last but not least, cherish your friends. They will be everything you will ever need when you are going through your worst storms. Therapist are wonderful. We all need them from time to time but nothing, absolutely nothing, will heal you quicker than the love of precious friends.I still have days where I am desperately sad and hate the world, but the majority of my days are filled with the smiles and laughter that I thought I would never have again.

The agency said that Walmart intimidated, surveilled or punished workers in 14 different states, violating U.S. labor law.The agency also said that Walmart illegally threatened workers in statements made in two news broadcasts. That charge appears to refer in part to an interview that Walmart spokesperson David Tovar gave to CBS Evening News last year, saying ""there could be consequences"" for workers who are expected to show up for work and don't.Brooke Buchanan, a Walmart spokeswoman, said the company disagreed with the general counsel's position. ""This is just a procedural step and we will pursue our options to defend the company because we believe our actions were legal and justified,"" she said. “The fact is, we provide good jobs and unparalleled opportunities for our associates. This is our busiest time of the year and we're focused on serving our customers and helping them have a great holiday season.""The labor board said it found no merit in some of the other charges that workers filed, with the backing of the United Food and Commercial Workers, a longtime Walmart foe. The NLRB dismissed one claim that Walmart violated employees' rights by pushing protesters off of store property, and another that Walmart illegally changed employees' work schedules in retaliation for striking.The general counsel's charge amounts to an allegation by a prosecutor -- not a ruling by the board. Such cases are often resolved before the board actually moves to prosecute a company, usually through a settlement to which the parties agree. If Walmart and the workers' representatives can't come to terms, then the labor board will file its complaints. In a call with reporters before the NLRB's announcement Monday, Joseph Hansen, president of UFCW, said the charges were evidence that ""workers who've joined together to improve conditions have been targeted.""""Walmart is on their heels,"" Hansen said. ""Does Walmart treat its workers fairly? It is a debate that we welcome, and one that we plan on winning.""An estimated 400 Walmart workers took part in Black Friday strikes last year, arguing that the company provides unlivable wages, scant benefits and erratic scheduling. The UFCW and its non-union Walmart affiliate, OUR Walmart, say they're planning more strikes this holiday shopping season, although they wouldn't estimate on Monday how many workers might take part.This wouldn't be the first time that the NLRB pursued charges against a company for statements it made in the media. In one highly politicized charge made in 2011, the board's general counsel accused Boeing executives of illegally threatening workers in the press for having gone on strike in the past. That case was eventually settled.This story has been updated with comment from Walmart."

18180	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/07/supreme-court-religion_n_4230411.html	Opinion	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"(Repeats with no change in content)By Joan BiskupicWASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - When the U.S. Supreme Court talks about religion, all hell breaks loose.A dispute over an upstate New York town's prayer before council meetings produced an unusually testy oral-argument session on Wednesday that recalled the decades of difficulty Supreme Court justices have had drawing the line between church and state.Court decisions involving freedom of religion tend to be closely decided with many separate opinions rather than clear-cut majority statements. The case of Town of Greece v. Galloway appears to be headed that way.In the case brought by two Greece residents who objected to the overwhelmingly Christian prayers at meetings, the justices appeared likely to allow legislative prayer to continue but not ready to offer new guidance for when government might have gone too far in favoring, for example, Christianity over other faiths. The more liberal of the nine justices appeared sympathetic to the challenge while the conservatives who control the court's majority seemed ready to back the town - but not with a single obvious rationale.At one point during the hourlong session, Justice Stephen Breyer referred to the challenge of setting constitutional rules so people of different religions live ""harmoniously together."" Not soon after, Justice Elena Kagan asserted that, ""Every time the court gets involved in things like this, it seems to make the problem worse rather than better.""Overall, the justices' remarks were more pessimistic than positive regarding a possible consensus. They voiced frustration with the lawyers who appeared before them and with each other as well.When Breyer asked the town's lawyer if officials could take more steps to invite non-Christians and even people who are not religious to offer the equivalent of a prayer, Justice Antonin Scalia mockingly asked what sort of invocation ""somebody who is not religious"" could offer. As lawyer Thomas Hungar, representing the town of Greece, began to suggest a chant ""of guidance and wisdom,"" Breyer interjected with some annoyance toward Scalia, ""Perhaps he's asking me that question and I can answer it later."" ENDURING DILEMMASSuch have been the tensions over one of America's most enduring dilemmas. The U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion while requiring the separation of church and state. Neither dictate is absolute and the court has struggled with religious protections, often leaving lower courts with confusing standards, particularly on the mandate at issue on Wednesday - that government ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion.""Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, often a deciding vote on religion during her 1981-2006 tenure, attended the session in the ornate courtroom. She sat, expressionless, in a front-row spectator seat.The religious makeup of the bench has changed since O'Connor's time. The court has historically been dominated by Protestants but it is now has six Catholic and three Jewish justices. The religious character of the justices, however, is unlikely to control their views. Among the Catholics, for example, are Scalia, a conservative who has voted repeatedly for prayer in public settings, and Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal who seemed more supportive of those challenging the prayer policy in Greece, a suburb of Rochester.The high court heard the case after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled that Greece officials relied on overwhelmingly Christian clergy, appearing to endorse their beliefs. The court noted that prayers at the town's legislative sessions regularly mentioned Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The appeals court differentiated the Greece dispute from a 1983 Supreme Court case allowing non-sectarian prayers in the Nebraska legislature. In that decision, Marsh v. Chambers, the justices relied on the historic nature of legislative prayer.In key Supreme Court cases since 1983, the justices have focused on whether government might be endorsing a particular religion or coercing people to participate in prayer. In a 1989 case, they rejected a Pennsylvania county's courthouse crèche display and in 1992 they struck down a Rhode Island public school district's prayer at graduations.In Greece's appeal, Hungar urged the justices to consider America's history of legislative prayer dating to its 18th century founding. The Obama administration filed a brief in support of the town. ""KEEPING GOVERNMENT NEUTRAL""Douglas Laycock, a lawyer representing town resident Susan Galloway and other challengers to the Greece prayer sessions, countered that the town's practice ""coerces"" people who attend meetings to join Christian invocations. Laycock said he was not arguing against non-denominational, inclusive prayer.""Give me an example of a prayer that would be acceptable to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus,"" Justice Samuel Alito insisted. As Laycock hesitated, Alito kept repeating, ""Give me an example. ... Give me an example.""Chief Justice John Roberts also was skeptical of Laycock's rationale. ""What exactly is coercive in this environment?"" he asked. ""Having to sit and listen to the prayer?""To sharp questioning by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has succeeded O'Connor as a pivotal vote among the nine, Laycock insisted the court could write a rule that would ensure legislative prayers were not exclusively Christian but that did not require excessive screening of prayers by officials.Laycock disagreed with Kagan's remark that the court seems to be making the law worse rather than better.""I don't think that's true,"" Laycock said. ""There are people who distort your decisions. There are people who misunderstand your decisions honestly ... But keeping government neutral as between religions has not been a controversial proposition in this court."" (Reporting by Joan Biskupic; Editing by Howard Goller, Amy Stevens and Bill Trott)"

18239	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marlene-g-fine/the-trifecta-of-race-in-america_b_4519590.html	Opinion	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Race and charges of racism continue to dominate the headlines in the U.S., with December turning out to be the ""trifecta"" of race in America. In early December, it was ""Affluenza"" -- not immediately coded for race, but yet a story with race in the background. A Texas judge sentenced a wealthy white teenager who killed four pedestrians when he lost control of his speeding pick-up truck to probation rather than jail. Although the teen confessed to intoxication manslaughter, the judge accepted the defense argument that the he suffered from ""Affluenza,"" a disease caused by having too much money and too little supervision, which led to his reckless behavior and absolved him of responsibility for his actions. The judge's decision outraged many people because it showed blatant preference for the wealthy. But imagine a different scenario -- a wealthy Black teen facing the same charges. Would ""Affluenza"" be the cause, or would the teen now be the victim of Black men's irresponsibility, which, of course, would leave him fully responsible for his actions?Then came the second big story when Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly assured any kids who happened to be watching her commentary about a Slate.com post on the possibility of a ""Black Santa"" that ""Santa just is white."" She also assured viewers that ""Jesus was a white man too."" Her statements set off a firestorm of criticism and satirical replies (John Stewart and SNL for example). The news commentators on the Boston PBS program ""Beat the Press"" wore black Santa pins to show support for non-white Santas. In an interview with Kelly on ""The Kelly file"" on December 13, political commentator and writer Zirlina Maxwell told her that whiteness is ""not the default identity."" Santa is a fantasy; why shouldn't Christian children of any race or ethnicity imagine that fantasy in their own image? Fern Johnson told a reporter for the Worcester Telegram & Gazette that Kelly's comments were an example of ""white washing"" images that have no firm racial definition. Kelly at least admitted in a later segment that controversy remains about whether Jesus was white. But Santa? The answer is ""white.""Then we hit the trifecta when ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch and star Phil Robertson's anti-gay and anti-Black statements were quoted in a GQ Magazine interview. While he defended his anti-gay statements by quoting scripture, his anti-Black comments were more insidious. Claiming he understood Blacks because he and his family were ""white trash,"" Robertson insisted that Blacks were happier before the civil rights era: ""Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues."" In a few short sentences, Robertson managed to conflate race and social class and declare that he, a white man, knows how Blacks think and feel.  We don't want to add to the debate over whether any of these individuals or their comments was intentionally racist. The issue is more complex than what sounds like a racist comment. The comments each reflect the kind of racial thinking that shapes our understanding of the world in the U.S. Whether it's the belief that wealth corrupts whites while Blacks are born corrupt, or that Santa, like all iconic figures, is white, or that a white person who has some commonality with African-Americans knows what Blacks think or feel, these beliefs each normalize a vision of the world that is not necessarily shared by people of other races or cultural backgrounds. But as long as those of us who are in the dominant culture believe our thinking is natural and normal, we refuse to question it, even in the face of contrary evidence.Yes, many commentators ridiculed the decision of the judge in the Affluenza case and Megyn Kelly's insistence that Santa is white and Phil Robertson's belief that Blacks were happier before the era of civil rights. But for all those who spoke up and questioned these beliefs, many still don't understand why they did. And many of those who did speak up might not know why the incidents reveal racial thinking. Often, we know something is wrong, but we don't know exactly why. Racial thinking is powerful precisely because it's normalized. If mainstream media and the shopping malls in American portray Santa as white, well... he must be white. Same for Jesus of Nazareth. We know these things to be true because these images repeat over and over. Santa is white, white people have money and money corrupts them, Blacks were happy before civil rights. In fact, Black people used to like white people -- after all, didn't Mammy love Scarlett in Gone with the Wind?"

Thirty-two percent said that they would favor a constitutional amendment making Christianity the official religion of the United States, with 52 percent saying they were opposed. Although a large percentage of Americans said they would favor establishing a state religion, only 11 percent said they thought the U.S. Constitution allowed states to do so. Fifty-eight percent said they didn't think it was constitutional, and 31 percent said they were not sure. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment, which (among other things) prohibits the government from establishing an official religion, also applies to the states.Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say that they would favor establishing Christianity as an official state religion, with 55 percent favoring it in their own state and 46 percent favoring a national constitutional amendment.The relatively high level of support for establishing Christianity as a state religion may be reflective of dissatisfaction with the current balance of religion and politics. Respondents to the poll were more likely to say that the U.S. has gone too far in keeping religion and government separate than they were to say religion and government are too mixed, by a 37-29 percent margin. Only 17 percent said that the country has struck a good balance in terms of the separation of church and state.The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted April 3-4 among 1,000 U.S. adults. The poll used a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

""If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you'll see more of them doing it,"" Obama said. Most recently, Limbaugh had a flair for the divisive during the fiscal cliff talks, encouraging members of the GOP to refrain from negotiating with the president.""I would suggest to people who really believe Obama is concerned about his second term and his legacy -- he doesn't want a recession -- the only way to flush that out is to come dangerously close to allowing it all to happen,"" said Limbaugh in late November.Obama linked that point to John Boehner in the TNR interview, adding that he thought the House Speaker ""genuinely wanted to get a deal done,"" but was impacted by vulnerability to attacks from more conservative streams of the Republican Party.  Boehner barely retained his House Speaker role, leaving the holiday talks in an embattled state after many members of his caucus were displeased with the terms of the agreement. While the president specifically named some names of the right-wing contingency, he added that the left is far from immune to the ""same dynamic."" Yet those networks in his estimation, and Democrats alike, are less obstinate to some give and take.""I think the difference is just that the more left-leaning media outlets recognize that compromise is not a dirty word,"" he said.

And a plurality of respondents, 46 percent, said they would still vote for Obama for president if they could recast their 2012 ballots, compared with 35 percent who said they would vote for the then-Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.Some 55 percent of the survey respondents who reported casting ballots in the 2012 presidential election said they had voted for Obama, compared with 33 percent for Romney.Institute of Politics Director Trey Grayson said the poll revealed cracks forming in Obama's base.""This isn't a problem for Obama because he's not coming up for election again,"" Grayson said in a conference call with reporters. ""But it is a potential problem for any Democratic candidate seeking to mobilize young Americans.""The results follow a CNN/ORC poll released on Nov. 25 that showed a growing number of Americans doubted Obama's ability to manage the nation, amid ongoing problems plaguing the president's signature domestic policy achievement, the healthcare reform law known as Obamacare.Obama's administration has also come under fire. Critics claim it is dealing poorly with the Syrian government over its alleged use of chemical weapons and Iran over its nuclear ambitions, and has failed to rein in U.S. public spending or revive the economy.Some 57 percent of respondents in the Harvard poll said they disapproved of the Obamacare law, with 40 percent expecting the quality of healthcare to worsen and about half expecting such costs to rise.""Among the 22 percent in our survey who report that they have no insurance, less than one-third tell us they are likely to enroll,"" according to the report detailing the survey findings. ""A plurality however are 50-50 and are therefore open to enrolling under the right circumstances."" UNHAPPY WITH EVERYONEThe Harvard survey respondents spread out the blame for Washington's shortcomings beyond Obama and the Democratic Party. In terms of job performance, 54 percent said they disapproved of the president, 59 percent disapproved of Democrats in Congress, and a whopping 75 percent disapproved of Republicans in Congress.Conservative U.S. Republicans took a hard line in the fight over October's U.S. government shutdown, which was waged over the party's demands to stop the launch of Obamacare. But delays in pay to some public workers, closings of national parks and reductions in public services only deepened Americans' frustration.""Nobody was happy with anybody after the shutdown,"" Grayson said.Asked which proposals they would prefer to see enacted to cut the federal deficit, respondents tended to favor increasing taxes for the wealthy and cutting certain types of military spending - including on the nuclear arsenal and the size of the Navy fleet.More than 70 percent also said they would prefer not to see any cuts to education spending on kindergarten through high school, the poll showed.In a sign of ambivalence over the role of Edward Snowden, a contractor for the National Security Agency, in unveiling details of the U.S. spying program, 52 percent of survey respondents said they were not sure if he was a traitor or a patriot. Some 22 percent labeled him a traitor and an equal 22 percent labeled him a patriot.Snowden is living in Russia as a fugitive after President Vladimir Putin granted him asylum against Washington's wishes.""The Snowden stuff shows that these 18-to-29-year-olds are not that supportive of giving up personal information for the interests of national security,"" Grayson said.

In as little as 10 years, experts who watched the ivory crushed said, trinkets like those could bring about the extinction of elephants.""What was once a local or regional problem has become a global crisis,"" said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director Daniel Ashe. ""How will we answer the question when our grandchildren ask why there are no elephants remaining in the wild? Will they be proud of us when we say it was more important to own beautiful things than for beautiful things to roam in spectacular places?""The condemnation of ""blood ivory"" supports an executive order by President Barack Obama to fight wildlife trafficking. The event also marked the first time in U.S. history that such a large quantity of ivory, stockpiled over 25 years, was destroyed, although selling ivory within the U.S. remains legal. ""We hear a lot about China, and concerns about the trade there are warranted, but the fact is, the United States is the second-largest market for ivory in the world,"" President and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States Wayne Pacelle said in a statement. ""Ivory trade laws in the U.S. are riddled with loopholes ... and smugglers take advantage of this deficiency.""A September report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence says the illicit ivory trade has grown to $10 billion and is now a major resource to fund crime and terrorism. Reports said activists claim elephant poaching helped finance al-Shabaab, the Somali terrorist group that recently attacked Kenya's Westgate mall. Poaching also has grown increasingly brutal. Earlier this year, poachers reportedly used cyanide to kill 300 African elephants for their tusks, and some have used night-vision goggles and AK-47s. African elephants have returned to the brink of extinction after an increase in poaching. According to a recent report by the National Intelligence Council, wildlife trafficking has doubled since 2007 and just last year, about 30,000 African elephants were slaughtered -- the most since the United Nations-backed Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) issued an ivory ban in 1989. CITES relaxed the ban in 1997, however, to allow limited sales of ivory in Zimbabwe and later China. According to Peter Knights, the executive director of WildAid, relaxing the ban resulted in ""disaster"" and destroying the ivory is the best thing to do.""People need to understand that this is as heinous a crime as consumption of heroin,"" Knights said. ""We don’t put heroin back on the market after we seize it, so this [crush] is the right thing to do. I think people who say otherwise are people who [support] this theory of legal supply, which we tried for 20 years, they fiddled with it and it was a disaster and we tried it with another release into China and that was a disaster, too, so you have to look at history and you have to learn its lesson."""

18379	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-weiler/chief-justice-roberts-and_b_3503768.html	News	1	None	None	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"When John Roberts came before the Senate in 2005 for confirmation as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, many scribes penned encomiums to this undeniably conservative, but seemingly eminently reasonable and restrained judge. Writing in the New Yorker, Hendrick Hertzberg expressed concerns about Roberts views once he reached the high court. But he also allowed that Roberts was ""not, it appears, a hater; nor is he even a particularly rigid ideologue. Unlike Justices Scalia and Thomas, Roberts does not project a sense of resentful beleaguerment.""Roberts, of course, worked assiduously to cultivate that image, famously insisting during his opening remarks before the Senate that he was merely an umpire calling balls and strikes and enforcing the rules of the game, not making them up. Then-Senator Biden did point out to Roberts that different umps had different strike zones and it was fair to ask Roberts a little bit about what his was. Roberts, an evidently highly intelligent and polished man, sailed through those hearings.All of this, mind you, was obvious BS even at the time, to anyone paying attention. As I wrote during the confirmation hearings:""Roberts' career is characterized not so much by a generalized fealty to judicial restraint, but to a highly selective version thereof, one that consistently favors powerful interests over the less advantaged and that appears consistently to advance the preferred conservative agenda of the day. According to [a report by the Alliance for Justice]: ""one can discern that Judge Roberts holds a troublingly limited view of the federal government's authority to enact key worker, civil rights and environmental safeguards and a similarly troublingly narrow view of the vital role of our courts and our government play in safeguarding our individual rights, especially civil and women's rights....these views, taken together, could produce a government with less power to protect ordinary people and give ordinary people less power to protect themselves from abuse by government and other powerful interests.""This is, of course, precisely who Roberts has turned out to be. In order to arrive at yesterday's opinion, which the seasoned legal observer Paul Campos described as a ""travesty... of basic legal reasoning,"" Roberts had to create a new legal doctrine out of whole cloth. The Chief Justice insisted that the portions of the Voting Rights Act struck down yesterday violated the ""fundamental principle of equal sovereignty of the states."" The eminent jurist Richard Posner responded by saying ""this is a principle of constitutional law of which I have never heard"" because, in fact, ""there is no such principle.""As many have pointed out, now is an especially disturbing time to claim that, because we have made so much progress over the past half century, proven mechanisms for ensuring voting rights are no longer necessary. In fact, over the past few years, we have seen a new war on voting pushed by right-wing activists and legislators all over the country. The transparently dishonest justification for these laws is the need to rein in voter fraud and ensure the integrity of the voting process. Voter fraud, of the sort that defenders of these new laws insist must be stopped is, as has been well-established, virtually non-existent. On the eve of last year's presidential election, John McCain's former campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, described voter fraud claims as ""bogus"" and part of the Republican Party's ""mythology."" The actual purpose of such legislation is, of course, to make it much more difficult for African Americans and other less favored groups of people to vote -- because when they do, they vote overwhelmingly Democratic. Sometimes, those pushing these laws are honest about their motives. When Pennsylvania passed a particularly problematic voter ID law last year, the House Majority leader of the Pennsylvania House, Mike Turzai, didn't declare triumphantly that Pennsylvania could now ensure integrity in its elections. Instead, to wild cheers from his cronies, he thundered that the legislation had just successfully delivered the state to Mitt Romney (much of the law was later tossed out and, of course, Romney did not win Pennsylvania). In fact, the toner cartridge was barely dry on Roberts' execrable opinion yesterday when several states announced that previously blocked voter suppression laws would go into force immediately, including in Texas -- where hundreds of thousands of voters might now be adversely affected -- and Mississippi.Writing in the Nation, Ari Berman rightly denounced the Court's right-wing majority in a post yesterday titled, ""What the Supreme Court doesn't understand about the Voting Rights Act."" And in the piece itself, Berman quoted from Justice Ginsburg's dissent -- ""The sad irony of today's decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven so effective."" The sentiments are understandable -- and in Ginsburg's case, perhaps professionally prudent -- but the premises are wrong. The right-wing majority understands precisely how the VRA has been effective. That is why they gutted it. There is no misunderstanding, no well-intentioned but misguided application of the law. They are neither dumb nor naïve. They are merely without conscience. When Chief Justice Roberts extolled the progress of the past fifty years in justifying his decision to try to undermine that progress, the irony should have been lost on no one, since the conservative movement has worked ceaselessly to try to roll back and reverse that progress. (Remember Trent Lott, former Senate Majority leader, lamenting in 2002 how much better things would have been if Strom Thurmond's vision of a segregated America had prevailed?)As Adam Serwer wrote yesterday, Roberts has worked hard to avoid being painted with that brush. Serwer reminded readers that during oral arguments in February in the Shelby v. Holder case -- the one the Court ruled on -- Scalia blurted out that the Voting Rights Act represented the ""perpetuation of racial entitlement."" One needs to step back for a moment to appreciate just how extraordinary and revealing that statement was. Roberts himself appears to have been a determined opponent of the VRA since he was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department in the early 1980s (so much for his claim that the long passage of time now provides a justification for gutting the law). But Roberts doesn't project an air of ""resentful beleaguerment."" And just as it's become a favored trick of the contemporary right to pretend to admire Martin Luther King while trying to undermine everything he stood for, so the clever and cunning Roberts knew enough in his Shelby opinion to pretend to extol the virtues of a law he has long wanted to bury. He's tried to put a ""moderate"" face on what has been a consistently extremist agenda, but it's that agenda, including rolling back civil rights protections to the maximum possible extent -- that animates Roberts and his cronies' jurisprudence (and see Rick Hasen's discussion about why Roberts thought it might be politically prudent to hold off on killing affirmative action for the time being). Emily Bazelon, in Slate, described Roberts as a ""stealth conservative"" who has successfully concealed his political agenda. That gig should have been up before he ever reached the high court. But yesterday should have removed the last shred of doubt. Roberts is a Stepford judge -- the tip of the spear of the conservative movement's three decade long march through the judiciary -- a robotic ideologue ceaselessly committed to undermining legal protections for the vulnerable while further stacking the deck in favor of the already-powerful. There's no principle here -- no respect for judicial restraint, or original intent or limited government or any of the other nonsense by which right-wingers try to defend their judicial ""philosophy."" Only a remorseless attack on common decency for the sake of enriching and empowering their ideological allies."

Still, he has attempted to add his own touches to the bill, such as stripping it of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The most recent amendment would touch on the equally contentious issue of whether would-be voters should be required to show identification to prove their citizenship before registering to vote.The Supreme Court ruled earlier Monday that states cannot require people to prove their U.S. citizenship before using a federal voter registration system.UPDATE: 6:30 p.m. -- Sen.

It passed the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee on a party-line vote, with majority Democrats in support.""This bill goes to the heart of economic security,"" testified Mitch Seaman of the California Labor Federation. ""For workers, the minimum wage is all that's keeping you from sinking further down as the economy moves on without you.""Eighteen states have a minimum wage above the federal level of $7.25 an hour, led by Washington at $9.19 an hour and then Oregon at $8.95. Ten of those states provide for annual, inflation-adjusted increases.California's wage ranks fifth-highest in the country and also trails the minimum required in Vermont and Nevada, although employers in Nevada can pay $1 an hour less than their state's $8.25 minimum if they provide health insurance benefits to workers.The California bill, which now advances to the Assembly floor, would raise the minimum wage to $8.25 in 2014, $8.75 in 2015 and $9.25 in 2016. Each year after, it would go up based on the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index.The bill is opposed by all the state's major employer organizations, including the California Restaurant Association, Western Growers Association, California Grocers Association and state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Businesses.Another opponent, the California Chamber of Commerce, has placed the bill on its annual ""job killer"" list, which includes legislation it most aggressively seeks to defeat.Matt Sutton of the restaurant association said an increase in the minimum wage would benefit only its employees who earn tips, as the added cost would force operators to hold down wages for hourly employees to absorb the mandated increases for tipped workers.""A minimum-wage increase is going to do nothing but harm my business,"" testified Joe Thompson, a Sacramento restaurant operator.Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas, the bill's author, countered that no evidence shows that higher minimum wages have done economic harm in Oregon or in San Francisco, which has a citywide minimum of $10.24.""There's been no adverse impact to jobs,"" he said.Alejo said the state's failure to increase its minimum wage for six years has led communities to begin taking matters into their own hands.

In certain corners of the foreign policy community, two theories in particular have developed. The first is that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice was promised the position of secretary of state only to have it taken away under the weight of Republican opposition. The second is that Obama never actually considered Rice for the post, instead, having her name floated to divert fire for his preferred choice, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). The former theory is regarded as more plausible than the latter. But the latter still has its believers. Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation, pushed the theory in a blog post published on The Huffington Post on Tuesday arguing that former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod admitted that Rice was never considered during a recent interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe. It is possible that Axelrod saw his remarks as a way to protect the president from any lingering criticism over his handling of the Rice issue. There had, after all, been some undercurrent of discontent among women's groups who were upset over Rice's public humiliation. Also, the very visible scuttling of Rice did suggest to many observers that, despite Obama's reelection, Obama was once again showing how he caves into Republicans under a barrage of partisan attacks.But Axelrod never actually said that Obama didn't consider Rice for Foggy Bottom; in fact, in interviews during the process and as recently as today, he has said that Rice was very much in the mix. As he recounts, Obama surveyed a number of possible candidates, including Rice. He never came to a decision on who to appoint until he ultimately chose Kerry. The attacks on the U.N. ambassador over her role in disseminating talking points about the consulate attack in Benghazi factored into the administration's thinking. But they weren't disqualifying. If anything, Axelrod said, they made the president more sympathetic towards choosing her. ""There is a myth that has grown up that the president was run off from choosing her,"" Axelrod told The Huffington Post Tuesday. ""That just wasn't true. She was highly regarded and considered for the post.""""So far as my conversations with him and everything I know, he had never made a decision on that particular appointment and it is a misstatement of history to suggest he had chosen her or never considered her,"" he added. ""Kerry always was a strong candidate for that position.""  "

Donald Trump was reportedly booed off the stage at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, according to various reports and attendees. The 66-year-old businessman attended the April 6 event as an inductee into the organization's 2013 Hall of Fame. He was introduced by WWE CEO Vince McMahon, a longtime friend of the ""Celebrity Apprentice"" creator. According to Bleacher Report, McMahon said Trump has helped the WWE and would have made a great U.S. president, but even this endorsement wasn't enough to quell the audience. “Donald will soon find out this is a very partisan crowd,"" McMahon said in response to the booing. Later adding, “You’re not even going to let him come out here before you boo him?”When Trump appeared, the heckling only continued. ""Trump was booed for most of his speech and eventually cut it short after the abuse,"" according to a Wrestling Online recap. His son was also apparently booed, but his daughter, Ivanka, was not. ""Trump noted that at least there is a member of the Trump family that the MSG crowd liked!"" Others noted the negative response. But Trump himself seemed unfazed by the incident. On Sunday he posted a cheery tweet that made no mention of his icy reception from WWE fans. Prior to Saturday, Trump had expressed excitement about the event being held in Manhattan. “I’ve always enjoyed and respected WWE’s brand of entertainment and look forward to the ceremony in my hometown at Madison Square Garden,” the Chairman and President of The Trump Organization said in a statement released by the WWE ahead of the ceremony. Jim Varsallone of the Miami Herald was disappointed by the audience's behavior and penned an op-ed defending the would-be conservative pundit. ""How about Donald Trump,"" he wrote Monday. ""Long before others did, The Don lauded Mr. McMahon’s vision ... and instead of thanking him or just watching quietly, you heckle him.""And this isn't the first time Trump has faced a disgruntled crowd. He was booed by members of the press at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, which he attended as a guest of the Washington Post. "

A new Dove campaign says yes -- and offers proof, in the form of forensic sketches. Dove recruited seven women of different ages and backgrounds and had FBI-trained forensic artist Gil Zamora create composite sketches of them based on descriptions of their own facial features. In the above video, produced for the campaign, you can hear the women use phrases like ""my mom told me I had a big jaw,"" ""I kind of have a fat, rounder face,"" ""I'd say I have a pretty big forehead."" ""We really weren't sure what was going on,"" Kela Cabrales, a 40-year-old technology teacher and digital artist who appears in the video, told HuffPost Women. ""They asked me to describe myself and use neutral terms and 'just the facts' sort of descriptions."" Earlier in the day, the women had been asked to spend time with strangers, though neither party was told why. These strangers were later brought one by one into a room with Zamora and asked to describe the women who had been sketched earlier. The two resulting drawings of each woman were then hung side-by-side -- and the contrast is pretty stark. The tagline of the campaign is: ""You are more beautiful than you think."" (Scroll down for more of the sketches.)It's worth noting that Dove is owned by Unilever -- the same company that owns Axe, king of misogynistic ads that use headless breasts and ""flirty girls"" to hawk its products. However, despite the obvious commercial intentions behind this campaign, the message rings true and is a refreshing departure from the many female-targeted ads that try to shame women into buying things.And it's women's existing shame that the Dove campaign does a good job of exposing through its sketches. ""I probably beat myself up way more than I should,"" Cabrales acknowledged to HuffPost Women. ""I see my 8-year-old daughter, and she’s so happy and confident, and naturally exudes this beauty. And when I see her I feel like, 'Oh god, what pitfalls did I fall into, and how can I keep that from happening to her?' I don’t know what they are -- I wish I did. I really want to protect her.""

18515	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/sexless-marriage_n_3869506.html	other	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"By Laura Seldon for GalTimeSex is one of those topics we’re all constantly thinking about, reading about, and even acting out… but not necessarily talking about. Sure, you’ll dish to your friends about the steamy sex session you had with your new man last night, but you won’t necessarily be so eager to share when your sex life goes from consistent to non-existent. And yet, several studies have been revealing for the last decade that a dry spell in the bedroom is actually common among couples. Is a lack of sex the one thing our conversations are lacking?“It is very common for couples to go through sexual dry spells,” says Rabbi Ed Weinsberg, EdD. “It's estimated that this process begins for most couples anywhere from two to ten years after they get married.”Defining a sexual dry spell, though, can be as difficult as dealing with the problem itself. One of my favorite scenes from the 1977 film ""Annie Hall"" features Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) talking to a therapist about their sex life. When the therapist asks how often they have sex, Alvy answers, “Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.” Annie, however, answers this way: “Constantly. I'd say three times a week.”“The disparity is normal,” says Rabbi Weinsberg, author of two books on sexuality after illnesses, including ""Conquer Prostate Cancer: How Medicine, Faith, Love and Sex Can Renew Your Life."" “Going through a sexual dry spell is fairly subjective.” Just as we all have different likes and dislikes when it comes to sex, we all have a different take on how often we should be having sex as well. “There is no one ‘right’ amount of sex that a couple should be having,” says Jodi Lipper, co-author of ""How to Love Like a Hot Chick"". “For some married couples, normal is having sex every day. For others, it might be having sex once a month.”Wondering if you and your partner are going through a sexual dry spell? Start by asking if both of your needs are being met. If your answer is no, then you may be facing a sexual drought. “It’s not enough when one or both partners is unsatisfied, or feels that his or her needs aren’t being met,” says Lipper. Her advice to couples in a sexless relationship? Talk it out with an open mind to determine the cause of the problem before you take drastic steps. In other words, share your sexual needs and wants before you demand that you and your partner either get it on, or get divorced!“Sometimes a decrease in sexual activity in a relationship represents a manifestation of other problems,” explains Dr. Alexis Conason, a clinical psychologist in New York City. “It is important to understand why the couple has stopped, or decreased, having sex before we can diagnose a sexless period as problematic or not.” In other words, talking about your lack of sex could turn up a simple cause for what seems like a major problem. Before you give up on your sex life, Dr. Conason suggests asking yourself the following questions:Have you stopped having sex because one partner is furious at the other? Is one partner having an affair? Are there medical issues that interfere with sexual functioning or desire? Is one or both partners overwhelmed with childcare responsibilities? Is one or both partners overwhelmed with career stress? Was there ever a time when you were having more sex with your partner? Or has the relationship always been sexless?Discussing these questions may seem like a daunting task, but it’s vital to the health of your relationship. “That hot and heavy sex that may have brought you together is not what is going to sustain the relationship,” explains Dr. Lisa Bahar, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Dana Point, Calif. “Now is the time to build intimacy on a deeper level, which requires awareness and a willingness to be curious about your partner in new ways that create spontaneous intimacy.” And spontaneous intimacy, my friends, is what leads to sexual intimacy… i.e. the opposite of a sexual dry spell!The bottom line is that a lack of sex is an indicator of a greater problem. If you can’t remember the last time you had sex, make a list of all the obstacles holding you back from doing the deed –- like work stress, a lack of time, etc. –- and then work to find solutions to those obstacles, like trading massages with your partner to help relieve work stress, or planning a Saturday “staycation” in your bedroom to make time for an all-day shag. However, the most important step to finding your happy ending (pun intended) is to open up and talk to your partner about what’s really going on. You’ll hopefully go from “We need to talk” to “Less talk, more action!” in no time at all.More from GalTime.com5 Ways to Make Bad Sex Better Why You Should Hold Marriage Meetings 3 Biggest Mistakes Women Make in the Bedroom 6 Things Women Do to Push Men AwayLaura Seldon is a writer and journalist living in Los Angeles.

The Coast Guard was called. Onlookers remained at a distance for safety. And the answer surprised everyone. As first reported by the Florida Keys Keynoter, it turns out the bright orange, 20-foot long, missile-shaped object was a $570,000 Air Force drone that had been shot down during a training mission in January -- 800 miles away, near Tyndall Air Force base in the Florida Panhandle. ""As soon as we heard, we had people on the way,"" Lt. Col. Lance Wilkins, commander of Tyndall's 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron, told the Keynoter, explaining that the Air Force would repair and reuse the drone. According to an official fact sheet, the BQM-167 drone is ""a high-performance, remotely-controlled subscale aerial target used to provide a threat-representative target drone to support the Air-to-Air Weapon System Evaluation Program and other Air Force and Department of Defense air-to-air test and evaluation programs.""NBC News reports that Tyndall airmen have launched BQM-167s about 600 times since 2007, according to Wilkins, initially losing 16 of them at sea. Of the missing, nine were later recovered. The others, like the Keys drone, presumably slipped into currents in the Gulf of Mexico and headed to sea. ""You would think that they would have awesome beacon tracking or at least GPS enabled on the thing,"" Roger Grimes, one the boaters who radioed the Coast Guard, told the Keynoter. And who can blame South Floridians for being cautious? In 2011, a live Navy mine washed ashore in Miami Beach, causing the bomb squad to evacuate the sand.A month later, a Miami Gardens family found a live grenade in their backyard.UPDATE, Friday noon: Lt. Col. Lance Wilkins, commander of Tyndall's 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron, told HuffPost that the drones used for live fire exercises -- including the one that floated to the Keys -- are equipped with a tracking beacon. But batteries don't last forever, he said, and the drone's GPS can be ""thwacked"" out of service when struck by an anti-drone practice missile traveling at several thousand miles per hour. Though boats are pre-positioned to retrieve the drones after an exercise, weather doesn't always cooperate with a safe recovery. ""For us to recover these we have to have weather that is acceptable risk,"" Wilkins said, ""because we have to put a diver in the water to hook up the drone and get it on the back of the boat.""Wilkins told HuffPost the Air Force has been using the types of drones launched for live fire exercises since the 1950s, and his unit will attempt to retrieve a fallen drone three days in a row before damage from prolonged exposure usually sinks them.

Baker and Lisa RichwineAug 20 (Reuters) - New cable network Al Jazeera America introduced itself to viewers on Tuesday with reports on political strife in Egypt and the impact of climate change on U.S. cities, shortly after a major pay TV distributor declined to carry the channel.The decision by AT&T's U-verse pay-TV service stemmed from a contract dispute over terms to carry the new network, AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said. Al Jazeera responded by suing AT&T for breach of contract in Delaware Chancery Court.Globally, Al Jazeera is seen in more than 260 million homes in 130 countries. But the new U.S. channel funded by the emir of Qatar has so far had difficulty getting distributors, in part because Al Jazeera was perceived by some as being anti-American during the Iraq war.Before AT&T's announcement, Al Jazeera America said it would be available in more than 40 million homes, about 40 percent of U.S. pay TV households and roughly half the reach of Time Warner Inc's CNN. U-verse was launched in 2006 and had 5 million video customers at the end of June in markets such as Texas and California.""We could not reach an agreement with the owner that we believed provided value for our customers and our business,"" AT&T spokesman Siegel said.Al Jazeera America said in a statement AT&T had ""unilaterally"" deleted the network and ""presented us with circumstances that were untenable - an affiliate that has willfully and knowingly breached its contractual obligations.""The network said it had ""no choice"" but to file a lawsuit over the matter.Defining the new channel's mission clearly will be crucial for Al Jazeera to gain a foothold in the United States, according to advertisers, executives and industry experts.In its first hour at midafternoon, Al Jazeera pledged to cover ""issues that matter to America and the world beyond."" Anchors said they would provide in-depth coverage of stories ignored by other media outlets, with bureaus in cities they considered underserved such as Nashville and Detroit.Al Jazeera America hired ABC news veteran Kate O'Brian to be its president and hired on-air talent like CNN veterans Ali Velshi and Soledad O'Brien.Its news coverage kicked off with reports on Egypt, a Georgia elementary school shooting and wildfires in the western United States, topics covered by cable news competitors on Tuesday. Al Jazeera America also reported on a hunger strike by inmates protesting conditions in California prisons and Kodak's plan to rebound from bankruptcy.It turned to sports with an interview of retired slugger Gary Sheffield about baseball's steroids scandal. A show called ""Inside Story"" explored the impact of climate change on U.S. cities and working conditions in Bangladeshi factories.Audience ratings data were not yet available. COVERAGE DESCRIBED AS BALANCEDMedia critic Howard Kurtz, speaking on rival Fox News Channel, said Al Jazeera America's early coverage was ""not much different, at least so far, than what you might see on Fox News, CNN or MSNBC."" One top story on Egypt was ""right down the middle"" in terms of balance, he said.The network is airing six minutes of commercials per hour, below the 15 to 16 minute average on other cable news outlets. Executives indicated they are willing to lose money in the near term.Advertisers on Tuesday included Procter & Gamble Co's Gillette for its Fusion razors and phone service provider Vonage .U-verse is the second TV provider after Time Warner Cable to drop the network since it acquired Current TV in January and replaced it with Al Jazeera America. Comcast, DirecTV, Dish and Verizon are carrying the network.Merrill Brown, a former media executive who helped launch cable news network MSNBC, said Al Jazeera America may need to pay distributors if it wants to reach more viewers, particularly since it is not owned by a media conglomerate that can package it with other channels to gain leverage in negotiations.""It's hard to believe they are going to get this thing nationally distributed without paying for carriage,"" Brown said.

Environmental Resources Management has conflicts of interest that should have prevented it from winning the contract for the analysis of the controversial pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Sierra Club has said. The group filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the State Department seeking documents that would show how Environmental Resources Management was chosen. Sierra Club provided some of the documents it received to The Huffington Post.But the documents do not indicate that the State Department conducted its own investigation into the company's ties to pipeline operator TransCanada before approving it to produce the analysis. Environmental Resources Management's draft supplemental environmental analysis, released in March, recommended changes to the pipeline route, but declared the project would have ""no significant impacts to most resources."" The Obama administration's decision on the pipeline is expected sometime early next year. Included in the documents Sierra Club obtained is a memo from a State Department staffer to Kerri-Ann Jones, assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, that recommends Environmental Resources Management for the pipeline contract. ""ERM is the only candidate that has not worked for TransCanada or its subsidiaries of affiliates, nor has ERM been a third-party contractor on any reviews of TransCanada projects,"" the memo says. The documents include signed forms from ERM and TransCanada affirming that they had not previously worked together, as well as talking points for government staff to use answering press questions about potential conflicts of interest.""The most alarming thing is the documents that aren't there,"" said Doug Hayes, a staff attorney at Sierra Club. ""So far they've sent us a bunch of documents, and none of them demonstrate that State Department did any independent inquiry into ERM's conflict of interest.""If State Department officials had looked, they may have found reasons to reject ERM, Hayes said. After ERM's analysis was released, Mother Jones revealed that a key ERM staffer on the project had previously done work for TransCanada, and that two other contractors had done work for ANR Pipeline, a TransCanada subsidiary. Still other ERM employees had worked for companies that would benefit from the pipeline. The biographies of those ERM staffers had been removed from materials the State Department released with the draft environmental impact statement. Mother Jones reported on the potential conflicts earlier this year after obtaining the version of the biographies before they were redacted by the State Department. Environmental groups seized on those connections, arguing that they should have prevented ERM from getting the contract. They also argued that ERM had not been transparent about this previous work for TransCanada in its disclosure form. The State Department's Office of Inspector General is now looking into those allegations. The inspector general's report, delayed by the government shutdown, will not be ready until late-February 2014, spokesman Douglas Welty told The Huffington Post.The department's first environmental analysis for the pipeline was conducted by Cardo Entrix, a company whose previous work for TransCanada prompted environmental groups to complain of conflicts of interest. That led to an investigation by the State Department's inspector general, which found no evidence that TransCanada had ""improperly influenced"" State's selection of the contractor and no actual conflict of interest in hiring Cardno Entrix. But the report dinged the department for failing to independently evaluate the contractor's claim that it had no conflicts and for ""accepting them at face value.""Sierra Club's FOIA request sought records related to State's approval of ERM for the second study to see what, if anything, the department did differently in evaluating potential conflicts of interest for the new environmental study. ""It looks like State Department did exactly what they did last time, which is take ERM and TransCanada's statements at face value and not do any independent evaluation,"" Hayes said.In response to questions about the documents, a State Department official said the department doesn't believe there was a conflict of interest in selecting ERM. ""No Environmental Resources Management (ERM) employees working on the review have worked for TransCanada,"" said the official. ""Our rigorous conflict of interest procedures are designed to ensure that no contractors or subcontractors have financial or other interests in the outcome of a project.""The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Interior both have submitted comments critical of ERM's study. The EPA said the study included ""insufficient information"" about several environmental concerns.Another document released in response to the FOIA request is a State Department press guidance from of Aug. 3, 2012. It includes this paragraph as a suggested response to reporters' questions about whether ERM had worked with TransCanada before:No, ERM has neither worked directly for TransCanada before, nor has it worked as a third-party contractor for a federal agency reviewing a TransCanada project. This is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada.The FOIA includes another version of the press guidance dated three days later. That document removes the line that says this ""is also true for subsidiaries of TransCanada."" Ross Hammond, a senior campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the removal of that line raises more questions about any potential relationships between ERM and TransCanada, and what the State Department knew about them. Hammond said the information that has come out about ties between the contractors and TransCanada should also raises questions about the Keystone report that ERM wrote. ""There's no reason that anyone should have any confidence -- particularly the president, who will be making the decision on this pipeline -- that what they put in this report is true,"" said Hammond."

18656	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-ferguson/hillary-clinton-documentary_b_4014792.html	Opinion	0	None	None	Neutral	Negative	huffingtonpost.com	"In late 2012, CNN Films approached me about directing a documentary. We discussed a number of potential subjects, and eventually settled on Hillary Rodham Clinton. The film would be ambitious, controversial, and highly visible. But I felt that it was important, that I was qualified to do it, and that I could be fair. CNN gave me complete control (""final cut"") over the theatrical version, and a generous budget.And then the fun began. The day after the contract was signed, I received a message from Nick Merrill, Hillary Clinton's press secretary. He already knew about the film, and clearly had a source within CNN. He interrogated me; at first I answered, but eventually I stopped. When I requested an off-the-record, private conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Merrill replied that she was busy writing her book, and not speaking to the media.Next came Phillipe Reines, Hillary Clinton's media fixer, who contacted various people at CNN, interrogated them, and expressed concern about alleged conflicts of interest generated because my film was a for-profit endeavor (as nearly all documentaries and news organizations are). When I contacted him, he declined to speak with me. He then repeated his allegations to Politico, which published them.CNN and I decided to publicly confirm the film project to clear the air. Immediately afterwards, the chairman of the Republican National Committee announced that the Republicans would boycott CNN with regard to the Republican presidential primary debates in 2016. Shortly afterwards, the entire RNC voted to endorse this position. This did not surprise me. What did surprise me was that, quietly and privately, prominent Democrats made it known both to CNN and to me that they weren't delighted with the film, either.Next came David Brock, who published an open letter on his highly partisan Democratic website Media Matters, in which he endorsed the Republican National Committee's position, repeating Reines' conflict of interest allegations and suggesting that my documentary would revive old, discredited Clinton scandal stories. Coming from Mr. Brock, this was rather amusing. David Brock began life as an ultraconservative ""investigative journalist,"" quotation marks very much intended, spreading scandal with little regard for truth. He first attracted attention with The Real Anita Hill, his nasty (and factually wrong) hatchet job on the woman who, during Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings, said that Thomas had sexually harassed her. Years later, he apologized and switched to the Democrats.When Brock published his letter about my film, I got in touch with several prominent Democrats who knew Hillary Clinton. I told them that this campaign against the film and against CNN was counterproductive. They conveyed this message to Mrs. Clinton personally, along with my request to speak with her. The answer that came back was, basically, over my dead body.None of this deterred or even greatly bothered me. I flew to New York and had a two hour meeting with CNN's President Jeff Zucker and his senior staff. They were great. They asked me how I was holding up -- I said fine. They pledged their support, expressed dismay that things were so nasty, and told me to go forth and make my film. I did so.In June, I attended a dinner for Bill Clinton, which was educational. Clinton spoke passionately about his foundation, about African wildlife, inequality, childhood obesity, and much else with enormous factual command, emotion, and rhetorical power. But he and I also spoke privately. I asked him about the financial crisis. He paused and then became even more soulful, thoughtful, passionate, and articulate. And then he proceeded to tell me the most amazing lies I've heard in quite a while.For example, Mr. Clinton sorrowfully lamented his inability to stop the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which banned all regulation of private (OTC) derivatives trading, and thereby greatly worsened the crisis. Mr. Clinton said that he and Larry Summers had argued with Alan Greenspan, but couldn't budge him, and then Congress passed the law by a veto-proof supermajority, tying his hands. Well, actually, the reason that the law passed by that overwhelming margin was because of the Clinton Administration's strong advocacy, including Congressional testimony by Larry Summers and harsh public and private attacks on advocates of regulation by Summers and Robert Rubin.Wow, I thought, this guy is a really good actor. And I also saw one reason why Hillary Clinton might not be thrilled about my movie. I discovered others. In Arkansas, she joined the boards of Walmart and Tyson Foods. One of the largest donors to the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is the government of Saudi Arabia. The Clintons' personal net worth now probably exceeds $200 million, and while earned legally, both the money's sources and the Clintons' public statements indicate a strong aversion to rocking boats or making powerful enemies.It was not always thus. When Bill Clinton became President, he and Hillary initially attempted courageous reforms: allowing gays to serve in the military, a carbon tax, health care reform. But they got their heads handed to them: Colin Powell went on television telling America that if gays served in the military, morale would suffer. And the Clintons also learned about money, because back then they had none. When they were mercilessly hounded by Kenneth Starr and Congressional Republicans, culminating in impeachment, their legal bills soared and the Clintons fell many millions of dollars into debt. (To be sure, Bill Clinton poured gasoline on the fire by lying.) It is very clear that the Clintons then decided never to be at anyone's mercy again. And since Bill Clinton first became Governor of Arkansas, the cost of Presidential campaigns has gone from $66 million (both parties combined, in 1976) to an estimated $5 billion for 2016, when Hillary will run. So more than ever, the Clintons need money and the people who supply it.I would have loved to explore all this. But when I approached people for interviews, I discovered that nobody, and I mean nobody, was interested in helping me make this film. Not Democrats, not Republicans -- and certainly nobody who works with the Clintons, wants access to the Clintons, or dreams of a position in a Hillary Clinton administration. Not even journalists who want access, which can easily be taken away. I even sensed potential difficulty in licensing archival footage from CBN (Pat Robertson) and from Fox. After approaching well over a hundred people, only two persons who had ever dealt with Mrs. Clinton would agree to an on-camera interview, and I suspected that even they would back out.This, of course, was the real consequence, and probably the real intent, of the announcements by the RNC, Philippe Reines, and David Brock. Neither political party wanted the film made. After painful reflection, I decided that I couldn't make a film of which I would be proud. And so I'm cancelling. (Not because of any pressure from CNN -- quite the contrary.) It's a victory for the Clintons, and for the money machines that both political parties have now become. But I don't think that it's a victory for the media, or for the American people. I still believe that Mrs. Clinton has many virtues including great intelligence, fortitude, and a deep commitment to bettering the lives of women and children worldwide. But this is not her finest hour."

Federal judge Kimba Wood officiated at the non-denominational wedding, which was attended by members of the couple's families, including the groom's five children, a source familiar with the wedding told Reuters on Saturday.For Soros, whose net worth is $20 billion according to Forbes, this will be his third marriage. It is Bolton's second.Soros put a Graff wedding band on Bolton's finger during the half-hour ceremony, according to the source.The exchange of vows will be followed by a reception, which begins at 4:30 p.m, with more than 500 guests at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, the Westchester County complex known for its Italian Renaissance-inspired buildings and lush gardens.Among the guests at the various events are World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and some foreign leaders, including Hendrik Toomas Ilves, president of Estonia; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia; and Edi Rama, prime minister of Albania.Also expected to attend are fellow titans of the hedge fund world, Paul Tudor Jones and Julian Robertson. From the U.S. political realm those invited include Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, both Democrats.On Friday night, the couple held a reception for 300 guests at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan for a preview of the new exhibition of works by Belgian painter Rene Magritte - ""Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938.""The honeymoon plans were not immediately disclosed.Soros, who established one of the first hedge funds in 1969 and is probably best known for famously betting against the British pound in 1992, met Bolton at a dinner party in 2008. Their engagement was announced in August 2012.Bolton, who was raised in California, is the daughter of a nurse and a retired naval officer. She graduated from the University of Utah and holds an MBA from the University of Miami.Bolton has been a consultant and entrepreneur working in the fields of health and education. She started an Internet-based dietary supplement and vitamin sales company, and her most recent project was advising on development of a web-based yoga education platform.The bride's dress was designed by U.S.-based, Lebanon-born Reem Acra, whose gowns have been worn on the red carpet by many stars, including Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Lopez.The reception on Saturday night will feature Hungarian composer and conductor Iván Fischer, a family friend, who created a new arrangement for the occasion.

THE FIRST LADY: We know how busy this time of year is for everyone, so we’re not going to take much of your time. But we did want to take a moment to wish you all a Merry Christmas, from our family to yours. THE PRESIDENT: This is a season for millions of Americans to be together with family, to continue long-held holiday traditions, and to show our gratitude to those we love. And along the way, some of us might even watch a little basketball or eat some Christmas cookies, too. THE FIRST LADY: Here at the White House, over the past few weeks, we’ve had about 70,000 people from all across the country come visit us and look at our holiday decorations.  This year’s theme was “Gather Around: Stories of the Season.” And in every room of the house, we tried to tell a story about who we are as Americans and how we celebrate the holidays together.  And we made certain to highlight some of the most powerful stories we know – the stories of our outstanding troops, veterans, and military families and their service and sacrifice for our country. THE PRESIDENT: Our extraordinary men and women in uniform are serving so that the rest of us can enjoy the blessings we cherish during the holidays. But that means many of our troops are far from home and far from family. They’re spending some extra time on the phone with their loved ones back home. Or they’re setting up video chats so they can watch as the presents are opened. So today, we want all of our troops to know that you’re in our thoughts and prayers this holiday season. And here’s the good news: For many of our troops and newest veterans, this might be the first time in years that they’ve been with their families on Christmas. In fact, with the Iraq war over and the transition in Afghanistan, fewer of our men and women in uniform are deployed in harm’s way than at any time in the last decade. THE FIRST LADY: And that’s something we all can be thankful for. And with more and more of our troops back here at home, now it’s our turn to serve – it’s our turn to step up and show our gratitude for the military families who have given us so much.  And that’s why Jill Biden and I started our Joining Forces initiative – to rally all Americans to support our military families in ways large and small.  And again and again, we have been overwhelmed by the response we’ve gotten as folks from across the country have found new ways to give back to these families through their schools, businesses, and houses of worship. THE PRESIDENT: That’s the same spirit of giving that connects all of us during the holidays. So many people all across the country are helping out at soup kitchens, buying gifts for children in need, or organizing food or clothing drives for their neighbors. For families like ours, that service is a chance to celebrate the birth of Christ and live out what He taught us – to love our neighbors as we would ourselves; to feed the hungry and look after the sick; to be our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper. And for all of us as Americans, regardless of our faith, those are values that can drive us to be better parents and friends, better neighbors and better citizens. THE FIRST LADY: So as we look to the New Year, let’s pledge ourselves to living out those values by reaching out and lifting up those in our communities who could use a hand up.  THE PRESIDENT: So Merry Christmas, everyone. And from the two of us, as well as Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo… THE FIRST LADY: And Sunny, the newest Obama. THE PRESIDENT: We wish you all a blessed and safe holiday season.  THE FIRST LADY: Happy holidays everybody, and God bless.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released his birth certificate on Sunday in an effort to curb speculation that he is ineligible to run for president. The document, published by the Dallas Morning News, confirms that Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta to an American mother, immediately making Cruz a citizen of both the United States and Canada. As the Morning News points out, that means Cruz could run for office in Canada unless he later decided to renounce his Canadian citizenship. However, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier denied the senator's dual citizenship. “Senator Cruz became a U.S. citizen at birth, and he never had to go through a naturalization process after birth to become a U.S. citizen,” Frazier said. “To our knowledge, he never had Canadian citizenship, so there is nothing to renounce.” Cruz, first elected to the Senate last fall, has sparked early presidential speculation by making visits to key primary states like Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire. He's also courted Republican donors at GOP functions in New York City and his home state of Texas.Under the U.S. constitution, only ""natural born"" citizens are eligible to run for president. While this definition includes individuals born overseas to an American parent -- like Cruz -- some have continued to raise questions about the freshman senator's eligibility for office if he chooses to run in 2016. During an appearance on ABC's ""This Week"" earlier this month, business mogul and unapologetic skeptic of President Barack Obama's birth certificate Donald Trump suggested that Cruz was ""perhaps not"" allowed to run for higher office.""I don't know the circumstances.

The singer was joined by the United States Marine Band.Clarkson's performance came with its own backstory. In December 2011, Clarkson endorsed Republican Ron Paul, citing his ""refreshing"" small-government views. The singer -- who describes herself as ""a Republican at heart"" -- then said she would vote for Obama ""again"" after he announced his support for gay marriage. The ""American Idol"" alum counts Sen. Chuck Schumer among her Washington fans. Schumer, the chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, praised the singer in an appearance on HuffPost Live.""I felt very good about myself, because I listened to her and I said, 'I really like her,' and then only later did I learn she had won 'American Idol,'"" Schumer said. ""So I was very glad that my tastes were the same as most of America's.""On Monday, Schumer responded to Clarkson's performance with just one word: ""Wow!"" Here's what Clarkson had to say for herself:  A host of other musicians and singers were spotted at events surrounding the actual inauguration. Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder and Usher were among those who scored inauguration weekend gigs.One of the President's favorite genres was celebrated at the Hip-Hop Inaugural Ball, where rappers 2 Chainz and MC Lyte and singer John Legend were honored at the Sunday night event. Their speeches were far better received than an impromptu one by rapper Lupe Fiasco, who was reportedly pulled from the stage after an anti-Obama rant of sorts at the StartUp RockOn concert.Four years ago, Aretha Franklin sang ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee"" and The United States Navy Band ""Sea Chanters"" chorus performed ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

They will no longer have to jump the traditional hurdle of 60 votes, which has increasingly proven a barrier to confirmation during the Obama administration.Reid opened debate in the morning by saying that it has become ""so, so very obvious"" that the Senate is broken and in need of rules reform. He rolled through a series of statistics intended to demonstrate that the level of obstruction under President Barack Obama outpaced any historical precedent. Half the nominees filibustered in the history of the United States were blocked by Republicans during the Obama administration; of 23 district court nominees filibustered in U.S. history, 20 were Obama's nominees; and even judges that have broad bipartisan support have had to wait nearly 100 days longer, on average, than President George W. Bush's nominees. ""It's time to change before this institution becomes obsolete,"" Reid said, before citing scripture -- ""One must not break his word"" -- in accusing Minority Leader McConnell (R-Ky.) of breaking his promise to work in a more bipartisan fashion.McConnell responded to Reid by changing the subject to the Affordable Care Act and accusing Democrats of trying to distract Americans from the law's troubled rollout. Getting around to fidelity, McConnell noted that Reid had said in July that ""we're not touching judges,"" yet he was now choosing to do so. Reid casually brushed off his suit coat and sat down. McConnell compared the alleged duplicity to another Democratic piece of rhetoric. ""If you like the rules of the Senate, you can keep them,"" he quipped, as the GOP side laughed heartily, which encouraged a pleased McConnell to turn directly to his colleagues and repeat the joke. He then turned to the Democratic side and said he understood why inexperienced young members who'd never been in the minority might want to change the rules. ""The rest of you guys in the conference should know better,"" he said. Obstruction, McConnell said, began with the Democrats when they decided to filibuster Circuit Court nominees under Bush. ""They made it up. They started it,"" he said, arguing that Republicans were only following their lead. His argument, though, raises the question of why eliminating the filibuster on such judges, if it was never used before 2000, should be seen as an historic development in the first place.""Stop trying to jam us,"" McConnell said, warning that it would come back to haunt them. ""You may regret it a lot sooner than you think."" Normally rules changes in the Senate need 67 votes, but the majority can challenge an existing rule, and if the presiding senator rules against the challenge, the majority can then ask for a vote on the chair's ruling. If a simple majority votes to overrule the chair, it sets a new precedent.Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) broke with their party and joined Republicans in opposing the move. Pryor is in an uphill reelection contest, which may explain his vote, but Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Mark Begich (D-Alaska), who are also top GOP targets in 2014, backed the rules change.Levin, a Senate traditionalist, has long been the most outspoken opponent of rules reform, and led a successful effort to stymie the movement earlier this year. Manchin, meanwhile, has great reverence for the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), a fierce champion of Senate tradition, likely explaining his vote. (Byrd did make several attempts to change the rules himself when he served as majority leader.)Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who has long been skeptical of changing the rules, cast a critical vote very late in the process supporting the move. That left Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a recent convert to reform, to cast the 51st vote, with Reid casting the 52nd.The move marks a significant win for the newer crop of Democrats -- like Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the lead proponent of going nuclear -- who have grown increasingly frustrated as McConnell expertly employed parliamentary procedures to stall Democratic nominees and initiatives. Sens. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) have also been longtime champions of filibuster reform, with Harkin's effort dating back more than two decades.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who chaired the Judiciary Committee back when it was Democrats trying to stall Bush's nominees, echoed McConnell, suggesting newer Democrats such as Merkley, who have never been in the minority, were not taking the long view.""They're -- I want to say this the right way -- they're rustling their inexperienced feathers,"" Hatch said, calling the historic move a ""charade just to try and get off Obamacare.""""It's raw power that they're exercising, that, like I say, is a very dangerous thing for them to do,"" Hatch said. ""They're going to rue the day they do it.""But Merkley disagreed, arguing the reform is ""about clearing the decks of the Senate so we can actually spend time on legislation, we can actually address the cost of college, actually have job-creation bills on the floor, that we can address issues related to retirement security.""""I feel great,"" Merkley said. ""Since I came here in 2009, I've been absolutely appalled by the dysfunction of this body."""

That's up from 43 percent in December 2012, during the last fiscal standoff. The figure is the first time a majority thought Republican control was bad for the country since CNN started asking in December 2010. Sixty-three percent of respondents want Boehner replaced, but by another Republican, which would not change GOP control of the House.The poll is yet another sign that the government shutdown has hurt the Republican party. An NBC/WSJ poll taken during the shutdown showed that 24 percent of people approved of the party, a record low. Gallup measured another record low for the GOP, with 28 percent approving. A poll released Sunday funded by Moveon.org and conducted by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling showed that incumbent Republicans trailed generic Democrats in 15 of 25 competitive House districts.Congress as a whole has a measly 12 percent approval rating, while 86 percent disapprove, according to the CNN/ORC International poll. President Barack Obama received a 44 percent approval rating, while 52 percent said they disapprove -- a number virtually unchanged since June. Forty-four percent are more confident that Obama can handle problems facing the U.S., versus 31 percent who said they think Republicans can. Twenty-one percent said they were confident in neither.

But the argument did not justify letting its lawsuit proceed, he wrote.Wednesday's decision upheld a November 2011 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.James Dabney, a lawyer for Already, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nor did Nike.Wednesday's decision may help companies such as Nike rival Adidas SE and luxury goods makers Coach Inc and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, which often sue to prevent alleged imitators from interfering with their revenue streams and customer goodwill.The case began in 2009, when Nike claimed in a lawsuit that Already's Sugar and Soulja Boy shoes infringed Nike's trademark on the stitching, eyelet panels and other features of Air Force 1. Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, launched the low-cut Air Force 1 sneaker in 1982 and sells millions of them each year.After Already countersued to void the trademark, Nike dropped its lawsuit, believing Yums was not a commercial threat, and gave a promise in the form of a covenant not to sue Already.But Already, based in Arlington, Texas, refused to drop its own case and accused Nike of dropping the original lawsuit to deprive courts of jurisdiction. DOROTHY'S RUBY SLIPPERSRoberts, however, said that allowing Already's lawsuit to continue would encourage large and small companies to use litigation as a ""weapon"" rather than as a last resort to settle disputes, which could discourage innovation.""Accepting Already's theory may benefit the small competitor in this case,"" he said. ""But lowering the gates for one party lowers the gates for all. As a result, larger companies with more resources will have standing to challenge the intellectual property portfolios of their more humble rivals - not because they are threatened by any particular patent or trademark, but simply because they are competitors in the same market.""Roberts also agreed with Nike that Already was unlikely to produce any shoe that would not be protected.""If such a shoe exists, the parties have not pointed to it, there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it, and we cannot conceive of it,"" Roberts wrote. ""It sits, as far as we can tell, on a shelf between Dorothy's ruby slippers and Perseus' winged sandals.""Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred in the decision, saying that other companies should not assume they can automatically end rivals' trademark cases with covenants similar to Nike's.Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor joined Kennedy's concurrence.Two companies with well-known trademarks, clothing maker Levi Strauss & Co and automaker Volkswagen AG, filed briefs supporting Nike.The case is Already LLC v. Nike Inc, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 11-982."

And already, the President is offering some clues.During a stop in Georgia Thursday, where he pushed his education agenda, President Obama hinted that one of his daughters -- most likely the eldest, 14-year-old Malia -- is officially dating.""I do have to warn the parents who are here, who still have young kids, they grow up to be, like five feet 10 inches. And even if they're still nice to you, they basically don't have a lot of time for you during the weekends,"" he told the crowd. ""They have sleepovers and dates. So all that early investment just leaves them to go away,"" he said.A White House official declined Yahoo.com's request for comment and clarification on the president's remark, but it's safe to say that First Boyfriend watch is officially in effect.In an interview with People magazine last month, the Obamas talked about the influence their marriage will have on their daughter's inevitable relationships with boys. ""The great thing about the girls is they've got a wonderful role model in their mom. They've seen how Michelle and I interact — not only the love but also respect that I show to their mom. So I think they have pretty high expectations about how relationships should be, and that gives me some confidence about the future,"" Obama said.Case in point: The romantic Valentine's date the president said he and Michelle had planned last night.""She made me promise to get back in time for our date tonight. That's important,"" Obama said during his Georgia stop, ""I've already got a gift, got the flowers,"" he went on to say.During their father's second term, Sasha, 11, who arrived in the White House as a second-grader, moves on to middle school while Malia begins the many adventures of your average teen.""Michelle is very good about making sure that we're creating a space for them where they can have sleepovers. They can go to the mall. They can go to the movies. They're going to homecomings at their school,"" Barack noted in an interview with radio host Ryan Seacrest last year. But don't expect to see much about it in the media. According to White House officials, the unwritten rule guiding news coverage of the girls still stands.In the meantime, we can only speculate on who Malia Obama's dates will be.

Bush Presidential Center, a museum and library that contains the historic bric-a-brac of President George W. Bush's White House, is being dedicated today. In keeping with arcane traditions, all of the living presidents of these United States are in attendance to fete the occasion. Speeches have been made, songs sung, pleasantries exchanged, and now all you need to do is Google ""What time does the George W. Bush Presidential Center open on Saturday?"" to proceed with the next step in your lives.I've not been paying very close attention to the celebration, other than to passively absorb the cable teevee coverage, which all seems to be coming straight from the lips of Dr. Pangloss to my captive ears. (A summary: Gatherings of presidents are neat-o! Look at them! They all seem to be great pals! Everyone is being so nice to President Bush. Nice things are nice!) But scrolling around the web, I now see that I should have paid more attention, because according to The New York Times' Peter Baker, President Barack Obama faced a very ""delicate task"" at this ceremony. Which surprises me, because as near as I can tell, the George W. Bush Presidential Center is not, say, testing nuclear weapons or promising war with South Korea or threatening to destabilize an entire region. (Though I guess the day is young.)Per Baker, here's why this library opening is actually a perilous moment for the Obama White House:It has become an awkward ritual of the modern presidency that the current occupant of the Oval Office is called upon to deliver a generous historical judgment of the previous one. With the opening of each new presidential library, the members of the world’s most exclusive fraternity put aside partisan differences to honor the shared experience of running the nation in difficult times.The task in such moments is especially acute when, as with Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, the current and previous presidents come from opposing parties and such different sensibilities. The incumbent must hit grace notes without appearing inconsistent with past criticism or, worse, hypocritical. Sometimes a president goes through the motions, dutifully reading what aides put before him. Other times, library dedications have become bonding moments when presidents genuinely grow closer.See, the problem facing Obama is that in key moments of his life as a politician, he has publicly assessed the Bush legacy as, you know, less than ideal. And now he has to stand in front of Bush at a big celebration and not issue a series of policy indictments. Awkward, right?At least one person Baker has talked to thinks that the policies on which Bush and Obama agree are the thornier ones:“He’s never going to say this,” [former Bush speechwriter Marc] Thiessen said, “but if he’s being totally honest, he would say that except for interrogations, he adopted almost the entire Bush counterterrorism policy, some of it voluntarily, some of it involuntarily, but most of it voluntarily.”Ha, well, Thiessen is absolutely right that Obama has pretty much continued the bulk of Bush's counterterrorism policies and ""unitary executive"" outlook -- and even expanded upon them. I'm bewildered, though, as to why anyone should expect this to come up at a museum dedication. ""Yo, where my fans of targeted extrajudicial killings at? Can I get a what-what?"" doesn't seem like a sentiment Obama is likely to offer, though I suppose it would ""make news.""And that's really the point, actually. If Baker was willing to be dead honest with his readers about the ""delicate task,"" he wouldn't couch his piece in all this gauze and mummery. He'd simply say, ""The media is going to scrutinize every detail of Obama's brief speech looking for gaffes and 'tells,' which we will then stretch into one-day stories.""That's really what this is about. Baker's piece is basically a warning that it's up to Obama to keep this non-event from becoming a pseudo-event. Obama has to navigate this little bit of oratory without seeming insincere in his remarks, or saying anything that a pundit-necromancer can spin into a dig, or doing anything funny with his gestures. Because what Baker means to say is that reporters are lying in wait to analyze his body language and pore over his word choice to divine dire meanings in preparation for articles titled, ""Obama did not use the word 'freedom'"" or ""Obama's hip-hop library dedication did not create jobs.""And what if Obama fails? This is the extraordinary thing, actually. Unlike every other ""delicate task"" that Obama could fail at this day or this week or this year, should Obama's Bush library speech be deemed less-than-satisfactory, the result will be a hot sack of nothing at all. No one's lives will be affected by anything that happens at this library today. There aren't merely low stakes, there are no stakes.I don't know why it's so hard to just admit this. Anyone who really thinks that this library opening is some sort of perilous moment for any of the attendees or speakers needs to get out more.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

Some of the administration's proposals — including mandatory background checks and an assault weapons ban — will will have to go through Congress.Joe Scarborough joined Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC after Obama's speech on Wednesday. He criticized Republicans for being what he said was out of touch with Americans, an assertion he has made before, as well as the NRA. He laid out what he saw as the GOP's two choices in the House of Representatives. ""They can either pass a comprehensive gun control package right now and shape it under Speaker Boehner, or they can wait two years when they lose the majority and have Nancy Pelosi write that bill,"" Scarborough said. ""There are no other choices."" He went on to hammer Republicans for living in an ""echo chamber"" for the past year. Scarborough issued the same warning to his party immediately after the Newtown shooting. In December, he said ""we will lose"" if Republicans continued to defend Glocks and Bushmasters."

Most people don't choose to be on food stamps. Most people want a job,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) ""Most people want to go out and be productive so that they can earn a living, so that they can support a family, so that they can have hope for a more prosperous future. They want what we want.""While most proponents of the bill similarly argued that they were just promoting work, there was also an undercurrent of accusation that many Americans are abusing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to sponge off taxpayers.""If you're a healthy adult and don't have someone relying on you to care for them, you ought to earn the benefits you receive,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.). ""Look for work. Start job training to improve your skills or do community service. But you can no longer sit on your couch or ride a surfboard like Jason in California and expect the federal taxpayer to feed you.""That would be Jason Greenslate, the California food stamp recipient who likes to surf and play rock music but not look for work. Fox News profiled him last month in a segment that said America has been on an epic ""food stamp binge."" The network made sure everyone in Congress saw the segment.The House vote sets up a showdown with the Democratic-controlled Senate, which previously approved a much more modest reduction in food stamp spending as part of a broader bill that included agricultural subsidies. A traditional ""farm bill"" likewise combining the two issues failed in the House during the summer, at which point House Republicans set nutrition aside and passed a bill with just the agribusiness subsidies. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) almost seemed desperate to get the measure passed, noting that it was only part of the process of passing the normally noncontroversial farm bill.""I admit to you, this has been an unusual process. But it remains my goal to get a five-year farm bill enacted. I'm doing everything possible to make sure that happens this year,"" Lucas said, emphasizing the ""everything.""Before the earlier attempt to pass a farm bill failed, Lucas had worked hard to accommodate conservatives by allowing an amendment that made the food stamp provisions harsher. Nearly all of them voted against the bill anyway, and the amendment cost Democratic supporters.""We have a responsibility to get this done, and quite simply, and I repeat, quite simply, it shouldn't be this hard to pass a bill that ensures all of us in this economy has enough to eat,"" Lucas said. ""And that's what a farm bill does.""Members from each chamber will have to reconcile the differences between their separate pieces of legislation in a conference committee this fall. The White House has repeatedly said it would veto the House GOP's food stamp demands. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the House legislation would deny benefits to 3.8 million Americans next year and save $39 billion over 10 years, or roughly 5 percent of the SNAP program's cost in that time. Enrollment doubled to 47 million in the wake of the Great Recession as incomes plummeted and more Americans qualified for benefits, which average $133 per month. Most beneficiaries are children, elderly or disabled.The bill is packed with changes to SNAP: It would require more beneficiaries to pass income and asset tests to prove their poverty. It would allow states to require drug tests. It would allow states to deny benefits to able-bodied adults who don't work or enroll in training for at least 20 hours per week.""Work is not a penalty,"" Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) said, citing the Book of Genesis. ""Work is a blessing.""Regardless of what President Obama ultimately signs into law, benefits will drop for all SNAP beneficiaries in November after the expiration of a 13 percent benefits increase that had been granted by the 2009 stimulus bill. Democrats called the House measure a useless assault on the poor.""Today's exercise is nothing more than a waste of our time and an insult to every American in need,"" said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio). ""The fact that we are considering this legislation makes me question whether the Republican leadership even wants a farm bill.""She added that the bill ""guts nutrition for those most in need and says to the poor, to hungry children, to the disabled, seniors and our veterans, 'You don't matter, you are not worthy of our help.' They deserve better.""Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) asked Lucas if he would try to spare veterans from the cuts in the probable conference committee, saying they deserve special support ""in these economic times."" Lucas argued that veterans were already protected.However, a recent Huffington Post review of military records found military families rely on more than $100 million in food stamps a year. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated that 170,000 veterans would feel the pinch from the bill."
18806	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/06/jodi-arias-verdict-prediction_n_2855214.html	News	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"PHOENIX -- For more than four months, they listened to endless hours of testimony in the case of State of Arizona v. Jodi Arias. On Friday, the lawyers and witnesses finally stopped talking, and the case was turned over to the 12 jurors.Now it is up to those dozen men and women -- some in their 20s, others well into retirement age -- to determine Arias' level of guilt or innocence. YOU BE THE 13TH JUROR: How Would You Vote?As to which side, defense or prosecution, did a more persuasive job, the jury may have already tipped its hand. On days 28 and 29 of the trial, jurors submitted more than 100 questions to Arias that suggested they were skeptical of her testimony, delivered over two highly emotional weeks. Arizona is one of only three states that allow jurors to ask witnesses questions. Panel members submit their queries to the judge, who reads them to the witnesses.In her testimony, Arias gave highly detailed descriptions of her sex life with Travis Alexander, the former boyfriend she killed. She claimed that he became increasingly demanding and abusive, and that she feared for her life. The prosecution argued that she murdered Alexander in a jealous rage.One juror asked, ""After all the lies you have told, why should we believe you now?"" Indeed, Arias changed her story several times. At first, she vehemently denied any involvement in the death of Alexander, whose body was discovered June 9, 2008, at his Mesa, Ariz., home. Alexander had been shot in the head and stabbed 27 times. His throat had been cut from ear to ear. When DNA proved Arias had been there, she then claimed that she and Alexander had been attacked by two masked killers in a home invasion. She said she didn't go to the police because she was still in fear of them.It was not until years after his death that she admitted to killing Alexander in what she said was an act of self-defense.""Lying isn't typically something I just do,"" Arias told the court. ""The lies I've told in this case can be tied directly back to either protecting Travis' reputation or my involvement in his death ... because I was very ashamed.""The defense team has attacked Alexander's character in an attempt to show he was a sex-obsessed womanizer who masturbated to photos of little boys. Although accusations of abuse and pedophilia can prove detrimental, the defense in this case has one problem: All such allegations came from one source -- Arias, an admitted liar who is on trial for her life. The prosecutors seemed to have an easier time. Although they did not have a murder weapon, they did have a motive, contending Arias was consumed with jealousy, and they had Arias' confession to the slaying. For a first-degree murder charge to stick, however, jurors will have to conclude that she acted with premeditation. The defense had to try to explain why someone acting in self-defense would stab her assailant multiple times, shoot him and cut his throat. That challenge was compounded by the fact that Arias claimed memory loss covering much of the day that Alexander was killed.The prosecution, meanwhile, argued that she made attempts to clean up the crime scene and disposed of the handgun used in the shooting.Other issues likely to come up in the jury room:THE CUTS: There were cuts on Arias' fingers. She said she nicked herself at work when she broke a glass. Prosecutors alleged those lacerations came while knifing Alexander. A blood-covered knife typically becomes slippery and slides through the hand of the person wielding it, often resulting in wounds. THE FINGER: Arias had a broken and disfigured finger. She said it happened months prior to Alexander's death and was a result of his physical abuse. Prosecutors allege she hurt herself during the killing, and that's why the injury is not visible in photos shown to the jurors that were taken after she claimed the injury occurred. GAS CANS: Arias took two gas cans with her and purchased a third when she went on her final road trip to visit Alexander. Arias testified the cans were a precautionary measure, so she would not run out of fuel while traveling through the desert. Prosecutors said she had them so she would not have to make fuel purchases that could tie her to the area. Arias said she returned one can to Walmart and received a cash refund without a receipt. Prosecutors said the exchange never occurred and presented a Walmart employee who testified there was no record of the transaction. THE GUN: Prior to Alexander's killing, a .25-caliber handgun was stolen from Arias' grandparents' home. Alexander was killed with a .25-caliber firearm, but Arias claimed it was Alexander's own gun, despite the lack of evidence that he had ever owned a firearm.What is bizarre about some of Arias' claims is that they are irrelevant in the grand scheme. Once she admitted she had killed Alexander, why argue about some of these little things? In the case of her finger, Arias' version of events was an attempt to show prior domestic abuse, but it might have served her better if she had played it differently. As for the gas can, what was the point in saying she'd returned one and then being contradicted by a witness? It is all these details that Arias has woven into her story that could ultimately be her undoing.Although the prosecution appears to be ahead, anything is possible. Prosecutors must prove their case, after all. Many trial watchers were convinced Casey Anthony would be found guilty of murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, but the jury held otherwise.Nothing is certain until the moment the verdict is read, and in a death penalty case such as this, it could take a jury several days to weigh each factor.YOU BE THE 13TH JUROR: How Would You Vote?"

""There are no readouts from big meetings he has with people from the outside, and many of them aren't even on his schedule. This is different from every president I covered. This White House goes to extreme lengths to keep the press away.""The awkwardness between the Obama administration and the White House press is nothing new -- this past summer, for instance, reporters blanched at White House attempts to edit a press pool report. But the latest fracas -- over the lack of access to a golf game that Obama played with Tiger Woods on Sunday -- has brought the journalists' anger out into the open again. Obama eventually had a brief off the record conversation with reporters on Monday night but, judging by Compton's comments, journalists see a deeper issue.Ed Henry, the White House correspondent for Fox News who is also president of the White House Correspondents' Association, made the rounds on Monday to defend the press corps' indignation at being kept from covering the game. He told HuffPost's Michael Calderone on Monday night that the protest was about having a ""minimal level"" of access to Obama, not about a desire to watch him play golf.Two people who see a tempest in a teapot? Henry's Fox News colleagues Bill O'Reilly and Charles Krauthammer. The anchor and pundit dismissed Henry's objections during a conversation on Monday.""It is a trivial issue,"" Krauthammer said. ""The guy wants to play golf. The guy deserves a couple of days off. He wants privacy. Big deal. This is -- this is the biggest non-media, non-story that the media have created since the Kardashian weddings.""""The press being banned from covering his leisure activities, you don't care?"" O'Reilly asked.""Absolutely not,"" Krauthammer said. ""You want to watch him shank and slice?""""I'm kind of with you on this, I don't care,"" O'Reilly said.Watch the O'Reilly conversation:"

18842	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/prison-overcrowding_n_4235691.html	News	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	America’s federal prisons are in trouble.They’re so crowded they’re endangering the lives of inmates and corrections officers, the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Charles Samuels Jr., testified at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. And the immense cost of confining so many people is draining vital resources from from other public safety endeavors, including investigations and prosecutions.Politicians across the political spectrum, from Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to Rand Paul (R-Ky.), increasingly agree that something has to be done. Now, a report from the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank for social and economic policy research, examines a host of specific suggestions, including several proposals awaiting a vote in Congress.The study, released this week, concludes that the federal government could save billions and significantly ease the overcrowding crisis by adopting strategies that include cutting fixed sentences for drug offenses in half, retroactively applying a law that lessens the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences, and offering early-release credits to inmates who participate in programs designed to keep them from committing new crimes after they're released.“The current situation with respect to the prison system is unsustainable,” said Julie Samuels, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center and one of the authors of the report (no relation to the prisons director). “I think what we’ve tried to do is lay out the array of options that we have to change that.”Not everyone agrees that it’s in the country’s best interests to pursue these options. At the Senate hearing where the prisons chief spoke, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a former U.S. attorney, attributed the dramatic reduction of violent crimes over the last three decades to the growth of the prison population. The more murderers and rapists “you have in jail, the fewer murders and rapes you are going to have,” he said. “That’s just a fact.”But supporters of prison reform argue that it’s possible to reduce overcrowding without compromising public safety. Below are 10 key proposals examined by the Urban Institute and how they may help save money and empty prison beds over the next decade.1. Send fewer people to prison for drug crimes.The problem: There are 219,000 inmates in the federal prisons system -- compared with 25,000 in 1980. About half are there for drug offenses.The fix: In a major speech in August, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would try to ensure that fewer people spend years behind bars for non-violent drug crimes, in part by directing prosecutors to bring fewer drug cases to federal court.Potential savings: If prosecutors and judges send 20 percent fewer drug offenders to prison, the federal government would save $1.29 billion and the prisons would save 125,000 “bed years.” (A bed year is a year’s worth of prison time for one person.) 2. Allow drug offenders to serve shorter sentences.  The problem: Why are so many people locked up for drug crimes? The answer has a lot to do with federal mandatory-minimum sentencing laws. Under one law, judges are required to sentence drug offenders to prison terms ranging from 5 years to 20 years, depending on the type and quantity of the drug. Before this 1986 law, one-quarter of all federal drug offenders were fined or sentenced to probation, the study notes. Today, 95 percent end up behind bars.The fix: A recent bill introduced by Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) in the Senate, and an identical proposal unveiled last week by Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), among others, would cut the length of those mandatory prison sentences in half.Potential savings: The report concludes that this reform would have “a monumental effect,” saving the government $2.49 billion over 10 years while reducing overcrowding to “its lowest level in decades.”3. Give judges greater discretion over sentencing.  The problem: Even under the current law, judges don’t always have to subject defendants to minimum sentences. A judge can deviate from this protocol, but only if the defendant has been convicted of a nonviolent drug crime and has a very clean criminal record.The fix: The bill introduced by Durbin, Lee, and Leahy would expand this “safety valve” to include drug offenders with slightly greater criminal histories who pose little danger to the public.Potential savings: 53,000 bed years, $544 million.4. Give judges even greater discretion.  The problem: That “safety valve” only applies to drug offenders, not to people who face mandatory minimum sentences for offenses that have nothing to do with drugs, like some white-collar crimes.The fix: Create a new “safety valve” that could be offered to everyone facing a mandatory minimum sentence.Potential savings: 81,000 bed years, $835 million.5. Lower the “truth-in-sentencing” requirement.The problem: Current law says that everyone in the federal prison system must serve at least 85 percent of the time to which he or she is sentenced, known as the “truth-in-sentencing” requirement.The fix: Require offenders instead to serve 70 percent of their sentences.Potential savings: 150,000 bed years, $1.55 billion.6. Make sure that people aren’t disproportionately punished for using crack instead of powder cocaine. The problem: A sentencing law passed in the 1980s dictated that that people caught dealing or posessing crack would go to prison for much longer than people caught with powder cocaine. Many criminal justice advocates have argued that this law essentially targeted blacks, since crack is cheaper than powder cocaine and more popular among low-income people. Carl Hart, an associate professor of neuroscience at Columbia University and an expert on illegal drugs, writes that “there are no pharmacological differences between crack and powder cocaine to justify their differential treatment under the law.”The fix: The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 decreased the disparity between crack and powder cocaine punishments for anyone sentenced after the law was passed. By applying this law retroactively, to people now serving crack-related prison time, the government would extend its benefits to people who were sentenced before the law was adopted.Potential savings: 22,000 bed years, $229 million.7. Allow more prisoners to reduce their sentences through credit for good behavior.  The problem: Many federal prisoners are eligible to get months or years chopped off of their sentences, but only if they participate in a particular drug treatment program.The fix: Expand the number of rehabilitation programs that offer credits toward early release for those who participate. (This option also offers the benefit of providing more inmates with skills that could help them stay out of trouble after they’re released.)Potential savings: 22,000 bed years, $224 million.8. Give prisoners a full year off their sentences for participation in a drug rehabilitation program.The problem: Federal prisoners who graduate from the system’s main drug program are supposed to get a full year off their sentences. But thanks to overcrowding, the line to get into the program is so long that many offenders have less than a year of their sentences left by the time they graduate.The fix: Expand the program so that every graduate receives a full year off his or her sentence.Potential savings: 880 bed years, $9.1 million.9. Release more elderly prisoners from Bureau of Prisons custody. The problem: After the age of 55, people who are released from prison are highly unlikely to commit new crimes, according to many studies. Yet 17,400 people in federal prisons are older than 55, according to the report.The fix: Release some of them before their sentences are up. (The report assumed that fewer than half would be promising candidates.)Potential savings: 700 bed years, $7.8 million.10: Send more foreign inmates back to their home countries.The problem: 54,200 federal prisoners aren’t U.S. citizens.The fix: Streamline the “international transfer” program so that twice as many prisoners are sent to prisons in their home countries.Potential savings: 670 bed years, $6.9 million.

A new Dove campaign says yes -- and offers proof, in the form of forensic sketches. Dove recruited seven women of different ages and backgrounds and had FBI-trained forensic artist Gil Zamora create composite sketches of them based on descriptions of their own facial features. In the above video, produced for the campaign, you can hear the women use phrases like ""my mom told me I had a big jaw,"" ""I kind of have a fat, rounder face,"" ""I'd say I have a pretty big forehead."" ""We really weren't sure what was going on,"" Kela Cabrales, a 40-year-old technology teacher and digital artist who appears in the video, told HuffPost Women. ""They asked me to describe myself and use neutral terms and 'just the facts' sort of descriptions."" Earlier in the day, the women had been asked to spend time with strangers, though neither party was told why. These strangers were later brought one by one into a room with Zamora and asked to describe the women who had been sketched earlier. The two resulting drawings of each woman were then hung side-by-side -- and the contrast is pretty stark. The tagline of the campaign is: ""You are more beautiful than you think."" (Scroll down for more of the sketches.)It's worth noting that Dove is owned by Unilever -- the same company that owns Axe, king of misogynistic ads that use headless breasts and ""flirty girls"" to hawk its products. However, despite the obvious commercial intentions behind this campaign, the message rings true and is a refreshing departure from the many female-targeted ads that try to shame women into buying things.And it's women's existing shame that the Dove campaign does a good job of exposing through its sketches. ""I probably beat myself up way more than I should,"" Cabrales acknowledged to HuffPost Women. ""I see my 8-year-old daughter, and she’s so happy and confident, and naturally exudes this beauty. And when I see her I feel like, 'Oh god, what pitfalls did I fall into, and how can I keep that from happening to her?' I don’t know what they are -- I wish I did. I really want to protect her.""

We're working hard to reduce the deficit, not expand it. The Administration does not support blowing up planets. Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a Death Star with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship?Shawcross did take the opportunity to explain what is being done already, instead of the government spending the the estimated $852 quadrillion (in case you were wondering what the above number was) to build the ultimate planet-destroying machine.There's the International Space Station (which doesn't destroy planets). There's the two rovers on Mars (""one wielding a laser""). Oh yeah, here's the president wielding a light saber!

As a result, I have created such a list here, using the opinions that I have heard from tens of thousands of men during my years working as a matchmaker. The fact is, if you are a woman and you want to get married, you need to be smart about your dating. This means avoiding certain male types, but it also means recognizing what you are doing wrong in your dating and whether the type of woman you are putting out there to the male population attracts or repels them. To figure this out, you can start by considering the list below and whether you, at times, are any of these quite unattractive female types:Miss ""Bossy Pants"": This woman usually can't help herself; she has bossy in her DNA. When a man first meets her, he might think this character trait is cute, for awhile. However, once he starts to feel like he is in grammar school being told what to do by his second grade teacher, he will give this woman her walking papers.Miss ""Playing Games With His Heart"": This woman thinks that being a game player will help her land a man. However, even though a man might be intrigued by a hard to get lady in the beginning, as soon as he decides that he is interested in her, all he wants is an honest straightshooter. If this woman doesn't remove Battleship from her repertoire quite quickly, she will be shown the door before she can even sink his vessel. Miss ""I Want To Change You"": This woman is lurking everywhere. She is the type of woman many men are the most leery of. (Of course, there are some men who love this woman because of their own insecurities.) She claims that she loves her guy just the way he is, but little by little, she chips away at just about everything about him. First, it's his wardrobe, then it's his taste in music. However, when she gets to his friends and his hobbies, she is usually kicked to the curb.Miss ""Suspiciously Jealous"": This woman is on edge all the time because she is very distrusting. Many times, she has been burnt in the past, so she is on guard for anything that looks or feels wrong. When a man first meets this woman, he sees her as a damsel in distress and wants to reassure her that he is nothing like that guy in her past. However, once she accuses him one too many times, he will have no choice to leave her because he can't go through his life being prosecuted for somebody else's crimes.Miss ""I Live For You And I Have Nothing Else Going On"": This woman is very difficult for a man to date, let alone marry. At first, he is flattered that she is so into him, but very quickly, he feels overwhelmed and suffocated by her. As a woman, you must have something going on in your own life so that you are not just waiting by the door for him to come home.Miss ""I Have Daddy Issues"": This woman usually dates older men and deep down is looking for a father figure, not a boyfriend or husband. Initially, her guy might like how she looks to him for approval and the answer to all of her questions, but soon, he realizes that he wants to have sex with a real woman, not someone who is stuck in her teen years trying to get Daddy to notice her.Miss ""I Speak To My Mother Five Times A Day About Everything"": This woman has her mother on speed dial and can't seem to make a decision or do anything without getting her opinion. When a guy first meets her, he thinks it's nice that she is so close to her family, but soon, he finds it to be way too much. A man just doesn't want to have to ask her mother's permission about things in his life.Miss ""Shhh, I Shouldn't Really Be Saying This, But..."": This woman is like a human Page Six. She loves to gossip and talk about other people and she loves to hear things about other people as well. Initially when a guy meets her, he might be entertained by her anecdotes but eventually, he begins to wonder what she is saying behind his back. Miss ""Keeping Up With The Joneses"": This woman needs to be at least as good as everyone else she knows. She is constantly talking about what the other people do and what the other people have. This places a lot of undue pressure on her guy and eventually, he justs gets fed up that she can't appreciate what they have instead of wishing she was someone else. Miss ""I Don't Eat"": This woman picks at her food, is on a never-ending diet or doesn't eat pretty much everything that most people eat. When a man first meets her, he thinks to himself, at least she will never become overweight, but eventually he realizes that it's no fun to eat alone. The fact is men like to eat; they like steak, they like trying different foods, they like dessert and women should be eating too, at least sometimes. Keep in mind that most men just want a happy and easy going woman who has good values, so just focus on putting the best YOU out there.

Disputes over many social dilemmas come down to 5-4 votes, as was seen in the recently completed term on gay marriage and voting rights. A retirement decision rests with an individual justice, but history is rife with tensions between aging justices and anxious presidents. Ginsburg, the eldest justice on an ideologically divided court, was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993.Political pressure is an age-old backdrop to Supreme Court appointments, and for Ginsburg it is likely to accelerate before the November 2014 congressional elections that could alter the Democratic dominance of the Senate.Such talk is always subtle because a presidential administration never wants to be perceived to engage in politics over the judiciary given the bedrock American principle that separates the branches of government. 2012 PRESSUREBefore Obama's 2012 reelection, Harvard University law professor Randall Kennedy stirred public debate with an April 2011 essay for the New Republic urging Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer, now 74 and also appointed by Clinton, to retire to ensure a possible Republican president not fill their seats.On Wednesday, Kennedy repeated his sentiment, telling Reuters he still thinks that ""the responsible thing"" would be for Ginsburg to step down. ""It seems to me that a justice should take into account the politics surrounding confirmation and not allow (an) opportunity to fall to a Republican,"" said Kennedy, who was a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall.University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt, who has studied judicial nominations, said Wednesday he expected to see ""opinion leaders trying to shape attitudes"" among the public as well as ""efforts through back channels to increase the pressure for her to step down.""In her interview, Ginsburg referred to past liberal commentary and predicted, ""That's going to start up again.""Brushing off political calculations, she said, ""It really has to be, 'Am I equipped to do the job?' ... I was so pleased that this year I couldn't see that I was slipping in any respect."" She said she remains energized by her work as the senior liberal, a position she has held since 2010 when Justice John Paul Stevens retired, and calls being a justice ""the best job in the world for a lawyer.""She has previously said she wanted her tenure to at least match the nearly 23 years of Justice Louis Brandeis, which would get her to April 2016, and said she had a new ""model"" in Justice Stevens, who retired at age 90 after nearly 35 years on the bench.Reinforcing the message that she might not leave before her health requires it, she mused of another former colleague, ""I wonder if Sandra regrets stepping down when she did?""Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired in January 2006 at age 75 to take care of her husband, John, who had Alzheimer's disease. He died in 2009.Ginsburg, who picked up the mantle of the liberals after Stevens' departure, took the unusual step of reading three dissenting statements from the bench in the final week of the term. Dissenting justices typically issue their statements only in writing. During one of them, on June 24, the media commented on the antics of Justice Samuel Alito, who had written the majority opinion in a job discrimination case Ginsburg was protesting, Vance v. Ball State University. As she spoke, he conspicuously rolled his eyes and screwed up his face.Alito did not respond to a request for comment.Ginsburg said she was oblivious, and only learned of his behavior from her law clerks. When she read another dissenting statement from the bench the next day, ""he did not make any faces.""Was she insulted? Her answer appeared to allude to Alito's nationally televised grimace and mouthing of ""Not true"" in response to comments Obama made in his 2010 State of the Union speech about a court campaign-finance ruling.""I'm in such good company,"" said Ginsburg. ""I'm in the company of the president.""(Reporting by Joan Biskupic; Editing by Amy Stevens, Howard Goller and Prudence Crowther)"

I mean, what would prohibit you from saying that you’re gay, and y’all get married and still live as separate, but you get all the benefits? I just see so much abuse in this it’s unreal. I believe a husband and a wife should be a man and a woman, the benefits should be for a man and a woman. There is no way that this is about equality. To me, it’s all about a free ride.”It's theoretically possible that such a scenario could happen, but there isn't any evidence of widespread fraud following the adoption of gay marriage in nine states and the District of Columbia. Though fictional, the premise of the 2007 Adam Sandler movie ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" was a pair of straight firefighters getting domestic partnership status. Everhart does not note the possibility of marriage fraud among opposite-sex couples, though others have warned against marriage fraud committed in order to get immigration benefits. In reality, the number of proven cases of such fraud is extremely small.Everhart also said she could not understand how two gay people could ever have sex. ""If it was natural, they would have the equipment to have a sexual relationship,"" she told the Journal.(h/t TPM) "

But teens weren’t the only sources of inspiration from that day -- host Chelsea Clinton also had some words of wisdom to share with the young audience.While you probably know her best as President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea has made a name for herself as a special correspondent for NBC News, as well as in her efforts to speak out about the uncomfortable topic of diarrhea, which is related to 100,000 deaths in Nigeria each year. HuffPost Teen caught up with the impassioned former first daughter at TEDxTeen this past Saturday in New York. Here are five powerful pieces of advice for Generation Y we took from our conversation with her.1. Ask yourself what you can do for others.  ""When [my grandmother and parents] would ask me, 'Well, what did you do today?' part of what they implied was, 'Well, what did you do for others?' It would not have been okay at the dinner table if I just didn’t have something to say ... That was the kind of world I grew up in. And being asked those questions really often helped me to always think, 'Wow, I have a real responsibility to define my life partly through what I can do for others and what I can learn from others.' I’m grateful that they set that example.""2. You should care about the world around you.  “I think [there] is a big misconception that people who are younger are more apathetic or more disinterested or more tuned out. That’s just not true. People are more connected, feel more empowered and feel a greater responsibility for their world than ever before. And we see that in so many different ways. I mean, a greater number and a greater percentage of people than ever before volunteer on a regular basis, and they actually keep volunteering once they’re in college ... young people [also] donate small dollar amounts when there are crises, like the Haiti earthquake. So I think all of this says that young people are far from apathetic, actually feel quite engaged, and thankfully, [feel] quite empowered.”3. Do what you can.  “I think all the time, 'What can I be doing?' and then, 'What should I be doing?' ... Because if we feel like, 'Oh my gosh, we can do everything and we should do everything' -- that’s overwhelming and disempowering. So I think about the things where I can make a difference.""4. If you have a great idea, speak up.  “Let your idea out of your head. Have the courage to share your idea, whether it’s with your teacher, a friend, online -- like an online community that is already concentrated around something that you really care about. See what the reaction is, see what the response is. Hopefully that will help surface different ideas to make your idea even stronger.” 5. ""Get caught trying.""  “The best advice that my mom gave me was repeating my grandmother’s mantra: Life’s about not what happens to you, it’s about what you do with what happens to you. It really is this kind of galvanizing message in my family. [Also] 'get caught trying,' which is something that has really motivated my father’s life. It’s always better to have tried and failed than to never have tried at all.”"
18995	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/19/jay-carney-marco-rubio_n_2718110.html	News	0	None	None	SomewhatPositive	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that the Obama administration has been engaged with the offices of members of Congress working on immigration reform, despite claims from Sen. Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) staff that they have had no contact. ""We have been in contact with everybody involved in this effort on Capitol Hill,"" Carney told reporters at a briefing.A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private talks, said later Tuesday that White House staff met with the offices of the ""gang of eight"" -- including a Rubio staffer -- five times in the past few weeks. Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, said in a statement earlier on Tuesday that the senator's staff hasn't spoken to the White House on immigration, but that they didn't necessarily want to anyway. ""Senator Rubio's office has never discussed immigration policy with anyone in the White House,"" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. ""To be clear: That’s fine with us -- we actually think Congress should write the policy; not the White House. But an honest question: If the Obama Administration is serious about drafting & passing its own immigration reform, why wouldn’t they seek input from any Republicans whose support they’ll need?""USA Today obtained the White House's draft immigration legislation on Saturday, but the White House has said it was not the source of the leak. Carney repeated that assertion in the press briefing, saying it ""was not an intentional release.""There's no set timeline for when immigration reform should be completed, Carney said. Obama said in his State of the Union last week that he would like a bill passed within ""the next few months"" -- a tight timeframe when bills have not yet been introduced in the House or Senate. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said Sunday that the administration's legislation was a back-up plan and that the White House would continue to work with Rubio and others on a deal. Rubio is a member of the Senate immigration ""gang of eight,"" along with Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). The four Democratic members of the group met with Obama last week to update him on the status of the talks. But Rubio's relationship with the White House, at least publicly, has been more fraught. The senator quickly decried the draft legislation leaked on Saturday, saying in a statement that it could be damaging to the discussions going forward. “It’s a mistake for the White House to draft immigration legislation without seeking input from Republican members of Congress,"" Rubio said. ""President Obama’s leaked immigration proposal is disappointing to those of us working on a serious solution. ... If actually proposed, the president’s bill would be dead on arrival in Congress, leaving us with unsecured borders and a broken legal immigration system for years to come.""He also released a statement last week accusing the administration, and in particular Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, of seeming to try to hurt reform efforts. Napolitano testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and said border concerns should not prevent broader immigration reform. The ""gang of eight"" plan would only allow immigrants to earn green cards after certain border metrics were met, a trigger not included in the White House draft legislation, but would allow other reforms to take place immediately, including allowing provisional status for undocumented immigrants. The White House has come out strongly against a piecemeal approach that requires passing border security enforcement measures first and other immigration provisions later, but has not specifically stated it would oppose a trigger such as the one in the ""gang of eight"" framework.Rubio, though, said Napolitano should have embraced the plan if the administration was ""serious"" about reform.""Secretary Napolitano’s refusal to accept this bipartisan principle at today’s Senate hearing is discouraging for those of us who are serious about permanently fixing America’s immigration system,"" Rubio said in a statement after the committee hearing. ""By continuing to oppose a key security principle with bipartisan backing, Secretary Napolitano and this Administration appear to be laying the groundwork to scuttle the bipartisan effort in the Senate.""UPDATE: 1:55 p.m. -- Rubio spokesman Alex Conant tweeted later that the White House had met with ""gang of eight"" staff, despite his statement that they never discussed immigration policy. Rubio spokesman Alex Conant clarified further by email. ""We have never discussed immigration policy with anyone from the White House,"" he said. ""The Administration has sent some agency officials to brief staff at the bipartisan group meetings, but they've never asked for our input. (And, frankly, we've never asked for theirs.) We've never received a call or email from Cecilia Munoz or anyone else at the White House asking for our input as they draft their bill.""UPDATE: 5:10 p.m. -- President Barack Obama called Graham, McCain and Rubio later on Tuesday to discuss immigration reform, the White House announced. Flake, the fourth Republican member of the ""gang of eight,"" was unable to speak with the president because he was traveling, according to the White House. During the calls, which build on conversations that have taken place at the staff level, the President reiterated that he remains supportive of the effort underway in Congress, and that he hopes that they can produce a bill as soon as possible that reflects shared core principles on reform. The President has made clear that he believes commonsense reform needs to include strengthening border security, creating an earned path to citizenship, holding employers accountable, and streamlining legal immigration. As the President made clear when he met with Democratic Senators involved in the process last week, that while he is pleased with the progress and supportive of the effort to date, he is prepared to submit his own legislation if Congress fails to act. He thanked the Senators for their leadership, and made clear that he and his staff look forward to continuing to work together with their teams to achieve needed reform.Conant said Rubio ""appreciated"" Obama's call. ""Rubio said he feels good about ongoing negotiations in Senate,"" Conant tweeted. "

Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) attempted to attach to a water resources bill on Wednesday, which would have allowed gun owners to carry firearms into recreational areas currently off-limits. The amendment was one of two Coburn had planned to offer, although he withdrew his second earlier in the day. Areas controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- such as hundreds of the nation's lakes and thousands of campsites and miles of trails -- are gun-free zones, even if the state where the land is located allows concealed weapons. Coburn's amendment, however, would have granted precedence to state laws and permitted people to carry guns in some of these places. The Senate voted 56-43 on Coburn's amendment, failing to garner the 60 votes needed to move forward. Coburn's second amendment would have required federal agencies to account for all of their guns and ammunition, essentially creating a registry of government firearms. The push was part of a concern among some conservatives that the government may be stockpiling ammunition in order to restrict the supply available to the public. Coburn spokesman John Hart confirmed to The Huffington Post that Coburn had withdrawn his amendment, which was also scheduled for a vote. He said it was ""a goodwill gesture"" to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), one of the sponsors of the Water Resources Development Act. On Tuesday, Boxer criticized Republicans for putting forward gun amendments on her bill. The NRA's federal affairs office sent out an alert on Wednesday afternoon, urging senators to support Coburn's Army Corps of Engineers amendment. ""The National Rifle Association strongly supports this amendment,"" the email reads, with the statement in bold, underlined type. The group argued that Coburn's amendment would ""not only allow law abiding citizens to protect themselves, but relieve them from the onerous responsibility of tracking where one federal agency’s land management jurisdiction ends and another begins.""In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a bill into law that allows loaded firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges.This story has been updated to reflect the results of a Senate vote Wednesday afternoon.

Does that mean your marriage is over?Not necessarily, according to Dr. Scott Haltzman, author of ""The Secrets of Surviving Infidelity."" In fact, according to the author, ""many people will say that working through the affair made the marriage stronger than before.""""Once an affair happens you realize, 'Hey, my marriage can’t run on auto-pilot,'"" Haltzman told HuffPost Divorce via e-mail. ""Succeeding at marriage after infidelity is akin to surviving a trauma; you often never realize your strength or resiliency until it is called on. And that’s worth something!""But there are several large hurdles between the affair and post-infidelity marital bliss, beginning with telling your spouse about your indiscretions.We asked Haltzman about whether or not it's important to cop to the infidelity, and how to go about having that emotional conversation. Below, he shares his answers.Huffington Post Divorce: Should you tell your spouse if you've had an affair? Why or why not?Dr. Scott Haltzman: In most cases, you should tell your spouse you had an affair. It goes without saying that marriages are based on openness, and affairs are based on secrets. Choosing openness is a potent step toward honoring your wedding vows.  Usually by the time you’re thinking of revealing all, your mate has already begun to figure out something is wrong. By telling your partner the truth, you free him or her up from the constant wondering, “what’s going on with you?” For the person having an affair, verbalizing your actions makes the impact more real, and moves you from “what will I do when my spouse finds out,” to “what’s the next step toward resolution”?HP: Is there ever a time where you shouldn't tell your spouse that you cheated?Haltzman:  If the infidelity was in the remote past, it has no impact on your current marriage, you've done the emotional ""work"" to make sense of what led to it and took the necessary steps to prevent it from happening again, then it's not clear that the marriage will benefit from telling the truth.If there's a good likelihood the the revelation will lead to domestic violence, or threaten the life of the person you had an affair with, then it is not a good idea to be entirely truthful, although you must commit to working individually to get the marriage back on track.  HP: If you've decided to tell your spouse, how should you go about telling him or her? How many details of the affair should you reveal? Should you be completely honest?Haltzman: Your mate is about to find out that his or her world is turned inside out. Is there any right way to do it? In a word, no. But you can try. When possible, revealing an affair should take place in a home, not a park, restaurant or other public place. It's more than likely that you will unfurl a litany of emotions; your spouse should not feel constrained to control emotions by the environment.You should be direct; no matter how you phrase it, it’s going to hurt. Once you’ve revealed your news, it may take a long time to sink in. Be prepared to answer as many questions as your partner has.Once you have come clean about the affair, the general policy is “do ask, do tell.” Let your spouse decide what he or she wants to hear. Many people try to protect their spouse (and themselves) from the harsh realities by holding back hurtful details. Don’t do that. Once an affair has been revealed, the most important element in rebuilding a marriage is establishing trust. Trust is built on complete honesty.   HP: If your spouse reacts badly, how should you respond?  Haltzman: There’s no predictable reaction to finding out your spouse had an affair, and, with the exception of physical violence, no right or wrong way to react. A partner who has had an affair must be prepared for any kind of reaction when the truth is told. Your partner’s pain must be recognized and prioritized. It is important to not try to minimize your spouse’s feelings by saying such things as, “It’s not that big a deal” or, “It happened only once,"" or by comparing feelings (“I didn’t get that upset when you told me about your affair”) or invalidating the feeling (“You shouldn’t feel that way.”) Remember that all feelings are valid because they are real within your mate. Your role is to listen, try to understand, be as strong as you can be -- although it’s OK to break down if it is in sympathy with your mate. At some point the dust will settle, and then you will need to be there to help pick up the pieces.  HP: What's the most important thing to remember before having this conversation?  Haltzman: The most important thing to remember about having this conversation is that it is a beginning, not an end. Revealing the truth about an affair is a necessary first step toward moving the marriage back on track.Click through the slideshow below for reasons why men cheat, according to men.Keep in touch!

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that the Republican Party as a whole has abandoned its opposition to allowing a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Graham, a member of the group of senators negotiating immigration reform, known as the ""gang of eight,"" guessed there was a 70-30 chance legislation would be enacted.""The politics of self-deportation are behind us,"" Graham said on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" referring to a proposal advanced by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney during the 2012 campaign.""Mitt Romney's a good man. He ran in many ways a good campaign,"" Graham said. ""But it was an impractical solution. Quite frankly, it was offensive. Every corner of the Republican Party -- from libertarians to the RNC, House Republicans and the rank-and-file Republican Party member -- is now understanding there has to be an earned pathway to citizenship. That gives us leverage on immigration with our Democratic friends.""On CBS' ""Face The Nation,"" two leading members of the ""gang of eight,"" Sens.

Schumer said that legislative language is on track to be completed at the end of this week, and McCain said that the bill could go through committee and land on the Senate floor by May.Graham, however, continued to press forward with a key issue of his, calling for a ""merit-based"" guest worker program. The proposal has been a stumbling block in negotiations, according to people involved, and the outlines of the deal currently tilt more toward family reunification as the central way of handling the future flow of immigrants. Graham also said that the pathway to citizenship must be tied to certified border security. The nature of that certification could end up being central to the final agreement. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson (D), also speaking on ""Meet The Press,"" said that it was inhumane to tie a person's pathway to citizenship to uncertain and unrelated border security evaluations, but Graham insisted there would be ""no deal"" without a direct connection.

To attend a taping of TNT's ""Christmas in Washington"" yesterday, the first lady opted to wear her white embroidered J. Mendel crepe jacket -- the very same garment that caused uproar during President Obama's 2012 election. Michelle had first worn the Resort 2013 piece to the pre-Olympics Opening Ceremony reception at Buckingham Palace back in July 2012, prompting criticism for the jacket's $6,800 price tag.Mrs. O was labeled ""out of touch"" by media outlets, which cited that the average American family was making $4,284 a month, only slightly more than half the cost of FLOTUS' jacket. News sources like Fox pointed to the fact that Ann Romney, the wife of then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney, was condemned for wearing a $990 Reed Krakoff top for a television interview, asserting that a possible bias existed in Michelle's favor. Other outlets pointed to the fact that nobody seemed to be tallying the prices of the men's clothing during the presidential race. Whatever side you take in this argument, Michelle certainly risks reigniting the debate by bringing back the now-infamous jacket.

As a result, I have created such a list here, using the opinions that I have heard from tens of thousands of men during my years working as a matchmaker. The fact is, if you are a woman and you want to get married, you need to be smart about your dating. This means avoiding certain male types, but it also means recognizing what you are doing wrong in your dating and whether the type of woman you are putting out there to the male population attracts or repels them. To figure this out, you can start by considering the list below and whether you, at times, are any of these quite unattractive female types:Miss ""Bossy Pants"": This woman usually can't help herself; she has bossy in her DNA. When a man first meets her, he might think this character trait is cute, for awhile. However, once he starts to feel like he is in grammar school being told what to do by his second grade teacher, he will give this woman her walking papers.Miss ""Playing Games With His Heart"": This woman thinks that being a game player will help her land a man. However, even though a man might be intrigued by a hard to get lady in the beginning, as soon as he decides that he is interested in her, all he wants is an honest straightshooter. If this woman doesn't remove Battleship from her repertoire quite quickly, she will be shown the door before she can even sink his vessel. Miss ""I Want To Change You"": This woman is lurking everywhere. She is the type of woman many men are the most leery of. (Of course, there are some men who love this woman because of their own insecurities.) She claims that she loves her guy just the way he is, but little by little, she chips away at just about everything about him. First, it's his wardrobe, then it's his taste in music. However, when she gets to his friends and his hobbies, she is usually kicked to the curb.Miss ""Suspiciously Jealous"": This woman is on edge all the time because she is very distrusting. Many times, she has been burnt in the past, so she is on guard for anything that looks or feels wrong. When a man first meets this woman, he sees her as a damsel in distress and wants to reassure her that he is nothing like that guy in her past. However, once she accuses him one too many times, he will have no choice to leave her because he can't go through his life being prosecuted for somebody else's crimes.Miss ""I Live For You And I Have Nothing Else Going On"": This woman is very difficult for a man to date, let alone marry. At first, he is flattered that she is so into him, but very quickly, he feels overwhelmed and suffocated by her. As a woman, you must have something going on in your own life so that you are not just waiting by the door for him to come home.Miss ""I Have Daddy Issues"": This woman usually dates older men and deep down is looking for a father figure, not a boyfriend or husband. Initially, her guy might like how she looks to him for approval and the answer to all of her questions, but soon, he realizes that he wants to have sex with a real woman, not someone who is stuck in her teen years trying to get Daddy to notice her.Miss ""I Speak To My Mother Five Times A Day About Everything"": This woman has her mother on speed dial and can't seem to make a decision or do anything without getting her opinion. When a guy first meets her, he thinks it's nice that she is so close to her family, but soon, he finds it to be way too much. A man just doesn't want to have to ask her mother's permission about things in his life.Miss ""Shhh, I Shouldn't Really Be Saying This, But..."": This woman is like a human Page Six. She loves to gossip and talk about other people and she loves to hear things about other people as well. Initially when a guy meets her, he might be entertained by her anecdotes but eventually, he begins to wonder what she is saying behind his back. Miss ""Keeping Up With The Joneses"": This woman needs to be at least as good as everyone else she knows. She is constantly talking about what the other people do and what the other people have. This places a lot of undue pressure on her guy and eventually, he justs gets fed up that she can't appreciate what they have instead of wishing she was someone else. Miss ""I Don't Eat"": This woman picks at her food, is on a never-ending diet or doesn't eat pretty much everything that most people eat. When a man first meets her, he thinks to himself, at least she will never become overweight, but eventually he realizes that it's no fun to eat alone. The fact is men like to eat; they like steak, they like trying different foods, they like dessert and women should be eating too, at least sometimes. Keep in mind that most men just want a happy and easy going woman who has good values, so just focus on putting the best YOU out there.

Former Bush strategist Karl Rove said that he ""has an inner confidence ... that what he did was right.""And while Bush and some of his closest allies suggest that there is nothing about his legacy that needs defending, other sources close to the former president have suggested that the $500 million presidential library is an attempt to patch up his scarred reputation.A longtime Bush counselor told National Journal in a piece published Monday that the former president was ""confident"" he could improve his reputation.“How else could he be?"" the counselor said. ""But he’s got a ways to go to mending his record -- if it can be done."""
19225	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/02/honolulu-police--tattoo-ban_n_4206377.html	other	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"Police departments all over the country are imposing tattoo bans of various scope on their officers, but it is unclear what difference these bans make on their abilities to enforce the law.Most recently, the Honolulu Police Department announced a ban on any visible tattoos, piercings or “dental ornaments.” Existing tattoos must be covered with a long sleeve uniform or with makeup. (Yes, makeup.) The new ban raises multiple concerns. Tattoos are a huge part of Hawaii culture, Polynesian tattoos in particular. Many see tattoos not as a fashion statement but as a statement of heritage. Similar issues were raised last year when the London Metropolitan Police banned some tattoos, since a portion of their force came from Pacific islands. A Honolulu resident summed up the second problem best: “Somebody’s going to get a heat stroke,” Beverly Neely told KITV, referring to the suggestion that the officers wear long sleeve uniforms to cover their tattoos. Mark Spencer, then president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, raised the same concern when Phoenix banned tattoos in 2011. “Imagine having to wear long sleeves along with body armor, a gun belt and having to get in and out of a police car 50 times every day,” Spencer told the New York Times. The New Orleans police department is in the process of reviewing its proposed tattoo ban in light of this concern. ""As we reach temperatures close to 100 degrees on some days, it just seems like cruel and unusual punishment, just because you are proud that you served in the U.S. Navy or you put the name of your child on your arm,"" a Fraternal Order of Police spokesman said during this summer’s debate over the ban.Finally, on an island where every branch of the military has at least one base, no doubt the Honolulu PD will also face the problem of a large portion of their officers having military backgrounds. The military has a strong tattoo culture, and veterans wear their ink with pride. Retired military members provide one of the best pools from which police departments could and should recruit.“We're losing a lot of good applicants, especially veterans returning back from Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Vermont State Police Capt. David Notte said last year. Vermont is currently considering loosening its strict policies regarding tattoos in order to give themselves more recruiting options. Baltimore, Los Angeles and New York all have tattoo bans of varying degrees, and smaller departments are clearly trying to follow suit. But what effect do tattoo bans have on the success of the officers? “The absence of visible tattoos gives a more professional appearance to law enforcement officers,"" an NOPD spokesperson argued. Some officers agree, believing a tattoo-less police force will aid in their community interactions. Jeffrey Yzquierdo, who has a full-sleeve tattoo on his arm, had been with the Phoenix Police Department for 11 years when he told the New York Times that he had no problem with a tattoo ban. “Some people want nothing to do with me,” Yzquierdo said, indicating he was frustrated with the public’s negative response towards him because of his tattoos.But many police departments’ bans involve an incredible amount of bureaucracy and nitpicking that possibly takes focus away from much more important concerns. Department bans specify the size of the allowable tattoos, “no greater than 3"" X 3"" size each” and only one on each arm for new hires in Palm Beach County. (For veterans, a little leeway: “No larger than a notecard.”) In Phoenix, tattoos could not be larger than a “3x5 index card.” In departments where the ban only applies to new hires, like Des Moines, current officers had to document by photograph and report every tattoo they already had so that no new tattoo went unnoticed -- or unpunished. As Honolulu moves forward with its tattoo ban, NOPD continues to reconsider its ban. It may be one of the few departments heeding the argument that the police have bigger fish to fry. According to The Advocate, New Orleans loses an average of one police officer every three days. “I think it’s bad for the city,” Police Association of New Orleans President Mike Glasser said. “It accomplishes nothing. I don’t know if it makes for a more professional appearance, but it doesn’t make for more professional policing.”In fact, when the Des Moines Police Department banned tattoos in 2009, police union president Stewart Barnes argued that his tattoos actually helped him do his job. Then 48 years old, Barnes said his ink helped local youth relate to him. “""They come up to me and talk to me about tattoos.” "
19241	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/senate-filibuster-reform_n_4316325.html	News	1	None	None	SomewhatPositive	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) pulled the trigger Thursday, deploying a parliamentary procedure dubbed the ""nuclear option"" to change Senate rules to pass most executive and judicial nominees by a simple majority vote.The Senate voted 52 to 48 for the move, with just three Democrats declining to go along with the rarely used maneuver.From now until the Senate passes a new rule, executive branch nominees and judges nominated for all courts except the Supreme Court will be able to pass off the floor and take their seats on the bench with the approval of a simple majority of senators. They will no longer have to jump the traditional hurdle of 60 votes, which has increasingly proven a barrier to confirmation during the Obama administration.Reid opened debate in the morning by saying that it has become ""so, so very obvious"" that the Senate is broken and in need of rules reform. He rolled through a series of statistics intended to demonstrate that the level of obstruction under President Barack Obama outpaced any historical precedent. Half the nominees filibustered in the history of the United States were blocked by Republicans during the Obama administration; of 23 district court nominees filibustered in U.S. history, 20 were Obama's nominees; and even judges that have broad bipartisan support have had to wait nearly 100 days longer, on average, than President George W. Bush's nominees. ""It's time to change before this institution becomes obsolete,"" Reid said, before citing scripture -- ""One must not break his word"" -- in accusing Minority Leader McConnell (R-Ky.) of breaking his promise to work in a more bipartisan fashion.McConnell responded to Reid by changing the subject to the Affordable Care Act and accusing Democrats of trying to distract Americans from the law's troubled rollout. Getting around to fidelity, McConnell noted that Reid had said in July that ""we're not touching judges,"" yet he was now choosing to do so. Reid casually brushed off his suit coat and sat down. McConnell compared the alleged duplicity to another Democratic piece of rhetoric. ""If you like the rules of the Senate, you can keep them,"" he quipped, as the GOP side laughed heartily, which encouraged a pleased McConnell to turn directly to his colleagues and repeat the joke. He then turned to the Democratic side and said he understood why inexperienced young members who'd never been in the minority might want to change the rules. ""The rest of you guys in the conference should know better,"" he said. Obstruction, McConnell said, began with the Democrats when they decided to filibuster Circuit Court nominees under Bush. ""They made it up. They started it,"" he said, arguing that Republicans were only following their lead. His argument, though, raises the question of why eliminating the filibuster on such judges, if it was never used before 2000, should be seen as an historic development in the first place.""Stop trying to jam us,"" McConnell said, warning that it would come back to haunt them. ""You may regret it a lot sooner than you think."" Normally rules changes in the Senate need 67 votes, but the majority can challenge an existing rule, and if the presiding senator rules against the challenge, the majority can then ask for a vote on the chair's ruling. If a simple majority votes to overrule the chair, it sets a new precedent.Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) broke with their party and joined Republicans in opposing the move. Pryor is in an uphill reelection contest, which may explain his vote, but Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Mark Begich (D-Alaska), who are also top GOP targets in 2014, backed the rules change.Levin, a Senate traditionalist, has long been the most outspoken opponent of rules reform, and led a successful effort to stymie the movement earlier this year. Manchin, meanwhile, has great reverence for the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), a fierce champion of Senate tradition, likely explaining his vote. (Byrd did make several attempts to change the rules himself when he served as majority leader.)Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who has long been skeptical of changing the rules, cast a critical vote very late in the process supporting the move. That left Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a recent convert to reform, to cast the 51st vote, with Reid casting the 52nd.The move marks a significant win for the newer crop of Democrats -- like Oregon Sen.

Several media outlets have reported that David Sacks, founder of the business networking site Yammer and a former colleague of Musk's, had dropped off the list of the group's supporters.Zuckerberg started Fwd.us to press for comprehensive immigration reform. But the group has been heavily criticized by some immigration reform supporters in recent weeks for its television ad campaign praising lawmakers for backing projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Fwd.us has argued that the ads were meant to give home district support to lawmakers backing immigration reform.In a statement to AllThingsD on Friday, Musk, the founder of the electric carmaker Tesla Motors, made clear he was unhappy with the pro-oil ads. “I agreed to support Fwd.us because there is a genuine need to reform immigration,"" Musk said. ""However, this should not be done at the expense of other important causes. I have spent a lot of time fighting far larger lobbying organizations in D.C. and believe that the right way to win on a cause is to argue the merits of that cause. This statement may surprise some people, but my experience is that most (not all) politicians and their staffs want to do the right thing and eventually do.”Fwd.us retains the backing of other Silicon Valley heavyweights, including Bill Gates.The withdrawal of Musk and Sacks comes just days after a coalition of progressive groups announced that they were temporarily pulling all their ads from Facebook in protest. “Leaders in the technology community have every right to talk about how immigration reform will benefit their businesses,"" former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) said in a statement on Tuesday. ""But instead, Fwd.us has chosen a strategy that’s condescending to voters and counterproductive to the cause of reform.""The seven-figure Fwd.us ad campaign ran for a week in seven states, but it is no longer on the air. Fwd.us spokeswoman Kate Hansen told HuffPost, ""We recognize that not everyone will always agree with or be pleased by our strategy -- and we're grateful for the continued support of our dedicated founders and major contributors. Fwd.us remains totally committed to supporting a bipartisan policy agenda that will boost the knowledge economy, including comprehensive immigration reform.""As The Huffington Post reported in February, Musk is a significant -- but not top-tier -- donor to Democrats. He also contributes to Republicans."
19243	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/senate-immigration-group_n_3095201.html	News	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- The senators of the bipartisan group unveiling immigration reform legislation on Tuesday will now begin the process of defending it to their colleagues, some of whom they expect to attempt to radically change or kill the bill. ""We will pledge to oppose, all eight of us, provisions that would destroy the fragile agreement that we have,"" Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the group, told reporters. ""But we're certainly open to amendments, we're certainly willing and glad to have votes on them. This is the beginning of the process, not the end."" The so-called gang of eight -- McCain, Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) -- will release the result of its months-long effort, the full text of immigrant reform legislation, by the end of the day Tuesday. Senators will begin to consider the bill during Judiciary Committee hearings on Friday and Monday, and members of the gang of eight have said they want to give their fellow lawmakers plenty of time to consider the bill and offer suggestions to improve it. But they also know their own agreement was hard won, and any tweaks could damage the balance. ""I want to make sure that we do this the right way, and what we have now is a starting point,"" Rubio told reporters. ""From that point, I encourage my other 92 colleagues to get involved and to offer ideas. I hope sincerely that those that have problems with it don't just offer objections but offer solutions.""There are a number of compromises in the bill, with perhaps the most important over the question of border security and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill would allow undocumented immigrants to gain legal status and eventual citizenship, but that pathway is tied to specific border triggers meant to prevent future unauthorized immigration. This requirement is aimed to reassure lawmakers that the legislation won't be a repeat of a 1986 bill under President Ronald Reagan that was followed by an increase in the number of undocumented immigrants. Legalization under the bill would begin with a new ""registered provisional immigrant status,"" that would allow some undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. before 2012 to stay and work without federal benefits, after a $500 fine and criminal background check. Then nothing can move forward until after certain ""triggers"" that guarantee a plan for and then the implementation of increased border security measures. The bill would put $3 billion toward that effort, and another $1.5 billion toward fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. If the triggers are met, immigrants would be able to apply for lawful permanent status 10 years after beginning the process, then eventually citizenship. There are other controversial provisions as well. The bill would mandate E-Verify, an already existing system to check whether potential employees are eligible to work in the United States. It would eliminate the diversity visa lottery, which allows up to 55,000 people each year to immigrate to the U.S. without work or family ties. While the current legal immigration system places emphasis on family visas, the bill would shift to give half of all visas based on merit, USA Today reported. For now, senators have mostly remained quiet on what amendments they plan to offer, particularly before the full text is released. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) hasn't yet made a decision, but may offer amendments to improve due process in immigration if in his view the bill doesn't adequately address the matter.""They're all written,"" Coons spokesman Ian Koski said of the possible amendments. ""It's just a matter of seeing the final legislation and determining which are necessary.""Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has previously said he will push for same-sex couples to be included in the bill, but as of Tuesday afternoon had not seen the final text of the bill to make a decision on amendments, his spokeswoman said. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who opposes mandating an employment verification system on civil liberty grounds, said he hadn't seen enough of the bill to know whether he'd oppose such provisions. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who opposes key parts of the bill such as a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, said he hasn't yet determined whether he'll try to amend the bill or just attempt to block it. He told reporters he thinks it's ""very possible"" it will fail, and that his concern about the lack of hearings isn't assuaged by the two planned so far, since they're planned for days when some senators will be out of town. ""That gives the indication we're going through the motion of hearings,"" Sessions said. ""And besides, it does appear that the core members of the gang of eight have sort of an agreement that they'll defend all the key provisions of the bill and vote against any amendment. So I don't know how valuable a hearing is if they all agree to stick together."" The White House seems prepared to put its weight into helping the bill pass, which McCain said earlier would be ""very important, particularly with the Democrats."" After meeting with McCain and Schumer, President Barack Obama said in a statement Tuesday the legislation does not include everything he wanted, but he will push for reform. ""This bill is clearly a compromise, and no one will get everything they wanted, including me,"" Obama said. ""But it is largely consistent with the principles that I have repeatedly laid out for comprehensive reform. ... I urge the Senate to quickly move this bill forward and, as I told Senators Schumer and McCain, I stand willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that comprehensive immigration reform becomes a reality as soon as possible."" Even if the bill passes the Senate, it could be a non-starter in the House, where lawmakers are working on their own compromise for immigration reform. When asked whether he could imagine the House picking up the Senate's bill, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), one of those working on a deal, said they're more likely to do their own. ""The scenario would be assuming the Senate passes it, and I'm not sure the Senate can pass it,"" Labrador said. ""We'll just have to see what they do, we're going to have our own regular order, our own process."""

A sheriff's spokesman referred a request for comment to attorney Tim Casey, who said he was reading the ruling and had no immediate comment.'ILLEGAL AND PLAIN UN-AMERICAN'Cecillia Wang, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project and plaintiffs' counsel, called the judge's ruling ""an important victory that will resound far beyond Maricopa County.""""Singling people out for traffic stops and detentions simply because they're Latino is illegal and just plain un-American,"" Wang said after the ruling was made public.""Let this be a warning to anyone who hides behind a badge to wage their own private campaign against Latinos or immigrants that there is no exception in the Constitution for violating people's rights in immigration enforcement.""During testimony in the non-jury trial last year, Arpaio said he was against racial profiling and denied his office arrested people because of the color of their skin.The sheriff, who won re-election to a sixth term in November, has been a lightning rod for controversy over his aggressive enforcement of immigration laws in the state, which borders Mexico, as well as an investigation into the validity of President Barack Obama's U.S. birth certificate.The lawsuit was brought against Arpaio and his office on behalf of five Hispanic drivers who said they had been stopped by deputies because of their ethnicity.The plaintiffs, which include the Somos America immigrants' rights coalition and all Latino drivers stopped by the sheriff's office since 2007, were seeking corrective action but not monetary damages.Arpaio has been the subject of other probes and lawsuits. In August, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said it had closed a criminal investigation into accusations of financial misconduct by Arpaio, and it declined to bring charges.A separate U.S. Justice Department investigation and lawsuit relating to accusations of civil rights abuses by Arpaio's office is ongoing.Arizona has been at the heart of a bitter national debate over immigration since Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed a 2010 crackdown on illegal immigration.The federal government challenged the crackdown in court and said the U.S. Constitution gives it sole authority over immigration policy. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has allowed to stand the part of the law permitting police to question people they stop about their immigration status.Snow scheduled a hearing in the case for June 14 at 9:30 a.m. at the Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Federal Courthouse in Phoenix.

HuffPost Divorce spoke to Noel and his wife, Amanda -- who's featured on the company's new billboard campaign -- in separate phone conversations to discuss the secret to their relationship success, how Amanda reacted when Noel initially told her about his idea for the site, and why Noel believes cheating actually saves marriages. Amanda, how did you react when Noel first told you about his plan to create an infidelity dating site? Were you supportive? Resistant?Amanda: Originally, I wanted to make sure it wasn’t an emotional or personal issue...an emotional or physical thing that he was grappling with. Once I understood that it was a sound business [idea], that there was a market he felt was under-serviced, I was totally behind him. Noel: We weren’t even married at the time, so she easily could have said, “I think there’s something flawed with this human being.” Instead, she saw the passion in which I wanted to pursue this and she wanted to match that passion. I knew I had a true partner. Noel, you've said that your website saves marriage and that an affair can serve as a ""marriage preservation device."" Can you talk a little more about that? Noel: I definitely believe that. For me, I’m a married man now -- 10 years later, two children later, a really good economic success later, and with an extended family I love, I would be a fool if I said sex was the most important thing in my marriage –- it’s not. [But] it's important to me, I’m not a priest and I didn’t sign up for a life of celibacy. If I woke up today in some kind of sexless marriage like so many Americans do, I would be genuinely upset by that. I would try to change it with my partner, but if I couldn’t change it, I don’t know if I would just walk out the door. I believe the social science, I’ve seen it firsthand, how children raised in single-parent households have more trouble with drugs and alcohol, have fewer educational opportunities, and get in trouble with the law. I don’t want to do that to my family and I certainly don’t want to do that because everything else I have going for me is great. I like my lifestyle, so why would I give it all up because the number five or six thing on my list -– my sex life -– is not where it should be? So yes, if my brother came to me and said I can't take it anymore, I'm either leaving or I'm having an affair, I would encourage him to have an affair first. Amanda, would you stay in a marriage where you knew your husband was being unfaithful for the sake of keeping your family together?Amanda: I wouldn’t just walk into divorce. But, I mean, I also wouldn’t deal with a relationship where I knew there were interpersonal relations going on without me. We definitely differ on that point. I get that some people are doing this to fulfill a need and to make themselves more fulfilled and happier. I’m not here to judge those people. Personally, that’s not how I live my life. That’s not how I live my life and how I define my relationship and what I would accept moving forward.Has running a site like AshleyMadison informed how you behave in your own marriage in any way? Noel: Ironically, I talk about infidelity more than any man on the planet, so hopefully I can navigate a monogamous relationship more successfully than a lot of people. But even then, I don’t know if I can, but I’m going to try. Monogamy is a man-made notion –- it’s not in our DNA. It’s not what we’re engineered for. We might think it’s a noble cause and something worth pursuing, but anything against our DNA is something we’re going to struggle with... I’ve seen study after study showing that the longer a couple is together, the more their sex life diminishes. I’ve yet to see any one where it says, “Twenty years later, those two are still hot and heavy” -– it just doesn’t play out that way. We’re working against something... So it's with that knowledge base that I keep coming back to my own marriage in a different way. While we don’t have an open marriage in a sexual sense, we have a very open marriage in the sense that we can challenge and ask a lot of things of one another because we understand how important our marriage is and how often it can become turbulent. My wife and I have a very honest relationship with each other -- blunt almost. I think getting things off our chests is the approach we took, knowing that it won’t always go our way but at least it’s out there for the other partner to deal with. That’s kind of suited us. We’re very passionate and when things are great, we ride really high. We also have our moments, but we definitely don’t sleep on the issue –- and I think that’s the secret to our success today. Amanda: I think we’re lucky that his role as CEO of Ashley Madison has helped us understand the pitfalls more than anybody else. I also walked into this marriage open-eyed about the realities of relationships because my parents divorced when I was relatively young. I’ve had to deal with the aftermath of that and it wasn’t a nice divorce... I’m 38 years old and I’m still dealing with aftermath of that. I just always wanted to have a relationship where I never ended it in divorce. Outside of my own experience with divorce, this business has just made us stronger and more communicative. For a lot of people...you meet your spouse, you fall in love, you have this relationship and then kids come and work and life gets stressful and you move so far away from that person that you forget. I think this business has made us remember to always come back to what initially brought us together, so that we can keep the conversation going and not have things build up where we’re looking to move away from each other."

Because, naturally, the Alex Jones conspiracy set is pretty sure that the tornadoes that hit Moore, Okla. were probably maybe some sort of ""false flag"" event, brought on by the ""weather weapons"" that of course the federal government has at its disposal, for the purpose of ... incurring massively expensive disasters on ourselves? This probably makes sense to somebody.Via Raw Story:Conspiracy talk show host Alex Jones, increasingly a favorite of conservative media for his extremely vocal support of gun rights, outed himself Tuesday as a tornado truther by telling a caller on his show, “Of course there’s weather weapons stuff going on.”Jones, a longtime proponent of the idea that the U.S. government can manipulate and even produce weather systems like tornadoes and hurricanes, went on to say that if people saw helicopters or small aircraft in the area, then “you better bet your bottom dollar they did this.”“But, who knows if they did?” he asked. “You know, that’s the thing. We don’t know.”As Max Rivlin-Nadler points out, conspiracy theorists who believe in ""weather weapons"" primarily focus their paranoid worries on HAARP -- the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, not the Muse album of the same name (though Muse frontman Matt Bellamy has similar fixations). The program is ""a scientific endeavor aimed at studying the properties and behavior of the ionosphere, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and defense purposes."" As HAARP draws funding from the U.S. Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (the folks what brought you the Internet!), it seems only logical to conclude that HAARP is actually being used to manipulate the weather and cause hurricanes -- if by ""logical to conclude"" you mean, ""left alone in a room filling with some sort of gas that makes your brain feel all wibbly-wobbly.""Normally, you'd see people sort of decrying the toxic influence of Jones and his ilk, but in a counterintuitive way, I like to see Jones' continued existence as evidence of the fact that a certain baseline of charity and prosperity still exists in America, that accommodates the notion that one can be a crazy conspiracy nutter as your job, in the same way a few people can make their living as ""ghost hunters."" Had Jones been an original Jamestown colonist, his colleagues would have probably greeted his ravings with a genial, ""Shut up and farm something, nutsauce, we are dying."" For a little while, anyway. Then the Jamestown colonists would have just murdered him and, as we now know, eaten him. Because he knows the secrets!

The style icon and former ""Gossip Girl"" star covers the September 2013 issue of Lucky magazine, and inside its pages she dishes about life as a new wife. “I was recently asked how my style has changed since I got married, as if I was living under some sort of dictatorship,” Lively told Lucky. “I should hope I dress differently at 25 than I did when I graduated high school. I hope I never stop changing.”Lively, 25, and Reynolds, 36, dated for almost a year before they tied the knot in Charleston, S.C., last September. Her fashion sense was as on-point as ever for her wedding day. She opted for a Marchesa ""cloudlike silk tulle"" gown featuring crystals and rose-gold embroidery.Of course, her red carpet moments are no less fabulous now that she's a married woman, but some things are different. These days, you are more likely to see her in the aisles of Home Depot than in the front row at a fashion show. She is in the process of decorating the Bedford, N.Y., abode she shares with her hubby. Currently, she has her heart set on ""a handcrafted Rosemary Hallgarten rug and the perfect midcentury Danish side table from Etsy."" She credits Reynolds with having ""better taste"" (although we find that hard to believe), but says they influence each other in different ways. “Work is important, but my greatest passion is my personal life,” she added. Earlier this month, Reynolds told Details magazine that ""words are too clumsy"" to accurately express how he feels about his love. However, the notoriously private actor -- who has had very public romances and breakups with Alanis Morissette and Scarlett Johansson -- did reveal that he and Lively might be parents to a large brood someday. ""We'd love to have a big family,"" he said. ""We both come from big families -- my parents did four, Blake's did five. A lot of people say it's crazy, but we'll only know when we're there, you know? We'll walk through that fire pretty happily, I think.""Read Blake Lively's full interview in the September 2013 issue of Lucky magazine, on newsstands Aug. 6. Keep in touch!

All Democrats on the committee, along with Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and gang of eight Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), voted in favor of the bill, which will now go to the Senate floor. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who voted against the bill out of committee, said he would support allowing it to move forward for debate -- rather than joining a filibuster -- once on the Senate floor. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who was also a ""no"" vote, said if it had been between his vote and moving the bill to the Senate floor, he would have voted in favor. The crowd in the room erupted into applause when the final vote tally was read, rising to their feet and chanting ""Yes we can!"" then ""Si se puede!"" Democrats seemed equally pleased to vote the bill out of committee. ""The dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform,"" Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said before the bill's passage. ""I hope that our history, our values, and our decency can inspire us finally to take action. We need an immigration system that lives up to American values and helps write the next great chapter in American history by reinvigorating our economy and enriching our communities.""Of 300 amendments offered to the gang of eight immigration bill, the committee debated more than 200.The bill came out of months of work from the gang of eight, which in addition to Graham and Flake includes Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.). It includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a streamlined legal immigration process, tougher interior enforcement and increased border security. One of the final issues to settle was over high-skilled worker visas called H1-Bs. An amendment that simplifies the process for companies to bring in workers in science, technology, engineering and math eventually passed on a voice vote. Hatch and Schumer came to a compromise that led Hatch to agree to vote the full bill out of committee, although he did not commit to supporting its eventual passage. It was a tough vote for Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who has previously been wary of expanding H1-B visas. He voted in favor, however, citing the need for compromise and to get the bill through. ""We've made concessions I never thought we'd have to make ... but we've made those concessions to win your support,"" Durbin said to Hatch. ""We need your support, and we want to pass this bill.""The amendment came under fire from the AFL-CIO labor federation, which said the measure would hurt American workers.""There is no reason why this strong coalition should accept anti-worker amendments,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement. ""And let's be clear: Senator Orrin Hatch's H-1B amendments are unambiguous attacks on American workers."" Some measures praised highly by immigrant rights advocates never went to a vote. Leahy brought up his amendment to allow LGBT couples equal protection under immigration law, but withdrew it ""with a heavy heart"" when it became clear Democrats were willing to drop it so the bill would pass.A number of provisions lauded by advocates did make it in. The committee voted on Monday to approve Blumenthal's amendment that would block immigration raids in sensitive areas such as schools, hospitals and places of worship, except in extreme circumstances. A separate Blumenthal measure to restrict the use of solitary confinement in immigrant detention also passed on Monday, also on a voice vote. Although many Republican amendments failed, some GOP senators, such as Hatch, were more successful than others. The committee voted on Monday to require a mandatory biometric exit system at airports with the highest volume of international air travel -- something Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) wanted to do nationwide but without success. Amendments deemed poison pills failed, unsurprisingly. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) attempted to add a change that would strip the bill of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, which is considered absolutely necessary to the bill by President Barack Obama, Democrats and some Republicans. Five Republicans voted for that amendment, while three -- Hatch, Graham and Flake -- joined Democrats in opposing it. Leahy said the amendment would gut the bill, while Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said ""it goes against everything America stands for."" Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) similarly disparaged another failed Cruz amendment, this one to bar currently undocumented immigrants from ever being eligible for welfare benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps, saying he doesn't think such an America is one he'd want to live in. Sessions was also unsuccessful in his efforts to amend the bill, offering 49 amendments and seeing nearly every one that went for a vote fail. On one amendment last week Sessions was the sole ""yes"" vote, with all of his Republican colleagues abandoning him in his effort to limit legal immigration. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) was one of the rare Democrats to offer an amendment that the gang of eight took down. Schumer and Durbin told her they had to reluctantly oppose her attempt on Tuesday to add a change that would expand family visas so that people in extreme hardship could petition for green cards for their adult children or siblings. It failed with 7 votes in support and 11 against, including Democrats Schumer, Durbin, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), all of whom said it was a good amendment but would upset the delicate balance of the gang of eight bill. ""Your heart's in the right place, your amendment's in the wrong place,"" Durbin said to Hirono.President Barack Obama applauded the committee for passing the bill.""None of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I, but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line,"" he said in a statement. ""I encourage the full Senate to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor at the earliest possible opportunity and remain hopeful that the amendment process will lead to further improvements.""Now that the bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee, it has to go to the Senate floor, where gang of eight members are hopeful it will pass. Schumer and McCain, who is not on the Judiciary Committee, have said they would like to win over a majority of both parties -- around 70 votes in total."

Jeff Gohringer, press secretary for the national League of Conservation Voters, said that the group has contributed $1.9 million to the state league in both cash and in-kind contributions this election cycle across all races. The Sierra Club launched its own anti-Cuccinelli efforts as well.Polling heading into Tuesday's election shows McAuliffe with a 6-point lead over Cuccinelli.Cuccinelli has been a particularly popular target for environmental groups, given his outspoken denial of climate change. In his role as attorney general, Cuccinelli attempted to subpoena the records and emailed correspondence of a former University of Virginia climate scientist, accusing him of fraud in his climate research. That climate scientist, Michael Mann, has been campaigning against Cuccinelli in the state.""We got involved in this race because of climate change,"" said LCV's Gohringer. ""[Cuccinelli] is one of the most vocal climate deniers in the country. To defeat him would send a signal to other climate change deniers, and also highlight the growing environmental movement.""The McAuliffe campaign has also criticized Cuccinelli's climate change denial in television ads that accuse the Republican of being too extreme for Virginia. The Virginia League of Conservation Voters' political action committee is also running a field program that it characterized as the largest effort by an outside group this year -- with volunteers making an estimated 300,000 canvassing visits over the course of the campaign -- one-third of them in the final five days of the race, according to Gohringer. McAuliffe has been accused of waffling on coal and greenhouse gas emissions over the years. He did not come out in support of the EPA's new rules for coal-fired power plants until early last month. His opponent quickly seized on the statement as part of a ""war on coal.""""I think we've seen Terry McAuliffe unafraid to really lean into these issues throughout the campaign, talking about climate change, supporting the EPA,"" said Gohringer.

Labrador was considered by many to be a potential leader on immigration reform, and even though he is not in leadership, advocates were hopeful he would push to bring Republicans on board. He said he is still working on a bill that would address legal immigration. But Labrador dropped out of a bipartisan group working on legislation and does not support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a criterion Democrats say is absolutely necessary to win their votes. He would support undocumented immigrants gaining legal status, but not a new way for them to move beyond it, he said -- a policy that would prevent many from becoming citizens because of narrow application windows under current law.The congressman said that if the House voted on legalization for undocumented immigrants within the next month, he doesn't think there would be enough support for the reform to pass.""Immigration reform is something about which we have to have a good debate,"" he said.

19413	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/08/gop-wall-street-bill_n_3542999.html	News	0	None	None	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved an agriculture budgeting bill last month that would significantly restructure the U.S. bank regulatory regime as part of a GOP effort to protect Wall Street's offshore trading in derivatives -- the complex financial products at the heart of the 2008 economic meltdown.Republicans in Congress have been pressuring regulators for years to exempt derivatives that U.S. companies sell overseas from the new rules set by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. For much of 2013, the deregulatory drive enjoyed bipartisan support in the House, with lawmakers casting their efforts as an attempt to harmonize U.S. law with international regulations. But financial reform advocates have attacked the initiative for padding Wall Street profits at the expense of important public protections, and Democratic support has eroded.In June, the House passed a bill that would completely exempt from U.S. oversight derivatives sold through the nine most popular foreign derivatives jurisdictions. The legislation is occasionally derided as the ""London Whale Loophole Act"" on Capitol Hill -- a reference to the overseas trades that cost JPMorgan Chase more than $6 billion in 2012. London was the epicenter of much of the derivatives trading by U.S. financial firms leading up the 2008 crash, including AIG's infamous Financial Products division. If banks can simply route trades through loosely regulated overseas affiliates, financial reform advocates warn, the most critical aspects of Dodd-Frank will be effectively nullified.The ""London Whale Loophole Act"" faces opposition from Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama, so it's unlikely to be signed into law. But June's House Agriculture Committee funding bill has much stronger prospects for passage, since it's tied to approximately $19 billion in other spending. That bill would require the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -- the agency with responsibility for more than 90 percent of the derivatives market -- to negotiate its regulations with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the remainder of the derivatives business.Big banks have railed against the CFTC guidelines for taking a broad view of what constitutes an American firm. The SEC's proposed rule, by contrast, would bar American regulators from overseeing many offshore partnerships run by U.S. firms, and many trades between U.S. firms and overseas companies. Forcing the CFTC to negotiate with the SEC would almost certainly introduce loopholes into the CFTC's rules, and may shut down the rulemaking process altogether.  ""The House bill is nothing more than a backdoor way of killing derivatives reform,"" said Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets. ""It's Christmas in July for Wall Street.""  Prior to Dodd-Frank, derivatives trades were essentially secret deals between two companies, with no market or regulatory scrutiny. The 2010 law required companies to trade through a third party that guaranteed each side’s ability to make good on its bets. To buttress the guarantee, each side of the trade was required to post margin -– a small upfront deposit just in case the trade went bad. An offshoring loophole would allow firms to evade these requirements, provided they meet the technical definitions of the loophole.  While Wall Street has pursued multiple avenues to derail the CFTC’s rule, some Senate Democrats cautioned that even the more aggressive regulatory interpretation may ultimately undermine the essence of Dodd-Frank.  Eight Democratic senators, organized by Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.), on Wednesday signed a letter to CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and SEC Chairman Mary Jo White stating that both the CFTC and the SEC have failed to deal with shadowy financial entities “sponsored” by U.S. banks without any explicit legal guarantee for their obligations.  This type of arrangement was common in the years leading up to the 2008 crash. Citigroup held nearly $50 billion in complex derivatives off its official balance sheet in so-called structured investment vehicles, and Bear Stearns operated risky hedge funds that it officially had no financial obligations to. The financial crisis began in August 2007 when two such Bear Stearns funds failed, and the company decided to pay off its investors rather than take the damage to its reputation from leaving clients out to dry. By the fall of 2008, Citi had decided to suck up its losses on structured investment vehicles, rather than signal to the market it was incapable of doing so.""A U.S.-based firm should not be able to escape U.S.-mandated swaps oversight simply because its swaps trading is conducted through an offshore affiliate or branch,"" the letter from the Democratic senators reads. ""It is likely that, if your agencies’ current proposals were adopted, foreign firms doing business with the foreign affiliate of a U.S.-based derivatives dealer would opt to forego an explicit guarantee from the U.S.-based entity in return for: (1) more favorable pricing, and (2) the ability to avoid U.S. trading regulations and any attendant costs."" Both the CFTC and SEC standards would allow an offshore fund organized by a U.S. bank that formally rejected any responsibility for the fund’s solvency to evade American oversight. Reform watchdogs said they worry that U.S. firms will simply route much of their derivatives business through these nebulous entities, leaving the financial system to operate much as it did in the years before the crash.  Read the full letter, signed by Sens. Merkley, Levin, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) here."

""They apparently don't consult the deepest hopes or greatest fears of young women.""Cotton, who is unmarried, wrote that he surveyed several women -- whom he referred to as ""Cliffies,"" or female students at Radcliffe -- and they all told him the same thing: that their ""greatest fear"" in life was to be left by their husbands, and their ""deepest hope"" was to be ""a good wife and mother."" To that end, he says, feminists should stop trying to make it easier to get divorced.""If men have easy access to divorce, many will choose it thoughtlessly,"" he wrote. ""They may not gain true happiness with their new trophy wives, but they certainly will not slide into the material indigence and emotional misery that awaits most divorced women."" Cotton tried to make the case for ""covenant marriages,"" in which people can only divorce in cases where there's fault, ""defined as abandonment, physical abuse, adultery or conviction of a capital crime.""The National Organization for Women denounced covenant marriage in 1997 when Louisiana became the first state to create it as a legal category, arguing that it was intended to trap women in bad marriages and re-establish patriarchy. But Cotton wrote that women should support the policy in order to restrain men from leaving, so that they will stay and ""fulfill women's deepest hopes.""""[Men] can learn that personal happiness comes from the desire to devote and sacrifice oneself to one's beloved,"" he wrote. ""A few men can see this by themselves, and women are quite lucky to hook them. Ordinary women must not only defend these men against feminism, but also demand that all other men accept the lifelong nature of marriage. If not, one-half of all women who marry see their ‘greatest fear’ come true.""Laws allowing no-fault divorce across the country were considered a victory for women's rights in the 1970s. A 2003 Stanford Business School study found states that passed no-fault divorce laws saw a 20 percent reduction in female suicide after 20 years and a 33 percent reduction in domestic violence and murder against women.Cotton's campaign did not immediately comment on whether the congressman stands by the article, but Cotton remains a staunch social conservative. He opposes abortion rights, equal pay for women, marriage equality and women in combat, and he voted against every version of the Violence Against Women Act that has come up since he took office.Cotton is challenging Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), the lone Democratic senator in an increasingly Republican state. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) began personally fundraising for Pryor this week, writing in an email to supporters that Cotton is ""recklessly anti-woman.""

19432	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/sexless-marriage_n_3869506.html	other	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"By Laura Seldon for GalTimeSex is one of those topics we’re all constantly thinking about, reading about, and even acting out… but not necessarily talking about. Sure, you’ll dish to your friends about the steamy sex session you had with your new man last night, but you won’t necessarily be so eager to share when your sex life goes from consistent to non-existent. And yet, several studies have been revealing for the last decade that a dry spell in the bedroom is actually common among couples. Is a lack of sex the one thing our conversations are lacking?“It is very common for couples to go through sexual dry spells,” says Rabbi Ed Weinsberg, EdD. “It's estimated that this process begins for most couples anywhere from two to ten years after they get married.”Defining a sexual dry spell, though, can be as difficult as dealing with the problem itself. One of my favorite scenes from the 1977 film ""Annie Hall"" features Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) talking to a therapist about their sex life. When the therapist asks how often they have sex, Alvy answers, “Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.” Annie, however, answers this way: “Constantly. I'd say three times a week.”“The disparity is normal,” says Rabbi Weinsberg, author of two books on sexuality after illnesses, including ""Conquer Prostate Cancer: How Medicine, Faith, Love and Sex Can Renew Your Life."" “Going through a sexual dry spell is fairly subjective.” Just as we all have different likes and dislikes when it comes to sex, we all have a different take on how often we should be having sex as well. “There is no one ‘right’ amount of sex that a couple should be having,” says Jodi Lipper, co-author of ""How to Love Like a Hot Chick"". “For some married couples, normal is having sex every day. For others, it might be having sex once a month.”Wondering if you and your partner are going through a sexual dry spell? Start by asking if both of your needs are being met. If your answer is no, then you may be facing a sexual drought. “It’s not enough when one or both partners is unsatisfied, or feels that his or her needs aren’t being met,” says Lipper. Her advice to couples in a sexless relationship? Talk it out with an open mind to determine the cause of the problem before you take drastic steps. In other words, share your sexual needs and wants before you demand that you and your partner either get it on, or get divorced!“Sometimes a decrease in sexual activity in a relationship represents a manifestation of other problems,” explains Dr. Alexis Conason, a clinical psychologist in New York City. “It is important to understand why the couple has stopped, or decreased, having sex before we can diagnose a sexless period as problematic or not.” In other words, talking about your lack of sex could turn up a simple cause for what seems like a major problem. Before you give up on your sex life, Dr. Conason suggests asking yourself the following questions:Have you stopped having sex because one partner is furious at the other? Is one partner having an affair? Are there medical issues that interfere with sexual functioning or desire? Is one or both partners overwhelmed with childcare responsibilities? Is one or both partners overwhelmed with career stress? Was there ever a time when you were having more sex with your partner? Or has the relationship always been sexless?Discussing these questions may seem like a daunting task, but it’s vital to the health of your relationship. “That hot and heavy sex that may have brought you together is not what is going to sustain the relationship,” explains Dr. Lisa Bahar, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Dana Point, Calif. “Now is the time to build intimacy on a deeper level, which requires awareness and a willingness to be curious about your partner in new ways that create spontaneous intimacy.” And spontaneous intimacy, my friends, is what leads to sexual intimacy… i.e. the opposite of a sexual dry spell!The bottom line is that a lack of sex is an indicator of a greater problem. If you can’t remember the last time you had sex, make a list of all the obstacles holding you back from doing the deed –- like work stress, a lack of time, etc. –- and then work to find solutions to those obstacles, like trading massages with your partner to help relieve work stress, or planning a Saturday “staycation” in your bedroom to make time for an all-day shag. However, the most important step to finding your happy ending (pun intended) is to open up and talk to your partner about what’s really going on. You’ll hopefully go from “We need to talk” to “Less talk, more action!” in no time at all.More from GalTime.com5 Ways to Make Bad Sex Better Why You Should Hold Marriage Meetings 3 Biggest Mistakes Women Make in the Bedroom 6 Things Women Do to Push Men AwayLaura Seldon is a writer and journalist living in Los Angeles.

Several media outlets have reported that David Sacks, founder of the business networking site Yammer and a former colleague of Musk's, had dropped off the list of the group's supporters.Zuckerberg started Fwd.us to press for comprehensive immigration reform. But the group has been heavily criticized by some immigration reform supporters in recent weeks for its television ad campaign praising lawmakers for backing projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Fwd.us has argued that the ads were meant to give home district support to lawmakers backing immigration reform.In a statement to AllThingsD on Friday, Musk, the founder of the electric carmaker Tesla Motors, made clear he was unhappy with the pro-oil ads. “I agreed to support Fwd.us because there is a genuine need to reform immigration,"" Musk said. ""However, this should not be done at the expense of other important causes. I have spent a lot of time fighting far larger lobbying organizations in D.C. and believe that the right way to win on a cause is to argue the merits of that cause. This statement may surprise some people, but my experience is that most (not all) politicians and their staffs want to do the right thing and eventually do.”Fwd.us retains the backing of other Silicon Valley heavyweights, including Bill Gates.The withdrawal of Musk and Sacks comes just days after a coalition of progressive groups announced that they were temporarily pulling all their ads from Facebook in protest. “Leaders in the technology community have every right to talk about how immigration reform will benefit their businesses,"" former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) said in a statement on Tuesday. ""But instead, Fwd.us has chosen a strategy that’s condescending to voters and counterproductive to the cause of reform.""The seven-figure Fwd.us ad campaign ran for a week in seven states, but it is no longer on the air. Fwd.us spokeswoman Kate Hansen told HuffPost, ""We recognize that not everyone will always agree with or be pleased by our strategy -- and we're grateful for the continued support of our dedicated founders and major contributors. Fwd.us remains totally committed to supporting a bipartisan policy agenda that will boost the knowledge economy, including comprehensive immigration reform.""As The Huffington Post reported in February, Musk is a significant -- but not top-tier -- donor to Democrats. He also contributes to Republicans."

Does that mean your marriage is over?Not necessarily, according to Dr. Scott Haltzman, author of ""The Secrets of Surviving Infidelity."" In fact, according to the author, ""many people will say that working through the affair made the marriage stronger than before.""""Once an affair happens you realize, 'Hey, my marriage can’t run on auto-pilot,'"" Haltzman told HuffPost Divorce via e-mail. ""Succeeding at marriage after infidelity is akin to surviving a trauma; you often never realize your strength or resiliency until it is called on. And that’s worth something!""But there are several large hurdles between the affair and post-infidelity marital bliss, beginning with telling your spouse about your indiscretions.We asked Haltzman about whether or not it's important to cop to the infidelity, and how to go about having that emotional conversation. Below, he shares his answers.Huffington Post Divorce: Should you tell your spouse if you've had an affair? Why or why not?Dr. Scott Haltzman: In most cases, you should tell your spouse you had an affair. It goes without saying that marriages are based on openness, and affairs are based on secrets. Choosing openness is a potent step toward honoring your wedding vows.  Usually by the time you’re thinking of revealing all, your mate has already begun to figure out something is wrong. By telling your partner the truth, you free him or her up from the constant wondering, “what’s going on with you?” For the person having an affair, verbalizing your actions makes the impact more real, and moves you from “what will I do when my spouse finds out,” to “what’s the next step toward resolution”?HP: Is there ever a time where you shouldn't tell your spouse that you cheated?Haltzman:  If the infidelity was in the remote past, it has no impact on your current marriage, you've done the emotional ""work"" to make sense of what led to it and took the necessary steps to prevent it from happening again, then it's not clear that the marriage will benefit from telling the truth.If there's a good likelihood the the revelation will lead to domestic violence, or threaten the life of the person you had an affair with, then it is not a good idea to be entirely truthful, although you must commit to working individually to get the marriage back on track.  HP: If you've decided to tell your spouse, how should you go about telling him or her? How many details of the affair should you reveal? Should you be completely honest?Haltzman: Your mate is about to find out that his or her world is turned inside out. Is there any right way to do it? In a word, no. But you can try. When possible, revealing an affair should take place in a home, not a park, restaurant or other public place. It's more than likely that you will unfurl a litany of emotions; your spouse should not feel constrained to control emotions by the environment.You should be direct; no matter how you phrase it, it’s going to hurt. Once you’ve revealed your news, it may take a long time to sink in. Be prepared to answer as many questions as your partner has.Once you have come clean about the affair, the general policy is “do ask, do tell.” Let your spouse decide what he or she wants to hear. Many people try to protect their spouse (and themselves) from the harsh realities by holding back hurtful details. Don’t do that. Once an affair has been revealed, the most important element in rebuilding a marriage is establishing trust. Trust is built on complete honesty.   HP: If your spouse reacts badly, how should you respond?  Haltzman: There’s no predictable reaction to finding out your spouse had an affair, and, with the exception of physical violence, no right or wrong way to react. A partner who has had an affair must be prepared for any kind of reaction when the truth is told. Your partner’s pain must be recognized and prioritized. It is important to not try to minimize your spouse’s feelings by saying such things as, “It’s not that big a deal” or, “It happened only once,"" or by comparing feelings (“I didn’t get that upset when you told me about your affair”) or invalidating the feeling (“You shouldn’t feel that way.”) Remember that all feelings are valid because they are real within your mate. Your role is to listen, try to understand, be as strong as you can be -- although it’s OK to break down if it is in sympathy with your mate. At some point the dust will settle, and then you will need to be there to help pick up the pieces.  HP: What's the most important thing to remember before having this conversation?  Haltzman: The most important thing to remember about having this conversation is that it is a beginning, not an end. Revealing the truth about an affair is a necessary first step toward moving the marriage back on track.Click through the slideshow below for reasons why men cheat, according to men.Keep in touch!

A second House source confirmed the lack of an invitation to Pelosi and Hoyer, and a Reid aide said that the Senate majority leader was not invited.""I wanna welcome members of Congress here,"" Bush said Thursday, opening his speech in Dallas. ""I thank the speaker for coming.""The snub is a reminder of the tense relationship that Bush had with Democrats as president. Reid famously called him a ""liar,"" and Pelosi made no attempt to conceal her contempt for him. Bush, for his part, showed little interest in a relationship with congressional Democrats, preferring to marshal only Republican votes on behalf of his agenda.""Guess there is no section in the library about the failed effort to privatize Social Security,"" quipped one top Democratic aide.Along with Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Bush also invited all the living former presidents and the current White House occupant, as well as a host of former top foreign leaders -- Australia's John Howard, Britain's Tony Blair, Israel's Ehud Olmert and Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, who left office in disgrace."

Circuit Court of Appeals. A statement issued on Friday comes after repeated attempts to confirm the former New York state solicitor general were filibustered by Senate Republicans.In a statement, Obama said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that a minority of senators had blocked Halligan's nomination for almost two and a half years, and called the vacancies on what is arguably the country's second-highest federal court ""unacceptable.""""Today, I accepted Caitlin Halligan's request to withdraw as a nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,"" Obama said in an emailed statement. ""This unjustified filibuster obstructed the majority of Senators from expressing their support. I am confident that with Caitlin's impressive qualifications and reputation, she would have served with distinction.""Republicans objected to Halligan's nomination because of what they claim is her history of legal advocacy, having focused specifically on a lawsuit in which she participated that would make gun manufacturers legally accountable for criminal acts of gun violence.The most recent GOP filibuster incidentally came on the same day that Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) gained national media attention for his 13-hour talking filibuster. Democrats fell short of the required 60-vote threshold to end debate and bring Halligan's nomination to a vote, with only Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) breaking from her party in support of invoking cloture. Halligan was nominated on Sept. 29, 2010, to fill the long vacant D.C. Circuit seat previously held by current Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts; her nomination was first filibustered in 2011.Shortly after the vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Halligan would ""bring that activism to the court."" ""Because of her record of activism, giving Ms. Halligan a lifetime appointment on the D.C. Circuit is a bridge too far,"" McConnell said.Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) called it a ""shame"" that Republicans had succeeded in blocking an ""extraordinarily well-qualified"" woman, who he said would've made an ""outstanding judge.""""Caitlin Halligan is a woman who is extraordinarily well-qualified and amongst the most qualified judicial nominees I have seen from any administration,"" Leahy said in a statement.

Instead, ""SNL"" took aim at itself.The sketch, which opened on Jay Pharaoh's Barack Obama in the Oval Office, reeling from embarrassing political setbacks, quickly shifted gears with the arrival of Michelle Obama, then Oprah, then supposedly Beyonce. The catch? Kerry Washington was supposed to play all three of them, because ""SNL"" doesn't have any black women on its cast.Cue the following mea culpa from the show's producers:The Producers at ""Saturday Night Live"" would like to apologize to Kerry Washington for the number of black women she will be asked to play tonight. We made these requests only because Ms. Washington is an actress of considerable range and talent and also because ""SNL"" does not currently have a black woman in the cast. As for the latter reason, we agree that this is not an ideal situation, and look forward to rectifying it in the near future…unless, of course, we fall in love with another white guy first.For all of ""SNL's"" staying power -- it has, after all, been on the air for most of four decades -- the one criticism it's never been able to escape is its startling lack of diversity. When ""SNL"" rolled out six new cast members in September, many voiced disappointment. Five of them are white men, and the one female addition, ""despite a heritage which includes Tunisian and Latina roots… has seemingly played just white characters onscreen,"" as NPR points out. That criticism was renewed this week, as Kerry Washington, one of only a few leading black women on television, prepared to host.  Per the Associated Press:The show has had four black women among its regular cast since coming on the air in 1975 with the last one, biracial Maya Rudolph, leaving in 2007. Both Pharoah and Thompson have recently addressed the situation in interviews, with Pharoah even lobbying for a specific comic to be added — Darmirra Brunson of the OWN sitcom ""Love Thy Neighbor.""""It's not like it's not a priority for us,"" producer Lorne Michaels  told the AP last week. ""It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.""Good self-awareness, ""SNL."" Now do something about it!"

Jodi Arias. On Friday, the lawyers and witnesses finally stopped talking, and the case was turned over to the 12 jurors.Now it is up to those dozen men and women -- some in their 20s, others well into retirement age -- to determine Arias' level of guilt or innocence. YOU BE THE 13TH JUROR: How Would You Vote?As to which side, defense or prosecution, did a more persuasive job, the jury may have already tipped its hand. On days 28 and 29 of the trial, jurors submitted more than 100 questions to Arias that suggested they were skeptical of her testimony, delivered over two highly emotional weeks. Arizona is one of only three states that allow jurors to ask witnesses questions. Panel members submit their queries to the judge, who reads them to the witnesses.In her testimony, Arias gave highly detailed descriptions of her sex life with Travis Alexander, the former boyfriend she killed. She claimed that he became increasingly demanding and abusive, and that she feared for her life. The prosecution argued that she murdered Alexander in a jealous rage.One juror asked, ""After all the lies you have told, why should we believe you now?"" Indeed, Arias changed her story several times. At first, she vehemently denied any involvement in the death of Alexander, whose body was discovered June 9, 2008, at his Mesa, Ariz., home. Alexander had been shot in the head and stabbed 27 times. His throat had been cut from ear to ear. When DNA proved Arias had been there, she then claimed that she and Alexander had been attacked by two masked killers in a home invasion. She said she didn't go to the police because she was still in fear of them.It was not until years after his death that she admitted to killing Alexander in what she said was an act of self-defense.""Lying isn't typically something I just do,"" Arias told the court. ""The lies I've told in this case can be tied directly back to either protecting Travis' reputation or my involvement in his death ... because I was very ashamed.""The defense team has attacked Alexander's character in an attempt to show he was a sex-obsessed womanizer who masturbated to photos of little boys. Although accusations of abuse and pedophilia can prove detrimental, the defense in this case has one problem: All such allegations came from one source -- Arias, an admitted liar who is on trial for her life. The prosecutors seemed to have an easier time. Although they did not have a murder weapon, they did have a motive, contending Arias was consumed with jealousy, and they had Arias' confession to the slaying. For a first-degree murder charge to stick, however, jurors will have to conclude that she acted with premeditation. The defense had to try to explain why someone acting in self-defense would stab her assailant multiple times, shoot him and cut his throat. That challenge was compounded by the fact that Arias claimed memory loss covering much of the day that Alexander was killed.The prosecution, meanwhile, argued that she made attempts to clean up the crime scene and disposed of the handgun used in the shooting.Other issues likely to come up in the jury room:THE CUTS: There were cuts on Arias' fingers. She said she nicked herself at work when she broke a glass. Prosecutors alleged those lacerations came while knifing Alexander. A blood-covered knife typically becomes slippery and slides through the hand of the person wielding it, often resulting in wounds. THE FINGER: Arias had a broken and disfigured finger. She said it happened months prior to Alexander's death and was a result of his physical abuse. Prosecutors allege she hurt herself during the killing, and that's why the injury is not visible in photos shown to the jurors that were taken after she claimed the injury occurred. GAS CANS: Arias took two gas cans with her and purchased a third when she went on her final road trip to visit Alexander. Arias testified the cans were a precautionary measure, so she would not run out of fuel while traveling through the desert. Prosecutors said she had them so she would not have to make fuel purchases that could tie her to the area. Arias said she returned one can to Walmart and received a cash refund without a receipt. Prosecutors said the exchange never occurred and presented a Walmart employee who testified there was no record of the transaction. THE GUN: Prior to Alexander's killing, a .25-caliber handgun was stolen from Arias' grandparents' home. Alexander was killed with a .25-caliber firearm, but Arias claimed it was Alexander's own gun, despite the lack of evidence that he had ever owned a firearm.What is bizarre about some of Arias' claims is that they are irrelevant in the grand scheme. Once she admitted she had killed Alexander, why argue about some of these little things? In the case of her finger, Arias' version of events was an attempt to show prior domestic abuse, but it might have served her better if she had played it differently. As for the gas can, what was the point in saying she'd returned one and then being contradicted by a witness? It is all these details that Arias has woven into her story that could ultimately be her undoing.Although the prosecution appears to be ahead, anything is possible. Prosecutors must prove their case, after all. Many trial watchers were convinced Casey Anthony would be found guilty of murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, but the jury held otherwise.Nothing is certain until the moment the verdict is read, and in a death penalty case such as this, it could take a jury several days to weigh each factor.YOU BE THE 13TH JUROR: How Would You Vote?"

Marcus Fulton ruled that President Barack Obama's comments on military sexual assault could affect the sentencing in two cases, according to Stars and Stripes.During pretrial hearings in the cases, Fulton said “unlawful command influence” derived from Obama's remarks could influence a potential sentencing in the two cases, according to according to court documents obtained by Stars and Stripes. The judge's ruling could have an impact on other sexual assault cases in the military.On May 7, Obama said he has “no tolerance” for sexual assault in the military.""I expect consequences,” Obama said. “So I don’t just want more speeches or awareness programs or training, but ultimately folks look the other way. If we find out somebody’s engaging in this, they’ve got to be held accountable – prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged. Period.”Stars and Stripes reports on the ruling:The judge’s pretrial ruling means that if either defendant is found guilty, whether by a jury or a military judge, they cannot receive a bad conduct discharge or a dishonorable discharge. Sailors found guilty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice’s Article 120, which covers several sexual crimes including assault and rape, generally receive punitive discharges.“A member of the public would not hear the President’s statement to be a simple admonition to hold members accountable,” Fulton stated. “A member of the public would draw the connection between the ‘dishonorable discharge’ required by the President and a punitive discharge approved by the convening authority.“The strain on the system created by asking a convening authority to disregard [Obama’s] statement in this environment would be too much to sustain public confidence.”Obama has made several comments chastising sexual assault in the military, at one point directing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to ""step up our game exponentially"" to prevent further incidents. Obama has also expressed concern over how military sexual assaults ""threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong.""""That's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes, because they've got no place in the greatest military on Earth,"" Obama said in a May address to U.S. Naval Academy graduates.According to an annual report released by the Department of Defense in May, sexual assaults occurred at an average of more than 70 per day in the United States military during 2012.Click here for more on Fulton's ruling from Stars and Stripes."

Following the announcement, Club For Growth said it would oppose the deal and include it on its congressional scorecard.""They're using our members and they're using the American people for their own goals. This is ridiculous,"" Boehner said loudly. ""Listen, if you're for more deficit reduction, you're for this agreement.""The deal reached by House Budget Chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Budget Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) modestly raises spending levels from $967 billion to $1.014 trillion by 2015, counteracting approximately one-third of sequestration cuts. It also reduces the deficit by $20 to $23 billion by hiking airline fees and requiring federal workers and military personnel to kick in more for their pensions.Boehner's tone toward the conservative groups was unusually aggressive, a further signal that he wants the deal to pass the House Republican caucus, where the groups hold sway among members.Levi Russell, Director of Public Affairs for Americans For Prosperity, responded to Boehner's comments. ""AFP stood with House Republicans earlier this spring when they passed modest spending limits set by the sequester,"" Russell said. ""That bipartisan agreement was signed by President Obama and set spending levels at $967 billion. It’s disappointing to see leadership give up even those modest gains with nothing to show for it.""“Americans are deeply concerned about the direction of the country. Over the next few days, lawmakers will have to explain to their constituents, many of whom are our members, what they’ve achieved by increasing spending, increasing taxes and offering up another round of promises waiting to be broken. That will be a really tough sell back home,"" said Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action.Club For Growth released a statement as well. ""We stand with Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Tom Coburn, Rand Paul, members of the Republican Study Committee and every other fiscal conservative who opposes the Ryan-Murray deal,” said the group's president, Chris Chocola. “After carefully reviewing the budget deal, on which we never commented until it was complete, we determined that it would increase the size of government. We support pro-growth proposals when they are considered by Congress. In our evaluation, this isn’t one of those.”"

The PR help included tweaks to op-eds and running UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Holden Thorp through a four-hour session to prepare for questions he'd likely face from reporters. The News & Observer reports that the bill will be paid by UNC's privately funded foundation.The majority of the money -- $367,000 -- went to The Fleishman-Hillard firm. Another $144,000 went to political consultant Doug Sosnik and $20,000 went to Sheehan Associates.The News & Observer obtained the correspondence through an open records request, which also revealed a series of communications between UNC administrators and faculty involved in the academic fraud scandal.The academic scandal involved courses being offered as ""paper"" classes that did not require attendance, and a number of unauthorized grade changes, the majority of which involved student athletes. It prompted several investigations, including those by former North Carolina Gov. James G. Martin, the National Association of Academic Advisors for Athletics and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.As a consequence of the scandal Thorp resigned and Bruce Carney left his post as executive vice chancellor and provost.UNC's bill tops what Florida State University spent for its own academic fraud scandal: $300,000 between 2007 and 2010.But as large as UNC's bill is for PR advice, it's nothing compared to the $2.3 million Rutgers University has already spent due to the scandal involving former basketball head coach Mike Rice.Both Rutgers and UNC's costs are dwarfed by the $100 million (or more) in costs due to penalties, fees and lost revenue that Penn State University faces in the wake of Jerry Sandusky's sex crimes."

Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said on Wednesday that the day after the May 2 incident, Ginsburg was examined at the Office of the Attending Physician at the Capitol and then went about her regular schedule.The justice, who survived two serious bouts with cancer, in 1999 and 2009, is keeping up a typically busy summer of travel, at home and abroad, beginning next week with a trip to Paris. Ginsburg said she was back to her usual weight-lifting routine and recently had good results from a bone density scan.Supreme Court justices are appointed for life and can be a president's most enduring legacy. Disputes over many social dilemmas come down to 5-4 votes, as was seen in the recently completed term on gay marriage and voting rights. A retirement decision rests with an individual justice, but history is rife with tensions between aging justices and anxious presidents. Ginsburg, the eldest justice on an ideologically divided court, was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993.Political pressure is an age-old backdrop to Supreme Court appointments, and for Ginsburg it is likely to accelerate before the November 2014 congressional elections that could alter the Democratic dominance of the Senate.Such talk is always subtle because a presidential administration never wants to be perceived to engage in politics over the judiciary given the bedrock American principle that separates the branches of government. 2012 PRESSUREBefore Obama's 2012 reelection, Harvard University law professor Randall Kennedy stirred public debate with an April 2011 essay for the New Republic urging Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer, now 74 and also appointed by Clinton, to retire to ensure a possible Republican president not fill their seats.On Wednesday, Kennedy repeated his sentiment, telling Reuters he still thinks that ""the responsible thing"" would be for Ginsburg to step down. ""It seems to me that a justice should take into account the politics surrounding confirmation and not allow (an) opportunity to fall to a Republican,"" said Kennedy, who was a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall.University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt, who has studied judicial nominations, said Wednesday he expected to see ""opinion leaders trying to shape attitudes"" among the public as well as ""efforts through back channels to increase the pressure for her to step down.""In her interview, Ginsburg referred to past liberal commentary and predicted, ""That's going to start up again.""Brushing off political calculations, she said, ""It really has to be, 'Am I equipped to do the job?' ... I was so pleased that this year I couldn't see that I was slipping in any respect."" She said she remains energized by her work as the senior liberal, a position she has held since 2010 when Justice John Paul Stevens retired, and calls being a justice ""the best job in the world for a lawyer.""She has previously said she wanted her tenure to at least match the nearly 23 years of Justice Louis Brandeis, which would get her to April 2016, and said she had a new ""model"" in Justice Stevens, who retired at age 90 after nearly 35 years on the bench.Reinforcing the message that she might not leave before her health requires it, she mused of another former colleague, ""I wonder if Sandra regrets stepping down when she did?""Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired in January 2006 at age 75 to take care of her husband, John, who had Alzheimer's disease. He died in 2009.Ginsburg, who picked up the mantle of the liberals after Stevens' departure, took the unusual step of reading three dissenting statements from the bench in the final week of the term. Dissenting justices typically issue their statements only in writing. During one of them, on June 24, the media commented on the antics of Justice Samuel Alito, who had written the majority opinion in a job discrimination case Ginsburg was protesting, Vance v. Ball State University. As she spoke, he conspicuously rolled his eyes and screwed up his face.Alito did not respond to a request for comment.Ginsburg said she was oblivious, and only learned of his behavior from her law clerks. When she read another dissenting statement from the bench the next day, ""he did not make any faces.""Was she insulted? Her answer appeared to allude to Alito's nationally televised grimace and mouthing of ""Not true"" in response to comments Obama made in his 2010 State of the Union speech about a court campaign-finance ruling.""I'm in such good company,"" said Ginsburg. ""I'm in the company of the president.""(Reporting by Joan Biskupic; Editing by Amy Stevens, Howard Goller and Prudence Crowther)"
19698	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/20/jfk-assassination-gary-hart_n_4302598.html	other	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- As the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's death nears, former presidential candidate Gary Hart, a member of the Senate committee that investigated JFK's assassination, said that the press had failed in its responsibility to investigate the truth behind his killing.Hart served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Agencies, known as the Church committee, after chairman Frank Church. He recalled that while the committee was investigating the connection between the assassination, the Mafia and plots against Cuban President Fidel Castro, two of the three main figures involved were also killed. ""It's amazing to me that American journalism never followed up on that story very much, because if you found out who killed those two guys, you might have some really interesting information on your hands,"" Hart, who served as a Democratic senator from Colorado for two terms, told HuffPost in a recent interview.There were ""all kinds of leads"" -- had reporters followed them, he said. ""I went down to Miami when [Johnny] Roselli was killed and talked to this Dade County sheriff from the Miami Police Department, and they showed me pictures of him being fished out of the water in the barrel and how he'd been killed -- nightmarish stuff. And [Momo Salvatore] Giancana was killed in his own basement with six bullet holes in his throat with a Chicago police car and an FBI car outside his house,"" he recounted.According to CIA documents released in 2007, the agency hired Johnny Roselli, a high-ranking mobster, to eliminate Fidel Castro, offering to pay him $150,000. Roselli reportedly declined the money and worked with former FBI agent Robert A. Maheu; Giancana, Al Capone's Chicago mob successor; and Santo Trafficante Jr., a mobster involved in Cuban operations, to unsuccessfully poison Castro with pills. Roselli disappeared soon after testifying before the Church committee, and his body was found inside an oil drum near North Miami Beach. Giancana was found dead at his Chicago home before he could testify to the Church committee. While alive, Giancana and Roselli also reportedly communicated with Kennedy. In a 1988 interview with People Magazine, Judith Campbell Exner claimed she had an affair with the president, and that during that relationship she served as a courier between the president and Roselli and Giancana. The president's brother, Robert Kennedy -- then-attorney general -- called for an investigation on Giancana. The deaths of Roselli and Giancana in 1975 and 1976 occurred amid the Church committee's ongoing investigations surrounding Kennedy's assassination. That coincidence, Hart said, was suspicious enough to warrant press attention, and he was surprised that the press didn't jump on the story.""I was always amazed in that particular instance of the CIA-Mafia connection and the Cuban connection 12 years -- coming up 12 years -- after Kennedy was killed that somebody didn't go after that story,"" he said. ""New York Times, Washington Post; anybody. And they didn't. They reported the deaths and that was it, and the strange quirky coincidence, you know, but nothing more.""For Hart, the uncanny series of events roughly 12 years after Kennedy's death was less of a coincidence than an indication that people -- including Giancana -- knew more than they were letting on. ""You don't have to be a genius to believe that they knew something about the coincidence of events -- Cuba, Mafia, CIA and Kennedy -- that somebody didn't want that out in the public 12 years later,"" Hart said.At a time when his Church committee was uncovering plots against the Cuban president and the CIA's use of the Mafia in those plots, Hart was privy to other peculiarities as well. According to Hart, the Warren Commission -- the presidential commission charged with investigating Kennedy's assassination that concluded  Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone -- remained unaware of the connections between Cuba, the CIA, the Mafia and Kennedy. Only then-CIA director Allen Dulles, who was on the commission, knew, according to Hart, but Dulles said nothing to the other members. Hart also heard from William Robert Plumlee -- a former CIA contract pilot who gave classified testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then chaired by John Kerry, in the '90s -- about how he believed Kennedy was really killed. Plumlee told Hart that he'd flown a plane to Texas days before the president's assassination and had later come to believe that several people on board were connected to the murder. A report by TV producer Robert Vernon claimed that Plumlee testified that the flight -- with Roselli on board -- was an attempt to thwart the Kennedy assassination. Hart tried to uncover the truth about the Kennedy assassination and the ""big unanswered questions."" He said he worked with fellow Church committee member and former Sen. Richard Schweiker (R-Penn.), but ultimately ran out of resources and leads. During an ill-fated presidential bid in the 1980s, Hart vowed he'd reopen the Kennedy investigation if elected. In retrospect, he said it ""was probably a stupid thing to do,"" citing death threats he received. Fifty years later, the danger of digging into cases such as Kennedy's assassination is not lost on Hart. In his chiding of the press and its failure to seize the opportunity to reveal the truth about Kennedy's death, he admits that revealing such a truth -- even as a journalist -- could have dire consequences. ""You risk your life because whoever killed these two guys is still out there,"" Hart said. "
19699	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-doe-/my-husband-the-impostor_b_3989875.html	other	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	It was 1996 and I was living in Charlotte, North Carolina, trying to get out of a marriage I should have never been in in the first place. I had young children and no idea how to care for them. Shortly after I decided to separate from my husband, I met a man who I fell deeply in love with and decided to be with him at all costs. He graduated from North Carolina State University and was working as a contracted Geologist at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. Against the wishes of my family and friends, I moved to Maryland to live with him. We had lived there for a short while when he applied for a civilian job for the Defense Department as a Geologist in Aberdeen, Maryland. He had to apply for a secret security clearance for this job. He was cleared for the security clearance and got the job. We then moved to Harford County, Maryland into his childhood home. We married shortly after that. Once I had planted my feet in Maryland, I became the wife he had always wanted -- picket fence and all. He refused to let me work and wanted me to pamper him the way he felt he deserved to be pampered, and I obliged. When my girls came to Maryland, he raised them as if he were their father. He was very involved in their schooling and extra-curricular activities. I was so thankful to be married to a man who cared so much for them. He became involved in county politics, community projects, etc. We took wonderful vacations to Hawaii several times, Alaska, cross country trips. At times, I would miss North Carolina and my childhood friends but that was behind me now. Although I did not realize it at the time, we were living his life. The life he wanted.On April 15, 2010, 11 years into my marriage, I had just gotten home from taking my daughter to school (she had a month to go before graduating) when the phone rang at 7:30am. It was my husband telling me that he was being detained. I had no idea what he meant by this until I finally realized that he had been arrested. I thought for sure it had to be a road rage incident or some kind of mistake. He told me that he loved me and that he didn't blame me if I divorced him. He hung up before he told me what had happened. Within minutes of that phone call, my entire property was swarmed by police -- exactly like you would see on television. I ran outside to see what was going on, but the police would not tell me anything. They told me that I was to stay with an officer and wait for the detectives to get there. When the detectives arrived, I was told that my husband had been arrested for taking pictures outside of the window of a teenage girl's bathroom. I could not hear anything they told me. I could not breathe. I could not believe that this was true. For nine hours, my house was no longer mine. It belonged to the police. They took what they wanted out of it and did to it what they pleased. The aftermath was mine to deal with. My husband was bailed out of jail by his family and re-arrested on May 3, 2010 by the feds. This is when I learned that he had thousands of pictures and videos on his government issued computer, mostly of my daughter but also of her friends and other young girls in our community. The story became big news in Maryland and D.C. News crews were showing up at my house, our mailbox was continually bashed in, I was ostracized by my own town as if they thought I had something to do with it. To add insult to injury, I came to find out that this man that I loved so dearly had been arrested in the early '90s in the state of Ohio for doing the same exact thing! All the security clearances for his jobs with the United States government did me nor all the girls he sexually violated any good.In August 2010, he was charged with two counts of child pornography in the Maryland Federal Courts and was sentenced to serve 12 years at Fort Dix Federal Prison in New Jersey. He believes that that government is using him as an example and that what he did has been blown way out of proportion. I believe the only regret he has is that he got caught. I also believe that when he does get out, he will do this again.On April 15, 2010, my life came to a crashing halt. One phone call and the life that I knew and thought I loved was over and done. There are no words to describe the agonizing pain that I went through. Getting out of bed was impossible. I ceased to function at all. My heart was broken and all I wanted was to make the pain stop. I had a neighbor who was like a surrogate mother to me force me out of the bed and to my doctor. My doctor sent me to a therapist. Slowly, ever so slowly, I was moving again. I began re-connecting with my long lost friends from childhood on Facebook and eventually moved back to Charlotte, North Carolina where I was born and raised and where I belonged. There are a few things I have learned from this nightmare and they are this: When your family and friends strongly discourage you from doing something, listen. Whomever you may become involved with, background check them thoroughly. This may seem impersonal but it will save you from ever having to go through a needless hell like I did. And last but not least, cherish your friends. They will be everything you will ever need when you are going through your worst storms. Therapist are wonderful. We all need them from time to time but nothing, absolutely nothing, will heal you quicker than the love of precious friends.I still have days where I am desperately sad and hate the world, but the majority of my days are filled with the smiles and laughter that I thought I would never have again.

19734	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/08/ann-coulter-immigration-math_n_3562057.html	Opinion	1	None	None	Positive	Negative	huffingtonpost.com	Someone get this pundit a calculator. Rightwing columnist/professional “amnesty”-hater Ann Coulter continued to rail against the possibility of any immigration reform that would create a pathway to citizenship in a column published last week, using faulty math to press her case. Arguing, as she has in the past, that Republicans should avoid trying to cultivate Hispanics because they lean Democratic, Coulter offered the following calculation:Can I see the math on that? I can see why bringing in 30 million new Democratic voters would be good for the Democrats, but how does it help Republicans? Maybe conservatives shouldn't blindly trust the calculations of the guy who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy.This “math” is based on a few incorrect assumptions. She presumes that every undocumented immigrant currently in the country or projected to come here over the next decade is Hispanic, will become a citizen and eligible to vote, and will proceed to vote exclusively for the Democratic Party.Coulter doesn’t explain how she arrived at her figure, but it's unrealistically high. The total number of undocumented immigrants in the country right now stands at about 11.1 million, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the legislation would lead to a net increase of 9.6 million people in the United States over the next 10 years. That totals 20.7 million, not 30 million.But not all undocumented immigrants are Hispanic. Some 81 percent of immigrants residing illegally in the United States come from Latin America, according to the Pew. The CBO doesn't specify where the 9.6 million new U.S. residents, both unauthorized and authorized, would come from, but working from the assumption that it's comparable to the figure for unauthorized immigrants, we can drop that figure still further to 16.8 million. Not all of them would become citizens if the immigration reform became law, however. The proposed law specifies a 10-year-long process from legal residence to citizenship. Not everyone will go through it. Under current law, only 56 percent of legal residents become naturalized citizens with the power to vote, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. That would bring the figure down to 9.4 million, though there’s no sure way to know what naturalization rates will look like in the future. Latinos also face a major problem with voter turnout. Only 48 percent of Hispanics voted in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau -- a much smaller figure than the number of blacks (66.2 percent) and non-Hispanic whites (64.1 percent). Even more worrisome for Hispanic voters, that low turnout figure represents a drop from 2008, when 49.9 percent of Latino voters made it to the polls.  Such low turnout would once again cut the potential Latino voter impact, to about 4.5 million. Lastly, Latinos do not vote “80 percent against Republicans,” as Coulter claims in her column. They vote differently depending on the candidate in front of them. GOP contender Mitt Romney fielded 27 percent of the Hispanic vote last year, the worst performance for a presidential candidate since Bob Dole’s run in 1996. But George W. Bush -- who unlike Romney spoke some Spanish and supported immigration reform -- won 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum opened May 1 on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas after much anticipation. The $250 million library brought together all living presidents for a dedication ceremony on April 25, where they showered praise on the 43rd president of the United States.But according to the Democratic nonprofit group Bridge Project, which focuses on ""exposing the conservative movement's dishonest tactics,"" the library's version of the Bush legacy suffers from selective memory loss. Bridge Project thus created a library of its own Thursday, in the form of a website BushRewrite.org, which the group said will ""rectify the falsehoods and omissions of the Bush library.""The timing coincides with the eighth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a low point of Bush's two-term presidency. The Bush library has already been accused of glossing over Katrina, which killed 1,833 people and destroyed an estimated $81 billion in property. The library overlooks the Bush administration's delayed reaction and includes no pictures of the desperate crowds at the Louisiana Superdome or the New Orleans Morial Convention Center -- images that quickly spurred suggestions that race was a factor in the muted federal response.The halls of the Bush library ignore other disturbing facts, the Bush Rewrite states on the website. The Huffington Post was offered an exclusive look at the website, which says that the Bush White House ""was plagued by a series of scandals and controversies"" and ""policy failures."" It contains pages with what Bridge Project calls a ""stark reminder"" of Bush's true legacy, ranging from the economy, which revisits events preceeding the 2008 financial collapse, to war and national security,  which highlights the Bush administration's torture and rendition programs. The Bush Rewrite also recalls Bush's record on education, environmental policy and Social Security. In some cases, the website displays pictures taken at the Bush Library to underscore the contrast between the museum's more favorable remembrance with media reports.A section called ""The Missing Wing"" is dedicated to controversial moments under Bush's presidency that his library chose not to mention, such as the roles played by Vice President Dick Cheney and senior adviser-turned-deputy chief of staff Karl Rove, the Abu Ghraib prisoner torture scandal, and Bush's support for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.Bridge Project also uses the website to argue that congressional Republicans continue pushing policies that are harmful today.The Bush library contents are ""American fiction,"" Eddie Vale, vice president of Bridge Project, told HuffPost. ""The inaccuracies and omissions are a disservice to the annals of history, but ignoring the lessons of the Bush administration poses a threat to our nation’s future. The failure to recognize the consequences of Bush’s policy decisions is why today’s congressional Republicans are even more ambitious than Bush ever was in pursuing the policies that served as the catalyst for the crises from which we are still recovering."""

""That's not the case here.""In an interview with The Huffington Post, Vilsack said House Republican leadership's failure to move a farm bill, which included nearly $80 billion per year in food stamp subsidies, could pose major harm to the agriculture community.He also predicted that the GOP was harming itself politically, having spent the last election lambasting President Barack Obama as the ""Food Stamp President"" to no success.""I think the reason why they haven't been particularly successful with this argument is that maybe the American people recognize these food assistance programs are helping people who are struggling through no fault of theirs,"" Vilsack said, ""or who have worked their entire lives but are now living on a very small and meager Social Security check, or dealing with a disability that makes it very difficult if not impossible for them to work. I think Americans have understanding and compassion for these people.""Republicans in Congress disagree. Last month, GOP leadership brought to the floor a bill that would have cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by more than $20 billion and given states leeway to drug test recipients. To the surprise of leadership itself, the measure failed to pass, as conservative Republicans argued the cuts weren't deep enough and that the rest of the bill represented a giveaway to agribusiness. Democrats, for their part, said the food stamp cuts went too far and only a handful of them ended up supporting the legislation. It's the second consecutive year the traditional alliance between urban and rural lawmakers has failed to get a farm bill through the House. With lawmakers now at an impasse, Republicans are entertaining the idea of splitting the bill in two, and attempting to pass agricultural subsidies and food stamp payments separately.""I'd be very concerned if I were a farmer or rancher or producer if these bills were split,"" Vilsack said, adding that food stamps don't need congressional reauthorization to continue. ""On the other hand, some of these farm programs, they come up every five years and historically the way they get passed is for that coalition between urban suburban and rural legislators understanding that there's something in this bill that speaks to their constituents.""Vilsack said that if Republicans wanted to reform nutrition assistance or crop subsidies, keeping them together in a farm bill is their best chance to do so. Agriculture and nutrition advocacy lobbyists generally agree that the nutrition and farm assistance should stay together.The top Democrat in the House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), argued a twin-bill package would fail to make it through the lower chamber. (He himself said he would vote against the food stamp portion of such a package, arguing the cuts would be too deep.) Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), meanwhile, urged House leadership to simply take up the Senate's version of the farm bill, pledging that he would not support a stopgap fix like the one-year extension that was passed last year.Vilsack said that if current agriculture laws are allowed to expire at the end of September it would have damaging effects, both globally, by harming trade relations, and locally, by raising milk prices.""We spend a lot less on our food as a percentage of our income than most people around the world do,"" Vilsack said. ""It gives us a lot of flexibility with our paychecks that sometimes we fail to recognize or appreciate farmers for what they get to us."" "

19842	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/bush-library-opening_n_3156183.html	News	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"The George W. Bush Presidential Center, a museum and library that contains the historic bric-a-brac of President George W. Bush's White House, is being dedicated today. In keeping with arcane traditions, all of the living presidents of these United States are in attendance to fete the occasion. Speeches have been made, songs sung, pleasantries exchanged, and now all you need to do is Google ""What time does the George W. Bush Presidential Center open on Saturday?"" to proceed with the next step in your lives.I've not been paying very close attention to the celebration, other than to passively absorb the cable teevee coverage, which all seems to be coming straight from the lips of Dr. Pangloss to my captive ears. (A summary: Gatherings of presidents are neat-o! Look at them! They all seem to be great pals! Everyone is being so nice to President Bush. Nice things are nice!) But scrolling around the web, I now see that I should have paid more attention, because according to The New York Times' Peter Baker, President Barack Obama faced a very ""delicate task"" at this ceremony. Which surprises me, because as near as I can tell, the George W. Bush Presidential Center is not, say, testing nuclear weapons or promising war with South Korea or threatening to destabilize an entire region. (Though I guess the day is young.)Per Baker, here's why this library opening is actually a perilous moment for the Obama White House:It has become an awkward ritual of the modern presidency that the current occupant of the Oval Office is called upon to deliver a generous historical judgment of the previous one. With the opening of each new presidential library, the members of the world’s most exclusive fraternity put aside partisan differences to honor the shared experience of running the nation in difficult times.The task in such moments is especially acute when, as with Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, the current and previous presidents come from opposing parties and such different sensibilities. The incumbent must hit grace notes without appearing inconsistent with past criticism or, worse, hypocritical. Sometimes a president goes through the motions, dutifully reading what aides put before him. Other times, library dedications have become bonding moments when presidents genuinely grow closer.See, the problem facing Obama is that in key moments of his life as a politician, he has publicly assessed the Bush legacy as, you know, less than ideal. And now he has to stand in front of Bush at a big celebration and not issue a series of policy indictments. Awkward, right?At least one person Baker has talked to thinks that the policies on which Bush and Obama agree are the thornier ones:“He’s never going to say this,” [former Bush speechwriter Marc] Thiessen said, “but if he’s being totally honest, he would say that except for interrogations, he adopted almost the entire Bush counterterrorism policy, some of it voluntarily, some of it involuntarily, but most of it voluntarily.”Ha, well, Thiessen is absolutely right that Obama has pretty much continued the bulk of Bush's counterterrorism policies and ""unitary executive"" outlook -- and even expanded upon them. I'm bewildered, though, as to why anyone should expect this to come up at a museum dedication. ""Yo, where my fans of targeted extrajudicial killings at? Can I get a what-what?"" doesn't seem like a sentiment Obama is likely to offer, though I suppose it would ""make news.""And that's really the point, actually. If Baker was willing to be dead honest with his readers about the ""delicate task,"" he wouldn't couch his piece in all this gauze and mummery. He'd simply say, ""The media is going to scrutinize every detail of Obama's brief speech looking for gaffes and 'tells,' which we will then stretch into one-day stories.""That's really what this is about. Baker's piece is basically a warning that it's up to Obama to keep this non-event from becoming a pseudo-event. Obama has to navigate this little bit of oratory without seeming insincere in his remarks, or saying anything that a pundit-necromancer can spin into a dig, or doing anything funny with his gestures. Because what Baker means to say is that reporters are lying in wait to analyze his body language and pore over his word choice to divine dire meanings in preparation for articles titled, ""Obama did not use the word 'freedom'"" or ""Obama's hip-hop library dedication did not create jobs.""And what if Obama fails? This is the extraordinary thing, actually. Unlike every other ""delicate task"" that Obama could fail at this day or this week or this year, should Obama's Bush library speech be deemed less-than-satisfactory, the result will be a hot sack of nothing at all. No one's lives will be affected by anything that happens at this library today. There aren't merely low stakes, there are no stakes.I don't know why it's so hard to just admit this. Anyone who really thinks that this library opening is some sort of perilous moment for any of the attendees or speakers needs to get out more.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

That's it. Two,"" General Ray Odierno told a news conference at the annual conference of the Association of the U.S. Army.Odierno's comments came as he and Army Secretary John McHugh discussed the impact of the recent U.S. government shutdown as well as across-the-board budget cuts that forced the military to slash spending in March, nearly halfway through its fiscal year.McHugh and Odierno both appealed to Congress to find a way to give the military more financial predictability so it can plan effectively. McHugh said that with the way the military is currently funded, budgets that are approved today are based on planning that occurred three years earlier.""You can't run the most important military on the face of the Earth locked into three-year-old budgets,"" McHugh said.The Army was hit particularly hard by the cuts in March, known as sequestration, because of higher-than-projected Afghanistan war costs and the need to make up those funds from its operations accounts, which include money for training.""We had to stop training, basically, in the last six months of the year,"" Odierno said.The ongoing uncertainty with the defense budget could make the situation worse in the fiscal year that began in October. The U.S. government began the year with a shutdown that lasted nearly three weeks and put many federal workers on unpaid leave.The government resumed operations last week under a deal to fund operations at last year's spending levels and priorities.The Army chief said he hoped to be able to devote enough money to training this fiscal year to ensure that seven combat brigades are fully ready by June to respond to a conflict. He said the current lack of training was his biggest concern.A combat brigade team has about 3,500 to 5,000 soldiers.""The worst-case scenario is you ask me to deploy thousands of soldiers somewhere and we have not properly trained them to go because we simply don't have the dollars and money because of the way sequestration is laid out,"" Odierno said.Odierno said that while troops going to Afghanistan had been trained, they were ""trained now to do training and advising only. They're not trained to do combat operations ... because that's not their mission in Afghanistan any more.""The Army grew to about 570,000 uniformed personnel over the past decade. But with the war in Iraq over and the one in Afghanistan winding down, officials plan to reduce the size of the force to 490,000. The number of brigade combat teams is due to fall from a total of 45 currently down to 33.With the Pentagon increasingly likely to face cuts of nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, the Army could be forced to cut further. A management review this summer conducted by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel indicated the Army might have to shrink by up to 70,000 more soldiers, to 420,000.McHugh said that if the across-the-board cuts continue in force, essentially all of the Army's programs will be affected.Odierno also said the Army needs a replacement for its armored fighting vehicles, its workhorse Humvee vehicles and its helicopters. ""The bottom line is we can't afford all of that. And so we're going to have make some tough decisions,"" he said. (Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Will Dunham)"

Federal judge Kimba Wood officiated at the non-denominational wedding, which was attended by members of the couple's families, including the groom's five children, a source familiar with the wedding told Reuters on Saturday.For Soros, whose net worth is $20 billion according to Forbes, this will be his third marriage. It is Bolton's second.Soros put a Graff wedding band on Bolton's finger during the half-hour ceremony, according to the source.The exchange of vows will be followed by a reception, which begins at 4:30 p.m, with more than 500 guests at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, the Westchester County complex known for its Italian Renaissance-inspired buildings and lush gardens.Among the guests at the various events are World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and some foreign leaders, including Hendrik Toomas Ilves, president of Estonia; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia; and Edi Rama, prime minister of Albania.Also expected to attend are fellow titans of the hedge fund world, Paul Tudor Jones and Julian Robertson.

If they don't win some elections they're probably going to die on the vine,"" O'Connell said.A series of interviews with Tea Party activists preparing for 2014, mainly in southern states, produced a clear consensus of the path forward, with possibly unsettling implications for Republican incumbents.While mainstream Republicans nationally see the crisis of President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul as their ticket to success next November, Tea Party activists see Republican leaders' decision to end the shutdown in October as a betrayal of the fight over healthcare reform, best met with primary challenges next spring.""The Tea Party won the 2010 election for the Republicans,"" said Debbie Dooley of the Atlanta Tea Party. ""We took a back seat in 2012 and the Republicans lost. We're not going to make the same mistake in 2014.""The national criticism of the movement is failing to change many minds in the movement, either.""If we have to get hurt in the polls in order to save the country from financial ruin, so be it,"" said Ben Cunningham, a long-time conservative activist in Tennessee involved in efforts to find a challenger for Senator Lamar Alexander.Tea Party-backed primary challengers are running in South Carolina against Senator Lindsey Graham, a frequent target of Tea Party ire for his ability to compromise, and Alexander in Tennessee. There are also right-wing challenges to Senator Pat Roberts in Kansas and Thad Cochran in Mississippi. The Senate seat in Georgia left open by the impending retirement of Saxby Chambliss has a field of candidates vying for the mantle of most conservative.For many grassroots conservatives the main target is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. McConnell is well known for vowing to make Obama a one-term president, but his record of brokering deals with Obama has incensed the Tea Party.""There are many important races in 2014 that deserve attention,"" said David Adams, president of Kentucky Citizens Judicial, a group suing Kentucky's Democratic Governor Steve Beshear over the implementation of Obama's health care law. ""But in terms of taking off the head of the snake, Kentucky is it.""In Kentucky and elsewhere, some of the Tea Party's challenges are perennial: they lack name recognition, the benefits of incumbency, and their rivals raise millions of dollars to their thousands.What Tea Party activists have on their side is cheap get-out-the-vote technology, motivated volunteers, and enough past success to provide a roadmap for would-be candidates. In Kentucky, for instance, many Tea Partiers united early around a candidate, and started campaigning early, following the lead of Ted Cruz of Texas, who came from behind to win a U.S. Senate seat. BACKING ONE HORSEA national Quinnipiac University poll published Nov. 13 found 47 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of the Tea Party, the highest percentage yet. Other national polls have also shown a drop in popularity for the movement.But unlike the Republican Party's national structure, the Tea Party has become an increasingly regional phenomenon, at its strongest in Republican dominated states like Georgia or in a few battleground states like Ohio.Of 80 Republican House members who wrote to John Boehner in August arguing the House Speaker should threaten a shutdown over the healthcare law known as Obamacare, 13 represent districts in Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina.""There are parts of the country geographically and sociologically that continue to feed the Tea Party phenomenon,"" said James Henson, a politics professor at the University of Texas in Austin. ""I'd be surprised if recruitment wasn't up.""While some senior Republicans in the U.S. Senate say House Republicans and senators Cruz and Mike Lee of Utah fought a useless, self-punishing fight over the government shutdown, conservatives say were close to victory undermining Obamacare when moderate Republicans undermined them.The Tea Party also pins the narrow Nov. 5 defeat of conservative Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia's gubernatorial race on the refusal of the Republican establishment to back him.The challenge is daunting in Kentucky, Tennessee and South Carolina where McConnell, Alexander and Graham all have a big advantage in raising money. McConnell, for instance, had $10 million cash on hand at the end of September. His opponent, moderately wealthy businessman Matt Bevin, had raised less than $900,000, more than two thirds of which was his own money.McConnell had a 33 point lead over Bevin in one poll. The Senator has focused his campaign on Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, with whom he was tied, according to polling.Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said it is hard to see the challengers in Kentucky, Tennessee or South Carolina being able to win, but that Cruz's long slog ahead of the Texas primary showed a challenge could develop late.""The best you could say at the moment is the jury is out,"" he said. INDIANA PLAYBOOKTea Party activists in Kentucky and Tennessee have carefully studied the playbook adopted by activists in Indiana in their successful bid to oust former Republican Senator Richard ""Dick"" Lugar in 2012. The key to primary victory involved getting behind a single challenger in state treasurer Richard Mourdock and going door to door for months ahead of the election -- well ahead of traditional campaigns.Many Tea Party activists have rallied behind Bevin in Kentucky. Speaking at his home in Louisville in October, Bevin said he would have favored the government shutdown. McConnell's team says voters will favor politicians who get things done.Bevin said his race against McConnell would be won ""from the bottom up"" by grassroots activists and compared his opponent to the emperor with no clothes, lacking real Republican values.""If this naked emperor can be exposed, any one of them can be exposed. If we can do this at the ballot box, none of them are safe and we can send them home one at a time,"" he said, invoking other Tea Party challenges gearing up.Activists are already going door to door for the primary election in May, using get-out-the-vote software provided free of charge by Kansas-based group the Madison Project, and Tea Partiers in Tennessee are using similar technology.""The only energy in the Republican Party at the moment lies in the Tea Party,"" said Randy Keller of the Bowling Green Southern Kentucky Tea Party, a conclusion some political analysts reach as well.""The lack of a ground game is a particular point of vulnerability for Republicans like Mitch McConnell,"" said Steven Schier, a politics professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota.

John Tierney (D-Mass.), Rubén Hinojosa (D-Texas) and George Miller (D-Calif.), members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, in a statement.

John Kline (R-Minn.) said in a statement. ""Both are a disservice [to] workers, employers, and job seekers.""The legislation at issue is a bill to reauthorize and reform the Workforce Investment Act, the largest source of federal funding for job training. Republicans want to consolidate more than 30 workforce development programs into a single fund, which they say would eliminate redundant programs and cut out red tape. Democrats say the plan would make it harder for vulnerable groups like the elderly and disabled to get access to the job training they need.Committee Democrats argued that funding for job training had been a generally bipartisan issue until recently. After making little headway in negotiations, they sent committee Republicans a letter on Monday asking them to cancel the markup of the bill scheduled for Wednesday, saying that the GOP plan ""eliminates programs for the sake of eliminating programs, without any independent evaluation of whether they are in fact duplicative of one another."" Nonetheless, Republicans went ahead with their markup and approved the legislation on Wednesday. Ahead of the vote, Kline said the reforms would save taxpayer dollars that are ""wasted on failed programs"" and leave workers ""stranded in unemployment.""After discussion of the bill, Hinojosa said he would leave the committee meeting on principle, and he called on his Democratic colleagues to join him.""I have concluded that I cannot be part of a political process that continues to be highly partisan and broken,"" Hinojosa said.

20105	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/21/obama-inaugural-address_n_2521206.html	News	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama’s second inaugural address, delivered on a crisp, overcast day at the nation’s capital, was an unapologetic one. The president, who has spent the first four years navigating Washington as much as shaping it, used his platform on Monday to announce that his next four years will be marked by a more assertive approach. The speech wasn't devoid of the classic, Obama-esque ideal that the country itself, and the two political parties in particular, must come together for the common good. But the appeal he made wasn’t so much to the good nature of each individual lawmaker as it was to the need to confront the severity of the issues at hand. The president talked about protecting entitlement programs upon which the elderly and the most vulnerable in society depend. “They do not make us a nation of takers,” he declared, in a clear rebuke to the conservative House Republicans that have been his bête noire. “They free us to take the risks that make this country great.But Obama also gave a nod to items further down on the conventional list of top priorities: climate change and election reform included. The underlying theme was altogether consistent: it is time for the country's reasonable majority to wrest back the agenda. For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial, and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years, and forty years, and four hundred years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall.What the administration now confronts is the issue of legacy. The accomplishments of the first term have given Obama an already exalted status among his base. But inside the White House, there is a tangible sense of hope (and, perhaps, a bit of trepidation) about what’s to come. Immigration reform, the ending of the war in Afghanistan, the protection of gay rights, the passage of gun laws, the execution of health care and banking reform, and the revamping of the tax code and social safety net are all on the docket. The means of addressing them is the great unknown.What Monday’s speech did, more than anything else, is provide a window into those means. This isn’t the same Obama who, upon coming into office amid an economic crisis, called for an end to the politics of division. It was a more jaded, ostensibly realistic Obama, demanding that divided politics no longer be used as an excuse for inaction and promising to not accept such a cynical status quo. What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”   Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing.The president’s supporters and even casual defenders will, undoubtedly, cheer this second inaugural address in a way that they never fully did the first -- a lofty, historic but somewhat unmemorable speech. His critics will take it as affirmation of a liberal agenda that they’ve often warned is coming once the burdens of reelection are gone. Those reactions are predictable and, ultimately, disposable. What matters more is the extent to which the president acts upon the vision he outlined. The second inaugural address showcased an unapologetic president. Time will tell if Monday was just a few lines in a speech or a new, dedicated mindset for the nation's leader.

Davies, who had trained Libyan security guards for the State Department, claimed he scaled a 12-foot wall that night, knocked out a terrorist with his rifle and later saw Stevens dead in the hospital.But four days later, The Washington Post reported that Davies had told his employer shortly after the attack that he never reached the compound that night, an account that conflicted with the one he had given to “60 Minutes,"" as well as included in a memoir. The memoir was published by a conservative imprint that is a subsidiary of CBS, a financial relationship that was not disclosed at the time of the broadcast.“60 Minutes” dodged questions for several days about the conflicting accounts. Fager later told HuffPost that Davies assured him that he was at the compound that night and the account revealed by The Washington Post wasn’t accurate. On Nov. 6, Fager was still standing by the report, telling HuffPost he was “proud” of it. One day later, The New York Times reported that Davies had also told the FBI he never reached the compound, the second known instance of Davies telling a different story than the one he told on “60 Minutes” and in his book. “60 Minutes” quickly pulled the story and Logan apologized on air the following morning.McClatchy raised more questions on Nov. 13 about the accuracy of the Benghazi report, beyond the issues with Davies' account, and “60 Minutes” acknowledged that the network was doing an internal review of the broadcast.Al Ortiz, executive director of standards and practices at CBS News, presented his findings in a memo to employees obtained by The Huffington Post. He wrote that the Benghazi story “was deficient in several respects” and suggested that “the wider reporting resources of CBS News” could have been employed to obtain information from the State Department and FBI that would have called into question Davies’ account before the report aired.“It’s possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside FBI sources could have found out that Davies had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story,” Ortiz wrote. Ortiz wrote that Davies’ statement to “60 Minutes” that he lied to his employer about his whereabouts the night of the attack but was telling the truth on air “should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process.”  In addition, Ortiz wrote that Logan’s “assertions that Al Qaeda carried out the attack and controlled the hospital were not adequately attributed in her report.”Ortiz also wrote that Logan’s October 2012 foreign policy speech, in which she spoke of the need for “revenge” for the Benghazi attack, was also problematic. “From a CBS News Standards perspective, there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda, while continuing to report on the story,” Ortiz wrote. One question that remains unanswered is how “60 Minutes” first reached Davies and what role his writing a book for Threshold Editions -– an imprint of Simon & Schuster, a subsidiary of CBS –- could have played in him appearing on air. There's been speculation that Logan's husband, a former defense contractor, could have been involved in getting him on air as well.In his memo to staff, Fager wrote that he asked Logan and McClellan, the producer, to take a leave of absence, which they agreed to do. “When faced with a such an error, we must use it as an opportunity to make our broadcast even stronger,” Fager wrote. “We are making adjustments at 60 Minutes to reduce the chances of it happening again.”Full memos from Fager and Ortiz, obtained by The Huffington Post are below:By now most of you have received the report from Al Ortiz about the problems with the 60 Minutes story on Benghazi.There is a lot to learn from this mistake for the entire organization. We have rebuilt CBS News in a way that has dramatically improved our reporting abilities. Ironically 60 Minutes, which has been a model for those changes, fell short by broadcasting a now discredited account of an important story, and did not take full advantage of the reporting abilities of CBS News that might have prevented it from happening.As a result, I have asked Lara Logan, who has distinguished herself and has put herself in harm’s way many times in the course of covering stories for us, to take a leave of absence, which she has agreed to do. I have asked the same of producer Max McClellan, who also has a distinguished career at CBS News. As Executive Producer, I am responsible for what gets on the air. I pride myself in catching almost everything, but this deception got through and it shouldn’t have. When faced with a such an error, we must use it as an opportunity to make our broadcast even stronger. We are making adjustments at 60 Minutes to reduce the chances of it happening again. There is a lot of pride at CBS News. Every broadcast is working hard to live up to the high standard set at CBS News for excellence in reporting. This was a regrettable mistake. But there are many fine professionals at 60 Minutes who produce some of the very best of broadcast journalism, covering the important and interesting stories of our times, and they will continue to do so each and every Sunday. Jeff Fager Chairman, CBS News Executive Producer, 60 Minutes  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS  My review found that the Benghazi story aired by 60 Minutes on October 27 was deficient in several respects:  --From the start, Lara Logan and her producing team were looking for a different angle to the story of the Benghazi attack. They believed they found it in the story of Dylan Davies, written under the pseudonym, “Morgan Jones”. It purported to be the first western eyewitness account of the attack. But Logan’s report went to air without 60 Minutes knowing what Davies had told the FBI and the State Department about his own activities and location on the night of the attack. --The fact that the FBI and the State Department had information that differed from the account Davies gave to 60 Minutes was knowable before the piece aired. But the wider reporting resources of CBS News were not employed in an effort to confirm his account. It’s possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside FBI sources could have found out that Davies had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story.   --Members of the 60 Minutes reporting team conducted interviews with Davies and other individuals in his book, including the doctor who received and treated Ambassador Stevens at the Benghazi hospital. They went to Davies’ employer Blue Mountain, the State Department, the FBI (which had interviewed Davies), and other government agencies to ask about their investigations into the attack. Logan and producer Max McClellan told me they found no reason to doubt Davies’ account and found no holes in his story. But the team did not sufficiently vet Davies’ account of his own actions and whereabouts that night.--Davies told 60 Minutes that he had lied to his own employer that night about his location, telling Blue Mountain that he was staying at his villa, as his superior ordered him to do, but telling 60 Minutes that he then defied that order and went to the compound. This crucial point – his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions – should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process.--After the story aired, the Washington Post reported the existence of a so-called “incident report” that had been prepared by Davies for Blue Mountain in which he reportedly said he spent most of the night at his villa, and had not gone to the hospital or the mission compound. Reached by phone, Davies told the 60 Minutes team that he had not written the incident report, disavowed any knowledge of it, and insisted that the account he gave 60 Minutes was word for word what he had told the FBI. Based on that information and the strong conviction expressed by the team about their story, Jeff Fager defended the story and the reporting to the press.--On November 7, the New York Times informed Fager that the FBI’s version of Davies’ story differed from what he had told 60 Minutes. Within hours, CBS News was able to confirm that in the FBI’s account of their interview, Davies was not at the hospital or the mission compound the night of the attack. 60 Minutes announced that a correction would be made, that the broadcast had been misled, and that it was a mistake to include Davies in the story. Later a State Department source also told CBS News that Davies had stayed at his villa that night and had not witnessed the attack. --Questions have been raised about the recent pictures from the compound which were displayed at the end of the report, including a picture of Ambassador Stevens’ schedule for the day after the attack. Video taken by the producer-cameraman whom the 60 Minutes team sent to the Benghazi compound last month clearly shows that the pictures of the Technical Operations Center were authentic, including the picture of the schedule in the debris.--Questions have also been raised about the role of Al Qaeda in the attack since Logan declared in the report that Al Qaeda fighters had carried it out. Al Qaeda’s role is the subject of much disagreement and debate. While Logan had multiple sources and good reasons to have confidence in them, her assertions that Al Qaeda carried out the attack and controlled the hospital were not adequately attributed in her report.--In October of 2012, one month before starting work on the Benghazi story, Logan made a speech in which she took a strong public position arguing that the US Government was misrepresenting the threat from Al Qaeda, and urging actions that the US should take in response to the Benghazi attack. From a CBS News Standards perspective, there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda, while continuing to report on the story.--The book, written by Davies and a co-author, was published by Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, part of the CBS Corporation. 60 Minutes erred in not disclosing that connection in the segment.

20187	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/01/ashley-madison-creator_n_2993008.html	other	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"More than 18 million people in 26 countries frequent AshleyMadison.com, a dating site for married people looking to have affairs.But while unsatisfied marrieds browse the site looking to hookup, the man behind the site -- creator Noel Biderman -- has been happily married for nearly 10 years. HuffPost Divorce spoke to Noel and his wife, Amanda -- who's featured on the company's new billboard campaign -- in separate phone conversations to discuss the secret to their relationship success, how Amanda reacted when Noel initially told her about his idea for the site, and why Noel believes cheating actually saves marriages. Amanda, how did you react when Noel first told you about his plan to create an infidelity dating site? Were you supportive? Resistant?Amanda: Originally, I wanted to make sure it wasn’t an emotional or personal issue...an emotional or physical thing that he was grappling with. Once I understood that it was a sound business [idea], that there was a market he felt was under-serviced, I was totally behind him. Noel: We weren’t even married at the time, so she easily could have said, “I think there’s something flawed with this human being.” Instead, she saw the passion in which I wanted to pursue this and she wanted to match that passion. I knew I had a true partner. Noel, you've said that your website saves marriage and that an affair can serve as a ""marriage preservation device."" Can you talk a little more about that? Noel: I definitely believe that. For me, I’m a married man now -- 10 years later, two children later, a really good economic success later, and with an extended family I love, I would be a fool if I said sex was the most important thing in my marriage –- it’s not. [But] it's important to me, I’m not a priest and I didn’t sign up for a life of celibacy. If I woke up today in some kind of sexless marriage like so many Americans do, I would be genuinely upset by that. I would try to change it with my partner, but if I couldn’t change it, I don’t know if I would just walk out the door. I believe the social science, I’ve seen it firsthand, how children raised in single-parent households have more trouble with drugs and alcohol, have fewer educational opportunities, and get in trouble with the law. I don’t want to do that to my family and I certainly don’t want to do that because everything else I have going for me is great. I like my lifestyle, so why would I give it all up because the number five or six thing on my list -– my sex life -– is not where it should be? So yes, if my brother came to me and said I can't take it anymore, I'm either leaving or I'm having an affair, I would encourage him to have an affair first. Amanda, would you stay in a marriage where you knew your husband was being unfaithful for the sake of keeping your family together?Amanda: I wouldn’t just walk into divorce. But, I mean, I also wouldn’t deal with a relationship where I knew there were interpersonal relations going on without me. We definitely differ on that point. I get that some people are doing this to fulfill a need and to make themselves more fulfilled and happier. I’m not here to judge those people. Personally, that’s not how I live my life. That’s not how I live my life and how I define my relationship and what I would accept moving forward.Has running a site like AshleyMadison informed how you behave in your own marriage in any way? Noel: Ironically, I talk about infidelity more than any man on the planet, so hopefully I can navigate a monogamous relationship more successfully than a lot of people. But even then, I don’t know if I can, but I’m going to try. Monogamy is a man-made notion –- it’s not in our DNA. It’s not what we’re engineered for. We might think it’s a noble cause and something worth pursuing, but anything against our DNA is something we’re going to struggle with... I’ve seen study after study showing that the longer a couple is together, the more their sex life diminishes. I’ve yet to see any one where it says, “Twenty years later, those two are still hot and heavy” -– it just doesn’t play out that way. We’re working against something... So it's with that knowledge base that I keep coming back to my own marriage in a different way. While we don’t have an open marriage in a sexual sense, we have a very open marriage in the sense that we can challenge and ask a lot of things of one another because we understand how important our marriage is and how often it can become turbulent. My wife and I have a very honest relationship with each other -- blunt almost. I think getting things off our chests is the approach we took, knowing that it won’t always go our way but at least it’s out there for the other partner to deal with. That’s kind of suited us. We’re very passionate and when things are great, we ride really high. We also have our moments, but we definitely don’t sleep on the issue –- and I think that’s the secret to our success today. Amanda: I think we’re lucky that his role as CEO of Ashley Madison has helped us understand the pitfalls more than anybody else. I also walked into this marriage open-eyed about the realities of relationships because my parents divorced when I was relatively young. I’ve had to deal with the aftermath of that and it wasn’t a nice divorce... I’m 38 years old and I’m still dealing with aftermath of that. I just always wanted to have a relationship where I never ended it in divorce. Outside of my own experience with divorce, this business has just made us stronger and more communicative. For a lot of people...you meet your spouse, you fall in love, you have this relationship and then kids come and work and life gets stressful and you move so far away from that person that you forget. I think this business has made us remember to always come back to what initially brought us together, so that we can keep the conversation going and not have things build up where we’re looking to move away from each other."

The last one, as I understand it, was yesterday,"" Reid told reporters on Tuesday.""All they talk about is, Mr President, what are you going to do?"" Reid said. ""He's already done things a number of people in my caucus, they're not wild about. But he's put forward his proposal. The Republicans refuse to come up with anything in writing.""Obama has offered Republicans a change in the way cost-of-living increases are calculated, using a less-generous measure of inflation, but has demanded additional tax increases on the wealthy. Many Democrats have balked at the proposal because it would effectively reduce Social Security payments to seniors in future years. TAX REVENUE ROADBLOCKMcDonough and other members of Obama's economic team are continuing to meet with the Republican group, which also includes Senators Kelly Ayotte, John Hoeven, Lindsey Graham, Bob Corker, John McCain and Tom Coburn, a senior administration official said.The official said the talks would continue, despite not yielding any results so far. To date the Republican senators have not offered specific proposals and have not agreed to put revenues on the table.""Obviously the challenge is that the administration wants $583 billion in higher taxes and that just doesn't work for us,"" said Hoeven, of North Dakota. ""Revenues should come through economic growth, not higher taxes. That's the stumbling block.""He said, however, that Obama's cost-of-living proposal shows there is room for agreement in some areas to reform benefit programs known as entitlements.A more immediate problem for Congress, however, will be reconciling deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans over spending on discretionary programs ranging from education to the military, and replacing the across-the-board sequester cuts with savings elsewhere.If these issues can't be resolved before the end of September, the government faces a strong risk of shutting down over lack of funding as the new fiscal year gets underway on Oct. 1.Time is already running short, as Congress starts a five-week recess on Friday, and has scheduled only nine legislative days in September.Reid said Democrats were ready to negotiate any size fiscal agreement - ""a big deal, a middle-sized deal, any kind of a deal. But you can't do it unless Republicans agree.""On Wednesday, Obama will come to Capitol Hill to meet with Democrats in both the House and Senate to discuss his plans for tax reform, job growth and budget issues.

He asked Trump whether he ""could be taken seriously as a presidential candidate"" and to respond to criticism that his talk of running is merely a ""publicity stunt."" Trump said that he is considering running.On Sunday, Media Matters blasted ABC News' decision to host Trump on the program. ""Trump is unlikely to be an actual candidate in this election or any other, and never has been- why would ABC News allow itself to be used for yet another round of promotional appearances for a charlatan?"" the organization wrote.

Trump was the butt of many jokes during the 2012 campaign, as he repeatedly teased his potential candidacy (he eventually endorsed Mitt Romney) and alleged that President Obama was not born in the United States. In one particularly ridiculous stunt, he offered Obama $5 million if the president released his college transcript and passport records. "

The singer -- who describes herself as ""a Republican at heart"" -- then said she would vote for Obama ""again"" after he announced his support for gay marriage. The ""American Idol"" alum counts Sen. Chuck Schumer among her Washington fans.

Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder and Usher were among those who scored inauguration weekend gigs.One of the President's favorite genres was celebrated at the Hip-Hop Inaugural Ball, where rappers 2 Chainz and MC Lyte and singer John Legend were honored at the Sunday night event.

Mitch McConnell, and to begin unveiling her own positions in the high-profile Kentucky Senate race.With an icy smile, the 34-year-old Grimes scoffed at the notion that she was philosophically or politically close to President Barack Obama, who is so unpopular here that he is mentioned by Kentucky Democrats fewer times than Voldemort ever was at Hogwarts.“The president and I disagree on a lot of things,” she said. “Sen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.“Well, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen. McConnell is a Chippendale dancer.”It was funny -– and definitely not nice. Even the thought of the doughy, 71-year-old McConnell in a dancer’s outfit might be enough to cost him a sixth term. In a wide-ranging, half-hour interview, Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Senate nominee for 2014, told me that she was pro-choice down the line on abortion, and that she would delay the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.The two statements were her first substantive comments on policy matters. Until now she has spent most of her time attacking McConnell as the embodiment of all that is corrupt and unproductive about Washington.The interview took place on the eve of the 133rd annual Fancy Farm Picnic, a church-sponsored day of politicking and speechifying on a rural expanse in the far-western Purchase region of Kentucky.Grimes is one of five daughters in a devout Catholic family in Lexington. “I am a practicing Catholic,” she told me. “But I’m also for separation of church and state. I am supportive of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. And I think that this is the kind of choice that has to be up to the woman, her God and her doctor.”On the Affordable Care Act -– Obama’s signature legislative measure -– Grimes was cautiously critical. “I am troubled by some of the provisions,” she said, and for the first time said exactly which one.“There are 700,000 businesses in Kentucky and I am concerned that especially the smaller ones are overburdened,” she said.Her suggestion: delay the imposition of the coverage mandate on small business, as the president already has done for larger corporations.“The mandate will not work for many small businesses in Kentucky,” she said, “so I believe that a delay is the right course so that changes can be made.”She also blasted McConnell for wanting to abandon the law altogether, pointing out that the state’s health ratings are among the worst in the nation, and that other provisions in the law will extend coverage to an estimated 600,000 more Kentuckians.“Unlike Sen. McConnell, I don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water,” she said. Of course McConnell is being blasted by tea party conservatives for his refusal -– so far -– to sign a letter that would force the issue by tying the next budget and debt-ceiling bills to the “defunding” of the ACA.“He has a tightrope to walk,” Grimes observed, not sympathetically.Her opening gambits on the issues are revealing for what they show about her beliefs and the strategy -- disagree with Washington Democratic orthodoxy when she can; hew to it when it is useful.A pure pro-choice view is a must in the Democratic Party, if for no other reason than so many women activists are motivated to vote for –- and work for -– the party because of their strong belief in that view.Grimes clearly wants to tap the fast-growing power of women in the Democratic Party, a phenomenon with a surprisingly long history in Kentucky politics.She stressed the female mentors in her life -– a teacher who taught her rhetoric, her mother and grandmothers, her four sisters. She proudly stated that she is the “youngest female secretary of state in the nation.”It sounded like a rather obscure claim when she made it at the Marshall County Bean Supper in nearby Kentucky Lakes on Friday night.But it drew a big round of applause -– even bigger than the one Marshall County Judge/Executive Mike Miller got when he auctioned off a donated “whole hog” for $350.Her speech was primarily sound-bitten attacks on McConnell. It was well received, if only because Democratic loyalists deeply despise McConnell.But to win -– she is in a dead-heat in some recent polls –- she will have to come of age on the fly in the midst of a grueling, 15-month race from here to November 2014.Nobody really knows who she is or what she really stands for, but she began the process of saying so Friday night.Next stop, Fancy Farm.

20268	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/30/marco-rubio-immigration-bill_n_3358191.html	News	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	huffingtonpost.com	"By Caren BohanWASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - Republican Senator Marco Rubio's repeated criticism of parts of the sweeping U.S. immigration bill he helped craft has unsettled immigration reform advocates and others who support its passage.Rubio, a Cuban-American lawmaker from Florida seen as a possible 2016 presidential contender, has consistently defended the bill's centerpiece - providing legal status for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.But he has publicly said he wants changes to the bill and said last week that he agreed with some of the concerns voiced in a letter by 150 prominent conservatives who oppose the legislation. He also told CNBC that it would not pass without changes.His office also raised eyebrows a few weeks ago when it circulated a memo to other Senate staff listing 21 concerns with the bill and ideas for changing what would be the biggest overhaul of federal immigration law in decades.Frank Sharry, head of the immigration advocacy group America's Voice, said Rubio's comments made him ""anxious"" and cautioned that the lawmaker must avoid taking his message too far.""Rubio is uniquely qualified to talk to conservatives about immigration reform,"" Sharry said. ""On the other hand, if he thinks now that he's the face of immigration reform, that he's going to drive this bill in a direction that makes it less palatable for the progressive coalition that created the political space for reform, it's going to be a huge problem.""Rubio, however, has said that failure to heed his concerns could endanger the prospect of overhauling immigration law, an issue that has historically divided conservatives and the American left.As the most high-profile conservative in the bi-partisan ""Gang of Eight"" senators who labored for months to craft the legislation, Rubio will play a key role when it comes up for debate in the Democratic-controlled chamber.Selling the bill is a delicate balancing act for Rubio. His comments are intended to build trust with conservatives, who have traditionally opposed immigration reform, but he must avoid alienating Democrats, whose support is also vital for passage.While enactment of the bill could help Rubio's overall presidential prospects, it could cost him support in crucial early-voting conservative states such as Iowa and South Carolina.Rubio has won credit from Democrats for backing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Pushing the economic case for the bill's passage, Rubio argues that new visa programs for foreign workers could boost America's global competitiveness, especially in the technology sector.Yet he has often qualified his support by making clear he favors toughening the enforcement provisions of the bill, which are seen as politically necessary to get many Republicans' support for giving legal status to undocumented immigrants.In a town hall-style appearance on Fox News last week, Rubio said he wanted to see the bill go farther to boost security on the southern U.S. border with Mexico. Asked about conservatives' mistrust of the Obama administration on border enforcement, he replied, ""You've hit on the exact point.""Rubio promised to consider revisions that would put Congress in charge of creating a border security plan rather than the Department of Homeland Security as currently called for in the bill. ""Unless we get people's confidence that we are going to secure the border, this bill won't pass,"" he said. SELLING TO CONSERVATIVESAs a frequent guest on conservative radio and television programs, Rubio has a broad platform. And his arguments have converted some talk show hosts, including Mike Gallagher who acknowledged recently that he had been won over to supporting the central focus of the bill.But David Leopold, general counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which supports immigration reform, said Rubio was ""pushing the envelope.""""Rubio needs to back up this bill,"" Leopold said. ""To offer a bill, to sit down and roll up your sleeves and write a bill with Democrats - I'm not going to discount that that took guts - but in that same vein, he needs to go into his caucus and sell this bill as a champion and not as a critic.""Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, which supports immigration reform, said some of Rubio's comments were ""off-putting.""But he added that Rubio's approach might turn out to be a shrewd way of reaching out and showing fellow conservatives that he is listening to their concerns. ""He does have a difficult role in trying to sell this package to conservatives.""Rubio's spokesman Alex Conant emphasized that the lawmaker was not the only member of the Gang of Eight to say publicly that more work was needed to pass the bill in the Senate.Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a Cuban-American from New Jersey, told Univision in an interview that the supporters ""don't currently have"" the minimum 60 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate.""After the last four or five months, I don't think anybody should question Senator Rubio's commitment to passing immigration reform,"" Conant said. That commitment is ""why he says we need to be open-minded about criticisms and we need to be open-minded about improving the bill,"" Conant said.Fitz warned that Rubio ""may be creating expectations that aren't going to be able to be met"" in terms of promises to toughen border security.Other Republican members of the Senate's Gang of Eight, including Senators John McCain, Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham, also are expected to push for the bill within their party.""I think Rubio is critical,"" said Rebecca Tallent, a former aide to McCain who is now director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, which supports immigration reform.""He speaks to a lot of the folks who wouldn't necessarily be inclined to vote for something like this but Senator McCain brings the historical context and has a leadership role within the party and is good at building coalitions,""In at least one recent closed-door meeting with Republicans, Rubio was even more blunt than he has been in public about what he sees as the bill's flaws, according to participants.""The message was not, 'Listen, I've come up with a really good bill that we need to support it.' It was, 'This is a terribly flawed bill but it moves the ball forward and over the next weeks and months, it will move ever rightward,'"" said a conservative who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity."

But Democrats have been remarkably successful at tapping huge numbers of small donors like Snider and Caliendo, who give over and over. That success may translate beyond money in next year's elections. As Caliendo noted, ""Smaller donors are where the votes are at.""More than 15 percent of the DCCC's $65.2 million in fundraising through October -- or $10.1 million -- came from more than 11,700 donors who did not make a contribution in the 2012 election cycle, according to a review of Federal Election Commission records by The Huffington Post. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $5.7 million from more than 4,200 donors who did not give in 2012. Through October, the NRCC had raised $52.4 million.More than half of the new DCCC donors made more than one contribution. Nearly 700 individuals made 10 or more donations. These repeat donors accounted for $3.4 million of the new donor money raised by the committee. That may only be one-third of the total raised from new donors, but these repeat donors are far more likely to keep giving through Election Day 2014.While the DCCC is successfully getting new donors to pony up multiple times, the NRCC is struggling. Just 28 percent of new NRCC donors made more than one contribution. Only 19 individual donors made more than 10 contributions.The NRCC, heavily reliant on big donors, received more than half of its new money from donors giving $10,000 or more. Donors giving $1,000 or more accounted for 90 percent of all new contributions to the Republican committee.The NRCC did not respond to a request for comment.Big donors also played a huge role for the DCCC, with 47 percent of its new donor funds coming from those giving $10,000 or more. Two-thirds of the new money came from donors making a contribution of $1,000 or more.But donors giving less than $1,000 accounted for one-third of the new DCCC money. The NRCC raised 10 percent from that category of donors. These donors do not include those giving less than $200, the threshold for public disclosure of a donor's name and amount they gave.Controversy has aided the Democrats' fundraising successes. The committee's two best fundraising months, among both overall and new donors, came during the 16-day government shutdown in October and the political standoff that led up to it. ""Mainly my giving works when [Republicans have] done something really stupid, made a really stupid remark, and the [DCCC] comes out with their thing saying can you give $5,"" Caliendo explained. ""In one week I think I gave like $250 because I was so mad. That was leading into the shutdown.""The elevation of Democrats' enemies, like the austerity-promoting House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), also helped rake in money. The DCCC's third-best fundraising month came in March, after the House passed Ryan's budget, which would have cut Social Security and Medicare benefits.“Every time House Republicans denigrate women, double down on millionaires over the middle class or push their agenda to hurt seniors, our grassroots supporters step up -- and, needless to say, it’s happened a lot this year,"" DCCC digital director Brandon English said.These strategies are at the heart of the DCCC's successful digital fundraising program. The committee has carefully tailored its appeals to Democratic partisans, angry at the tea party and the Koch brothers. This is done through a stream of emails to the DCCC's massive list of supporters.""Once you've given once, if you give them your email, you get lots of emails,"" Snider said.Some help the DCCC raise more money. Randall Redmon, a bagger and janitor at a Kroger supermarket in Versailles, Ky., has made more than 56 contributions totaling $370. He posts every fundraising email he gets from the DCCC to Facebook and Twitter to try to help raise more money than he can give himself.""If they say that Republicans are trying to steal something or take away something, I'm trying to get as many people as I can to help stop them,"" Redmon said. ""That's what I do. I spread the word.""Supporters can set up a recurring donation to keep their support flowing, as Caliendo, Snider and Redmon, among many others, have done.The DCCC also raises money through an online store, a tactic pioneered by the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. ""Sometimes I buy stuff from their store and that's like a contribution, too,"" Redmon said. ""Sweaters and stuff, and shirts.""These new Democratic donors will likely continue to pile on contributions whenever the DCCC amplifies the actions of House Republicans. But there are always some important factors that could lead some to cut off their giving.""It depends on how things are going with polls and my finances and my job,"" Snider said.Aaron Bycoffe contributed reporting. This story has been updated to include comment from the DCCC."

Federal law bars officials from soliciting any organization or individual with whom they do business or regulate.Enroll America is run by the president's former campaign backers to do something Congress refused to fund: sell ""Obamacare"" to the public.An HHS statement last week said that since March Sebelius solicited financial donations for Enroll America from H&R Block Inc, the tax preparation company, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropic entity devoted to public health issues. Asked Monday for a list of all solicitations before or after March, an HHS spokesman referred Reuters to the department's original statement.Neither H&R Block nor the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation are regulated by HHS, the department's spokesman said, so there was nothing improper or illegal about soliciting them.Enroll America is intended to serve as the private sector flagship for a massive public outreach campaign intended to get millions of uninsured Americans to sign up for subsidized insurance coverage through new online marketplaces, or exchanges, that will begin open enrollment on Oct. 1. NO COMMITMENTH&R Block said it has made no commitment to Enroll America. ""We received a phone call from the Secretary during which the Secretary discussed supporting Enroll America,"" the company said in a statement. ""While we took her suggestion under consideration, we have made no commitment,"" it said.The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said in a statement that it had ""recently approved new funding"" for Enroll America, bringing its total contributions to the group to nearly $14 million since 2010. It did not say how much of that, if any, came in response to Sebelius' solicitation.It's the second controversy over the novel method used by the Obama administration to promote its agenda: using campaign-style organizations staffed with loyalists and former campaign or White House aides to mobilize grassroots support for government policies. The first involved Organizing for Action, an independent non-profit group seeking to harness both the energy and personnel from Obama's re-election campaign in support of the president's legislative agenda.The Enroll America issue is complicated by the fact that Republicans in Congress have succeeded in blocking proposed government spending that otherwise could have been used to achieve the ends pursued by the independent group.That has given lawmakers, such as Republican U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander, an opening to allege a violation of the federal ""anti-deficiency"" act, which bars agencies from accepting ""voluntary"" services except when authorized by law.In defense of the help the department is getting from Enroll America, an HHS spokesman said it is permitted by a section of the Public Health Service Act that allows the secretary to encourage support for new and innovative health programs.Some conservative legal experts say finding a clear-cut violation of the law is a long shot. ""I would be skeptical of the claim that it's illegal, unless someone made a really compelling case. However, the appearance is such that it at least raises questions,"" said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western University who opposes healthcare reform.But legal issues may be the least of the concerns for supporters of the healthcare law.They worry that a political storm over Obamacare, with congressional hearings likely, could discourage private donors to Enroll America and jeopardize the administration's ability to find the funds needed to reach a public that is already largely unaware of the healthcare reforms.One of the biggest concerns is that younger, healthier people will not sign up for health plans on the exchanges, driving the costs up for coverage of the people who do sign up.""The danger"" to the health program, said former Obama healthcare adviser Nancy-Ann DeParle, ""is that people don't come and enroll and get insured. That leaves the health plans in the exchanges trying to cover people without any young, healthy people, and it drives the price up."" REPUBLICANS PROMISE PROBESRepublicans certainly see an opportunity.""Our guys on the Hill think this is the fourth scandal,"" said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. ""It fits into that narrative Republicans are building not only about incompetence in the executive branch but also dishonesty.""""This is a good issue for Republicans,"" Mackowiak added. ""We want to maximize it.""The Republican-controlled House Energy and Commerce Committee has launched an investigation into the fundraising to determine whether it involved regulated companies and has asked nearly a dozen healthcare firms including major insurers such as Aetna Inc, a member of Enroll America's advisory council, to say whether they have received solicitations.Republicans in the House and Senate have also called on the non-partisan Government Accountability Office to investigate.""People are watching it very closely. We're hearing about it from constituents, people who are incredibly concerned,"" said Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn.Enroll America was launched in September 2011 in part by leaders of Families USA, a key backer of the healthcare reform effort as it moved through Congress in 2009 and 2010. It is led by Anne Filipic, who worked on public engagement projects in the Obama White House. It's managing director, Chris Wyant, directed Obama's eastern Ohio field operation during the 2012 election campaign.It includes on its boards of directors and advisers, executives of Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Blue Shield of California, Kaiser Permanente, and CVS Caremark as well as officials of major health-related trade associations, such as the American Hospital Association and the National Association of Health Underwriters.Filipic said she is confident that Enroll America will get the funds it needs for the outreach campaign.

Steve King (R-Iowa) in 2012 that he was a huge fan, and now it turns out that the two share a knack for drawing controversial comparisons when it comes to immigration policy.Cuccinelli made his strange remark during a radio interview in 2012. Speaking on the conservative radio show ""The Morning Majority,"" the attorney general launched into a critique of Washington, D.C.'s pest control policies, which he claimed protected rats from being killed.""They have to relocate the rats. And, not only that, that’s actually not the worst part, they cannot break up the families of the rats!"" Cuccinelli said, incorrectly suggesting that the District’s 2010 Wildlife Protection Act forced pest control specialists to dump them across the river in Virginia.Cuccinelli then made his comparison.""So, anyway, it is worse than our immigration policy,"" he said. ""You can't break up rat families. Or raccoons, and all the rest, and you can't even kill 'em. It's unbelievable.""It's unclear what Cuccinelli meant by that -- perhaps that he believes the nation's immigration policy is better because it allows for immigrant families to be broken up -- but the comments come to light as the gubernatorial candidate attempts to finesse his position on immigration reform. In the past week, he's expressed positions that make him sound like both a moderate and a hardliner on the issue, depending on the audience.As for King, one of Cuccinelli's favorite congressmen, he recently drew widespread criticism from both sides of the aisle after suggesting that many undocumented immigrants who had been brought here as children were acting as drug mules. He said they'd developed ""calves the size of cantaloupes"" from their illicit work.King has been one of the most rigid opponents of immigration reform efforts over the past years, a stance that he's developed not just through legislative efforts, but also through divisive comments he's made about immigrants themselves. He recently was forced to explain remarks he made in 2012 in which he compared immigrants to dogs."

Marshall, doomsday might be just around the corner.That's why the Prince William County Republican wants to prepare Virginia for the impact of a major financial meltdown, caused by hyperinflation, cyberattacks on banks and the Federal Reserve's increasing control over the nation's money supply.What if your credit or debit cards won't work tomorrow and you have no access to your money? How do you continue to conduct commerce in these emergency situations?To protect Virginians and their assets, Marshall has drafted legislation with the goal to give Virginia its own currency.House Joint Resolution 590, which passed by a two-thirds vote in the House of Delegates last week, would establish a 10-member joint subcommittee consisting of eight legislators and two non-legislative Virginia residents who would study the feasibility ""of a metallic-based monetary unit.""Marshall said the new currency would not replace but compete with the U.S. dollar.""It would be an additional vehicle of trade and commerce,"" he said.The study's projected $17,440 cost would justify the means, he added.""That's very cheap, just about what one delegate makes a year,"" he said.His concern that the dollar might not always be available prompted him to introduce this measure, Marshall said.""There are sniper attacks going on right now from foreign powers on our financial institutions,"" he said. ""If they succeed, you're not going to be able to buy gas with a credit card. If you are on Medicaid, you won't get a debit card to buy food at the grocery store. A whole bunch of transactions are going to cease.""A simple way around this, Marshall said, would be to require at least the 81 state-chartered banks to issue checks to all account holders ""so they can carry on commerce, so they can buy food, gasoline, pay their rent and electricity.""Marshall's idea isn't new. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, a passionate advocate for the abolishment of the Federal Reserve -- who has run for president as a Libertarian and as a Republican -- previously introduced his ""Free Competition in Currency Act"" in Congress.The measure, which would have allowed states to introduce their own currencies, was never signed into law but was reintroduced last month by Georgia Rep. Paul C. Broun, a Republican.The proposals have gained support, especially among some Republicans and tea party groups nationwide, who worry about the Fed's continuing infusions of cash into the economy and who are pushing for a return to the ""gold standard"" that would require the U.S. dollar to be backed by gold reserves.The guarantee of the convertibility of dollars into gold on demand was first established in 1944 at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce under the Bretton Woods Agreement. But in 1971, the measure was abandoned under Republican President Richard Nixon.Since President Barack Obama's first election in 2008, several states have pursued legislative efforts for currency creation. These efforts face legal challenges, because while individual localities are permitted to issue their own currency -- as long as it is distinguishable from U.S. dollars -- the Constitution bans states from printing their own paper money or issuing their own paper currency.But Article 1, Section 10 also leaves states the option to mint coins to be used for debt service -- a loophole that some use as a step toward currency creation.At least 13 other states -- Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Washington -- have explored the option of issuing their own currency.To date, only Utah has passed such legislation, recognizing gold and silver coins issued by the U.S. Mint, like Silver Eagles and American Gold, as a legal form of payment.Marshall introduced legislation in 2011 that authorized the governor to direct the state treasurer to mint ""gold, platinum and silver coins for commemorative use that bear the seals of the commonwealth."" The bill passed in both houses and was signed into law.Two years ago, Marshall complained that his bill had been mischaracterized as an attempt to mint a separate currency for Virginia -- bringing criticism that he offered an alternative to the Federal Reserve. ""Some hysterical comments,"" he said.That was then. But now, Marshall is serious about taking that next step.""Virginia has to do this, we need to be prepared,"" he said. ""We have to anticipate this so we don't descend into social chaos. When you got massive inflation, you are setting up the stage for dictatorships. We don't need that in this country.""But experts say Marshall's fears are not grounded in reality.""There is no chance whatsoever that hyperinflation will happen in the United States,"" said Michael Smitka, professor of economics at Washington and Lee University. ""Only countries that are on the brink of a complete political breakdown ever face this.""Smitka said Japan, a country with an economic system most similar to that of the U.S., has never experienced hyperinflation after its 1991 economic meltdown.""After all this time, what they have is outright deflation, not inflation, much less hyperinflation,"" he said. But slight, one-digit inflation, as the U.S. experiences, is manageable, he said.Cyberattacks are even less likely to cause serious damage, Smitka said.""Banks are very careful with their Internet systems. Anyone suggesting that a cyberattack can bring down an entire centralized system has no understanding of how it works,"" he said.A system that can be trusted is already in place, Smitka said.""Who are they going to put in to run the Virginia monetary system? I'd fear the competence of a state-level monetary board and state-level financial regulation more than the federal level,"" he said.The Fed is prepared for national emergencies, Smitka said.""The Federal Reserve in Richmond has multiple billions in cash reserves that can be infused into the Virginia economy if needed,"" he said.Democrats also slammed Marshall's proposal.""House GOP put on tin foil hats in late-night session,"" was the headline of a statement released by the Virginia House Democratic Caucus last week. Caucus chairman Mark D. Sickles, D-Fairfax, called the debate over this legislation ""political theatrics.""Marshall stands by his measure, which the state Senate has referred to the Rules Committee.""It's a serious effort dealing with a serious problem,"" he said.But Marshall -- who suggested in 2011 to name a Virginia currency ""Ginny"" -- said he has not given any thought to whose head he would want to grace the commonwealth's coin.""We are not at that point yet,"" he said. ""But it won't be mine.""mschmidt@timesdispatch.com(804) 649-6537 ___(c)2013 the Richmond Times-Dispatch (Richmond, Va.)Visit the Richmond Times-Dispatch (Richmond, Va.) at www.timesdispatch.comDistributed by MCT Information Services"

Jesse Jackson Jr. was charged Friday with violating federal law by misusing campaign funds -- and his wife Sandi Jackson was also charged with filing false joint tax returns.According to the Chicago Tribune, Jackson is accused of conspiring with his wife, formerly a Chicago alderman, to divert $750,000 in campaign funds for personal use.Politico reported earlier Friday that sources close to the case revealed Jackson conspired with his wife Sandi to illegally spend the campaign funds on personal expenses. Among the couple's improper expenditures: a $43,000 Rolex watch, home renovations, fur coats, cosmetic procedures, breakfast snacks and even beds for campaign workers. (Read Jesse Jackson Jr.'s full indictment document and Sandi Jackson's separate indictment.)According to ABC Chicago, Jesse Jackson Jr. released a statement on Friday:""Over the course of my life I have come to realize that none of us are immune from our share of shortcomings and human frailties. Still I offer no excuses for my conduct and I fully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made. To that end I want to offer my sincerest apologies to my family, my friends and all of my supporters for my errors in judgment and while my journey is not yet complete, it is my hope that I am remembered for the things that I did right.""Per the terms of a plea deal, Jackson could face anything from probation to up to 58 months — or more than four-and-a-half years — in jail, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.Sources previously told ABC Chicago that Jackson Jr.'s deal was signed Feb. 1 and specifically includes a guilty plea for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, mail fraud and false statements. Attorney Tom Kirsch confirmed to the Associated Press that Sandi Jackson has pleaded guilty to one count of tax fraud, a charge that carries a maximum three-year sentence.Among those items Jackson Jr. allegedly purchased using campaign funds are thousands of dollars of Bruce Lee, Michael Jackson and Martin Luther King Jr. memorabilia, according to NBC Chicago.HuffPost reporter Ryan J. Reilly has outlined additional details on how Jackson Jr. is accused of illegally spending campaign cash.Sandi Jackson, 49,  last month stepped down from her role in Chicago's City Council amid the scandal.  Sandi signed many of her husband's tax forms when she acted as his campaign manager.Jesse Jackson Jr., 47, resigned from office last November after going on medical leave from Congress for several months and seeking treatment for bipolar disorder at the Mayo Clinic.

20349	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/12/obama-impeachment-poll_n_2669820.html	News	0	Republican Scandals	None	SomewhatNegative	Negative	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- It should come as no surprise to anyone that most Republicans aren't members of the Barack Obama fan club. According to one recent survey, a significant majority of Republicans in one state not only dislike the president but want to see him impeached. As a new HuffPost/YouGov national poll shows, however, questions about impeachment are a tricky business, and simply asking whether people support or oppose it may produce results that overstate their support. A January survey of Texas voters conducted by Public Policy Polling found that 67 percent of Texas Republicans, and 39 percent of Texas voters overall, said they favor impeaching Obama. The survey asked, ""Would you support or oppose impeaching President Obama?"" But that relatively straightforward question leaves open several possibilities for interpreting what respondents meant when they said they favor impeachment. For example, the question contained no definition of impeachment, so that some respondents may have misunderstood what impeachment entails, even if they grasped that it functions as some kind of reprimand. Some respondents could have been just expressing an unfavorable opinion of Obama (virtually all Republicans rate him unfavorably) or endorsing a more generic reprimand, rather than advocating a process that could remove the president from office after trial for ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""To help better parse levels of support for impeaching the president, The Huffington Post and its polling partner YouGov conducted a survey experiment to see how question wording might affect that support. Between Jan. 30 and Feb. 2, a total of 3,000 respondents nationally were randomly assigned to answer one of three questions about impeaching the president, including the original question asked by PPP and two alternative questions. The results showed both that a simple support/oppose question may overstate the number favoring impeachment and that support for impeachment remains surprisingly high among Republicans even when they are asked a more explanatory question. One set of respondents answered the same question that was asked on the PPP poll. Similar results were found nationally to those that PPP found in Texas, particularly among Republicans. In the new survey, 35 percent of Americans overall and 66 percent of Republicans said they would support impeaching Obama. The first alternative question asked respondents to choose between two options: Obama should be ""impeached and removed from office"" or he ""hasn't committed crimes that would justify impeachment."" The second alternative question allowed respondents to say they like Obama and think he should not be impeached, to say they think Obama should be impeached, or to say they dislike Obama but don't think he should be impeached. Support for impeachment varied by 9 percentage points among the three questions, from 35 percent among those asked the original question to 26 percent of those asked the first alternative question. Support for impeachment among Republicans varied even more widely, from 66 percent of those asked the original question to 51 percent of those asked the first alternative.The lowest support for impeachment, both among respondents overall and among Republicans specifically, came from the first alternative question, which made clear both that impeachment is a process to remove a president from office and that it is spurred by crimes committed by the president, rather than a more general reprimand or distaste for his policies. Even so, one-quarter of respondents and half of Republican respondents persisted in saying that Obama should be impeached and removed from office. And those asked the second alternative question, which did not mention crimes but did ask if Obama should be ""impeached and removed from office"" and also gave respondents the option of expressing dislike of the president without calling for his impeachment, found a slightly higher 29 percent of respondents overall and 57 percent of Republicans would support impeachment.The results of these polls, both on the state level and nationally, reflect the extreme dislike for Obama among Republicans. A recent YouGov/Economist poll found that nearly three-quarters of Republicans strongly disapprove of the job that the president is doing. Moreover, the desire to impeach a president of an opposing party isn't limited to Republicans: For example, a Time magazine poll conducted in November 2006 (and accessed through the Roper Center's iPoll database) found that 48 percent of Democrats were then in favor of impeaching George W. Bush, while an equal number were opposed. More than anything, surveys finding support for impeachment show just how divided Americans are today along party lines and how strongly rank-and-file members of each party dislike presidents from the opposing party.The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Jan. 30-Feb. 2 among 3,000 U.S. adults, of whom 1,000 were randomly assigned to answer each question (no respondent was shown more than one of the questions). The poll used a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

J.R. Hoell (R-Dunbarton) suggested that it may some day be necessary to use ""firearms and ammo"" against the government if its policies continue to be shaped by elected officials like former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.).Hoell was discussing plans to protest outside a state GOP fundraiser that is scheduled to feature Brown, who is rumored to be considering a run for one of New Hampshire's U.S. Senate seats. Hoell has characterized Brown as too liberal for the state, and accused him of supporting laws that encroach on the Second Amendment. Hoell then invoked the armed uprisings of the Revolutionary War.When asked whether protesters should bring weapons to the rally, Hoell responds:I'm never going to tell a person not to carry a firearm ... I will recommend people carry firearms concealed. Tactically it's a better solution; it doesn't make you out to be a target. In terms of messaging to the media, if you're carrying concealed, versus carrying an AR-15 or AR-10 slung over your back, it's a lot easier to make the statement, ""We're not here to threaten anybody. We're here standing on our soapbox, as opposed to standing with our ammo box in hand, to make a point politically.""The message needs to get out that Scott Brown does not represent New Hampshire. If things continue the way they are, there may be a day or a time where firearms and ammo are necessary. It happened in the Revolutionary War. I'd like to think we're not there yet, but as things continue to unravel, that may be the next step. Let's stand on our soapbox this time.Earlier this month, a source close to Brown told The Huffington Post that Brown is ""warming to the idea"" of another run for a U.S. Senate seat. Brown may not make his decision until January, said the source, who estimated the chances that Brown would enter the race against first-term Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) at 50 percent.(h/t ThinkProgress)CORRECTION: Rep. J.R. Hoell was incorrectly referred to as a representative of Merrimack. He represents Dunbarton. "

Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Republicans are waiting for Holder's response to a letter about the apparent discrepancy between his sworn testimony and reports about his involvement in the near prosecution of Fox News reporter James Rosen.""It is fair to say we're investigating the conflict in his remarks, those remarks were made under oath, but we also think it’s very important that the attorney general be afforded the opportunity to respond, so we will wait to pass judgment on that until we receive his response,"" Goodlatte said. The Justice Department accused Rosen of being a criminal co-conspirator in the prosecution of a former administration official who had provided Rosen information about North Korea. Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said on ""Fox News Sunday"" there was no contradiction between Holder's testimony and his involvement in the case because Holder said he was not involved in the ""near prosecution"" of journalists and Rosen had not been prosecuted.""It is often the practice in cases where you have investigations that you target somebody for the purpose of gathering information with never having any intention of prosecuting them,"" Van Hollen said. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) suggested on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that Holder should consider resigning. ""The attorney general has to ask himself the question, is he really able to serve the president of the United States and the American people under the present circumstances?""""The attorney general has definitely lost the trust of the American people,"" Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I think it will take a generation to rebuild trust in the federal government at this point.""But Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), also appearing on ""Meet the Press,"" said there's been no perjury and that Holder should stay, despite the mounting calls for his resignation. “There have been all kinds of accusations, but I haven’t seen anything that would prevent him from continuing to do his job,” Schumer said. ""Let’s not forget for two years, many of our hard right colleagues spent a lot of their time on Fast and Furious and I’m sure there were calls for Holder to step down. He continued to do his job well and then the IG exonerated him on Fast and Furious."""

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced on the Senate floor Wednesday he intended to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan as director of the CIA, citing concerns about President Barack Obama's policy on civil liberties.""I will speak until I can no longer speak,"" Paul said.Paul, an outspoken libertarian, pointed to what he called the abuses of executive power and civil liberties under Obama's administration. In particular, he objected to the contents of a letter he received from Attorney General Eric Holder that asserted the U.S. government had the legal authority to kill a U.S. citizen on American soil.""Where is the Barack Obama of 2007?"" he asked, referring to then-presidential candidate Obama's criticism of Bush-era violations of civil liberties. ""If there were an ounce of courage in this body, I would be joined by many other senators,"" he added. ""Are we going to give up our rights to politicians?""Paul had asked the Justice Department about the constitutionality of drone strikes and whether they could be used agains U.S. citizens. Holder responded in a letter that conceded the military could authorize a drone strike on U.S. soil. ""It is possible, I suppose, to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States,"" Holder wrote.Paul elaborated on his concern Wednesday: ""When I asked the president, 'Can you kill an American on American soil,' it should have been an easy answer. It’s an easy question. It should have been a resounding an unequivocal, ‘No.’ The president’s response? He hasn’t killed anyone yet. We’re supposed to be comforted by that. The president says, ‘I haven’t killed anyone yet.’ He goes on to say, ‘And I have no intention of killing Americans. But I might.’ Is that enough? Are we satisfied by that?""Paul started his filibuster speech around 11:45 a.m. Unlike most modern filibusters, the Kentucky senator is actually attempting to talk through the whole thing -- like Jimmy Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"" -- rather than simply raising his hand to object and requiring 60 votes to proceed. The last ""talking"" filibuster was in 2010, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), spoke out against extending the Bush-era tax cuts. Filibuster reform advocates have proposed returning to this old-fashioned style.""I will not sit quietly and let him shred the constitution,"" Paul said of Obama, later adding that getting an answer from the president on drone strikes was like ""pulling teeth."" The White House declined to comment Wednesday.Paul's speech drew on the work of bloggers from both the left and right who have criticized the president on civil liberties, such as Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian and Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic. Kevin Williamson of the National Review also earned a mention for a piece he wrote asking whether under Obama's standards the Nixon and Johnson administrations should have bombed college campuses.""To be bombed in your sleep? There's nothing American about that,"" Paul said. ""There's nothing constitutional about that.""Last week, Paul voted for the nomination of Chuck Hagel as defense secretary -- another key Obama national security appointment -- after first voting against cloture on the matter, saying he was using his vote to try to get more information about Hagel.Brennan's confirmation was expected as soon as Wednesday, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. Following Paul's filibuster, the aide was still ""cautiously optimistic"" that once the senator ended his speech a time agreement for a vote could be reached.Paul also used his filibuster Wednesday to speak out against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He conceded that he would have supported the Afghanistan war at the outset, but said it had since become far wider than its initial response to the Sept. 11 attacks.""The problem is as this war has dragged on, they take that authorization of use of force to mean pretty much anything, and so they have now said that the war has no geographic limitations,"" he said. ""So it's really not a war in Afghanistan, it's a war in Yemen, Somalia, Mali. It's a war in unlimited places.""Paul went on to reprimand Congress for ceding its authority to govern U.S. wars. ""Were we a body that cared about our prerogative to declare war, we would take that power back,"" he said. ""But I'll tell you how poor -- and this is on both sides of the aisle -- how poor is our understanding or belief in retaining that power here.""WATCH: Paul's filibuster live on CSPAN-2.This is a developing story. Updates will appear below:Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined the filibuster just before 3 p.m., giving Paul a break after more than three hours of speaking. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) then took over for Lee just after 3:10 p.m. ""You must surely be making Jimmy Stewart smile,"" he said. Paul resumed speaking around 3:45 p.m, and the filibuster went bipartisan just before 4:00 pm, when Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) joined in. Wyden said he intended to vote for Brennan's confirmation, but added that the nomination provided an opportunity to seek more information on the Obama administration's legal documentation for targeted killings. He said the Senate Intelligence Committee had gotten that information.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came to the Senate floor to ask a question of Paul just before 4:20 p.m. Rubio did not criticize the administration's targeted-killings policy per se, but he defended the Senate's right to ask questions of presidential appointment nominees. Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) joined the filibuster just before 4:40 p.m. The Georgia senator, who is retiring in 2014, said that he thought the administration should be capturing and interrogating more suspected militants, rather than launching drone strikes at them. He said that he did not support the nomination of John Brennan.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took to the floor at about 4:45 p.m. to try to invoke cloture on the Brennan nomination to allow the vote to happen Wednesday night.Sen. Paul (R-Ky.) said he would be happy to vote, but that he hasn't gotten the answer he wanted, and therefore objected to holding the vote.The filibuster showed no signs of stopping as it entered its eighth hour Wednesday evening. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) read aloud supportive tweets. ""I think the technical term for what the Twitterverse is doing right now is called 'blowing up,'"" he said.Meanwhile, Obama and several Republican senators were dining at the Jefferson Hotel, meeting in an attempt to find a replacement plan for the automatic spending cuts that took effect March 1.Just after 9:15 p.m., Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) joined the filibuster as it neared 10 hours.Close to 11:30 p.m., Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) took to the Senate floor, followed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell expressed support for Paul's efforts, and said that he would not support Brennan's nomination if Reid invoked cloture. "

I had some exasperated things to say about the situation on HuffPost Live last night, and as soon as I'd signed off, my colleague John Celock -- who has forgotten more things about America's state legislatures than I shall ever know -- gave me the skinny as to how Stella Tremblay became a thing that was happening in America: the New Hampshire House of Representatives has 400 members. ""Double-you tee effing eff!"" I replied, because huh? The Virginia House of Delegates, by contrast, has a mere 100 members. And, oh yeah, the actual U.S. House of Representatives has 435 voting members.These two sentences from the Wikipedia entry on the New Hampshire House of Reps is sufficient to put the fear in you: ""On average, each legislator represents about 3,300 residents. If the same level of representation were present in the U.S. Congress, that body would have approximately 99,000 members, according to current population estimates.""On top of that, Celock told me that members of this august body receive a mere $100 a year for their participation, which means that the only people who are likely to seek these offices are people who are just beginning their political careers, people who are winding down their political careers, and people who have literally nothing better to do than run for these seats. With a system designed like this, it can't not feature a nutter like Tremblay.So, anyone who is truly concerned about getting Stella Tremblay out of office would be well served to stop thinking about running a better candidate in ""Rockingham 4,"" and instead concentrate on making New Hampshire's legislative body a lot less bonkers.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

Circuit Court of Appeals.During a Wednesday hearing on one of Obama's key judicial nominees, Nina Pillard for the D.C. Circuit, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee resurrected the claim that the president's effort to fill three vacancies on the court amounts to ""court-packing."" The term refers to an effort to increase the number of judge slots on a court with the goal of shifting its political balance, not to fill existing vacancies.""The president appears to have targeted the D.C. Circuit in hopes that he can pack the court and stack the deck to his advantage,"" said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) noted that the Senate already confirmed a nominee to the D.C. Circuit this year, Sri Srinivasan, and argued that Obama's efforts to fill the court's remaining vacancies are politically motivated.""I have deep concerns about what the administration is doing now with a package of three nominees to the D.C. Circuit after the Senate just confirmed a very qualified nominee,"" Cruz said. ""I believe [this] is an attempt by this administration to pack that court.""Not only is the charge factually inaccurate -- the court has three empty seats, which the president is constitutionally required to fill -- but one could easily make the case that Republican efforts to prevent Obama from filling empty court seats, thereby keeping those courts from having any more judges appointed by a Democrat, are actual instances of ""court-unpacking.""Scuffles over the D.C. Circuit come as Senate Republicans have been using a variety of methods to block Obama's judicial nominees. Tensions over stalled nominees have gotten so high that Democrats nearly proceeded with filibuster reform earlier this month, a standoff that was defused at the last minute as party leaders cut a deal that allowed some of Obama's executive nominees to get votes. That deal did nothing to unclog Obama's judicial nominees, though, and filling the D.C. Circuit is a major priority for the president.Republicans haven't signaled much interest in allowing D.C. Circuit nominees to get a vote. As it stands, the court has 11 seats, three of which are vacant. Lee and Cruz are both are cosponsors of a bill by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that would eliminate those three seats altogether and keep the court where it is: with eight judges, four of whom were appointed by Democrats and four of whom were appointed by Republicans.Grassley, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, re-upped that argument during Wednesday's hearing. He cited statistics that he said illustrated that the court has the lowest workload of all circuit courts. He also read aloud anonymous statements that he said were from current D.C. Circuit judges arguing that the court isn't busy enough to warrant filling its vacancies. Those statements came in response to a letter that Grassley said he sent to the court's judges asking for their take on the matter.""The judges themselves confirmed everything I've been saying,"" Grassley said. ""Who is in a better position than the judges to make an assessment about the court's workload and the need for additional judges?""But Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Grassley's argument overlooks the fact that the D.C. Circuit, considered second only to the Supreme Court in terms of its importance, takes on particularly hefty and complex cases that require extra scrutiny. He also listed off the names of current and former judges on that court -- including Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts -- who have spoken publicly about the court's intense workload.Plenty of judges who have served on the court ""have commented for the record, not anonymously, their views as to the workload of the court,"" Blumenthal said, ""all indicating very strongly and unequivocally that the workload of this court is certainly a tremendous challenge and growing, rather than diminishing."""

""President Nelson Mandela was one of the greatest leaders of our lifetime,"" he wrote. ""When he visited the Congress I was deeply impressed with the charisma and the calmness with which he could dominate a room. It was as if the rest of us grew smaller and he grew stronger and more dominant the longer the meeting continued."" Gingrich's statement, however, was met with backlash from many of his followers. ""Newt, I was rooting for you to win the primaries and become the next president; please tell me your joking!! Mandela was a commie murderer!!"" read one comment that was popular with other users.""You're forgetting Mandela's extreme racism! There are YouTubes of Mandela singing songs about murdering the white man. I spit on his grave....,"" read another. When asked about the criticism in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, Gingrich replied, ""I was very surprised by it. [My wife] Callista posted my statement on her Facebook page and was amazed at some of the intensity -- some of whom came back three, four and five times repeating how angry they were.""In response, on Saturday, Gingrich put out a new statement and video to his supporters, challenging critics to put themselves in Mandela's shoes. ""I was surprised by the hostility and vehemence of some of the people who reacted to me saying a kind word about a unique historic figure,"" he said. ""So let me say to those conservatives who don’t want to honor Nelson Mandela, what would you have done?""Responding to conservatives who dismiss Mandela as a communist, Gingrich added, ""Actually Mandela was raised in a Methodist school, was a devout Christian, turned to communism in desperation only after South Africa was taken over by an extraordinarily racist government determined to eliminate all rights for blacks."" As Ta-Nehisi Coates at the Atlantic pointed out, Gingrich's support for Mandela is not new or an attempt to rewrite history.""Newt Gingrich was among a cadre of conservatives who opposed the mainstream conservative stance on Apartheid and ultimately helped override Reagan's unconscionable veto of sanctions,"" he wrote, adding, ""When Gingrich compliments Mandela on his presidency he doesn't do so within the context of alleged African pathologies, but within the context of countries throughout the world. It's a textbook lessons in 'How not to be racist,' which is to say it is a textbook lesson in how to talk about Nelson Mandela as though he were a human being.""Watch Gingrich's video:Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also encountered a fair amount of vitriol last week when he honored Mandela in a Facebook post, writing, ""Nelson Mandela will live in history as an inspiration for defenders of liberty around the globe… Because of his epic fight against injustice, an entire nation is now free.”When CNN host Candy Crowley asked Gingrich if he believed his and Cruz's critics were fellow conservatives, the former House speaker said they were people who bought into ""a rationale that defined everybody who was in any way in rebellion against the established system in the third world as anti-American."""

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) disagreed with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) characterization of the deal made with Democrats on President Barack Obama's nominations, calling McConnell's claims ""bullshit."" According to a Roll Call report, McConnell told his caucus that he believed he could have negotiated a deal more beneficial to his party than the one brokered primarily between Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).Roll Call's Meredith Shiner reports: McConnell’s tone, according to multiple sources, implied that he had been kept in the dark about the talks between some in his own ranks and Democrats. However, those same Republicans say they kept McConnell updated throughout their negotiating process.Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., got so frustrated with McConnell’s presentation of events, that he called “bullshit” loud enough for the room to hear, nearly a half-dozen sources said. The heated exchange underscored the “buyer’s remorse” among some Republicans, especially leaders, one senior Republican said on background.Under the deal brokered by Reid and McCain, Republicans agreed to allow votes on seven of Obama's executive nominees, under the condition that the president replace two of his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board with two other candidates. The deal came after Reid threatened to invoke the so-called nuclear option, or changing Senate rules by a simple majority vote.Corker was one of 17 Republicans who voted to end the filibuster on Richard Cordray's nomination to lead the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau.As The Huffington Post's Ryan Grim and Michael McAuliff reported Tuesday, the deal was perceived as an embarrassment for McConnell: The unfortunate moment culminated Tuesday morning, when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) marched onto the Senate floor not with the leader from Kentucky opposite him to announce a deal to pass the stalled nominees, but with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).McCain was there, according to several sources who spoke about private, behind-the-scenes talks on the condition of anonymity, because he and and several other Republicans grew fed up with their own side's stalling tactics and went around McConnell (R-Ky.) to cut the deal with Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), avoiding a ""nuclear option"" rules change to pass the nominees."

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, alleges that FBI agents and Defense Department employees disclosed Kelley's identity to outside parties, including the news media, and violated her privacy while investigating Petraeus' extramarital relationship with Paula Broadwell, the author of a Petraeus biography. Kelley, who frequently hosted Petraeus and his wife at parties, complained to the FBI that Broadwell had sent her threatening emails, and had viewed Kelley as a potential competitor for Petreaus' affections. The FBI later dropped the investigation without charges.The lawsuit, filed by Kelley and her husband, surgeon Scott Kelley, seeks unspecified monetary damages, a formal apology, and an accounting of the information the FBI and Defense Department gathered about them. The complaint details how the Kelleys' lives were turned upside down once their names were publicly linked to the Petraeus scandal. Click here to read the complaint.In addition to the nonstop media attention, the revelation that Jill Kelley had communicated on a regular basis with both Petraeus and Gen. John Allen led to suggestions she may have had romantic relationships with the commanders. Allen abruptly retired after the disclosure. ""There was no legally acceptable reason for the government to disclose confidential information about the Kelleys and thereby make them part of the public scandal,"" the lawsuit says. Details about the Kelleys' personal lives and their financial difficulties was widely reported.""Mrs. Kelley’s reputation is indelibly tainted,"" the complaint says. ""She is consistently referred to as the 'center' of the 'sex scandal' and is often portrayed as the woman who brought down two American generals. As a result, she -- the victim and a participant in none of the bad acts in the sex scandal -- has shouldered the blame as the villain in the generals’ downfall.""The suit describes damage to Jill Kelley's social reputation and connections to those in high places, which it claims were key to her earnings. The scandal caused the revocation of Jill Kelley's honorary consulship to South Korea, which ""deprived her of significant social and financial networking, investment, and business fee finder opportunities, as well as the loss of the tax-free annual stipend for years,"" the suit says. Today, Jill Kelley ""no longer receives prestigious invitations to the diplomatic and distinguished governmental functions."" The complaint adds that ""Dr. Kelley also suffered dramatic financial losses.""The lawsuit is peppered with links to news articles about the Kelleys from late 2012. According to one, the Kelleys were considering legal action as far back as late November, when their attorney at the time, D.C. powerhouse litigator Abbe Lowell, released a slew of emails and phone records intended to prove that Jill Kelley did not exploit her friendship with Petraeus for financial gain. But now, six months later, the issue of potential overreach in a federal investigation has taken on a very different tenor in Washington, a fact likely not lost on Kelley and her attorneys. Public anger has erupted over news that the Department of Justice gathered journalists' phone and email records in leak investigations. This, combined with a scandal at the Internal Revenue Service over the targeting of tea party groups for special tax scrutiny, has put the Obama administration on defense. In the ensuing months, Jill Kelley has emerged as an advocate for greater Internet privacy and received an award from the Electronic Privacy Information Center on Monday. Jill Kelley said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post that her experience ""made me an advocate for privacy rights for every American."" She said she would continue to work to ensure that citizens would ""not have their personal communications improperly and unreasonably searched by overreaching government or any other abuse of government powers.""The Justice Department has 60 days to respond to the lawsuit.

The letter was obtained by The Record in a public records request.""On approximately 20 occasions in the last forty days, our Borough has been completely gridlocked,"" wrote Sokolich to Baroni, who was Christie's top official at the Port Authority. ""Traveling from the south to the north end of our Borough takes upwards of one hour. Our safety vehicles are unable to traverse our own thoroughfares to attend to emergencies which place our residents in harms way.""Despite these concerns, on Sept. 9, 2013, Sokolich woke up to find that two of the three local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge had been closed, causing dangerous traffic jams in the borough on the first day of school. Neither he nor Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye -- who was appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) -- were given any advance warning.The closures were ordered by David Wildstein, then the director of interstate capital projects and an ally of Christie's. They came just weeks after Sokolich refused to endorse Christie's reelection bid. On Sept. 12, Sokolich said he believed the closures were ""punitive,"" although he later backed off that accusation. Baroni has stated that the closures were part of a traffic study, implying that Fort Lee may not need three access lanes.""Every one of you, every one of you on this committee has people in your communities who sit in longer traffic every day because of the special lanes for Fort Lee,"" Baroni said in November. But he acknowledged that no one ever sought approval for the study, which, without an alternative route, was guaranteed to create traffic congestion. According to The Record, a bridge official said Wildstein also specifically instructed him to keep the lane closures secret from Fort Lee officials. And records indicate, according to the paper, ""that traffic engineers predicted it would lead to 600-vehicle back-ups during the morning rush hour that would not subside until noon.""Wildstein and Baroni have since resigned and hired attorneys to represent them.In a Dec. 17 press conference on the controversy, Christie stood by Baroni's explanation for the closures, saying that while his appointees did not go through the proper channels for the closures, there was no malicious or political intent in what they did. Still, the controversy has continued to dog Christie, who is considered a possible 2016 presidential contender. Sen. John ""Jay"" Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, has asked the Transportation Department to review what happened in Fort Lee. ""While this type of decision tends to be local in nature, I am concerned about the larger federal implications of what appears to be political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice,"" wrote Rockefeller in his letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. The inspector general of the Port Authority is also investigating the closures, and several state legislators continue to look into the matter.Last week, Christie said the controversy was ""not that big a deal"" even though reporters were ""obsessed"" with it.

Donald Trump was reportedly booed off the stage at Madison Square Garden on Saturday, according to various reports and attendees. The 66-year-old businessman attended the April 6 event as an inductee into the organization's 2013 Hall of Fame. He was introduced by WWE CEO Vince McMahon, a longtime friend of the ""Celebrity Apprentice"" creator. According to Bleacher Report, McMahon said Trump has helped the WWE and would have made a great U.S. president, but even this endorsement wasn't enough to quell the audience. “Donald will soon find out this is a very partisan crowd,"" McMahon said in response to the booing. Later adding, “You’re not even going to let him come out here before you boo him?”When Trump appeared, the heckling only continued. ""Trump was booed for most of his speech and eventually cut it short after the abuse,"" according to a Wrestling Online recap. His son was also apparently booed, but his daughter, Ivanka, was not. ""Trump noted that at least there is a member of the Trump family that the MSG crowd liked!"" Others noted the negative response. But Trump himself seemed unfazed by the incident. On Sunday he posted a cheery tweet that made no mention of his icy reception from WWE fans. Prior to Saturday, Trump had expressed excitement about the event being held in Manhattan. “I’ve always enjoyed and respected WWE’s brand of entertainment and look forward to the ceremony in my hometown at Madison Square Garden,” the Chairman and President of The Trump Organization said in a statement released by the WWE ahead of the ceremony. Jim Varsallone of the Miami Herald was disappointed by the audience's behavior and penned an op-ed defending the would-be conservative pundit. ""How about Donald Trump,"" he wrote Monday. ""Long before others did, The Don lauded Mr. McMahon’s vision ... and instead of thanking him or just watching quietly, you heckle him.""And this isn't the first time Trump has faced a disgruntled crowd. He was booed by members of the press at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, which he attended as a guest of the Washington Post. "
20543	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/14/john-boehner-right-wing-groups_n_4445626.html	Opinion	1	Republican Scandals	None	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- With an emphatic ""Are you kidding me?!"" aimed at right-wing Washington groups, House Speaker John Boehner this week may have finally pronounced the verdict that activist outfits, prosperous amid the tea party movement, have jumped the shark.The Ohio Republican lashed out twice at organizations that have invited themselves to the tea party since 2009, blasting groups like Club for Growth, Heritage Action, FreedomWorks and others on Wednesday as ""ridiculous"" for opposing a bipartisan budget deal before they even saw it. And Thursday he declared, albeit two months after the fact, his stunned disbelief that some of their leaders admitted they knew their bid to defund Obamacare by shutting down the government last fall would fail. Boehner accused them of ""misleading their followers,"" and using House Republicans and the American people to promote themselves. ""Frankly, I just think they've lost all credibility,"" Boehner told reporters at his weekly news conference.Maybe they have, and maybe they haven't. But Boehner was at least declaring war on the well-funded agitators who have given him agita for three years. And he marked the 16-day government shutdown showdown as the moment they hopped over the line to absurdity -- much the way the aging TV show ""Happy Days,"" stretching for fresh plot lines, infamously put the leather-jacketed character ""Fonzie"" on water skis to leap a man-eater.The question now is whether Boehner's outburst -- and more importantly the subsequent overwhelming vote for the budget deal -- means the influence of such outside groups will simply collapse, or whether it will limp along for years like the old '70s sitcom did.Few senators leaving the Capitol Friday (the House already had recessed for vacation) were willing to answer that question directly, but some seemed to suggest that such organizations would no longer have as easy a time reaching out to scuttle key deals, as they did during the October shutdown battle. ""I think many people are realizing that many of the outside groups exist for one reason, and that is to raise money,"" Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told HuffPost, echoing Boehner's charge. ""They have nothing to do with policy -- never did. If the goal posts are set, they'll move 'em … There's almost nothing that can be done to satisfy some of the groups.""I think that people have begun to see through the antics of many of these groups,"" Corker added.The issue is especially relevant -- and fraught -- for Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who runs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which could win back the Senate by netting six seats in 2014. The NRSC can fairly blame tea party candidates for costing them at least five seats in the previous two election cycles, including Nevada in 2010 and Indiana in 2012. To avoid a replay, it must deal with primary challenges in seven or eight contests, and secure candidates with crossover appeal against the many red state Democrats they've targeted.On the one hand, Moran wants the energy the tea party brought in 2010. On the other, he doesn't want all-or-nothing candidates who embrace the shutdown model.""Hard for me to ever complain that Americans get involved in our government and encourage us to do things, one way or the other. I'm for more participation, not less,"" Moran said. But he added that while lawmakers should listen to outside interest groups, ""we need to make certain that we don't make decisions based upon that alone.""For the 2014 contests, that means Moran will do what he can to ensure tea party purity is not the litmus test. ""What I'm hoping is that people will decide that they are interested in supporting a candidate that can win not just a primary, but also a general election,"" he said.He doesn't believe -- and neither apparently does Boehner -- that most voters want absolutist politicians.""I think there's a large group of American people, voters, who are interested in seeing this place work, seeing the Senate and House function, who dislike the constant political bickering that goes on here,"" Moran said. ""We at every opportunity -- without foregoing our principles -- ought to demonstrate that we can govern.""Moran said he didn't like the budget deal that made the GOP strife so prominent this week, but he also did not say that he would try to obstruct the deal the way many Republicans -- led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- did during the October showdown.Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action -- the campaign arm of the Heritage Foundation -- denied it was more interested in itself, asserting that the organization's efforts were indeed about promoting conservative policy.""We just want to make sure lawmakers are having an honest, fact-based discussion with their constituents,"" Holler said.And he argued the influence of groups like his merely suffered a dip during the House passage of the budget bill they robustly oppose. ""I do think there was an element of fatigue here in Washington, where people were tired, and that tends to happen, but then the American people are tired of Washington,"" Holler said.  He predicted that the conservative base would come around to the organization's way of thinking on the budget agreement, and that Republican lawmakers would have trouble explaining why they were willing to trade across-the-board spending cuts in 2014 and 2015 for proposed cuts in 2022 and 2023.""If they can explain that to their constituents, then they're in good shape. If they can't explain it to their constituents, chances are they're going to have a little bit of trouble,"" Holler said.A more telling moment than this week's House budget vote (and next week's in the Senate), he said, would come in January when lawmakers have to pass the $1.012 trillion spending bill the budget prescribes.""It'll be an interesting dynamic, and I think when this comes to a head will be in January,"" Holler said. ""That sort of massive bill rolling through a Republican-controlled House is going to be really painful for a lot of these guys.""And he predicted that if the GOP leaders ignored the disapproving opinions of the outside groups, conservative voters would see that as a betrayal they would remember next fall.""The reason what we say matters, the reason what Club (for Growth) says matters, the reason why FreedomWorks has influence is because people outside of Washington trust us. And those conservative activists are also voters and constituents,"" Holler said.""These conservative activists are smart, and they tend not to forget when they're cast aside,"" he added. ""There's a whole lot of open questions here about how is this going to play out in 2014.""At least some outside Republican consultants think Boehner essentially answered those questions by declaring Republicans would no longer be slaves to self-appointed guardians of conservative doctrine and their vote scorecard. The speaker had to go along with the fall shutdown strategy to show once and for all that the path of the outside groups leads to a dead end, they said.""I think that once they headed down that road in September, that [Boehner] decided the only thing he could do was give them all the rope he could,"" said long-time GOP operative Rich Galen, with the implicit idea that the groups hung themselves in what turned out to a deeply unpopular gambit.Boehner's dramatic denunciation served not just to say he was back in charge, but also to tell the broader spectrum of voters and major donors that they could trust the GOP again, Galen said.""I think it's less Fonzie, and I would look at it more as a Sister Souljah moment,"" Galen said, referring to then-Arkasas Gov. Bill Clinton's calculated denunciation of rap artist Sista Souljah in 1992 when he wanted to reassure moderates he wasn't a left-wing ideologue.But Galen also suggested the ""Happy Days"" comparison is correct, in that there's no un-jumping the shark of the government shutdown.""It's the peak of their influence, not just with the tea party members,"" Galen said. ""Their influence over legislation is probably permanently damaged.""Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post. Talk to him on Facebook."

At that event, which included drinks and a quick speech by the presidential candidate, the would-be filmmaker also tended bar.He and Romney shared a typical bartender-to-patron moment.""I handed him a diet Coke with lemon on it,"" the filmmaker recalled, ""because I was told that that's what he drank.""Romney didn't acknowledge his server at all.""He took it and turned and didn't say anything,"" the filmmaker explained. ""I presented him the exact right drink that he wanted ... Had it there, sitting there on a napkin. He took it out of my hand and turned his back without a 'thank you' or anything else.""HuffPost has agreed to withhold the name of the surreptitious filmmaker until he breaks his silence on MSNBC's ""The Ed Show"" Wednesday evening, followed by an appearance on HuffPost Live Thursday morning. In interviews over the last several months, he laid out his thinking before and after Romney's speech.The filmmaker had worked in the service industry for years, starting out after high school as a club doorman in Boston. He slowly worked his way up to bartender and then operations manager and general manager at a downtown nightclub. He had wanted to be a cop and hoped to get a degree in criminal justice from Northeastern. When he couldn't afford to complete his degree, he still had his night-club jobs.He moved to Florida about 10 years ago. He told HuffPost that former President Bill Clinton had partly inspired him to release the video: He had worked at a Clinton event at which the politician had made an effort to greet the cooks and waiters. Romney had been the opposite.""You can tell a lot about someone the way they take a drink from you,"" he said. ""[Romney] took it and just turned his back."""

Chris Christie (R) knew that Fort Lee, N.J., had issues with traffic congestion around the George Washington Bridge, long before he authorized a seemingly unnecessary study that closed down lanes to the bridge and made traffic even worse. Fort Lee is an essential access point to New York City, serving as the gateway to the George Washington Bridge, which is the busiest bridge in the United States. In November 2010, Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (D) wrote to Bill Baroni, deputy director of the Port Authority of New York and Jersey, and complained of traffic problems in the borough. The letter was obtained by The Record in a public records request.""On approximately 20 occasions in the last forty days, our Borough has been completely gridlocked,"" wrote Sokolich to Baroni, who was Christie's top official at the Port Authority. ""Traveling from the south to the north end of our Borough takes upwards of one hour. Our safety vehicles are unable to traverse our own thoroughfares to attend to emergencies which place our residents in harms way.""Despite these concerns, on Sept. 9, 2013, Sokolich woke up to find that two of the three local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge had been closed, causing dangerous traffic jams in the borough on the first day of school. Neither he nor Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye -- who was appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) -- were given any advance warning.The closures were ordered by David Wildstein, then the director of interstate capital projects and an ally of Christie's. They came just weeks after Sokolich refused to endorse Christie's reelection bid. On Sept. 12, Sokolich said he believed the closures were ""punitive,"" although he later backed off that accusation. Baroni has stated that the closures were part of a traffic study, implying that Fort Lee may not need three access lanes.""Every one of you, every one of you on this committee has people in your communities who sit in longer traffic every day because of the special lanes for Fort Lee,"" Baroni said in November. But he acknowledged that no one ever sought approval for the study, which, without an alternative route, was guaranteed to create traffic congestion. According to The Record, a bridge official said Wildstein also specifically instructed him to keep the lane closures secret from Fort Lee officials. And records indicate, according to the paper, ""that traffic engineers predicted it would lead to 600-vehicle back-ups during the morning rush hour that would not subside until noon.""Wildstein and Baroni have since resigned and hired attorneys to represent them.In a Dec. 17 press conference on the controversy, Christie stood by Baroni's explanation for the closures, saying that while his appointees did not go through the proper channels for the closures, there was no malicious or political intent in what they did. Still, the controversy has continued to dog Christie, who is considered a possible 2016 presidential contender. Sen. John ""Jay"" Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, has asked the Transportation Department to review what happened in Fort Lee. ""While this type of decision tends to be local in nature, I am concerned about the larger federal implications of what appears to be political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice,"" wrote Rockefeller in his letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. The inspector general of the Port Authority is also investigating the closures, and several state legislators continue to look into the matter.Last week, Christie said the controversy was ""not that big a deal"" even though reporters were ""obsessed"" with it.

Now another statement from the interview -- this time about the black community during the pre-civil rights era -- is stirring more controversy. GQ's Drew Magary sat down with the ""Duck Dynasty"" patriarch for a candid interview about his road to fame. The 67-year-old journeyed from substance abuse to devotion to God to small-screen celebrity, all in the backwoods of Louisiana. According to Robertson, growing up in those Louisiana backwoods in the pre-civil rights era was not bad for black people. “I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person,"" Robertson is quoted in GQ. ""Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I’m with the blacks, because we’re white trash. We’re going across the field.... They’re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.”Before the civil rights movement of the 1950s, Jim Crow laws enforced a system of subjugating African-Americans in the South by upholding racial barriers for years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The cultural climate in the Southern states was one of ""disenfranchisement, segregation and various forms of oppression, including race-inspired violence,"" History.com notes. The Human Rights Campaign and the NAACP wrote a joint letter to the president of A&E, expressing deep concern over Robertson's remarks: We want to be clear why Phil Robertson’s remarks are not just dangerous but also inaccurate. Mr. Robertson claims that, from what he saw, African Americans were happier under Jim Crow. What he didn’t see were lynching and beatings of black men and women for attempting to vote or simply walking down the street. And his offensive claims about gay people fly in the face of science. In fact, it’s important to note that every single leading medical organization in the country has said that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being [lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender] -- it’s not a choice, and to suggest otherwise is dangerous. Robertson called homosexuality a sin and juxtaposed it with bestiality. After his homophobia made news, A&E released a statement announcing Robertson's indefinite suspension from ""Duck Dynasty."" The network emphasized that his beliefs are in contrast to those of the network.  "

House Speaker Thom Tillis (R-Charlotte) announced Thursday afternoon that the bill would not be receiving a vote in the full House, effectively dropping the measure. Loretta Boniti, a reporter for News 14 Carolina, broke the news on Twitter, and it was confirmed in a breaking news alert posted on the home page of wral.com, a Raleigh-based television station. Tillis' decision followed several days of national media attention on the bill, which also said that the state government did not have to listen to federal court rulings and was exempt from the requirements of the First Amendment. The bill, which was drafted by state Reps. Carl Ford (R-China Grove) and Harry Warren (R-Salisbury), was intended to address an issue in Rowan County, where the ACLU has filed a lawsuit against the county commission in an attempt to block commissioners from having a Christian prayer at the beginning of meetings. The North Carolina measure responds to the ACLU suit by declaring that each state is ""sovereign"" and no federal court can prevent a state from ""from making laws respecting an establishment of religion."" Though  Warren, one of the bill's authors, told HuffPost Live that the measure was not seeking to create a state religion, the drafted legislation would clearly allow for such an action. SECTION 1. The North Carolina General Assembly asserts that the Constitution of the United States of America does not prohibit states or their subsidiaries from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.SECTION 2. The North Carolina General Assembly does not recognize federal court rulings which prohibit and otherwise regulate the State of North Carolina, its public schools, or any political subdivisions of the State from making laws respecting an establishment of religion.The North Carolina bill seeks to play the First Amendment both ways. It says that the state is exempted from the establishment clause under the First Amendment, which establishes the ""separation of church and state."" The clause reads that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an Establishment of Religion."" But the North Carolina bill asserts that prohibition does not apply ""to states, municipalities, or schools,"" and that North Carolina could establish a state religion. The bill then goes further, portraying this reasoning as a protection of the freedom of religion, including the state lawmakers' right to exercise their own religious beliefs.In fact, in a series of cases stretching back nearly a century, the Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment does cover state governments. Judicial precedent has held that any such proposals on the establishment of religion must have secular, legislative purpose; cannot inhibit or advance religion; and cannot be ""an excessive government entanglement with religion.""An explanation on why Tillis decided to kill the measure was not posted and a Tillis spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The media firestorm regarding the legislation comes as Tillis is considering a bid for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) next year. Tillis was not a co-sponsor of the bill, which originally drew 11 GOP supporters, including Tillis' deputy, Majority Leader Edgar Starnes (R-Hickory) and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Justin Burr (R-Albemarle). Three additional Republicans had signed on as co-sponsors since the bill was first introduced on Monday. "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released his birth certificate on Sunday in an effort to curb speculation that he is ineligible to run for president. The document, published by the Dallas Morning News, confirms that Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta to an American mother, immediately making Cruz a citizen of both the United States and Canada. As the Morning News points out, that means Cruz could run for office in Canada unless he later decided to renounce his Canadian citizenship. However, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier denied the senator's dual citizenship. “Senator Cruz became a U.S. citizen at birth, and he never had to go through a naturalization process after birth to become a U.S. citizen,” Frazier said. “To our knowledge, he never had Canadian citizenship, so there is nothing to renounce.” Cruz, first elected to the Senate last fall, has sparked early presidential speculation by making visits to key primary states like Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire. He's also courted Republican donors at GOP functions in New York City and his home state of Texas.Under the U.S. constitution, only ""natural born"" citizens are eligible to run for president.

There were financial scandals, a new Supreme Court case, laws rewritten and the anticipation of more money than ever before. Below are 10 of the biggest campaign finance stories of the year.10. Big money took over North Carolina. Gov. Pat McCrory (R) won election in late 2012 with huge support from the political network funded by wealthy conservative activist Art Pope and immediately announced that Pope would be his budget director. In the ensuing year, the state enacted highly divisive right-wing legislation along the lines long proposed by Pope's outside network of think tanks and political organizations. North Carolina became example number one of how a single donor can influence the political direction of an entire state in the post-Citizens United world.9. Get ready for the most expensive midterm election ever. More than $815 million has been raised or spent on the 2014 midterm elections and 2013 special elections already. Spending by independent groups like super PACs and ""dark money"" nonprofits is ahead of the 2012 pace, when these groups laid out nearly $1 billion.Next year's Kentucky Senate race, pitting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) against both a tea party primary challenger and a very well-financed Democratic candidate, is also well ahead of the fundraising pace set by the two most expensive Senate campaigns in history. The 2012 Massachusetts race cost candidates Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren a combined $82 million, and the 2000 New York race between Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio topped $70 million. The Kentucky candidates have raised nearly $20 million and that's just through September 2013.8. Are Democrats winning the super PAC war? Just one year after conservative independent groups outspent liberal groups 2.5 to 1, the spending pattern has reversed. Liberal independent groups doled out $16.5 million in 2013, compared to $9 million from conservative groups, and liberal super PACs outraised their conservative counterparts 2 to 1 in the first half of the year.These numbers, however, are somewhat deceiving. Most of the money was spent in special elections that were highly favorable to Democrats, so major conservative groups sat out those contests. The financial comparison also does not account for ""issue"" advertising that masks an electoral purpose. Conservative groups have already spent millions on this form of independent spending that doesn't have to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission.7. OFA turned into a dark money nonprofit. Following another successful electoral campaign, the Obama for America machinery, with its troves of data desired by practically every Democratic candidate in the country, sought a new home. The group transformed itself into the 501(c)(4) nonprofit Organizing for Action, the exact type of dark money group that the president had lambasted during his 2012 reelection.It may have become a bit trite, even if true, to mock the president for his repeated hypocrisy on the issue, but the transformation of his campaign organization into a nonprofit relying on voluntary disclosure -- the group does disclose its donors, but only as it sees fit -- solidified that hypocrisy for many advocates of openness and campaign finance reform.6. Obama bundlers were nominated to be ambassadors. Again, after promising to change the culture of Washington, President Barack Obama continued the tried and true practice of nominating his biggest campaign fundraisers to jobs as overseas diplomats. According to the Center for Public Integrity, Obama has nominated 23 campaign bundlers for ambassadorships since January.The American Foreign Service Association, which represents active and retired Foreign Service officers, has called for an end to this practice: ""Now is the time to end the spoils system and the de facto 'three-year rental' of ambassadorships. The United States is alone in this practice; no other major democracy routinely appoints non-diplomats to serve as envoys to other countries.""5. California officials tore back the curtain on dark money in their state. The state's investigation into an $11 million contribution to a ballot campaign committee late in 2012 revealed the inner workings of the dark-money nonprofit network connected to the billionaire Koch brothers. Due to poorly redacted documents released during the investigation, many of the original donors were uncovered, including the owners of the Gap clothing brand, investor Charles Schwab, casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and real estate developer Eli Broad, who had publicly supported the ballot initiative even as his money funded the opposition.The success of the inquiry propelled Ann Ravel, then head of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, into the vice chairmanship of the FEC.4. The Republican Party faces civil strife. This tea party vs. big business battle is apparently a real thing. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce plans to dump $50 million into supporting primary candidates from the GOP's establishment wing -- even if those candidates don't differ much on policy from the tea partiers they oppose.The key contests to watch are the Senate primary races in Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia and the House primaries in Michigan's 3rd and 11th districts and Idaho's 2nd District.3. The Supreme Court debates maybe the next Citizens United. In October, the justices heard arguments on another potentially groundbreaking campaign finance case, McCutcheon v. FEC -- this time challenging the aggregate contribution limits that restrict overall giving by an individual donor.Following the 2010 Citizens United decision, which upended politics by freeing independent groups to spend unlimited sums of money, including corporate and union funds, campaign finance cases have been watched very closely. Some observers have even worried that the Supreme Court could use the McCutcheon case to roll back all contribution limits, although legal experts consider this unlikely.A ruling in favor of plaintiff Shaun McCutcheon would free the wealthiest donors to give millions more to candidates and political parties than they give now. An end to aggregate limits could also allow a political party's multiple committees to evade ordinary contribution limits by shifting money amongst each other. The Huffington Post has previously written about the dozens of donors who broke the aggregate limits in 2012 and showed how Mitt Romney's presidential campaign used state party committees to evade those limits.2. IRS scandal led to proposed clearer rules for nonprofits. If you think the public relations rollout for Obamacare has been bad, remember how the Internal Revenue Service slowly admitted that it had improperly targeted conservative groups for heightened review. After repeatedly denying any such misdeed, IRS official Lois Lerner apologized for doing precisely that in response to a planted question at a meeting of nonprofit tax lawyers. Months of howling by conservatives and hours of congressional testimony ensued until it was revealed that the IRS had targeted not just conservative groups but also liberal groups and other nonpolitical organizations.The scandal did bring about greater scrutiny of the agency's oversight of political groups, particularly dark money nonprofits that aren't required to disclose their donors. These groups have proliferated over the last several years following the Supreme Court's rulings in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life and the Citizens United case. In November, the IRS proposed new regulations for political activity by such nonprofits. The draft regulations, which were criticized from all sides, will take months, if not years, to wend their way through the regulatory process. Nonetheless, they mark a step toward greater transparency for political spending by nonprofits and, potentially, less abuse of the nonprofit tax code to hide donors' identities.1. States raised contribution limits. After the Citizens United ruling, proposals were put forward across the country to increase disclosure, rein in rampant independent spending and pass constitutional amendments to reverse the decision. The most popular idea -- among politicians, at least -- was to increase the amount of money they can raise to even the playing field.Nine states -- Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina and Wyoming -- increased their campaign contribution limits in 2013. The feat was accomplished by state legislatures run both by Republicans and by Democrats.Minnesota state Rep. Ryan Winkler (D) told The Huffington Post earlier this year, ""Increasing the money flowing directly through candidates from individuals is a better system. It might not be a perfect world, but we have to live in the world that the Supreme Court created for us and do the best we can.""The multiple bills to raise contribution limits highlight the gulf between the public, which sees far too much money in politics and supports the reversal of Citizens United, and the lawmakers, who simply want as much money as the independent groups empowered by that decision. Expect even more states to adopt hike their limits in the coming years.Permanent honorable mention: The FEC is an ongoing disaster."

""It was clearly understood that compliance with all rules and regulations was an absolute necessity for my presidential campaign,"" Bachmann said in her retirement announcement. ""And I have no reason to believe that that was not the case."" Investigators have reason to believe otherwise, however. Was Bachmann's campaign involved in bribery? Money laundering? Or were her actions in this case just the industry standard for a high wire political campaign? We may eventually get an answer from the FBI, and perhaps a federal prosecutor. In the meantime, the Michele Bachmann circus is going to remain on the national stage."

Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.), feeling sandbagged, got into a heated exchange with House Speaker John Boehner soon after the decision was made to adjourn without taking up the relief bill. Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) told reporters that he was ""utterly devastated."" From New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie declaimed that the House had ""failed that most basic test of public service,"" adding, ""Shame on you. ... [This] is why the American people hate Congress."" (Curiously, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg greeted the news with something of a bemused shrug.)But when it comes to unrelenting anger over the Sandy relief bill, none can hold a candle to Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), whose fury at the delay was hardly assuaged when the package finally passed at the end of January -- it merely turned on his GOP colleagues who refused to vote ""yes"" on the aid's passage. And, now, he's not happy about Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) making the fundraising rounds in New York City, after Rubio cast a ""no"" vote on the relief bill's passage. As Politico reported Wednesday, Rubio's been working Wall Street in order to ""lock down some of Wall Street’s biggest donors ahead of the 2016 presidential race."" According to Ben White and Maggie Haberman, not only do ""campaign finance experts"" deem Rubio's efforts to be logical in the main, they're also shrewd tactically: Rubio's aggressive early Wall Street outreach comes as yet another potential 2016 GOP hopeful, Christie, is limited in his ability to raise money from his many supporters in the financial world. Strict federal ""pay-to-play"" laws ban contributions from those who might seek bond underwriting and some other forms of business from New Jersey.But King is spitting fire at Rubio for having the chutzpah to come begging in the Big Apple. Here he is in an interview with Colin Campbell at the New York Observer's Politicker blog:""Being from New York we're not supposed to be suckers,"" Mr. King told Politicker this morning. ""It's bad enough that these guys voted against it, that's inexcusable enough. But to have the balls to come in and say, 'We screwed you now make us president?'""Mr. King went on to urge Empire State donors to cut off Mr. Rubio and any other member of Congress who ""threw a knife in the back in New York"" by voting ""no"" on the bill.For King, this is just keeping an apocalyptic commitment he made, way back when the Sandy relief bill was left on the floor of an adjourned House of Representatives, to nurture a longstanding grudge:As HuffPost reported:""I'm saying right now, anyone from New York or New Jersey who contributes one penny to congressional Republicans is out of their minds,"" he said in an interview on Fox News. ""Because what they did last night was put a knife in the back of New Yorkers and New Jerseyans. It was an absolute disgrace.""Well, no one can say they weren't warned.Elsewhere in his Politicker interview, King professes a distaste for his party's ""anti-Northeast attitude,"" demonstrated -- to his mind, fittingly -- by the snub Christie received from Conservative Political Action Conference organizers. He expanded on this in an interview with The Hill:""If Republicans had any brains they'd stay away from CPAC,"" King said. ""The thought that he's being penalized because he sought to get the aid for Sandy relief is disgraceful regional bias. To hold that out against him shows a narrow-minded bigotry from the party.""READ THE WHOLE THING: Pete King Can't Believe Rubio Has the 'Balls' to Fundraise in New York [Politicker] GOP lawmaker: CPAC snub of Christie shows 'narrow-minded bigotry' [The Hill][Would you like to follow me on Twitter?

The Senate minority leader most often emerges into the public eye from the floor of the Senate, formally debating Democrats in the chamber or dryly answering (or completely ignoring) reporter questions in the halls. Flashy he is not. Yet McConnell's aides have noticed that the Republican conversation about catching up to Obama's data-driven, clinic of a campaign in 2012 is mostly focused on doing so by 2016. That doesn't help McConnell, who is up for reelection in 2014. And so the attitude among aides to the fifth-term Kentucky Republican is that while some in the GOP are holding soul-searching panel discussions and others are fighting over who gets to control the data and the money in 2016, they're going to run a cutting-edge, digital-savvy campaign in 2014 that shows their party how it's done. ""We have no doubt the GOP will be ready for the 2016 presidential cycle, but in the meantime, we plan to set the standard here in our campaign and establish best practices other conservatives can emulate,"" said Jesse Benton, McConnell's campaign manager.McConnell may not have a Democratic opponent yet; he has so far managed to intimidate a long list of Democrats from taking him on, all while avoiding a primary challenge from his right flank. But McConnell has struggled with a low approval rating. Some polls have shown him as low as 36 percent, though his aides point to other surveys showing him closer to 50 percent. And the fact that he is running a full-throttle reelection campaign is a sign to some that he knows he remains vulnerable. So McConnell is bringing some relatively new blood into an establishment campaign. He has hired a small firm called Crowdverb to run his campaign's data operation. For digital strategy, McConnell is turning to Vincent Harris, a 24-year-old digital specialist who worked for Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) campaign and on the presidential primary runs of Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga). Throw in Benton, the 35-year-old former campaign manager for former Rep. Ron Paul's (R-Texas) 2012 presidential campaign, and the message is clear: McConnell may be 71-years-old and look the part of a local chamber of commerce president, but he is taking an approach to personnel that embraces outsiders and innovation. Crowdverb's co-founder, Cyrus Krohn, is someone who has been ""largely ignored in Republican circles,"" Benton said. The 42-year-old Krohn is of the tech world, not of the GOP political establishment, said Josh Holmes, the 34-year-old McConnell adviser who runs the senator's district office in Washington and was Krohn's connection to McConnell. Krohn, who is based in Seattle like Crowdverb co-founder Todd Herman, has done some work for the Republican party, in a two-year stint as digital director at the Republican National Committee during the 2008 election. But he fell victim at the RNC to ""myth of the savior"" thinking, one senior Republican digital strategist told The Huffington Post on background. The RNC, led by then-chairman Mike Duncan, expected Krohn to ""work magic"" but did not give him the resources or the authority to do so, the strategist said. Krohn spent a few years at CNN in the early '90s before helping to start Slate Magazine, where he eventually became publisher. All told, he spent a decade at Slate, and then from 2004 to 2007 Krohn worked for Microsoft and Yahoo in the world of online video, primarily in politics. ""One of the things that has bothered me most about the political industry is that everyone knows how to talk a good game but very few do anything remarkable or unique. Nowhere is that more prevalent than the world of data and online strategy,"" Holmes, the McConnell adviser, told The Huffington Post in an e-mail. ""Most of the people selling data-based products or online strategy to the political world are from the political world, which immediately disqualifies them in my view. I wouldn't hire an accountant to be our press secretary so why would we hire a political strategist to handle our data?""""I spent about a year talking to a lot of vendors. Very few of them invented the technology, wrote code, understood data analytics, or applied algorithms. Most of them know politics and they have a widget to sell,"" Holmes said. ""[Krohn] and his team invent technology, write code, understand analytics, create algorithms, and build usable dashboards. They don't write ad copy and they don't even seem to have an opinion on the political application of their findings. When you're up in the air it's really comforting to know that the guy flying the plane is a pilot.""Crowdverb is harvesting massive amounts of data from publicly available information on the web, in cooperation with its partner BehaviorMatrix, and using it to enhance the McConnell campaign's voter file, to measure public sentiment about McConnell moment by moment and to track how its different messages and tactics are impacting persuadable voters. ""What we're focused on really is the inherent need for dynamic data to complement traditional campaign tactics,"" Krohn said. ""What can you glean from the live web to understand in real time, based on people's emotions, to get them to take an action on the campaign's behalf: opening an e-mail, making a donation.""Krohn gave an example.""Let's say it's a Sunday talk show in Kentucky and it's a call-in program. All of the audio from that program is digitized for closed captioning. We're able to score what was said, gauge how it played with the electorate, and then determine what the implications were in terms of how people perceived that content via broadcast, and then respond,"" he said. Crowdverb measures the response, in part, by ""maintaining records of individuals who have publicly available profiles, and mapping that back to the voter database.""""We can say, 'We've identified that the comments from this program affected people emotionally in these ways' through predictive modeling as well as actual commentary, and that informs geographically how to communicate with them,"" Krohn said. Benton said the campaign has ""about 41 percent of voter file matched to what they consider a detailed online profile,"" which includes ""things like social media handles, mobile phone number, preferred method of internet browsing, general internet activity, how people prefer to use social networks, and then also certain behavioral things or sentiment things about issues.""He continued, ""This is what the Obama machine did.""That may be a stretch. The Obama campaign, according to Sasha Issenberg's reporting, began the 2012 election ""confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans whose votes had put him in the White House,"" and then worked to identify more potential supporters and recruited them one by one with individualized outreach.If McConnell has 40 percent of the voter file identified, they may be on their way to doing some of what Obama did. Benton explained how the real time feedback from Crowdverb will help the McConnell campaign monitor how the electorate is moving, and will then inform how to respond.""Because the boss is always getting attacked, we're seeing a little bit more cycnicism about the boss than we'd like to see. They show us what they think is a critical level of cynicism that would start to hurt, and at this point in time we are below that,"" Benton said. ""But if we start to see a cynicism indices indicate a rise and that would tell us there could be a problem there, we would try to encourage our netroots people to make phone from home calls to people where their cynicism indexes are rising … with a sincerity message.""That element of engaging grassroots supporters to influence their friends was a key component of the Obama campaign ground game. Harris' job in running the campaign's digital strategy is not so much the harvesting and organizing of data as it is the promotion of the candidate through new media. ""Usually campaigns have a communications plan centered only on traditional media but Team McConnell believes in the emerging Buzzfeed culture: memes, web videos, and persuasion by entertainment,"" Harris said. ""They understand that when given a choice, many people would prefer to look at cat photos than engage with their elected officials. So we're working hard to ensure the senator's message breaks through what has become a cluttered medium.""The McConnell team was eager to talk about their burgeoning digital operation, in an obvious attempt to project strength to potential opponents and hopefully keep the field clear as long as possible. Yet, it's not a bluff. McConnell, as always, is playing for keeps. "
20840	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/17/john-boehner-government-shutdown_n_3942752.html	Opinion	1	Elections	Republican Scandals	SomewhatPositive	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"The growing clamor around the Beltway is that everyone should batten down the hatches and get ready for the inevitable government shutdown. It's an outcome that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has worked hard to avoid, for the sake of his party's reputation. But Boehner, short on time and tactics, may have no other choice now than to let calamity physics work its will.For the past week, warnings over the possibility of a shutdown have rung out. Jonathan Chait advised just last week that ""a government shutdown is more likely now"" because the time in which to actually deal-make around it is quickly elapsing. Not that a deal seemed likely. As one source, positioned to suss out the state of negotiations, told Jonathan Cohn, ""The breakdown is more extensive than you've heard ... There is no discussion going on at all at this point.""And Peter Weber cautions, ""Brace yourselves,"" because everyone's incentives seem to align in such a way that makes a shutdown a fait accompli. President Barack Obama thinks the shutdown will add political capital to his coffers. Democrats believe it will improve their position to bargain on the budget. Tea party Republicans believe the conventional wisdom -- which holds that the GOP's brand loses out in the event of a shutdown -- is wrong, and that they actually have the leverage. The Hill reports that ""at least 43 conservatives want the GOP leadership to go for broke"" over this.Standing at the center of all of this is House Speaker John Boehner, who has, thus far, attempted to stave off a shutdown on the grounds that it would be bad for the GOP's brand. But he might be all out of options. His most recent gambit was to try to get the House to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning, with a sidecar resolution attached that would defund Obamacare. The idea is to give his caucus colleagues another chance to vent their disapproval of Obamacare without imperiling the federal government. At the same time, Boehner has extended the notion that there will be time enough for hostage-taking when the debate over the debt ceiling is enjoined. (Of course, there's no indication that Boehner thinks a debt ceiling row would be any better for the GOP than a shutdown, but if his colleagues accepted this plan, he would at the very least buy some time.)The problem, however, is that the more raucous members of his caucus have rejected Boehner's ""continuing resolution with a side of Obamacare defunding,"" and call this plan a ""sell-out."" Boehner is further hamstrung by the fact that his colleagues have turned the ""Hastert Rule"" -- which holds that the speaker can't bring anything to the floor for a vote without first securing a ""majority of the majority"" -- into official House GOP dogma. All of this brought Boehner to his lowest point last week, when he vented his frustrations at reporters, saying, ""Do you have an idea? They'll just shoot it down anyway."" So now, as The New Republic's Noam Scheiber posits, Boehner might just let his colleagues take aim at their own collective foot.Back in March, Scheiber mapped out the strategy that Boehner's been using to move important business through the House and survive -- both as a House speaker and as a guy tasked with keeping his party's standing from collapsing. It goes something like this:First Boehner stakes out a position so extreme or impractical that he effectively marginalizes himself from any negotiation with Democrats. At that point, Democrats begin to bargain with Boehner's Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell. Once they strike a deal, it passes the Senate with overwhelming support. This is the cue to Boehner to troop before his caucus and lament that they fought the good fight for as long as they could, but now even their fellow Republicans have turned on them. If it is their will to hold out, then Boehner will obey it. (Always best to give crazy people the illusion of agency.) But he can no longer in good faith recommend this path. Invariably, the lunatics fold.But with those same lunatics in full revolt against Boehner's continuing resolution gambit, that particular jig is up. So Scheiber now reckons that Boehner has no choice left but to stop treating the symptoms and fully feed the disease:Now, don’t get me wrong: Boehner clearly prefers to avoid a government shutdown. He's spent months figuring out how to do that, fully aware of the political debacle it would entail. Unfortunately, it's now clear that the only way he can induce the political isolation he typically relies on to prod his caucus into semi-rational action is by shutting down the government and inviting the public backlash he's been so desperate to avoid. Boehner simply has no other way of talking sense into his people, no other hope of making the House GOP governable. And so, in the end, a shutdown is in Boehner's interest, too.The hopeful possibility here, according to Scheiber, is that now maybe Boehner's GOP antagonists will ""sober up before we take on the substantially higher-stakes proposition of avoiding a debt default."" That would, indeed, be a welcome occurrence. But contending against this possibility are electoral fundamentals. The GOP goes into the midterm elections with a very strong hand. The vagaries of redistricting, and the fact that the bulk of the Democratic base has sequestered itself into a limited number of urban districts, means that there literally might not be enough votes in the right districts to threaten any of the GOP dead-enders. And a government shutdown may not actually be enough of an apocalypse to alter the underlying electoral plate tectonics.So there's a good chance that Boehner's plan will simply further tarnish the GOP's standing, without providing sufficient motivation to push his colleagues in a saner direction.But as Boehner himself has asked, do you have a better idea?[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

What I have to do is convince the 5 to 10 percent in the center that are independents, that are thoughtful, that look at voting one way or the other depending upon in some cases emotion, whether they like the guy or not, what it looks like.""But Romney told Balz that the focus of his remarks was on swing voters, not on those who were already in President Barack Obama's camp. ""[I]t was saying, 'Look, the Democrats have 47 percent, we've got 45 percent, my job is to get the people in the middle, and I've got to get the people in the middle,'"" he said. ""They’ve got a bloc of voters, we've got a bloc of voters, I've got to get the ones in the middle. And I thought that that would be how it would be perceived -- as a candidate talking about the process of focusing on the people in the middle who can either vote Republican or Democrat.""Romney's argument that the remarks were taken out of context is a new defense for him. During the campaign, he said at first that they were ""not elegantly stated"" and then that they were ""completely wrong.""Also in the interview with Balz, Romney claimed that Obama had made a similar comment: ""And I think the president said he's writing off 47 percent of Americans and so forth. And that wasn't at all what was intended. That wasn't what was meant by it. That is the way it was perceived.""Romney nonetheless acknowledged that the quote was ""very damaging"" to his campaign. Indeed, the Obama campaign seized on the remark, creating an ad based on it, and the former Massachusetts governor took a hit in the polls."
20859	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-ferguson/hillary-clinton-documentary_b_4014792.html	Opinion	1	Elections	Republican Scandals	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"In late 2012, CNN Films approached me about directing a documentary. We discussed a number of potential subjects, and eventually settled on Hillary Rodham Clinton. The film would be ambitious, controversial, and highly visible. But I felt that it was important, that I was qualified to do it, and that I could be fair. CNN gave me complete control (""final cut"") over the theatrical version, and a generous budget.And then the fun began. The day after the contract was signed, I received a message from Nick Merrill, Hillary Clinton's press secretary. He already knew about the film, and clearly had a source within CNN. He interrogated me; at first I answered, but eventually I stopped. When I requested an off-the-record, private conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Merrill replied that she was busy writing her book, and not speaking to the media.Next came Phillipe Reines, Hillary Clinton's media fixer, who contacted various people at CNN, interrogated them, and expressed concern about alleged conflicts of interest generated because my film was a for-profit endeavor (as nearly all documentaries and news organizations are). When I contacted him, he declined to speak with me. He then repeated his allegations to Politico, which published them.CNN and I decided to publicly confirm the film project to clear the air. Immediately afterwards, the chairman of the Republican National Committee announced that the Republicans would boycott CNN with regard to the Republican presidential primary debates in 2016. Shortly afterwards, the entire RNC voted to endorse this position. This did not surprise me. What did surprise me was that, quietly and privately, prominent Democrats made it known both to CNN and to me that they weren't delighted with the film, either.Next came David Brock, who published an open letter on his highly partisan Democratic website Media Matters, in which he endorsed the Republican National Committee's position, repeating Reines' conflict of interest allegations and suggesting that my documentary would revive old, discredited Clinton scandal stories. Coming from Mr. Brock, this was rather amusing. David Brock began life as an ultraconservative ""investigative journalist,"" quotation marks very much intended, spreading scandal with little regard for truth. He first attracted attention with The Real Anita Hill, his nasty (and factually wrong) hatchet job on the woman who, during Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings, said that Thomas had sexually harassed her. Years later, he apologized and switched to the Democrats.When Brock published his letter about my film, I got in touch with several prominent Democrats who knew Hillary Clinton. I told them that this campaign against the film and against CNN was counterproductive. They conveyed this message to Mrs. Clinton personally, along with my request to speak with her. The answer that came back was, basically, over my dead body.None of this deterred or even greatly bothered me. I flew to New York and had a two hour meeting with CNN's President Jeff Zucker and his senior staff. They were great. They asked me how I was holding up -- I said fine. They pledged their support, expressed dismay that things were so nasty, and told me to go forth and make my film. I did so.In June, I attended a dinner for Bill Clinton, which was educational. Clinton spoke passionately about his foundation, about African wildlife, inequality, childhood obesity, and much else with enormous factual command, emotion, and rhetorical power. But he and I also spoke privately. I asked him about the financial crisis. He paused and then became even more soulful, thoughtful, passionate, and articulate. And then he proceeded to tell me the most amazing lies I've heard in quite a while.For example, Mr. Clinton sorrowfully lamented his inability to stop the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which banned all regulation of private (OTC) derivatives trading, and thereby greatly worsened the crisis. Mr. Clinton said that he and Larry Summers had argued with Alan Greenspan, but couldn't budge him, and then Congress passed the law by a veto-proof supermajority, tying his hands. Well, actually, the reason that the law passed by that overwhelming margin was because of the Clinton Administration's strong advocacy, including Congressional testimony by Larry Summers and harsh public and private attacks on advocates of regulation by Summers and Robert Rubin.Wow, I thought, this guy is a really good actor. And I also saw one reason why Hillary Clinton might not be thrilled about my movie. I discovered others. In Arkansas, she joined the boards of Walmart and Tyson Foods. One of the largest donors to the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is the government of Saudi Arabia. The Clintons' personal net worth now probably exceeds $200 million, and while earned legally, both the money's sources and the Clintons' public statements indicate a strong aversion to rocking boats or making powerful enemies.It was not always thus. When Bill Clinton became President, he and Hillary initially attempted courageous reforms: allowing gays to serve in the military, a carbon tax, health care reform. But they got their heads handed to them: Colin Powell went on television telling America that if gays served in the military, morale would suffer. And the Clintons also learned about money, because back then they had none. When they were mercilessly hounded by Kenneth Starr and Congressional Republicans, culminating in impeachment, their legal bills soared and the Clintons fell many millions of dollars into debt. (To be sure, Bill Clinton poured gasoline on the fire by lying.) It is very clear that the Clintons then decided never to be at anyone's mercy again. And since Bill Clinton first became Governor of Arkansas, the cost of Presidential campaigns has gone from $66 million (both parties combined, in 1976) to an estimated $5 billion for 2016, when Hillary will run. So more than ever, the Clintons need money and the people who supply it.I would have loved to explore all this. But when I approached people for interviews, I discovered that nobody, and I mean nobody, was interested in helping me make this film. Not Democrats, not Republicans -- and certainly nobody who works with the Clintons, wants access to the Clintons, or dreams of a position in a Hillary Clinton administration. Not even journalists who want access, which can easily be taken away. I even sensed potential difficulty in licensing archival footage from CBN (Pat Robertson) and from Fox. After approaching well over a hundred people, only two persons who had ever dealt with Mrs. Clinton would agree to an on-camera interview, and I suspected that even they would back out.This, of course, was the real consequence, and probably the real intent, of the announcements by the RNC, Philippe Reines, and David Brock. Neither political party wanted the film made. After painful reflection, I decided that I couldn't make a film of which I would be proud. And so I'm cancelling. (Not because of any pressure from CNN -- quite the contrary.) It's a victory for the Clintons, and for the money machines that both political parties have now become. But I don't think that it's a victory for the media, or for the American people. I still believe that Mrs. Clinton has many virtues including great intelligence, fortitude, and a deep commitment to bettering the lives of women and children worldwide. But this is not her finest hour."

North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed legislation earlier this month that requires voter identification, rolls back early voting hours and ends a state-supported voter registration drive. Powell condemned that particular law at an event in Raleigh last week.Powell pointed out that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, the very premise of the identification statutes. ""You need a photo ID. Well, you didn't need a photo ID for decades before,"" Powell said. ""Is it really necessary now?

Powell predicted that such measures will blow up in Republicans' faces.""These kind of procedures that are being put in place to slow the process down and make it likely that fewer Hispanics and African Americans might vote, I think, are going to backfire, because these people are going to come out and do what they have to do in order to vote, and I encourage that,"" he said.During the interview, Powell also reflected on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, recalling times when he couldn't eat in certain places due to the color of his skin, even though he'd just served his country. ""In my lifetime, over a long career in public life, you know, I've been refused access to restaurants where I couldn't eat, even though I just came back from Vietnam: 'We can't give you a hamburger, come back some other time,'"" Powell recalled. ""And I did, right after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, I went right back to that same place and got my hamburger, and they were more than happy to serve me now. It removed a cross from their back, but we're not there yet. We're not there yet. And so we've got to keep working on it."""

And Thursday he declared, albeit two months after the fact, his stunned disbelief that some of their leaders admitted they knew their bid to defund Obamacare by shutting down the government last fall would fail. Boehner accused them of ""misleading their followers,"" and using House Republicans and the American people to promote themselves. ""Frankly, I just think they've lost all credibility,"" Boehner told reporters at his weekly news conference.Maybe they have, and maybe they haven't. But Boehner was at least declaring war on the well-funded agitators who have given him agita for three years. And he marked the 16-day government shutdown showdown as the moment they hopped over the line to absurdity -- much the way the aging TV show ""Happy Days,"" stretching for fresh plot lines, infamously put the leather-jacketed character ""Fonzie"" on water skis to leap a man-eater.The question now is whether Boehner's outburst -- and more importantly the subsequent overwhelming vote for the budget deal -- means the influence of such outside groups will simply collapse, or whether it will limp along for years like the old '70s sitcom did.Few senators leaving the Capitol Friday (the House already had recessed for vacation) were willing to answer that question directly, but some seemed to suggest that such organizations would no longer have as easy a time reaching out to scuttle key deals, as they did during the October shutdown battle. ""I think many people are realizing that many of the outside groups exist for one reason, and that is to raise money,"" Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told HuffPost, echoing Boehner's charge. ""They have nothing to do with policy -- never did. If the goal posts are set, they'll move 'em … There's almost nothing that can be done to satisfy some of the groups.""I think that people have begun to see through the antics of many of these groups,"" Corker added.The issue is especially relevant -- and fraught -- for Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who runs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which could win back the Senate by netting six seats in 2014. The NRSC can fairly blame tea party candidates for costing them at least five seats in the previous two election cycles, including Nevada in 2010 and Indiana in 2012. To avoid a replay, it must deal with primary challenges in seven or eight contests, and secure candidates with crossover appeal against the many red state Democrats they've targeted.On the one hand, Moran wants the energy the tea party brought in 2010. On the other, he doesn't want all-or-nothing candidates who embrace the shutdown model.""Hard for me to ever complain that Americans get involved in our government and encourage us to do things, one way or the other. I'm for more participation, not less,"" Moran said. But he added that while lawmakers should listen to outside interest groups, ""we need to make certain that we don't make decisions based upon that alone.""For the 2014 contests, that means Moran will do what he can to ensure tea party purity is not the litmus test. ""What I'm hoping is that people will decide that they are interested in supporting a candidate that can win not just a primary, but also a general election,"" he said.He doesn't believe -- and neither apparently does Boehner -- that most voters want absolutist politicians.""I think there's a large group of American people, voters, who are interested in seeing this place work, seeing the Senate and House function, who dislike the constant political bickering that goes on here,"" Moran said. ""We at every opportunity -- without foregoing our principles -- ought to demonstrate that we can govern.""Moran said he didn't like the budget deal that made the GOP strife so prominent this week, but he also did not say that he would try to obstruct the deal the way many Republicans -- led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- did during the October showdown.Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action -- the campaign arm of the Heritage Foundation -- denied it was more interested in itself, asserting that the organization's efforts were indeed about promoting conservative policy.""We just want to make sure lawmakers are having an honest, fact-based discussion with their constituents,"" Holler said.And he argued the influence of groups like his merely suffered a dip during the House passage of the budget bill they robustly oppose. ""I do think there was an element of fatigue here in Washington, where people were tired, and that tends to happen, but then the American people are tired of Washington,"" Holler said.  He predicted that the conservative base would come around to the organization's way of thinking on the budget agreement, and that Republican lawmakers would have trouble explaining why they were willing to trade across-the-board spending cuts in 2014 and 2015 for proposed cuts in 2022 and 2023.""If they can explain that to their constituents, then they're in good shape. If they can't explain it to their constituents, chances are they're going to have a little bit of trouble,"" Holler said.A more telling moment than this week's House budget vote (and next week's in the Senate), he said, would come in January when lawmakers have to pass the $1.012 trillion spending bill the budget prescribes.""It'll be an interesting dynamic, and I think when this comes to a head will be in January,"" Holler said. ""That sort of massive bill rolling through a Republican-controlled House is going to be really painful for a lot of these guys.""And he predicted that if the GOP leaders ignored the disapproving opinions of the outside groups, conservative voters would see that as a betrayal they would remember next fall.""The reason what we say matters, the reason what Club (for Growth) says matters, the reason why FreedomWorks has influence is because people outside of Washington trust us. And those conservative activists are also voters and constituents,"" Holler said.""These conservative activists are smart, and they tend not to forget when they're cast aside,"" he added. ""There's a whole lot of open questions here about how is this going to play out in 2014.""At least some outside Republican consultants think Boehner essentially answered those questions by declaring Republicans would no longer be slaves to self-appointed guardians of conservative doctrine and their vote scorecard. The speaker had to go along with the fall shutdown strategy to show once and for all that the path of the outside groups leads to a dead end, they said.""I think that once they headed down that road in September, that [Boehner] decided the only thing he could do was give them all the rope he could,"" said long-time GOP operative Rich Galen, with the implicit idea that the groups hung themselves in what turned out to a deeply unpopular gambit.Boehner's dramatic denunciation served not just to say he was back in charge, but also to tell the broader spectrum of voters and major donors that they could trust the GOP again, Galen said.""I think it's less Fonzie, and I would look at it more as a Sister Souljah moment,"" Galen said, referring to then-Arkasas Gov. Bill Clinton's calculated denunciation of rap artist Sista Souljah in 1992 when he wanted to reassure moderates he wasn't a left-wing ideologue.But Galen also suggested the ""Happy Days"" comparison is correct, in that there's no un-jumping the shark of the government shutdown.""It's the peak of their influence, not just with the tea party members,"" Galen said. ""Their influence over legislation is probably permanently damaged.""Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post. Talk to him on Facebook."

The gay Republican was referring to GOProud’s exclusion from participation at CPAC for a second year in a row, banned as an official sponsor. LaSalvia attended CPAC as a guest of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a sponsor of CPAC which hosted a panel Thursday on which LaSalvia appeared, “A Rainbow on the Right: Growing the Coalition, Bringing Tolerance Out of the Closet.”At the packed panel, attended by younger CPAC members, including quite a few conservative gays and lesbians, conservative commentators and activists on the panel who support marriage equality, including CNN pundit Margaret Hoover and Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, made the case for gay marriage as a conservative value. Earlier in the day Senator Marco Rubio, criticized those who would call him a “bigot” for not supporting same-sex marriage, underscoring the tension the issue continues to cause among conservatives. LaSalvia, for his part, however, agreed with Rubio, making a similar statement during the panel discussion and getting applause from the audience. (Scroll down to listen to the full interview) “It’s truly about what people think conservatives think of gay people,” LaSalvia said in an interview on my SiriusXM radio program. “Kicking us out of CPAC doesn’t help. People aren’t going to vote for you if they think you hate their family and friends.”“How do we have a winning coalition in the future, in a world that has gay people in every single family,” LaSalvia continued, a day before GOP Senator Rob Portman reversed his position and came out for marriage equality because his son had come out as gay. “It’s broader than marriage equality. It's about, 'Do you support my loved ones?' I think that a lot of the establishment leaders are out of touch with America and with their own base. There are a few folks in the establishment that don’t like gay people.”Asked why GOProud endorsed candidates like Mitt Romney, who supported an constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, said that was old news.“Mitt Romney is as relevant as Mike Dukakis is now,” he said. “So let’s not talk about the past. I know that it’s embarrassing to call yourself a Republican right now. I’m embarrassed to call myself a Republican right now. The question is, 'Are we going to be able to build new coalition that can win, that includes gay people, or not? Are they going to become the Dixiecrats or are they gong to go on and win elections?'”Listen to the interview with LaSalvia below:

Rick Perry (R) stood before conservatives gathered at a Faith and Family Rally in Austin on Tuesday and spoke about what he perceives as a sustained attack on their values by gay rights activists.“This is a very unsettling time in our nation’s history,” Perry said, according to the Associated Press. “These are the days when a person is vilified when they state that they believe fundamentally that marriage is between one man and one woman.”Perry spoke just hours after the Supreme Court heard arguments on Proposition 8, California's gay marriage ban. On Wednesday, the justices will consider a case challenging the federal Defense of Marriage Act.Perry went on to suggest that the decision by LGBT rights advocates to fight for equal treatment was proof that they were themselves intolerant.“The underlying problem is that there is this very vocal, very litigious minority of Americans willing to legally attack anybody who dares utter a phrase or even a name that they don’t agree with,” he said. “In a twisting of logic, they insist on silencing the religious in the cause of tolerance. Now I ask you, where is the tolerance in that?”The Austin American-Statesman reports that a heckler in the back of the crowd disagreed with Perry's remarks, yelling that the governor was finished politically.Perry has been a consistent opponent of gay rights throughout his tenure as governor. He's supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and helped usher through a 2005 state ballot amendment that officially defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman. During his 2012 GOP presidential campaign, Perry put his fight against gay rights front and center with a campaign ad that quickly became one of the most disliked videos on YouTube.On Tuesday, Perry told reporters that Texas was ""fairly clear about where"" it stands on gay marriage.""The people of the state of Texas, myself included, believe marriage is between one man and one woman,” Perry said, according to the Dallas Morning News."

20933	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/07/georgia-obamacare_n_4400772.html	Opinion	0	Healthcare	Republican Scandals	Positive	SomewhatNegative	huffingtonpost.com	"WASHINGTON -- For Democrats like Stacey Abrams, Georgia's House minority leader, advocating for the Affordable Care Act in a strongly conservative state is a daunting task. Her Republican colleagues, who control the state legislature, are staunch opponents of the law, and Gov. Nathan Deal is one of 20 GOP governors who rejected the Medicaid expansion.That alone would seem like enough for state Rep. Abrams and her Democratic colleagues to tackle, but it doesn't end there. Last month, U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall, another Georgia Republican, chaired a congressional oversight hearing in Gainesville during which a handful of cherry-picked witnesses spoke only of being harmed by the health care law.Georgia is also home to Ralph Hudgens, the Republican state insurance commissioner who drew sharp criticism this week when a camera caught him likening pre-existing conditions to a car wreck in which the driver is at fault. Hudgens also bragged to a crowd of fellow Republicans in August about GOP efforts to destroy the law.""Let me tell you what we’re doing [about Obamacare]: everything in our power to be an obstructionist,"" Hudgens said. But despite the litany of obstacles facing Obamacare in her state, Abrams said that Georgians are ""hungry for information"" on what the law means for them and how they can sign up. She has made it her mission to bring that directly to them, by leading events explaining the Affordable Care Act to people across Georgia, many of whom have spent decades waiting for access to health insurance.""What we have is that people are hungry for information. They desperately want to know what's going on,"" Abrams told The Huffington Post in an interview Thursday. ""They want to know how this impacts them because they realize, whether they're Democrat or Republican, they are going to be held accountable for getting health insurance."" ""But even more importantly, they want it,"" she added. ""A lot of the communities we're speaking to have been denied access to health care either because of cost or because of pre-existing conditions or because they didn't have an option.""Since August, Abrams and her colleagues have reached out to discuss Obamacare on 40 occasions, from town hall meetings to teleconferences. Unlike most local events with state legislators, Abrams said empty seats are hard to come by at the Obamacare forums, prompting her to extend the activities through January.""A big part of it is how we frame it. There isn't the hostility to us sharing this information,"" she said, noting that their primary objective is to arm individuals with information about the law, not to discuss its politics.A typical event consists of legislators translating the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, down to such basics as explaining deductibles and co-pays to individuals who have never had health insurance before. Now that the functionality of Healthcare.gov has improved, Abrams and her team have launched ""Enrollment Saturdays"" for people to come in and access both the technology and the human navigators who can help them sign up on the health care exchange. States such as Texas and California have adopted similar outreach tactics, underscoring how critical on-the-ground operations are to meeting the law's primary objective of expanding coverage to the uninsured. Abrams conceded the problems that plagued the Obamacare rollout over the last couple of months, including the website glitches and the news of canceled policies, left people disappointed and ""didn't help matters at all."" She and her colleagues spent a great deal of time in their early events directing constituents to the telephone hotline rather than the website, but added that the struggles haven't dissuaded people from wanting to sign up.""People get sick and they want to get care,"" she said. ""The challenges with the rollout did not change what for some people has been a 10-, 20- or 30-year wait to actually have access to health care. This is a miracle for them.""Early data for November has shown a surge in the number of enrollments, although the White House is still lagging behind its target of 7 million by the March 31, 2014, deadline.As part of ongoing efforts to boost enrollment, the administration gathered state legislators from across the country Wednesday for a briefing on the Obamacare exchanges. Abrams was in attendance and shared her story, which was met with loud applause, according to a senior administration official. The White House meeting also focused on the law's Medicaid expansion, which Georgia Gov. Deal refused on the grounds that his state can't afford it -- even though his decision will cost Georgia nearly $3 billion in lost funding by 2022. Supporters of the law point out that the federal government will cover the entire cost of the expansion from 2014 through 2016, after which the federal share declines until it reaches 90 percent in 2022 and future years.A study released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, titled ""Nobody Wins,"" detailed the impact on states where governors rejected the Medicaid expansion. ""There are no states where the taxpayers would actually gain by not expanding Medicaid,"" Sherry Glied, lead author on the study, told USA Today.Georgia falls into the category of states whose residents are most in need of the Medicaid expansion. An estimated additional 410,000 would qualify in Georgia, where gaps in coverage abound.Financial pressures in states where Medicaid wasn't expanded have also put many public hospitals at risk, including as many as 15 facilities in Georgia. Just this year, hospitals in Folkston, Richland and Arlington, three of the state's rural towns, permanently closed their doors. Abrams hopes such events will put public pressure on Gov. Deal to reverse his decision. ""If we say no to the Medicaid expansion, we are saying yes to shutting down our hospitals,"" she said."

And, y– you know– I think what’s important to recognize is that– we’ve already cut– $2.5– $2.7 trillion out of the deficit.

Rightwing columnist/professional “amnesty”-hater Ann Coulter continued to rail against the possibility of any immigration reform that would create a pathway to citizenship in a column published last week, using faulty math to press her case. Arguing, as she has in the past, that Republicans should avoid trying to cultivate Hispanics because they lean Democratic, Coulter offered the following calculation:Can I see the math on that? I can see why bringing in 30 million new Democratic voters would be good for the Democrats, but how does it help Republicans? Maybe conservatives shouldn't blindly trust the calculations of the guy who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy.This “math” is based on a few incorrect assumptions. She presumes that every undocumented immigrant currently in the country or projected to come here over the next decade is Hispanic, will become a citizen and eligible to vote, and will proceed to vote exclusively for the Democratic Party.Coulter doesn’t explain how she arrived at her figure, but it's unrealistically high. The total number of undocumented immigrants in the country right now stands at about 11.1 million, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the legislation would lead to a net increase of 9.6 million people in the United States over the next 10 years. That totals 20.7 million, not 30 million.But not all undocumented immigrants are Hispanic. Some 81 percent of immigrants residing illegally in the United States come from Latin America, according to the Pew. The CBO doesn't specify where the 9.6 million new U.S. residents, both unauthorized and authorized, would come from, but working from the assumption that it's comparable to the figure for unauthorized immigrants, we can drop that figure still further to 16.8 million. Not all of them would become citizens if the immigration reform became law, however. The proposed law specifies a 10-year-long process from legal residence to citizenship. Not everyone will go through it. Under current law, only 56 percent of legal residents become naturalized citizens with the power to vote, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. That would bring the figure down to 9.4 million, though there’s no sure way to know what naturalization rates will look like in the future. Latinos also face a major problem with voter turnout. Only 48 percent of Hispanics voted in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau -- a much smaller figure than the number of blacks (66.2 percent) and non-Hispanic whites (64.1 percent). Even more worrisome for Hispanic voters, that low turnout figure represents a drop from 2008, when 49.9 percent of Latino voters made it to the polls.  Such low turnout would once again cut the potential Latino voter impact, to about 4.5 million. Lastly, Latinos do not vote “80 percent against Republicans,” as Coulter claims in her column. They vote differently depending on the candidate in front of them. GOP contender Mitt Romney fielded 27 percent of the Hispanic vote last year, the worst performance for a presidential candidate since Bob Dole’s run in 1996. But George W. Bush -- who unlike Romney spoke some Spanish and supported immigration reform -- won 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004.

Jon Karl, the network's chief White House correspondent, interviewed Trump in Ames, Iowa on Saturday night. He asked Trump whether he ""could be taken seriously as a presidential candidate"" and to respond to criticism that his talk of running is merely a ""publicity stunt."" Trump said that he is considering running.On Sunday, Media Matters blasted ABC News' decision to host Trump on the program. ""Trump is unlikely to be an actual candidate in this election or any other, and never has been- why would ABC News allow itself to be used for yet another round of promotional appearances for a charlatan?"" the organization wrote. Other viewers also balked at the interview. The Huffington Post's Sam Stein tweeted: Before the interview aired, he said that the prospect of a Trump candidacy had some people ""raising their eyebrows"" or ""rolling their eyes."" Trump was the butt of many jokes during the 2012 campaign, as he repeatedly teased his potential candidacy (he eventually endorsed Mitt Romney) and alleged that President Obama was not born in the United States. In one particularly ridiculous stunt, he offered Obama $5 million if the president released his college transcript and passport records. "
