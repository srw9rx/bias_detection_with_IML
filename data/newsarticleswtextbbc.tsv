Cispa is designed to help combat cyberthreats by making it easier for law enforcers to get at web data.This is the second time Cispa has been passed by the House. Senators threw out the first draft, saying it did not do enough to protect privacy.Cispa could fail again in the Senate after threats from President Obama to veto it over privacy concerns.A substantial majority of politicians in the House backed the bill.The law is passing through the US legislative system as American federal agencies warn that malicious hackers, motivated by money or acting on behalf of foreign governments, such as China, are one of the biggest threats facing the nation.""If you want to take a shot across China's bow, this is the answer,"" said Mike Rogers, the Republican politician who co-wrote Cispa and chairs the House Intelligence Committee.Cispa has also secured the backing of several technology firms, including the CTIA wireless industry group, as well as the TechNet computer industry lobby group, which has Google, Apple and Yahoo as members. By contrast, the social news website Reddit has been vocal in its opposition to the bill. In March, Facebook said it no longer supported Cispa.The bill could fail again in the Senate after the Obama administration's threat to use its veto unless changes were made. The White House wants amendments so more is done to ensure the minimum amount of data is handed over in investigations.The American Civil Liberties Union has also opposed Cispa, saying the bill was ""fatally flawed"". The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Reporters Without Borders and the American Library Association have all voiced similar worries.Cispa's authors say existing amendments have addressed many of the criticisms and more oversight was being given to data before it was handed over."

Mr Kerry is the most senior Obama administration official to have commented directly on an issue that has upset America's European allies.He said he will work with the president to prevent further inappropriate acts by the National Security Agency.His comments come as Asian countries have protested at claims that Australia was involved in a US-led spy network.China has demanded an explanation of the reports, while Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador to Jakarta.In other developments: Major technology companies including Google, Apple and Yahoo have called for the US government to do more to rein in the NSA's activities.A German MP said ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden is willing to travel to Berlin to help investigations into the alleged surveillance of Angela Merkel's phone.Indonesia's foreign minister said reports that the NSA used Australian embassies to eavesdrop on Asian countries would indicate a ""serious breach"" of diplomatic rules.In his comments, Mr Kerry also defended the need for increased surveillance, saying it had thwarted terrorist attacks.""We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans,"" Mr Kerry told a conference in London via video link.""I assure you, innocent people are not being abused in this process, but there's an effort to try to gather information. And yes, in some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately.""And the president, our president, is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people, and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse... we are going to make sure that does not happen in the future."" he said. Mr Kerry, in his remarks to a conference organised by the Open Government Partnership, said that while some surveillance may have been excessive, claims that up to 70 million were being monitored were an ""exaggeration"".Claims about the extent of US surveillance of targets such as European leaders have strained Washington's diplomatic relations with some of its key allies.Last week it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone had been tapped for up to 10 years. More recently there have been claims that the NSA hacked links connecting data centres operated by Google and Yahoo.According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Australia embassies in Asia had been used to spy on Asian countries such as China, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.""If confirmed, such action is not only a breach of security, but also a serious breach of diplomatic norms and ethics,"" Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said.The report describes a signals intelligence programme called Stateroom which involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic using equipment in US, British, Australian and Canadian diplomatic missions. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade declined to comment on the latest reports. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: ""Every Australian governmental agency, every Australian official... operates in accordance with the law.""The claims are the latest to emerge from documents leaked by ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia and is wanted in the US in connection with the unauthorised disclosures.In Germany, a member of parliament has said Mr Snowden is willing to travel to Berlin to help investigate allegations about the tapping of Mrs Merkel's phone.Hans-Christian Stroebele, who represents the opposition Green party, said there would need to be safeguards against Mr Snowden, who he recently visited in Moscow, being deported to the United States. The BBC's Steve Evans, in Berlin, said Germany's Christian-Democrat-led government may be unwilling to invite Mr Snowden to the country, particularly as his presence would raise issues over extradition agreements with the United States.In the wake of the claims about surveillance of online data centres, six major technology companies have called for the US government to do more to control the NSA's activities.The six called for ""appropriate oversight and accountability"" in a letter sent to a US Senate committee sponsoring a bill designed to rein in the NSA.AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo signed the letter to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, saying the greater control would help to rebuild trust in government surveillance programs."

Six of those on the commutation list had been sentenced to life in prison.Most will be released in April. One man will go free immediately and another will be released in 2018.Among those ending their prison terms:Reynolds Wintersmith, a first-time drug offender who rejected a plea deal after his arrest aged 19 in 1994Stephanie George, who received a life sentence in 1997 for charges stemming from crack cocaine her boyfriend stored in her loftClarence Aaron, who first applied for clemency in 2001 after being sentenced to a life term in 1993 in a case where he did not buy or sell the drugs in question. A pardon attorney reportedly left out new, key information in the 2008 version of Aaron's bid for clemency to the White HouseBefore this, Mr Obama had commuted only one sentence in the five years of his presidency, also involving another drug case, and had pardoned 39 people.On Thursday, the president also pardoned 13 others for various crimes. All had already served their full prison terms.A pardon forgives a crime and wipes out the conviction, while a commutation leaves the conviction but ends the punishment. In August, US Attorney General Eric Holder announced a major shift in federal sentencing policies, targeting long mandatory terms that he said have flooded the nation's prisons with low-level drug offenders and diverted crime-fighting dollars that could be far better spent. And a bill in Congress would apply the Fair Sentencing Act to some drug offenders already in prison, allowing potential clemency to a group of people estimated to be in the thousands by advocacy groups."

And they called on senators to ask Attorney General Eric Holder, an Obama appointee, why the federal government had not already taken action when he testifies in Congress on Wednesday.Under the US Constitution, federal law trumps state law, and the US is bound by international treaty to keep cannabis illegal, argue the former DEA chiefs, who worked under both Democratic and Republican presidents.In the two states where voters have legalised recreational cannabis use, ""the process of writing regulations is underway and it will become harder to rescind the legislation,"" Peter Bensinger, who ran the DEA under Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, told the BBC.He added the Obama administration should sue Colorado and Washington state as it recently had the state of Arizona over an immigration measure it deemed clashed with federal law.Mr Bensinger warned that full implementation of the legalisation laws would ""cause havoc"" in the communities, schools and roads of Colorado and Washington state.""The highways would be littered with fatalities because you're going to have increased use and marijuana stays in the body much longer than alcohol,"" Mr Bensinger said.But Sanho Tree, a drug policy analyst who supports legalisation, said the former DEA chiefs' warnings were ""scare tactics"".Their letter is an attempt to goad the Obama administration into a show-down with the states in the Supreme Court, said Mr Tree, director of the drug policy project at the Institute for Policy Studies.""Most of these drug policy statements are about turf, which is really about budgets,"" said Mr Tree. He said drug enforcement agencies were attempting to ""maintain a monopoly on doctrine"".He said the federal government must be realistic about changing attitudes towards the drug, and he said that in states with medical marijuana laws in place, critics' worst fears had not come to pass."

For Cristian, this will mean that instead of hiding his plants from the police, the authorities will supervise them to make sure he complies with the new rules.A central body, the National Institute for Cannabis Regulation, will provide those who want to grow marijuana with seeds and ensure that their crop does not exceed the legal limit of 480g (1lb 1oz) per year.Cristian welcomes the change.""I think it was about time that cannabis became legal. Police should worry about fighting crime and drug trafficking, not me,"" he says.The man behind the law is 78-year-old former guerrilla fighter turned President Jose Mujica.The president says he opposes drug consumption but wants to take the multi-million-dollar cannabis business away from the drug cartels. ""This won't be a weed-for-all country,"" Mr Mujica assured critics.Under the new law, buyers will have to officially register - something only residents can do, not tourists.There will also be a strict 40g/month limit on those who grow the drug or buy it at licensed pharmacies.""What I am doing is offering consumers a legal amount,"" President Mujica explains. The bill goes several steps further than existing legislation in the Netherlands, where growing cannabis is not legal, although the authorities turn a blind eye to those who grow some plants at home.It bears some similarities to drug laws in the US states of Colorado and Washington, where the sale of cannabis for medicinal or recreational use was made legal in 2012.But Uruguay is the first nation state to regulate the production, distribution and sale of the drug. The country, which has a population of fewer than 3.5 million people, has so far been spared much of the drug-related violence that other Latin American countries have suffered from, but officials say it is time to tackle drug gangs before they get too strong.""Last year, 82 people were killed in drug-related violence in Uruguay. We are starting to see episodes of criminal score-settling, groups of hitmen ... but we are not aware of anybody who died because of marijuana consumption,"" explains the head of the National Drug Agency, Julio Calzada.Other Latin American countries are watching Uruguay's experiment with interest.Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, whose country is suffering from a wave of violence blamed on drug cartels, has described his Uruguayan counterpart as ""a visionary"".Others view Mr Mujica's experiment with scepticism.Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade recently warned that ""unilateral policies"" would not solve the problem, and asked for a global discussion about drug policy.Uruguay's neighbour Brazil sent a delegation to Montevideo earlier this year to express its concern about the potential impact of the new law.But Mr Calzada insists Uruguay's neighbours will benefit as well as its own citizens. ""Our commitment to other countries is that our legal marijuana will not end up smuggled into their territory. This will not happen,"" he assures foreign sceptics.But the law is also facing criticism at home. According to recent polls, 60% of Uruguayans oppose the bill. Congresswoman Veronica Alonso of the National Party is one of them.""This law does not solve the real problems. If the government really wants to fight insecurity it should tackle the places where illegal drugs are sold,"" she told the BBC.""If it is a matter of public health, then it should work to prevent the consumption of other drugs, like tobacco or alcohol,"" she argues.Ms Alonso fears that the law will encourage drug consumption, especially among young Uruguayans.""There will be a higher availability of marijuana and at the same time the perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug will be lower. Therefore consumption will grow,"" she says.""This is going to cause us a lot of problems, especially from a social and medical point of view, and the State is not ready to face them.""Whether good or bad, the effects of the government's pioneering move are certain to be scrutinised and analysed by both opponents and supporters of cannabis legalisation not just in Uruguay but across the world."

Mr De Leon's office claimed the bill does not infringe on First Amendment rights because it targets the photographer's conduct, not the act of taking a photograph.Other organisations in opposition include the National Press Photographers Association and the California Broadcasters Association.""It is for all of us that I rejoice today and hope that this fight will continue and that the proper enforcement of this law will truly make a positive impact on the daily lives of all children,"" said Berry."
169	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24894345	Opinion	0	Elections	Civil Rights	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	bbc.co.uk	"This week's Time magazine front cover with Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, is titled ""The elephant in the room"". He told ABC: ""If I'm bothered by jokes about my weight, it's time for me to curl up into the foetal position and go home, OK?""""So let's get the fat jokes out of the way first. Christie is a big figure, a heavy hitter and a weighty presence,"" his campaign manager and friend of 20 years Bill Palatucci tells me.""It certainly doesn't bother anyone in New Jersey, we all have our struggles. He's got a bit of a weight problem, but it doesn't hold him down whatsoever.""What is important is the big guy's next trick, which requires all the poise of a tightrope walker, balancing on the taut wire stretching between popular appeal and conservative distaste. Make no mistake - he could be, puns aside, a huge player. He could be the Republicans' best stab at the White House in 2016, potentially transforming his party in the process. He has, as far as I can see, a unique appeal in American politics, reaching parts that Hillary Clinton can't. Rush Limbaugh, the hyper-conservative, Tea Party-adored doyen of right-wing talk show hosts, says it tells you all you need to know that Democrats love Christie, that he is a creation of the liberal media. He has a point, although not the one he thinks he is making.Christie's importance is precisely because a third of self-identified Democrats who voted in New Jersey vote for him. It is because liberals in the Washington media establishment can vaguely imagine holding their ideological noses and voting for him.Hurricane Sandy defined Chris Christie - he toured his smashed-up state, throwing his big arms around the newly homeless. He also gripped the hand of President Obama, praising him for helping the rescue operation with government money - this, just days before last year's election. It disgusted some conservatives. He looked like a man more concerned about helping people than remaining pure to a cause.He talks of getting the job done and working together at a time Washington can do neither, mainly because of the shenanigans of his own party. But a lot of Americans like this sort of talk - you might even remember the senator who said there was not a liberal America, or a conservative America but the United States of America. It can be the key to the White House. There are two main ways to win elections (they are not mutually exclusive). One, you can motivate and organise and drag out all the people who, in theory, like your party and should be voting for you. This is what Obama did in 2008 and 2012.Second, you can hoover up the swing voters, the people in the centre and some of those who often vote for the other party. It is a typical mistake of both politicians and journalists to talk in shorthand implying everyone is born with a party label around their necks.It is not true. Even in the extraordinarily partisan world of US politics there are plenty of people who change from one election to another or split the ticket, voting say one way for the Senate, the other for the president. Here's the thing - although the Democrat nomination is Hillary Clinton's for the taking, she can't necessarily pull off this trick. Many Republicans heartily dislike the Clintons, and her appeal to the centre is uncertain. New Jersey exit polls indicated voters preferred Hillary Clinton by 49% to Christie's 43%. That's not bad in a long-time Democrat state.But to get a shot at the general election, Christie has to win his own party's nomination first. That will be really hard - in 2012, the Republican candidates tried to outdo each other by appealing to the right, and as a result Mitt Romney found himself trapped inside an ideological bubble of his own design, unable to appeal to his natural constituency of business-minded moderates. Christie may be pugnacious on low taxation and the unions, but he has already evoked conservatives' ire. He will have trouble convincing them he's the real deal. On the Sunday shows, he tried a combination of ""Let's work together"" and ""I'm just the governor of New Jersey"", but I'd expect him now to trim to the right to an extent.I asked his old friend Bill Palatucci what he made of the Tea Party criticisms. He said: ""There are lots of elements of the Tea Party. The governor has great, great support in New Jersey for cutting taxes and making government smaller. Our spending in New Jersey in 2014 is less than in 2008. ""I think the Tea Party is about freedom and smaller government and the governor is about the same things."" So he can appeal to conservatives? I ask.""Absolutely. The governor is very much a conservative, very much pro-life, against gay marriage, worked very hard to get Mitt Romney elected. ""His accomplishments on fiscal issues when the state was on the brink of bankruptcy, turning that around - that's a record many conservatives like.""But Christie has ducked and weaved along the centre line. He's long been anti-abortion, but hasn't made a big deal of it; he's opposed gay marriage but recently ordered New Jersey courts to drop an appeal against it; and he's banned conversion therapy for gay kids in New Jersey. So I ask - will he stand for president? Bill Palatucci laughs long and hard. ""We'll wait and see,"" he says. ""He's just got re-elected so it's important to get to the job of the second term, a good second term.""That indeed may be critical - New Jersey's economy is not in a great way. But for the next three years, Christie will be on the tightrope - how he sways and if he falls will be vitally important for his party and the country. "

Pilots will be notified through routine announcements about where drones are being flown.The FAA said in a statement that its decision followed a 10-month process involving proposals from 24 states.The agency said it had considered geography, climate, location of ground infrastructure, research needs, airspace use, aviation experience and risk.The sites chosen are:A set of locations proposed by the University of Alaska in seven zones with varying climates, from Hawaii to OregonGriffiss International Airport in central New York state will test how to integrate drones into the congested north-east airspace North Dakota Department of Commerce will test the human impact of drones and also how the aircraft cope in temperate climatesThe state of Nevada will concentrate on standards for air traffic and drone operatorsTexas A&M University plans to develop safety requirements for drones and testing for airworthinessVirginia Tech university will research operational and technical areas of risk for dronesThe biggest chunk of the growth in the commercial drone industry is currently expected to be for agriculture and law enforcement. Police and other emergency services could use them for crowd control, taking crime scene photos or for search and rescue missions.It can cost a police department hundreds of dollars an hour to deploy a helicopter, while an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be sent into the skies for as little as $25.Farmers, meanwhile, might find it easier to spray crops or survey livestock with the pilotless aircraft. The FAA estimates as many as 7,500 aircraft could be in the air five years after widespread airspace access is made legal.However, the commercial use of drones has drawn criticism from both conservatives and liberals.   In a report last December, the American Civil Liberties Union said that giving drones access to US skies would only ensure ""our every move is monitored, tracked, recorded and scrutinised by the authorities"".But lawmakers from winning states were delighted with the selections. ""This is wonderful news for Nevada that creates a huge opportunity for our economy,"" said Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada.An industry-commissioned study predicted more than 70,000 jobs  - including drone operators - would develop in the first three years after Congress loosens drone restrictions on US skies.The same study, conducted by the Teal Group research firm, found that the worldwide commercial drone market could top $89bn in the next decade.

If crossbench peer Lord Dear's amendment, aimed at preventing the legislation getting a second reading, were passed, it would effectively kill it.The former chief constable of West Midlands Police told peers the bill was ""ill-considered"" and sought to ""overturn centuries of tradition"".It was ""blind to the laws of unintended consequences"", he added, calling homosexuals ""a very small minority"".Lord Dear also said: ""The concept should be sent back to the drawing board. This is too serious a matter to be hurried through on a whim and in a cavalier fashion.""But equalities minister Baroness Stowell of Beeston said: ""For gay and lesbian couples this matters. It matters because it means the final acceptance of who they are.""She added that discrimination against homosexuals was ""wrong"" and that ""no religion or faith would be required to change its beliefs or doctrines"" as a result of the bill.Same-sex marriage was ""new and different"" but would ""not affect the nature of existing marriage"", Lady Beeston said.Baroness Royall, Labour's leader in the Lords, said she understood the bill had caused ""anguish"" for some people of faith, but she did not understand the argument that gay marriage could ""harm marriage between a man and a woman"".But the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told the Lords the plans would ""weaken"" existing marriage, adding that ministers were confusing ""equality"" with ""uniformity"".He added: ""I and many of my colleagues retain considerable hesitations about this bill.""Conservative former cabinet minister Lord Tebbit: ""This bill is promoted as a measure to end discrimination against homosexuals, but the present law of marriage does not discriminate against homosexuals.""The rights of a homosexual man are identical to mine. Subject to the laws on incest and bigamy, we are both free to marry a woman. Neither he nor I may marry another man.

Earlier this month Mr Ford stepped aside as an elder at Second Donegore Presbyterian Church over his political support for gay marriage. His position on the issue is to be examined by the church.  Mr Ford said the language of the debate was important.""I think it's not for majorities to tell minorities that feel discriminated against that they're not being discriminated against,"" he told the BBC's Sunday Sequence.""I think you only have to look back at the history of this region in the 1950s and 60s to see the dangers of majorities telling minorities that discrimination isn't real."" Last September, the Alliance Party voted in support of legislation to allow gay civil marriage in Northern Ireland. Mr Ford voluntarily stepped aside as an elder in Second Donegore Presbyterian Church after some members of the congregation expressed concerns about his support for marriage equality laws.""It appeared my political position was a focus for some limited dissent within the congregation,"" he said.""I'm not sure how many members of the congregation did go to the minister. ""I know there were a small number who had a conversation with the minister and I've had conversations both, in the presbytery and in the session, before I voluntarily stepped aside, just to be very clear, currently from the active duties of the office, not from the office. ""I think that is very much an issue which is in the hands of the session of Second Donegore as to whether or when they might wish me to resume those duties.""Mr Ford told the programme it had been a ""difficult time for me and my family given the way the controversy has raged and given to some extent the way it's been handled in the media"".The Alliance Party supports same sex marriage in Northern Ireland, while the Presbyterian church strongly opposes the move. Mr Ford said his personal position on same sex marriage was the same as the party's position. ""I believe the state has a duty to provide services for citizens on an equal basis, and at the same time, the state has a duty to protect the rights of churches to define and practice their own beliefs,"" he said."

Culture Secretary Maria Miller told BBC Radio 4: ""We feel that marriage is a good thing and we should be supporting more couples to marry."" There would be adequate protection for religious freedoms, she said. The bill has divided Conservatives, with former Defence Secretary Liam Fox recently describing it as ""ill thought through and constitutionally wrong"". Conservative MPs will get a free vote on the legislation when it is debated in the Commons on Tuesday 5 February, meaning they will face no repercussions if they decide to defy government policy. More than 100 Tory MPs are thought to be against the idea, but the bill is likely to pass through the Commons with the support of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs.Same-sex couples have been able to enter into civil partnerships since 2005, entitling them to the same legal rights as married couples across a range of matters, such as inheritance, pensions provision, life assurance, child maintenance, next of kin and immigration rights.The new law, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, will enable same-sex couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies - where a religious institution has formally consented. It will also allow couples who have previously entered into civil partnerships to convert their relationship into a marriage. Mrs Miller said the government recognised that ""some churches won't want to participate in same-sex marriages"". ""We are trying to make sure that there are the protections there for churches who feel that this isn't appropriate for their particular beliefs,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, the government also wanted any religious institution that did want to carry out same-sex marriages to be able to do so, she said. The Church of England and Roman Catholics, among other denominations, have voiced opposition to the plans and are expected to oppose the bill, even with its caveats.But some religious groups, including Quakers, Unitarians and Liberal Judaism, are in favour.The culture secretary set out the legal position of the Church of England and the Church in Wales in some detail in a blog post in December. ""The Church of England, as the established church, is a special case. It has a duty in law to marry any person in their local parish church, regardless of their religious affiliation,"" she wrote.The legislation would ensure this duty did not apply to same-sex couples, she said. But she added that it could put forward a change to the law ""of its own accord"" if its governing body, the Synod, changed its policy: ""Put simply, should the Church of England decide to carry out same-sex marriage in the future, it can itself amend legislation to effect this with the approval of Parliament.""Mrs Miller told the Commons in December that no religious organisation ""will ever be forced to conduct marriages for same-sex couples"".Mr Fox has said the proposals will put the established church in an ""anomalous and absurd"" position. In a letter to constituents that was made public earlier this month, Mr Fox said same-sex relationships should be treated ""with tolerance and respect"", but he did not believe there was much demand for them to be recognised as marriages. ""The legislation looks as though it was made on the hoof to deal with the political problem du jour,"" he wrote. The government was in danger of ""further weakening and splintering Britain's traditional religion at a time when many Christians feel that they are under threat"", he said.""To fail to understand this is to risk an affront to a large stabilising and normally acquiescent section of this country which will sow completely unnecessary seeds of dissent.""The Bishop of Leicester, the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, said marriage should continue to be ""a union between one man and one woman. It is a social institution that predates both church and state and has been part of the glue that has bound countless successive societies together.""The ""absence of an overwhelming public consensus for change ought at least to give pause for thought"", he said. But John Wadham, general counsel at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, welcomed the move: ""We agree that couples who wish to marry should be permitted to marry in church if their church also wishes to marry them.""For Labour, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""Marriage as an institution has undergone repeated reform and modernisation over hundreds of years and needs to again now to reflect the equal value we place on long-term loving relationships for same-sex couples too."""

But same-sex marriage has been possible in some states since 2004 - and one gay couple even craftily obtained a marriage licence more than 40 years ago.""We're gonna win eventually, not this time but maybe the next time around.""In 1973, gay rights activist Jack Baker told an American talk show it was just a matter of time before same-sex marriage would be legalised.  He was appearing on the influential David Susskind Show, broadcast nationwide, after he and his partner, Michael McConnell, had managed to secure a marriage licence by subterfuge.For Baker, marriage was a civil rights issue.""It goes to the core of discrimination, you cannot let non-gay people treat you differently… you have to say 'I pay taxes to support this government and it is going to recognise me as an equal citizen or by God I'm going to disrupt that government.'""The prevailing image of homosexuality in the early 1970s was a caricature - flamboyant men in gay bars, and a lifestyle of wild promiscuity.Going public about your sexual orientation could cost you your home, your job and your family.  Baker and McConnell didn't fit the stereotype. Both in their late 20s - clean cut and with short, neat hair - Baker was a law student and McConnell a librarian. They'd been together for four years when they first applied for a marriage licence in 1970.This was rejected - on the grounds that they were both men. But the couple decided to fight. They appealed, and kept on appealing until the case reached the US Supreme Court. It was the first time the court had been asked to rule on gay marriage - but it refused to hear the case ""for want of a substantial federal question"".Undeterred, the couple tried again. This time they tried a different tack - Baker changed his name to the gender-neutral ""Pat Lyn"". A very simple manoeuvre, but it did the trick. The licence was issued and they began to plan a wedding. They asked a Methodist minister to perform the ceremony and went through weeks of pre-marital counselling like any heterosexual couple preparing for a Methodist wedding.  But with 24 hours to go, the minister changed his mind.They needed another minister to step forward, says Pastor Roger Lynn, who worked alongside the couple at a drop-in centre offering support and counselling to gay people in Minneapolis.""It wasn't just a marriage… it was a social event in the gay community,"" says Lynn. The couple were planning to film the wedding, in order to get the word out to the national media. Lynn jumped at the chance to conduct the ceremony. At the time, his church had no rules against marrying people of the same sex, he says.""The Methodist church has always taken a strong stand on social issues… I expected that the progressive side of the church would support me.""The ceremony took place in an old Victorian home near a lake in Minneapolis. ""There was a cake and rather than a bride and groom on the top, there were two grooms,"" Lynn says.He remembers pronouncing the couple ""husband and husband"".He says it was an emotional moment, ""particularly when they kissed"".Despite his work at the drop-in centre he'd never seen two men kiss - and he says he had a ""visceral reaction"". ""It was frightening,"" he says. ""It forced me to come to terms with my own homophobia.""  At the end of the ceremony, when many of the congregation came up to the pastor in tears, he says he knew he'd done the right thing.  ""It was very clear that these two people were in love with each other, and they were a good balance,"" he says.  After conducting Baker and McConnell's wedding ceremony, Lynn found his own marriage was in trouble. His wife wasn't happy about what he'd done and was nervous about the attention it would bring. The following Sunday they attended church and the preacher leading the service vilified Lynn for performing the marriage.Lynn was steadfast. ""I thought it was funny,"" he says. ""I knew some in the congregation supported me and I felt a little smug.""But soon afterwards he began to get hate mail from across the country. His notoriety was such that one letter reached him addressed simply to ""gay hippy minister, Minneapolis"".He was fired from his job, but soon reinstated on appeal.His marriage also ended, though not for this reason alone, he says.  For years afterwards fellow ministers tried to get him to change his mind about what he'd done. But despite all these problems, Lynn - now retired and living in Minnesota - says he's never regretted his actions.""It defined who I am and if I had the chance to do it again, I'd do it again,"" he says.Jack Baker and Mike McConnell received many letters of support from across the world - from Brazil to India. One postcard sent from Barbados read simply: ""Congratulations on your courageous step! Hope your dreams come true and that life together will be as beautiful and happy as can be.""The couple still live together in Minneapolis. They consider themselves legally married as their licence has never been revoked. They don't give interviews to the media now, but speaking on the David Susskind show in 1973, Baker described their attitude to same-sex marriage. ""Gay couples will come into the relationship as two equal human beings and so you don't arbitrarily assume that because you have certain genitals you'll do a certain thing… heterosexuals should learn that one.""Roger Lynn was interviewed for the BBC World Service programme WitnessYou can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

President Barack Obama has publicly voiced his support for the measure, three years after Congress lifted the ban on gays serving openly in the US military, and months after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage.""Americans ought to be judged by one thing only in their workplaces: their ability to get their jobs done,'' Mr Obama told the Huffington Post.""Does it make a difference if the fire-fighter who rescues you is gay, or the accountant who does your taxes or the mechanic who fixes your car?"""

Mr Borda and Mr Miranda said they would celebrate their wedding in September. It would be a ""very public affair"", not only because they wanted to share the moment with ""all the world"", but also because they wanted ""to give an example to those gay couples who may be thinking about getting married but don't dare to"", the couple added.Three years ago, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to allow same-sex marriages.Since then, Brazil's Supreme Court overwhelmingly voted in favour of granting same-sex couples the same legal rights as married heterosexuals, effectively authorising gay marriage. In Colombia, a judge recently ordered a notary to sign a document which - while not a marriage certificate - in effect gave a same-sex couple the same rights as a heterosexual one.In Mexico, legislation on same-sex unions is a matter for individual states. Gay marriage is legal in the capital and the southern state of Quintana Roo, while the states of Coahuila and Colima allow gay couples to enter into civil unions. Gay marriage remains illegal in the rest of the country. The gay-marriage bill is among a series of liberal reforms in Uruguay backed by President Mujica.Since the left-wing politician came to power, parliament has also passed a law allowing abortion beyond cases of rape, incest or threats to a woman's health.Last week, the House of Representatives voted in favour of a bill which, if passed by the Senate, will legalise marijuana and put its production and sale into the hands of the state."

Correspondents say the laws are in part an effort to close the state's only abortion clinic, in the town of Fargo.The measures, which take effect on 1 August, make no exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the mother.Gov Dalrymple said: ""Although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question, this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v Wade.""In that landmark 1973 case, the US Supreme Court ruled abortion was legal until the foetus could survive outside the womb.The governor said that the court has allowed states to adopt stricter abortion measures, and has never before considered a measure like this one - leaving the constitutionality of the bills an ""open question"".Gov Dalrymple added the state should put money aside to pay for legal challenges to the laws.Under the North Dakota bills, women would not be prosecuted for having an abortion after a foetal heartbeat could be detected, but doctors could face five years in prison and a $5,000 (£3,300) penalty.Pro-choice advocates vowed to challenge the legislation.Sarah Stoesz, president of Planned Parenthood, said: ""This sweeping package of bills will not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.""But as a result of North Dakota's leaders' disregard for women's health, the state will endure months and years of drawn-out litigation costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.""In addition, North Dakota's Republican-dominated legislature last week set up a voter referendum for November 2014 which seeks to amend the state constitution to define life as beginning at conception.The amendment would grant full legal protection to embryos and foetuses and could outlaw some forms of birth control, stem-cell research and possibly in vitro fertilisation.

The future of the legislation is now uncertain.The proposal, already passed by the Texas House of Representatives, was debated in the state Senate on Tuesday.During her filibuster, Sen Davis read testimony and messages from women and others opposing the legislation.She also recited previously suggested changes to the bill and recounted her own life story.Sen Davis was picked to lead the filibuster because she had her first child as a teenager and went on to graduate from Harvard Law School.""I was a poor, uninsured woman, whose only care was provided through that facility. It was my medical home,"" said Sen Davis, 50.   Rules of the debate stipulated she must remain standing, not lean on her desk or take any breaks, even for meals or to use the bathroom. Republicans watched for any slip-up that would allow them to end the filibuster. Supporters of the bill protested at one point that Sen Davis had received help from another lawmaker in adjusting a supportive back brace.Texas Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst, who is Senate president, eventually suspended the filibuster after ruling that she had meandered off topic.Democrats appealed that ruling, sparking a debate over parliamentary rules.As the clock ticked to midnight, Republicans rushed to hold a vote on the bill, amid jeers from pro-choice protesters in the public gallery.""Get them out!"" Republican Senator Donna Campbell shouted to a security guard. ""Time is running out.""But amid the disruption, Lt Gov Dewhurst said he had been unable to sign the bill within deadline following a 19-10 vote. He blamed an ""unruly mob"" in the gallery.He reportedly hinted that the vote could be held again at a second special session.Supporters of the bill say the measures will improve safety standards. It requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.The new law would mean only five of Texas' 42 abortion clinics would be able to remain in operation.But opponents say this would force women to travel hundreds of miles or resort to dangerous methods to obtain a procedure.The US Supreme Court legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, but about a dozen conservative states have enacted laws in recent years that seek to limit the procedure.In March, North Dakota banned abortions once a foetal heartbeat is detected - as early as six weeks - in the most restrictive law of its kind in the US.Earlier this month, the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives in Washington DC passed a bill banning abortions 20 weeks after fertilisation.

The Israeli military said the existing shells contained ""minimal amounts"" of white phosphorus, and would be ""removed from active duty soon"".Three years ago, Israel promised to draw up new rules on the use of shells containing white phosphorus, in the wake of the Gaza war.Some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed in the three-week conflict.During the offensive, Israel used white phosphorus rounds in densely populated areas, the UN and Human Rights Watch said. Part of a UN compound burned down after it was hit by chunks of the burning chemical which ignites on contact with air.Human Rights Watch said Israel ""deliberately or recklessly"" used white phosphorus shells in violation of the laws of war, causing ""needless civilian deaths"".Israel has insisted that its use of white phosphorus in the conflict was permitted under international law and that it sought to avoid unnecessary civilian deaths in Gaza.As a weapon, white phosphorus is used to mark enemy targets and to produce smoke for concealing troop movements. It can also be used as an incendiary device against enemy positions.Its effects however can be extremely harmful. If burning white phosphorus lands on a person's skin, it can go through to the bone. Toxic phosphoric acid can also be released into wounds, risking phosphorus poisoning.A protocol to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons bans the use of white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon against civilian populations or in air attacks against enemy forces in civilian areas."

The legislation makes provision for the interception of communications and the carrying out of surveillance.Undercover surveillance on council staff is often undertaken when there is a suspicion that fraud is being committed.BBC Wales contacted the 22 local authorities in Wales over the matter.Gwynedd, Cardiff, Bridgend, Caerphilly and Denbighshire all said they had used undercover surveillance, although Caerphilly stopped in April and was reviewing its policy.Conwy council said it would only use surveillance ""if the circumstances justified"" it.But five councils, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Swansea, failed to reply to the BBC's request for information.Teacher Kim Shaw was followed by a surveillance company on behalf of Caerphilly council two years ago while she was on sick leave. Although the authority has since stopped using undercover monitoring, she says it has left her feeling vulnerable.""My reaction when I first saw it was utter revulsion,"" said Mrs Shaw.""Then I experienced a whole range of quite intense emotions, ranging from fear that someone had actually been almost stalking me and then to incredulity at the personal details in the report.""For example, my footwear was described as flamboyant with kitten heels and flowers on the front of my shoes, which suggested that I couldn't possibly be stressed.

""These powers are utilised at the discretion of individual local councils, often when all other avenues have been exhausted.""Such surveillance operations are primarily used to combat suspected law breaking and illegal activity such as fraud.""A recent law change means that councils require a magistrates' warrant before such powers can be used, and councils are also subject to audit and challenge by the Office of Surveillance Commissioners on their use of directed surveillance activity.  ""This means that a strict legislative framework has been put in place to help balance the need to uphold civil liberties with the need to tackle those involved in criminal activity."""

529	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-21950197	News	1	International News	Civil Rights	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"A bill containing harsher punishments for rapists was passed by India's parliament earlier in March. Karuna Nundy, a leading Supreme Court lawyer, explains the new laws. Why change the law? Reacting to the massive protests that followed the fatal gang rape of a student in Delhi last December, the government set up a panel headed by a retired judge to recommend legal reform and other ways to reduce sexual violence. The Justice Verma Committee received 80,000 recommendations, held wide consultations and referred to laws and research from around the world.Its report gave many women the audacity to hope that freedom from violence and constitutional equality would be reclaimed by and for women. The new law is a combination of just thinking about gender and existing patriarchal attitudes in society, as well as those ingrained in the colonial Indian Penal Code of 1860. It also reflects the government's desire to be seen as tough on crimes against women. So ""outraging the modesty of a woman"" remains a legitimate legal standard, though some new crimes based on a women's right to bodily integrity and to be free of sexual harassment have also been incorporated.A clearly defined rule should have been to penalise violent, coercive activity.Instead, most marital rape is still legal, even the rape of a ""married"" child, aged between 15 and 18. If an unmarried girl and boy of about 17 years have consensual intercourse, though, the boy risks being sent to a juvenile home for three years, reported for statutory rape by unhappy parents, unofficial caste-councils, or religious moral police.  Which new crimes are included? ‪The new laws are closer to addressing violence as women experience it. New crimes include stalking, which is intimidating and often leads to assault, even murder. Acid violence and disrobing, common now in India, are specific crimes. Voyeurism - spying on a woman when naked or circulating her pictures without her consent - is a new crime. The law also expands the definition of rape and says explicitly that the absence of physical struggle doesn't equal consent.A major reason such a tiny percentage of crimes against women are reported is that the police don't let complaints through. Now the security blanket that protected misogynist police officers and other public servants who failed to register complaints and compromised survivors' rights during investigations has been removed. Compulsory jail time has been prescribed for the non-military public servant who fails to register a complaint or himself commits sexual assault. Procedures for gathering evidence and the trial are a little easier on women now, and more careful of disabled people's rights. Also, all healthcare providers must now give survivors of sexual violence or acid attacks free and immediate medical care. There's a legal provision for compensation but the relevant governments have not set up systems to give survivors quick and adequate restitution.Are the laws tougher?  The word tough can be a red herring: people often think it's about higher sentencing. The new laws increase jail terms in most cases, and bring in the death penalty for a repeat offence of rape, or rape that causes coma. We don't have comprehensive, long-term studies that measure the effect of higher sentences on the rate of sexual violence - but evidence from India and other countries shows that the death penalty is no deterrent to violent crime.There's also a concern that if sentences are thought of as too harsh by the judges, the already high acquittal rate in cases of sexual violence will rise further. Certain and swift justice is more likely to reduce crime. Without comprehensive expansion of the criminal justice system it's unclear how fast rape and assault trials will be, but there's a hopeful amendment in the Criminal Procedure Code - that trials ""as far as possible"" be completed two months from the date of filing charges.There are fears of false complaints, but the power to prosecute malicious complaints already exists under law. Besides, a recent UK study released earlier this month by the Crown Prosecution Service says false cases of rape and sexual violence are much rarer than many believe and compromise justice for women who have in fact been raped, assaulted or harassed.What about the age of consent?The 'age of consent' is a misnomer and lead to all sorts of confusion in public and parliamentary debates. The age of statutory rape would be more accurate. For about 30 years that age was 16 years. It was increased a few months ago to 18 years without much discussion by the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.There were those who thought keeping the age of consent at 16 years would be a social and moral endorsement of teenage sexual activity. But the criminal law doesn't tell you to do this or that. Families, schools, society and free will do. If two young people decide to engage in sexual intercourse with others around the same age, the truncheon of the criminal law is not the appropriate societal signal. Now boys of 16-18 years or slightly older may be branded rapists if they have consensual sex with a girl of the same age and the judge will have no discretion in the matter. This is against the ""best interests"" of teenagers, who weren't even consulted on this important decision, although India is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.A ""proximity clause"" is badly needed: one that clarifies that sexual intercourse between a teenager of 16-18 years with a person not more than four years older will not be criminalised.Parents, schools and communities are free to impart their social values to children, whatever they may be. What do the new laws not cover?That the new laws only protect women from rape and sexual assault and not men and transgender people is a major failure.  The infamous section 377 of the Penal Code penalises ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"". Even if it survives a Supreme Court challenge, the law is limited, and doesn't have violence or coercion at its core. The absence of a proximity clause means 18 as the ""age of consent"" criminalises intercourse between young adults that is neither violent nor forced. Marital rape is still legal - unless the couple are separated. Armed forces in ""disturbed areas"" are still effectively immune from prosecution for rape and sexual assault. They benefit from the boys' club protections that are enhanced in situations of sanctioned violence, committed against communities they are seriously alienated from. While in state and central legislatures politicians accused of crime may remain in office and benefit from the slow justice system until convicted. What lies ahead?The Justice Verma Committee report has laid out a comprehensive roadmap for women's constitutional equality - the panel was set up by the government, it should use that blueprint. It includes police reforms, educational reforms, training of personnel in the criminal justice system, services such as well equipped rape-crisis centres. The new amendments are only a start and a law is nothing if it's not enforced; but you have to have a law first. And for better or for worse, now we do.  Karuna Nundy spoke to the BBC's Soutik Biswas. "

Several thousand women wait to receive their bounty in the humid early evening air. Many of them have dressed-up for the rally, their shalwar kameezes a riot of colour, their foreheads decorated with bright bindis (dots of colour). They are here to celebrate the birthday of the late Bal Thackeray, the founder of Shiv Sena.  Little-known outside Mumbai, Shiv Sena wields extraordinary power in India's economic capital. Founded in 1966 by Thackeray, a political cartoonist at the time, the party initially pushed for the rights of the native Maharashtrian community in the face of a wave of immigration from South India. With a militant wing, a fondness for bandhs (mass strikes) and violence, Shiv Sena has been a major political force in the city, winning control of the state of Maharashtra in 1995. The charismatic figure of Thackeray led the strikes until his death in November last year.In the wake of the horrifying Delhi rape case in December, Shiv Sena has turned its focus to the issue that is dominating the country's newspapers and television channels - women's rights. I spoke to the girl next to me on the bus the morning I arrived in Mumbai, a student from Chennai. She disapproved of Shiv Sena's politics, she said, but claimed that the party's white-coated ""moral police force"" had made life better for women in Mumbai. She had taken a train at midnight the night before, something she would never be able to do in her home city. The culture of ""Eve teasing"" - an ugly euphemism for sexual harassment - is far less pronounced in Mumbai than in any of India's other major cities and Shiv Sena can take much of the credit for this. While the party has its bigots and bruisers, its record on putting forward female candidates, on speaking out against practices such as sati (the banned practice of burning widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands) and forced marriage, is impressive.I arranged to meet Thackeray's biographer, the political journalist Vaibhav Purandare, in The Gaylord - a glitzy restaurant in south Mumbai. I walked to our rendezvous through Churchgate and past the hockey stadium which still carries traces of recent Shiv Sena protests that forced the Pakistani team to flee the country. We sat outside, looking out on to a road lined with vine-clad baobab trees in which hooded crows cackled and croaked. I asked Purandare about the party's role as defender of the city's women.""Shiv Sena is facing a crisis of identity,"" he told me. ""Since they lost power in the state in 1999, they've been struggling. They are desperately looking for issues. ""Suddenly, since the rape on the Delhi bus, people are concerned about the safety of women. There are spontaneous protests, the feeling that the government is not doing enough. Shiv Sena thinks it can cash in on this.""I asked him about reports of the party's ""moral police force"" attacking women for wearing short skirts and harassing couples for walking arm-in-arm in public. ""There's some truth to those stories,"" Purandare told me, ""but they aren't just brutal thugs."" And this is from a man whose face bears the scars of a recent run-in with the Shiv Sena militia, while reporting on a city-wide strike. He escaped with two broken cheekbones. ""The Maharati community has strong, independent-minded women,"" he continued.""In a Maharati family it's the women who call the shots and Shiv Sena needs to work with this, to appeal to them.""The next morning I walked along Marine Drive, to a meeting with one of the rising political stars of Shiv Sena - Shweta Parulekar. She is a serious, self-contained woman dressed in saffron and red and frowns at my description of Shiv Sena as a party of violence. ""What can you do if you try all of the normal, legal methods?"" she asked, holding up her hands. ""Ultimately, what does the common man do? He goes out on to the streets."" Parulekar called the handing out of knives by the party: ""A publicity stunt, to make a point."" From the brief time we spent together I cannot think the pun is intended. On the television that evening, a local Shiv Sena leader energetically defended the arming of the city's female population. ""Bal Thackeray used to say women should prefer a rampuri (knife) in their purse, to a lipstick,"" he said. ""This government has failed to provide security to women so we are distributing these knives to empower them."" I tried to buy one from a plump grandmother at the rally as a souvenir, but she was unwilling to part with it. She showed it to me, though.

Foreign nationals will be deported.The institutions include the president, vice-president, any of the rulers of the federation's seven emirates, their crown princes and deputy rulers, as well as the national flag, national anthem, or any symbols of the state.The law also prohibits ""information, news, caricatures or any other kind of pictures"" that authorities believe could threaten security or ""public order"".Sheikh Khalifa issued the decree just hours after the UAE was elected to a three-year term on the UN Human Rights Council, after standing unopposed for one of the five vacant seats reserved for Asian states.Although some provisions of the legislation were aimed at preventing the proliferation of racist or sectarian views online, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said its principal effect was to place severe restrictions on the rights to free expression and free association and assembly.Joe Stork, the group's deputy Middle East director, says it has already had an impact on social media usage.""It has had a chilling effect,"" he told the BBC, adding that prominent UAE activists had ""stopped tweeting"".""Who decides what constitutes an insult, who determines where the red line is?"" he asked. ""It shows the utter intolerance of any kind of public criticism of the government""Elsewhere in the Gulf, a lawyer for the prominent Qatari poet Mohammed al-Ajami - also known as Mohammed Ibn al-Dheeb - said his client was sentenced last week to life in prison.He was convicted by a security court of insulting the country's ""symbols"" and encouraging the overthrow of its ruling system.The case against him is said to be based on a 2010 poem critical of the Emir, Sheikh Hamad al-Thani, but activists believe the Qatari authorities were angered by a 2011 poem in which he denounced ""all Arab governments"" as ""indiscriminate thieves"".Mr Ajami has been in solitary confinement since his arrest in November 2011.And in Oman, a number of online activists were sentenced in July to jail terms from one year to 18 months for ""defaming"" Sultan Qaboos Bin Saeed.The previous month, the Omani authorities threatened a crackdown, with Muscat's public prosecutor threatening all appropriate legal measures against those who made ""inciting calls"".Many have criticised the Omani government's failure to carry out reforms promised in 2011 following demonstrations.Another Gulf activist, Nabeel Rajab, is currently serving a three-year prison term in Bahrain.His Twitter account, which has over 100,000 followers, says: ""Because of tweets, I have been in jail since 9 July, sentenced to three years in prison. My friends are operating my account on my behalf."" The Bahrain government, however, says the sentence was for inciting illegal acts by encouraging people to protest and attend banned rallies.In Bahrain all public gatherings and rallies have been banned, although the government insists the measure is only temporary.The picture, though, is not all bleak.The Saudi blogger, Ahmed al-Omran, says that when he set up his Twitter account in 2006 virtually no-one in his country was using the micro-blogging service.""Now it has exploded,"" he told the BBC from Jeddah. ""Saudi Arabia has the fastest growing population of Twitter users in the world. In one month last year it increased by 3000%.""""It is redefining how boys and girls get to know each other. "" That constitutes a huge shift in social dynamics and relationships in a still deeply conservative country.So can social media change a region where royal families have ruled with an autocratic hand for decades?As in the West, much of the Gulf's social media is consumed with celebrity watching, sports and day-to-day chatter.But because the Gulf has such a large youth population, one that is educated and very new-media savvy, some of the conversation bouncing around in cyberspace is, unsurprisingly, about the need for change, especially in the wake of the Arab Spring.And that can be dangerous. Governments in the Gulf have little tolerance for calls for deep reforms and even less when individual members of the ruling families come under fire. They have sophisticated monitoring systems to accompany far-reaching laws and tend to come down hard when they believe a red line has been crossed.But even though monitoring is extensive, the sheer volume of online comment and conversation makes policing internet use in the Gulf a huge and, some would say, impossible challenge to meet.Steve Royston, a businessman based in Bahrain who blogs regularly on Gulf matters, believes that, though caution remains the byword, social media is a force for change.He says: ""The red line is still there but it is receding.""Writing in his blog, Mr Royston applauded a recent podcast conversation in English now gaining a measure of internet fame. It is called ""That Jeddah Podcast"".""The broadcasters are bright, articulate and insightful - serious yet full of life and humour.  Any young Westerner listening to their conversation is likely to think: 'Wow - these people are just like me!' And guess what - in all that is important they are.""Of course, just the idea that three people - a man and two women - unrelated could have a public conversation about freedom of expression, attitudes towards women, sexuality and other taboos in the rigid social climate of Saudi Arabia would be otherwise unthinkable.As Mr Royston notes: ""The taboo about mixing of the sexes does not apply online.""And as the online world breaks down walls and steps into previously forbidden territory the old, official world seems baffled about how to deal with it. Legislation, sophisticated snooping, arrests and even jail will have their effect on high-profile activists like Nabeel Rajab and others.But they are a distinct and vocal online minority. Others who are less vociferous or more nuanced continue to push the envelope. There is, as one blogger told the BBC, ""a subtle dancing around certain issues"".After all, says a young Saudi blogger, ""the government can't jail everyone who says something they don't like to hear"".That is a point not lost on older commentators like Jamal Khashoggi, the editor-in-chief of the new Al Arab News Channel in Saudi Arabia. ""Twitter is becoming the newspaper that we never had. It is having an effect, and we haven't seen all of it yet,"" he told a Washington conference on US-Arab affairs in October.""What could Twitter, what could Facebook do to affect change and reform in Saudi Arabia? God only knows. But it has begun to happen."" Indeed, says the young Saudi blogger: ""This is a tide, not just here but throughout the whole world. Saudi Arabia cannot stop it."""
543	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23285869	News	1	International News	Civil Rights	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	bbc.co.uk	"A senior rebel commander with the Free Syrian Army has been shot and killed by jihadis. As Paul Wood reports, the killing is part of an escalating struggle within the armed uprising between moderates and Islamists linked to al-Qaeda. The Free Syrian Army commander, stocky, bearded, dressed in camouflage, oozed menace and seethed with righteous anger. We were speaking about the biggest jihadi group in Syria, the Nusra Front, who had kidnapped his brother. ""I know the names of all their emirs [leaders]. They will have nowhere to hide. This will be all-out war,"" he said.He explained that he was now free to take his revenge because he had just paid $50,000 (£33,000) to get his brother out. He had hated to do this because Nusra would just spend the money on weapons to use against the FSA. He told me they had sent a suicide bomber to infiltrate his command post, killing 12 of his men. They were able to do that, he complained bitterly, only because he had sent most of his troops to fight in Qusayr, which later fell to the regime. I met that particular commander in Turkey, not far from the border with Syria, 10 days ago. He was describing a long-standing and often bloody enmity among those fighting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad - ""secular"" against jihadi, ""moderate"" versus ""extremist"". That struggle has now resulted in the loss of one of the FSA's most senior figures, Kamal Hamami, who commanded an important brigade in his native north-western province of Latakia.Even as the Syrian regime pushes back the rebels on several fronts, a civil war within the civil war is building on the opposition side. A spokesman for the FSA's Supreme Military Council said Mr Hamami had been driving through Latakia when they ran into a checkpoint run by the main group linked to al-Qaeda in Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.The fighters at the checkpoint refused to let him pass, saying he would need to get permission from their emir. He told them they had to take their checkpoint down. As the argument raged, one of the fighters - a foreign jihadi from Iraq, it is said - raised his weapon and shot Mr Hamami. The FSA men retreated with their mortally wounded commander.According to the FSA, the emir gave a long list of reasons for the killing, one of which included the fact he was a member of the FSA's Supreme Military Council. The FSA said the Islamic State had threatened to kill all of the other members of the Supreme Military Council - another sign of the escalating struggle within the armed uprising. This is partly a battle over spoils, partly ideological. In truth, almost all of those fighting the regime are to some degree religious, including those FSA brigades commonly labelled ""secular"". The crucial difference, though, is that the ""secular"" FSA will accept a civil state while the jihadis are fighting to establish an Islamic theocracy. A year ago, the jihadis were still operating almost underground in Syria. Now they are powerful and important players, in some places running whole towns, where they impose Sharia law.  ""This is a disaster for us, a disaster for the revolution,"" a female opposition activist told me. She was complaining about Islamist gunmen telling her not to smoke, to cover her head, and to leave meetings where she was the only woman. ""We do not want these people,"" she went on, referring to the foreign fighters who have joined jihadi brigades. ""This is not Syria.""She admitted that the jihadis had grown in popularity because of corruption and infighting among the FSA. Many rebel groups were preying on the people they are supposed to be fighting for, she conceded. I spoke to another activist who had spent two years on the run from the regime, only to finally flee Syria because he spoke out against looting by the FSA. ""One word about this on Facebook can earn you a bullet,"" he told me. The moral clarity of the early days of the uprising has been lost. Then, people wanted to defend themselves against overwhelming and brutal force - and ultimately to replace a corrupt, one-party dictatorship. Now many people tell me the revolution itself has become corrupt and, in rebel-held areas, they fear a different kind of tyranny: crime, kidnapping, gangsterism. By the laws of sheer demographics in Syria, President Assad should have been finished long ago. Three quarters of the country is Sunni and this is a predominantly Sunni uprising. But now some who supported the revolution are even switching, however reluctantly, to the regime, as the lesser of two evils. The result is that the government is looking stronger than ever.The town of Qusayr fell to a government offensive six weeks ago. It looks very much like the last rebel pockets in the much bigger city of Homs will be next. One of those pockets is Khaldiya. For two years the rebels held out here, but now government tanks are closing in. An activist reached by Skype told us that most people have fled Khaldiya, just fighters and their families remaining, living in medieval conditions without power and running water.In a video uploaded to YouTube, three FSA fighters stand looking at the camera and declare they will defend Khaldiya to their last breath. ""This is the only weapon we have left,"" says one, pointing to a suicide belt he is wearing. ""By God's will, we can hold this place."" The suicide belt is a sign of how Islamist ideology has spread even through the FSA, as well as of how desperate the battle against the regime has become. The rebels in the Khaldiya suicide belt video are clear where the blame lies for what - despite their declaration - seems like an imminent defeat. They have been abandoned by the outside world, they say, and even by their own leadership in the FSA. They say that, starved of weapons, they had little against a Syrian regime armed with tanks, artillery, jets and Scuds.For Western governments thinking about arming the rebels, there are many worrying questions: What if the weapons are used in a sectarian massacre of Shias and Alawites? What if the jihadis get hold of anti-aircraft missiles and use them in Europe or the US? Against that, there is the risk that staying out will allow the Syrian inferno to light fires beyond Syria's borders. One in four Syrians have fled their homes, many into neighbouring countries. There is a risk of destabilising the whole region. Sectarian violence has already spread to Lebanon. A car bomb in Shia, Hezbollah-controlled southern Beirut, this week was payback for Hezbollah's involvement in the battle for Qusayr, it is said. Jordan, straining with more than half a million refugees, is also said to be at risk. To stop the killing, outside powers are trying to force both sides to the negotiating table. President Assad will not go, presumably, unless he feels seriously in peril - that is one reason, it is argued, to arm the rebels. But if the balance tips too far the other way, the rebels would not want to talk if they felt they were winning on the battlefield. If Western governments do decide to step in, there are some rebels they might feel they could do business with, represented by the FSA's Supreme Military Council, the body on which the murdered commander, Kamal Hamami sat. At the top of the Supreme Military Council sits General Salim Idris, the FSA's chief of staff. He talks, reassuringly for Western governments, not of revenge or of Sharia law, but of human rights and democracy. The relatively secular rebel groups are in the minority. On many frontlines, they are not militarily as significant as other groups that Western governments would find problematic.  The hope in London, Paris and Washington, is that the ""moderate"" FSA will grow in power and influence with Western support. The question is, as the regime's offensive continues, is it too late? "
546	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19992263	News	1	International News	Civil Rights	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The east Hungarian city of Miskolc has seen a march by several thousand supporters of the far-right Jobbik party in protest against ""Gypsy crime"", and a counter-demonstration by 1,000 Roma (Gypsies) and their supporters against the party's ""Nazi ideology"".Communism was kind to Miskolc. In 1980 the city boasted 207,000 inhabitants. The Avas housing estate was built to accommodate 35,000 new workers flooding in from the countryside to work in the steel mill and a host of other factories. Capitalism has been a rougher experience. Factories collapsed like dominoes in the early 1990s. Those who could moved away. The population of the city is now 167,000. The unskilled - particularly, but not only Roma - have been the hardest hit, both in the city and the surrounding countryside.""As a child, we longed to live in Avas, but the waiting list was very long,"" remembers Mariann Demeter, a Roma woman who runs her own hairdressing and beauty parlour in Avas 3.Her father worked in the steel mill, her mother in the hospital. Avas is divided into three sections, climbing the hill of the same name. Mariann employs both Roma and non-Roma staff, and her customers are equally mixed. On the day of the march she closed for the day and joined the Roma gathering.Other Roma were more cautious. One young woman, who gave her name only as Gabriella, said she had fetched her children early from school, hurried them home and locked the doors. She lives in Avas 2, in one of the most notorious blocks. Most of the windows in the stairwells are broken. The doors of better-off families are reinforced. Some of the tenants, Roma and non-Roma, pose for a photograph together. ""We get on fine here,"" they say.Imre, who has lived in the block since it was built, says it deteriorated when a ""nest-building"" programme was launched by the previous, Socialist-run city administration. Designed to give poor families a chance to buy their first flats, it was exploited by a group of largely non-Roma lawyers and businessmen, who ran off with the subsidies on offer after installing the poorest of the poor in the flats - rural Roma who had never lived in a home with running water or indoor toilets and had no income. The ""nest-builders"", as around 300 families are now known, became the terror of the estate, ripping out metal fittings to sell as scrap, selling the baths and basins, and living sometimes 30 to a room. This offended the long-term Roma residents as much as the non-Roma ones. Several hundred people now stand accused of fraud in a long-running court battle. About 100 ""problem families"" remain, but other Roma complain they have been tarred with the same brush. ""The situation is like a road accident, in which the person who got hit is left bleeding in the road, while the police pursue the driver,"" says Mariann.What angers residents today is that Jobbik, and the media, paint the Avas housing estate as a single black hole, rather than as a self-respecting district with localised problems in dozens of flats and stairways.The streets are clean and almost beautiful in the autumn sunshine, lined with trees, their leaves turning yellow and gold. There is no litter, even around the recycling bins. The 10-storey buildings look no less dilapidated than those built in the 1970s in London, Berlin or Paris. Norbert Petrusko, a local journalist, complains that the value of his flat in Avas 3 has fallen by more than half in five years, just because of the bad reputation of the estate.  Vera, Imre's neighbour in Avas 2, has been trying to sell her flat for six years - in vain.   Peter Jakab, a Jobbik councillor and a main organiser of the far-right demonstration, is unrepentant: ""This protest is a warning signal to the government. ""We have had enough. For 22 years, Avas and Miskolc have become a symbol, a centre of squalor, of crime, of the lack of public order.""He taught history in a Roma secondary school until he was sacked for running for office in the Jobbik colours. The answer, he says, is the eviction of families who do not pay rent or public utility bills, more police, tougher prisons, and an ""end to the terror"". His party got 17% in the local elections in Miskolc - the same as their proportion in the national parliament. County police challenge Jobbik claims that crime is rising in the housing estate. Statistics released to coincide with the demonstrations show cases of assault and burglaries at their lowest level on the estate for four years, and lower than comparable-sized towns elsewhere in the country. Roma organisations say solidarity, not punishment, is the answer. ""The poorest of the poor need help not Nazi ideology,"" says Gabor Varadi, of the local Roma self-government. ""The real crime here is hate speech.""Aladar Horvath, leader of the Roma Civil Rights Movement in Hungary, says Wednesday's demonstration was the beginning of something new: ""We need Roma unity, then we need an agreement between the Roma and Hungarian society."" The Roma demonstration was ""not against the government, but against the state and its discriminatory, feudal policies"", he says."

Foreign nationals will be deported.The institutions include the president, vice-president, any of the rulers of the federation's seven emirates, their crown princes and deputy rulers, as well as the national flag, national anthem, or any symbols of the state.The law also prohibits ""information, news, caricatures or any other kind of pictures"" that authorities believe could threaten security or ""public order"".Sheikh Khalifa issued the decree just hours after the UAE was elected to a three-year term on the UN Human Rights Council, after standing unopposed for one of the five vacant seats reserved for Asian states.Although some provisions of the legislation were aimed at preventing the proliferation of racist or sectarian views online, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said its principal effect was to place severe restrictions on the rights to free expression and free association and assembly.Joe Stork, the group's deputy Middle East director, says it has already had an impact on social media usage.""It has had a chilling effect,"" he told the BBC, adding that prominent UAE activists had ""stopped tweeting"".""Who decides what constitutes an insult, who determines where the red line is?"" he asked. ""It shows the utter intolerance of any kind of public criticism of the government""Elsewhere in the Gulf, a lawyer for the prominent Qatari poet Mohammed al-Ajami - also known as Mohammed Ibn al-Dheeb - said his client was sentenced last week to life in prison.He was convicted by a security court of insulting the country's ""symbols"" and encouraging the overthrow of its ruling system.The case against him is said to be based on a 2010 poem critical of the Emir, Sheikh Hamad al-Thani, but activists believe the Qatari authorities were angered by a 2011 poem in which he denounced ""all Arab governments"" as ""indiscriminate thieves"".Mr Ajami has been in solitary confinement since his arrest in November 2011.And in Oman, a number of online activists were sentenced in July to jail terms from one year to 18 months for ""defaming"" Sultan Qaboos Bin Saeed.The previous month, the Omani authorities threatened a crackdown, with Muscat's public prosecutor threatening all appropriate legal measures against those who made ""inciting calls"".Many have criticised the Omani government's failure to carry out reforms promised in 2011 following demonstrations.Another Gulf activist, Nabeel Rajab, is currently serving a three-year prison term in Bahrain.His Twitter account, which has over 100,000 followers, says: ""Because of tweets, I have been in jail since 9 July, sentenced to three years in prison.

The allegations were published on Saturday by O Globo newspaper.They were based on documents disclosed by fugitive American intelligence analyst Edward Snowden. Brazil received the reports ""with deep concern,"" Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota said in a statement.President Dilma Rousseff called several cabinet ministers to a meeting on Sunday to discuss the issue, following the publication of the newspaper articles on Saturday.Mr Patriota was taking part in an international literature meeting in the city of Paraty, near Rio de Janeiro, but called the media in the afternoon to read a statement.""The Brazilian government has asked for clarifications through the US embassy in Brasilia and the Brazilian embassy in Washington,"" he said.Mr Patriota said it was going to request that the United Nations work on regulation ""to impede abuses and protect the privacy"" of internet users.Communications Minister Paulo Bernardo said the Federal Police and the Brazilian Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) would carry out an investigation to find out whether internet providers based in Brazil had been involved in the alleged surveillance scheme.""If that has happened, these companies broke Brazilian law and acted against our Constitution, which safeguards the right to privacy,"" said Mr Bernardo.""But the surveillance was probably done through undersea cables and satellites. Most of the cables for international communications go through the US,"" he added.According to O Globo newspaper, Brazil had one of the highest numbers of electronic messages and phone calls monitored by the US, even though the country has good relations with the US.""It is not known the number of people and companies spied on in Brazil, but there is evidence that there was a large volume of data collected on a regular basis,"" says the report.""Brazil appears on the charts of the American agency (National Security Agency, or NSA) as a prime target for the espionage of phone calls and other data, alongside nations like China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan,"" says O Globo.The allegations come at a difficult time for relations between the United States and Latin American countries.On Tuesday, a Bolivian government plane was denied access to the airspace of France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.President Evo Morales, who was returning from an official visit to Moscow, was forced to wait for 13 hours in Vienna before being allowed to return to La Paz.France apologised for the incident, blaming it on ""conflicting information"" that Edward Snowden was on board. The American whistleblower is believed to be holed up at an airport in Moscow since fleeing from Hong Kong.Mr Morales and other Latin American leaders reacted angrily, denouncing a ""neo-colonialist"" approach from the US and some of its European allies.Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua have since stated that they are willing to give Mr Snowden asylum. A statement by Brazil's President Rousseff said: ""The embarrassment to President Morales hits not only Bolivia, but all of Latin America.""Any flight to Latin America would almost certainly take Mr Snowden through Cuba, which has been relatively quiet on the issue so far.But on Sunday President Raul Castro said he supported ""the sovereign right of Venezuela and all those in the region to grant asylum to those persecuted for their ideals or their struggles for democratic rights"".The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Havana says the comments may signal a change of attitude towards allowing Mr Snowden transit through Cuba."

As the scandal widens, BBC News looks at the leaks that brought US spying activities to light.The scandal broke in early June 2013 when the Guardian newspaper reported that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was collecting the telephone records of tens of millions of Americans.The paper published the secret court order directing telecommunications company Verizon to hand over all its telephone data to the NSA on an ""ongoing daily basis"". That report was followed by revelations in both the Washington Post and Guardian that the NSA tapped directly into the servers of nine internet firms, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, to track online communication in a surveillance programme known as Prism. Britain's electronic eavesdropping agency GCHQ was also accused of gathering information on the online companies via Prism.Shortly afterwards, the Guardian revealed that ex-CIA systems analyst Edward Snowden was behind the leaks about the US and UK surveillance programmes.He has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence.The GCHQ scandal widened on 21 June when the Guardian reported that the UK spy agency was tapping fibre-optic cables that carry global communications and sharing vast amounts of data with the NSA, its US counterpart. The paper revealed it had obtained documents from Edward Snowden showing that the GCHQ operation, codenamed Tempora, had been running for 18 months.GCHQ was able to boast a larger collection of data than the US, tapping into 200 fibre-optic cables to give it the ability to monitor up to 600 million communications every day, according to the report.The information from internet and phone use was allegedly stored for up to 30 days to be sifted and analysed.Although GCHQ did not break the law, the Guardian suggested that the existing legislation was being very broadly applied to allow such a large volume of data to be collected.GCHQ and NSA eavesdropping on Italian phone calls and internet traffic was reported by the Italian weekly L'Espresso on 24 October. The revelations were sourced to Edward Snowden. It is alleged that three undersea cables with terminals in Italy were targeted. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta called the allegations ""inconceivable and unacceptable"" and said he wanted to establish the truth. After fleeing to Hong Kong, Edward Snowden told the South China Morning Post that the NSA had led more than 61,000 hacking operations worldwide, including many in Hong Kong and mainland China. He said targets in Hong Kong included the Chinese University, public officials and businesses.""We hack network backbones - like huge internet routers, basically - that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one,"" Mr Snowden was quoted as saying.Claims emerged on 29 June that the NSA had also spied on European Union offices in the US and Europe, according to Germany's Der Spiegel magazine.The magazine said it had seen leaked NSA documents showing that the US had spied on EU internal computer networks in Washington and at the 27-member bloc's UN office in New York.The paper added that it had been shown the ""top secret"" files by Edward Snowden.One document dated September 2010 explicitly named the EU representation at the UN as a ""location target"", Der Spiegel wrote.The files allegedly suggested that the NSA had also conducted an electronic eavesdropping operation in a building in Brussels, where the EU Council of Ministers and the European Council were located.It is not known what information US spies might have obtained. But observers say details of European positions on trade and military matters could be useful to those involved in US-EU negotiations.The German government summoned the US ambassador on 24 October - a very unusual step - after German media reported that the NSA had eavesdropped on Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone. The allegations dominated an EU summit, with Mrs Merkel demanding a full explanation and warning that trust between allies could be undermined. She discussed the matter by phone with US President Barack Obama. He assured her that her calls were not being monitored now and that it would not happen in future. But the White House did not deny bugging her phone in the past. Past surveillance by secret police - whether Nazi or communist - has made Germans very sensitive about privacy issues. Mrs Merkel grew up in the former East Germany, where the Stasi spied on millions of citizens.France's President Francois Hollande meanwhile expressed alarm at reports that millions of French calls had been monitored by the US. The Guardian later reported that the NSA had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by another US government official. Again, Edward Snowden was the source of the report. A total of 38 embassies and missions have been the ""targets"" of US spying operations, according to a secret file leaked to the Guardian.Countries targeted included France, Italy and Greece, as well as America's non-European allies such as Japan, South Korea and India, the paper reported on 1 July.EU embassies and missions in New York and Washington were also said to be under surveillance.The file allegedly detailed ""an extraordinary range"" of spying methods used to intercept messages, including bugs, specialised antennae and wire taps.The Guardian report also mentioned codenames of alleged operations against the French and Greek missions to the UN, as well as the Italian embassy in Washington.US Secretary of State John Kerry said that activities to protect national security were ""not unusual"" in international relations.US allies in Latin America were angered by revelations in Brazil's O Globo newspaper on 10 July that the NSA  ran a continent-wide surveillance programme.The paper cited leaked documents showing that, at least until 2002, the NSA ran the operation from a base in Brasilia, seizing web traffic and details of phone calls from around the region.US agents apparently joined forces with Brazilian telecoms firms to snoop on oil and energy firms, foreign visitors to Brazil, and major players in Mexico's drug wars.Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Chile all demanded answers from the US.But the revelations on Latin America kept coming, and in September more specific claims emerged that emails and phone calls of the presidents of Mexico and Brazil had been intercepted.Also, the US had been spying on Brazil's state-owned oil firm Petrobras.Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff  cancelled a state visit to the US in the most high-profile diplomatic move since the scandal hit.Documents leaked to the Washington Post in mid-August suggested the NSA breaks US privacy laws hundreds of times every year.The papers revealed that US citizens were inadvertently snooped on for reasons including typing mistakes and errors in the system,In one instance in 2008, a ""large number"" of calls placed from Washington DC were intercepted after an error in a computer program entered ""202"" - the telephone area code for Washington DC - into a data query instead of ""20"", the country code for Egypt.Later in August, the Washington Post reported that US spy agencies had a ""black budget"" for secret operations of almost $53bn in 2013. In January 2014, the Guardian newspaper and Channel 4 News reported that the US had collected and stored almost 200 million text messages per day across the globe.A National Security Agency (NSA) program is said to have extracted and stored data from the SMS messages to gather location information, contacts and financial data.The documents also revealed that GCHQ had used the NSA database to search for information on people in the UK.The programme, Dishfire, analyses SMS messages to extract information including contacts from missed call alerts, location from roaming and travel alerts, financial information from bank alerts and payments and names from electronic business cards, according to the report.Through the vast database, which was in use at least as late as 2012, the NSA gained information on those who were not specifically targeted or under suspicion, the report says.The revelations came on the eve of an expected announcement by President Obama of a response to recommendations by a US panel on ways to change US electronic surveillance programmes."

Mr Snowden, a former contractor to the American National Security Agency (NSA), has admitted leaking information about widespread US surveillance on electronic communications to the media. He fled the US - where he now faces espionage charges - and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia.Lavabit came under scrutiny following reports that Mr Snowden was using the service while holed-up in Moscow airport.""I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people, or walk away from nearly 10 years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit,"" Mr Levison wrote in a letter posted on the Lavabit website.He said he had decided to ""suspend operations"" but was barred from discussing the events over the past six weeks that led to his decision. ""This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States,"" he wrote.Silent Circle said it shut down its email service for both technical and political reasons. ""Email as we know it... cannot be secure,"" wrote Jon Callas, co-founder and head of technology officer at Silent Circle, in a blogpost. ""Email that uses standard Internet protocols cannot have the same security guarantees that real-time communications has.""By contrast, he said, the firm was keeping its secure voice and text services going because it had control over the infrastructure supporting them and could guarantee that messages were not intercepted or tampered with en route.In addition, said Mr Callas, it was anticipation of future government calls to hand over customer details that prompted the Silent Mail shutdown.""We see the writing (on) the wall, and we have decided that it is best for us to shut down Silent Mail now,"" he said. ""We have not received subpoenas, warrants, security letters, or anything else by any government, and this is why we are acting now.Speaking to the BBC, Silent Circle co-founder Phil Zimmermann said the service was closed because of Lavabit's action and because it feared it would be coerced into handing over keys that can unscramble messages.In addition, he said, email was very hard to make secure. While the contents of messages can be scrambled little can be done about ""metadata"" which can give clues about who is talking to whom.The US Department of Justice has so far not commented on the Lavabit closure.Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society, said America's widespread surveillance could have far-reaching consequences for its technology industry. ""...the US government, in its rush to spy on everybody, may end up killing our most productive industry,"" she wrote in a blogpost. ""Lavabit may just be the canary in the coal mine.""  "

Leaflets, posters and messages in local newspapers will also be used to urge illegal immigrants to return home.They will all feature a text number they can message to arrange a return. The scheme costs just under £10,000, which is cheaper than forcibly removing someone. That process costs about £15,000. Mr Butt told BBC London 94.9 he first heard about the scheme on Twitter.""I was absolutely horrified to find that Brent had been chosen and we hadn't been consulted,"" said the Labour leader of the council. ""In a diverse borough like Brent when 65% of the population is from an immigrant background it's just a totally divisive policy.""He added: ""It just shows what contempt national government has for local government and we have to face all the decisions made by them and they're giving us no support to move forward.""Mr Butt said Brent North MP Barry Gardiner had the highest caseload of immigration cases to look at as it was taking so long to process claims. ""So whose fault is it? Is it the immigrants who've applied and their cases are not being processed?""The Home Office said the areas were chosen because they had either significantly higher or below average numbers of voluntary returns.It said voluntary returns were the most cost-effective way of removing illegal immigrants and saving the taxpayer money. Councils were not consulted as it is an immigration policy which does not require local consent, it added.Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ""This pilot is just another part of the reforms of the immigration system that have cut out abuse and seen net migration drop to its lowest levels in nearly a decade. ""The Immigration Bill being introduced later this year will build on this work by restricting illegal migrants' access to benefits and services."""

""Based on their recommendations, and as mandated by Congress, [Defence Secretary Chuck] Hagel signed off on the legal requirements to move forward with the transfer of these detainees.""Mr Little added that the defence secretary agreed the prison should be closed.The current hunger strike, which began in February, is the longest in the military prison's history. Lawyers representing detainees say it was sparked by tougher prison searches.At least 100 prisoners had joined the strike.There are currently 166 inmates at Guantanamo Bay. Some have been held there for more than a decade, and many were cleared for release years ago."

But the director said the FBI was in the ""initial stages"" of developing drone policies.The revelation comes amid a debate about how the US government balances privacy and national security.It recently emerged that America's electronic spying agency has been harvesting US phone records and overseas internet data.  Mr Mueller described the drone use in testimony on Wednesday to the US Senate judiciary committee. He was questioned on the matter by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley. ""I will tell you that our footprint is very small,"" said Mr Mueller, who is retiring in September after 12 years as FBI director.He said drones were used in ""particular incidents where you need the capability"", adding he was unsure how long images captured by the drones were kept.The panel's chairwoman, Sen Dianne Feinstein, told the FBI director she believes that unmanned planes are the biggest threat to Americans' privacy, especially their use by private firms.The authorities used a surveillance drone during a February stand-off with an Alabama man who shot dead a school bus driver and then took a five-year-old boy hostage, according to media reports at the time.Congress has ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to open up US airspace to unmanned aircraft by October 2015.The aerospace industry predicts there will be 30,000 drones deployed globally within five years, half of them in the US, the Associated Press news agency reports.In March, a Republican senator raised concerns about the use of drones against Americans.Kentucky's Rand Paul demanded a pledge that the federal government would not use such aircraft in the US to kill terror suspects who are American citizens.Sen Paul spoke without a pause on the issue for nearly 13 hours on the Senate floor, in a tactic known as a filibuster, to delay the nomination of a new CIA chief.In May, US President Barack Obama said he would curtail the use of armed drones in operations outside the US.Under the new policy described by the White House, the US will only allow drones to be used in areas that are not overt war zones when there was a ""continuing, imminent threat"" to the US and capture was not feasible."

On Monday in a Washington DC federal court, Judge Leon called the NSA's surveillance programme ""indiscriminate"" and an ""almost Orwellian technology that enables the government to store and analyze the phone metadata of every telephone user in the United States"".The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by conservative activist Larry Klayman, a user of a Verizon mobile telephone who challenged the NSA's collection of metadata on his behalf and that of a client.On Tuesday morning, US President Barack Obama met chief executives from the nation's top technology companies - including Google and Apple.He was expected to discuss the NSA's surveillance programmes as well as government information technology reforms; the legal ruling may also come up.The NSA had ordered Verizon - one of the largest phone companies in the US - to disclose to it metadata, including telephone numbers, calling card numbers and the serial numbers of phones, of millions of calls it processes in which at least one party is in the US.Judge Leon ruled the plaintiffs had demonstrated ""a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their Fourth Amendment claim and that they will suffer irreparable harm absent… relief"", referring to the clause in the US constitution that bars unreasonable search and seizure by the government.He issued a preliminary injunction against the NSA surveillance programme but suspended the order to allow for an appeal by the justice department, thus enabling the programme to continue for now.Mr Klayman told the BBC the ruling ""could have immediate impact. ""If the NSA continues to do this, they're now on notice that it's illegal, and we will seek to have them held in criminal contempt of court.""Through Glenn Greenwald, a journalist with whom he has close ties, Mr Snowden issued a statement hailing the ruling.""I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts,"" he wrote, according to the New York Times. ""Today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights,"" he added. ""It is the first of many."" Earlier on Monday, the White House rejected an amnesty for Mr Snowden.Press secretary Jay Carney said the US government continued to press Russia - where Mr Snowden has been granted asylum - to return him to the US.""There's been no change in our position,"" he told reporters. On Sunday, Richard Ledgett, head of the NSA's task force investigating damage from Mr Snowden's leaks, discussed the possibility of an amnesty.""My personal view is, yes it's worth having a conversation about,"" he told the US television channel CBS."

A master on computers"".Explaining why he decided to leave the US, he told the Guardian: ""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things… I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.""The US has charged Mr Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.Mr Snowden, 30, had been living with his girlfriend in Hawaii, but left, initially for Hong Kong where, with his consent, the UK's Guardian newspaper revealed his identity.After the US filed charges and asked local authorities to extradite him, Mr Snowden left Hong Kong on 23 June, initially for Moscow, but with the intention of seeking asylum in Ecuador.Ecuador has said it could not consider Mr Snowden's asylum request until he had arrived in the Latin American country, or one of its diplomatic missions.With the knowledge that the US does have an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, Mr Snowden left on an Aeroflot flight to Moscow.He remained in a transit zone in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport for more than a month after the US revoked his travel documents. In August, he was given permission to enter Russia after he was offered asylum there for one year.His father, Lon, visited him in October.Mr Snowden is reported to have grown up in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and later moved to Maryland, near the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade.Describing himself as a less-than-stellar student, he is said to have studied computing at a Maryland community college to get the necessary credits to obtain a high school diploma. However, he never finished the course.In 2003, he joined the US Army and began training with the special forces, only to be discharged after breaking both his legs in a training accident.His first job with the NSA was as a security guard for one of the agency's secret facilities at the University of Maryland. He then worked on IT security at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).Despite his lack of formal qualifications, it is said that his computer wizardry allowed him to quickly rise through intelligence ranks.By 2007, he was given a CIA post with diplomatic cover in Geneva.Mr Snowden told the Guardian: ""Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world. I realised that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.""Mr Snowden said he had considered going public earlier, but waited to see whether President Barack Obama's election in 2008 would change the US approach.""[Mr Obama] continued with the policies of his predecessor,"" he said.According to campaign finance records, Mr Snowden gave money in 2012 to Republican presidential long-shot Ron Paul, who supports strictly curtailing the powers of government.Mr Snowden reportedly made two donations of $250 (£160) over the course of the campaign.He left the CIA in 2009 and began working at the NSA as an employee of various outside contractors, including consulting giant Booz Allen.In a statement, the company confirmed he had been an employee of the firm for less than three months, assigned to a team in Hawaii. ""News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm, it said.Mr Snowden admitted to Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper that he took the job at Booz Allen because he wanted access to classified information to gather evidence.He was formally sacked on 11 June.Mr Snowden was on a salary of $122,000 according to a statement from his employer.He and his girlfriend moved out of their home in Waipahu, West Oahu, Hawaii, on 1 May, estate agents said, leaving nothing behind.A neighbour told ABC that the couple usually kept the blinds and doors closed and ""didn't really talk to anyone at all around here"".His then-girlfriend, whose personal blog includes photos of her pole dancing, has said her partner's sudden disappearance caught her by surprise.""My world has opened and closed all at once,"" Lindsay Mills wrote.

Mr De Leon's office claimed the bill does not infringe on First Amendment rights because it targets the photographer's conduct, not the act of taking a photograph.Other organisations in opposition include the National Press Photographers Association and the California Broadcasters Association.""It is for all of us that I rejoice today and hope that this fight will continue and that the proper enforcement of this law will truly make a positive impact on the daily lives of all children,"" said Berry."

But the US Olympic Committee swiftly rejected the idea.Wednesday's hearing in Washington DC was one of the most searching on US government surveillance since the 9/11 attacks, correspondents say.Questioning became heated as congressmen said the scope of the snooping made it vulnerable to government abuse. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican, said: ""That's exactly what the American people are worried about.""That's what's infuriating the American people. They're understanding that if you collect that amount of data, people can get access to it in ways that can harm them.""But Robert Litt, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said Congress already knew about the government's security policy.""When it comes to telephone calls, every member of Congress has been briefed on this programme,"" Mr Litt told the panel.The deputy attorney general argued that the government had to build its own database of phone records because the telecommunications firms did not keep them for long enough.But Wisconsin Republican James Sensenbrenner - one of the original sponsors of the Patriot Act, under which the NSA programme was authorised - threatened that the law might not be approved again in 2015.""Unless you realise you've got a problem,"" Mr Sensenbrenner said, ""that is not going to be renewed.""Representative Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, said that without the leaks by Mr Snowden many lawmakers would not have known how far the NSA programme reached.""Snowden, I don't like him at all, but we would never have known what happened if he hadn't told us,"" Mr Poe said.The Patriot Act was passed by Congress in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, granting sweeping security powers to the government.

Democratic President Barack Obama has denounced the practice as unacceptable and Attorney General Eric Holder has said the FBI has launched a criminal inquiry.The hearing in the House ways and means committee came at the end of a difficult week for the White House, which has also faced new questions about a deadly assault on the US diplomatic mission in Libya and fended off attacks on the seizure of reporters' phone records. Friday's was the first in a series of congressional hearings on the tax affair - correspondents say Republicans hope to use it to discredit Mr Obama just months into his second term.""I want to apologise on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service for the mistakes that we made and the poor service we provided,"" Mr Miller told the panel.""Partisanship - and even the perception of partisanship - has no place at the Internal Revenue Service.""J Russell George, the treasury department inspector general for tax administration, told the committee that he had not seen evidence IRS officials were under political pressure to target conservative groups.But leading Republicans on the committee said the misconduct was not a mere management lapse.""The reality is this is not a personnel problem. This is a problem of the IRS being too large, too powerful, too intrusive and too abusive of honest, hardworking taxpayers,"" House ways and means committee chairman Dave Camp said at the opening of Friday's hearing.The Michigan Republican said the affair appeared to be just one case of a ""culture of cover-ups"" in the IRS.""It seems like the truth is hidden from the American people just long enough to make it through an election,"" Mr Camp said.While Mr Obama's Democrats have been reluctant to defend the tax agency, the senior Democrat on the committee, Sander Levin, warned his colleagues not to allow legitimate inquiries into problems at the IRS to devolve into a political brawl.For his part, Mr Obama attempted to refocus on the economy with a trip to Baltimore, Maryland in which he said lawmakers should spend their time on helping people get back to work. ""Our focus cannot drift,"" Mr Obama said. The IRS has acknowledged that beginning in 2010, staff in a Cincinnati, Ohio, branch office delayed the filings for tax-exempt status of groups that had words such as ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their names or that otherwise indicated their conservative orientation.Mr Miller testified on Friday that while the practice of maintaining a list of keywords that flagged conservative groups for extra review was ""intolerable"", it was a mistake and had merely been put together by civil servants trying to work more efficiently. The practice of extra screening began in response to a Supreme Court ruling that loosened campaign finance rules, Mr Miller said. During questions, the outgoing IRS head said the agents did not use search words associated with liberal causes - like ""progress"" or ""organising"".The number of applications from so-called ""social welfare"" groups seeking tax-exempt status nearly doubled from 2009-2012 to 3,300 a year, Mr George's report found. Under US tax law, the groups were entitled to a tax exemption so long as campaigning was not their ""primary activity"". Amid reports some of the groups were violating that threshold, the IRS deemed some level of review appropriate.The list of watch words was assembled by a ""determinations unit"" based in Cincinnati, and there seemed to be little or no supervisory review of the list, inspector general Mr George told the committee.""The determinations unit requested unnecessary information because of a lack of managerial review, at all levels,"" Mr Russell said.""We concluded that determinations unit specialists lacked knowledge of what activities are allowed.""The IRS is an independent agency within the treasury department.Mr George's investigation, revealed this week, found that 296 groups had been subjected to additional auditing. In those cases the IRS may have asked for lists of donors, the groups' positions on a range of issues, and whether the groups' senior members intended to run for public office.Many of the applicants faced considerable delays in obtaining tax-exempt status, but none were turned down, he added.In addition to Mr Miller, Joseph Grant, commissioner of the IRS's tax-exempt and government-entities division, said on Thursday that he was stepping down within a month."

For the sake of national security, it's time to stop playing politics with our Department of Defense and to move beyond the distractions and delay.""But Republicans, who have agreed to a vote following an upcoming 10-day recess, have said they need more time to weigh outstanding questions about Mr Hagel.South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham also said he would continue to use the confirmation vote as leverage in his effort to wring more information from the White House about the response to the 11 September attack on a US consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Mr Hagel was a private citizen at the time of the attack.""There seems to not be much interest to hold this president accountable for a national security breakdown that led to the first ambassador being killed in the line of duty in over 30 years,"" Sen Graham said. ""No, the debate on Chuck Hagel is not over. It has not been serious. We don't have the information we need. ""And I'm going to fight the idea of jamming somebody through until we get answers about what the president did personally when it came to the Benghazi debacle.""On Thursday, Republicans forced the delay with a parliamentary manoeuvre blocking the Senate Democratic leader's motion to end debate on Mr Hagel's nomination and proceed to an up-or-down vote on confirmation.Even though the Democrats command a majority of 55 votes, Senate rules in this case require them to come up with 60 to end debate. They fell one short.Mr Hagel, a decorated and twice-wounded veteran of the Vietnam War, served in the Senate for 12 years.But correspondents say he is seen by some of his former colleagues as a renegade for breaking with Republican ranks on issues such as the Iraq war.He has also been criticised during the confirmation process for comments he made years ago claiming ""the Jewish lobby"" had too much influence over American policy.His remarks in 1998 that a nominee for an ambassadorial post was ""openly, aggressively gay"" have also raised eyebrows.

But, Mr Johnson said, ""only by a whisker"".According to OBR estimates, the deficit will fall to £120.9bn this financial year from £121bn in 2011-12 - a mere £100m, which Mr Johnson described as akin to a ""rounding error"".""There is every indication that the numbers have been carefully managed with a close eye on the headline borrowing figures for this year,"" he said.""It is unlikely that this has led either to an economically optimal allocation of spending across years, or to a good use of time by officials and ministers.""The IFS also highlighted how the poor performance of the economy had led the the OBR year after year to cut its forecasts for economic growth, and to raise its forecasts for the deficit, for total government indebtedness, and for the scale of spending cuts needed to bring its finances back under control.In June 2010, the chancellor had expected that by 2014-15 the deficit would have fallen to £37bn. The latest revised OBR deficit now puts the figure at £108bn."

The 1 October launch of the federal and state marketplace websites was the culmination of more than three years of political combat in Washington over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Mr Obama in 2010 and known to both sides as Obamacare.Considered the largest overhaul of the US healthcare system since the 1960s, it aims to extend health insurance coverage to the estimated 15% of the US population who lack it. Those people receive no coverage from their employers and are not covered by US health programmes for the poor and the elderly.But Healthcare.gov - akin to a shopping website for health insurance plans - has been plagued by glitches, especially long wait times to sign up and serious flaws on the back end where customers' data are processed and sent to insurance companies.Ms Sebelius, appointed secretary of health and human services by Mr Obama in 2009, told the House committee in prepared remarks that more than 20 million people had visited the website since its launch, but acknowledged the experience was ""frustrating"" for many Americans. The Obama administration has declined to say how many Americans have actually enrolled in new policies through the sites, rankling Republicans who accuse it of withholding vital information.Ms Sebelius said the problems were ""fixable"" and that changes had already been made to improve the site's speed and reliability. She said the federal government was working with the numerous contractors who built the site, and that the Obama administration projected it would be fully up and running by the end of November.The committee's senior Democrat, Henry Waxman, acknowledged ""the launch of the new website has not gone well"" but just as with a prescription drug programme for pensioners enacted under Republican President George Bush, the ""early glitches will soon be forgotten"".""We should keep this issue in perspective - the Affordable Care Act is working,"" he said. ""It has been improving the health security of millions of Americans for the past three years.""Republican committee chairman Fred Upton called the website ""inept"", saying that five weeks into enrolment, ""the news seems to get worse by the day"".He also questioned why hundreds of thousands of Americans had received letters from their insurance companies saying their policies were being cancelled - despite past assurances from Mr Obama that people who liked their insurance plans would be able to keep them under the health law.Ms Sebelius rejected that criticism, saying that people whose plans were dropped would have access under the new law to better insurance coverage at comparable rates.And Democrat Frank Pallone, a supporter of the health law, called Republicans' concerns over the cancellation letters a ""red herring"" and said insurance companies were closing ""lousy policies with high prices because they can't compete"".Some Republicans have called for Ms Sebelius' resignation over the issue. They argue the problems with the website that prevent consumers from signing up reflect broader problems with the healthcare law.Republicans view the health law as a costly and inappropriate government intrusion into the healthcare system, and have sought to undo or undermine it at every turn.""Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible,"" Ms Sebelius told the committee after several members asked which contractors and Obama administration officials were responsible for issues.Aside from establishing the healthcare.gov health insurance marketplace website and others run by the states, the law bolsters coverage requirements for insurance firms, mandates that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and offers subsidies to assist in the purchase of the insurance. It also expands eligibility for the Medicaid government health programme for the poor.Amid the fallout, the White House has said it will grant a six-week extension - until 31 March 2014 - in the healthcare law's requirement for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty.Mr Obama is scheduled to speak about the healthcare rollout in the state of Massachusetts on Wednesday afternoon."
1142	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24664045	News	1	International News	Democrat Scandals	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"On Wednesday evening the White House was supposed to host one of the most lavish events on Washington's social calendar - a state dinner for a visiting VIP.It ended up being cancelled - not because of any lingering effects from the partial shutdown of the federal government. Nor was President Barack Obama called away on urgent business.Rather, the guest of honour announced last month that she would not be attending. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was aggrieved that her private communications had apparently been snooped upon by American intelligence.In cancelling her state visit, she was making a pointed personal and national protest.On Wednesday afternoon, rather than preparing to welcome one of America's allies to the White House, Mr Obama found himself listening to grievances from another. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called to complain that her private mobile had been tapped.The president's spokesman assured the news media that the National Security Agency (NSA) ""is not monitoring and will not monitor"" her phone. But he was unable to tell her that it had not listened to her calls previously.His inability to speak in the past tense was tantamount to an admission that the NSA was guilty as charged.The ""Snowden effect"" has created an ever angrier diplomatic backlash. The secrets that the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden took with him when he left America are causing ructions around the world.On Monday, it was French President Francois Hollande who complained to Mr Obama about the vast surveillance operation the NSA had allegedly conducted against political and business figures in France.Mexico is annoyed that their president, Enrique Pena Nieto, and his predecessor Felipe Calderon, had been snooped upon. America has also been accused of bugging the United Nations and European Union.The latest allegations, published in Britain's Guardian newspaper, are that the phone conversations of 35 world leaders have been monitored.Doubtless, some of the outrage from aggrieved allies is intended for domestic consumption. And it is hardly as if America is the only country to spy on its allies.  But as the list of wronged friends grows by the day, the Snowden effect is not just complicating US diplomacy but also seriously compromising it.  When Secretary of State John Kerry touched down in Paris this week he was confronted by the spying allegations published in that morning's Le Monde.On the day Angela Merkel challenged her American counterpart, two senior Obama administration officials were in Berlin for talks on a new transatlantic trade deal called the biggest such agreement in history.For the Obama administration it is not merely a case of smoothing some ruffled feathers. Daily, it needs to put out diplomatic fires. And, increasingly, the damage looks as though it could be lasting. Consider the impact on the personal relationship between Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, which up until now has been close.""Spying among friends is not on,"" complained the German Chancellor at the EU Summit in Brussels. ""Trust will now have to be rebuilt."" Nor is it merely the NSA revelations that are hampering US diplomacy. This week John Kerry has been trying to allay Israel's concerns about America's openness to the recent overtures from the new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Saudi Arabia, its other main strategic ally in the Middle East, has also been dismayed that Washington has warmed towards Tehran.Fuelling its anger is what Prince Turki al-Faisal, a member of the royal family and former director of Saudi intelligence, this week described as the Obama administration's ""lamentable"" policy towards Syria. Riyadh's decision this month not to take up its seat on the UN Security Council was intended to send a message to the US, not the UN. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have similar misgivings over the president's failure to intervene more strongly in Syria's civil war.  Further afield, America is confronted by problems of its own making. Less than two years after announcing Washington's much-vaunted ""Asian pivot,"" the federal shutdown prevented Mr Obama from attending the key annual gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders. Instead, China was left to take centre stage.To argue that the NSA scandal threatens to damage Barack Obama in the same way that the Iraq War undercut George W Bush is surely too strong.The Bush administration's hyper-unilateralism and wilful disregard for the views of longstanding allies caused deep resentment in Europe.But this is turning out to be a major embarrassment for a president who entered office in 2009 determined to repair frayed relations with some of its longstanding allies, like France, and to restore America's international standing.

It was one of the ""strangest speeches a president has given in my lifetime"", wrote Ross Douthat of the New York Times. ""A prime time presidential address should either announce a policy course or make a specific appeal to Congress; it should not be wasted on a situation where the course is so unclear and the appeal so vague and undirected."" Joan Walsh of Salon.com echoed Douthat's criticism, calling it ""a strangely lackluster address that essentially served as a placeholder for a theoretical future battle"". Many writers said Mr Obama's speech was disjointed, because he spent most of it apparently building a case for military strikes against Syria, only to acknowledge that recent diplomatic developments may make the use of force unnecessary. As the New Republic's John Judis put it: ""The speech did not have the structure of an argument, but of a television drama in which the viewer's anxiety is finally relieved by the promise of peaceful resolution."" ""The overwhelming emphasis was on humanitarian goals, with a brief, secondary, and noticeably weak effort to buttress that case with talk about threats to our interests,"" wrote Stanley Kurtz in National Review Online. The speech was ""a time filler"", wrote Peggy Noonan in The Wall Street Journal. ""The White House had asked for the time and had to fill it."" Others criticised Mr Obama's references in his address to the suffering of the Syrian children. Erick Erickson of RedState wrote: ""When we are doing things 'for the children' as opposed to any other reason, we have no substantive reason for taking an action."" Mr Obama's pleas to remember the children echoed the president's words following last December's mass murder at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, noted Politico columnist Roger Simon. Little has changed since that call to action, Simon wrote, but ""in Syria, because the weaponry was gas instead of bullets, we are supposed to be ultra-shocked"". Even among those who thought Mr Obama did a good job with the speech, many had caveats. Matt Miller of the Washington Post wrote that ""Obama traded in the wobbly mien he displayed in recent appearances for the confident bearing Americans need from their commander in chief"". He cautioned, however, that ""between the long-running box he's now put himself in on Syria, and the prospect of the White House botching another debt ceiling showdown just ahead, the president's authority in his second term is in danger of collapse"". Toward the end of his speech, Mr Obama cited the ""exceptional"" nature of America as a reason the country should not ignore the use of chemical weapons halfway around the world. Conservatives who picked up on Mr Obama's turn of phrase were none too pleased. Scott Johnson of the blog PowerLine wrote: ""This is American exceptionalism filtered through the mind of a man who doesn't believe it."" Despite the negative reaction among commentators, a CNN poll found 61% of those who watched the speech now support the president's Syria policy. ""The poll suggests that he did what presidents rarely do: change people's minds, if only temporarily,"" David Kusnet, former head speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, wrote for CNN. ""With down-to-earth arguments and a lofty conclusion, last night's speech was a model of how to turn an audience around, point by point."" "

It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator.""In another tense moment, Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said Mrs Clinton's acknowledgement that she had not read the cables from Libya seeking additional security ahead of the attack was ""inexcusable"".""Had I been president at the time and I found that you did not read the cables,"" he said, ""I would have relieved you of your post.""Mrs Clinton told the senators her department was implementing - as well as going above and beyond - 29 recommendations by an independent panel that investigated the incident.Earlier, Mrs Clinton's voice cracked with emotion as she described the moment she and President Barack Obama welcomed home the coffins of those killed in the Benghazi attacks. ""I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters, and the wives left alone to raise their children,"" she said.Mrs Clinton testified in the afternoon before the House foreign affairs committee, where Republican members pressed her on why cables and other memos about security deficiencies in Benghazi seemed to have been ignored.""The dots here were connected ahead of time. The state department saw this was coming,"" said Representative Ed Royce, a Republican and the chairman of the panel. ""The state department didn't act.""Four state department employees have been put on administrative leave over the Benghazi attack.Mrs Clinton, who is stepping down from her post in two weeks, has spent a month recuperating from a series of ailments in December, which delayed her testimony.She is considered a strong candidate for the Democratic nomination for president should she run in 2016.Mr Obama has nominated Democratic Senator John Kerry to replace her as Secretary of State."

Moments later, the line was cut.Later that night Mr Hicks heard from the Libyan prime minister, who informed him the ambassador was dead.During the night, Mr Hicks said he received calls from Libyans using the ambassador's phone. They said they had the envoy with them.But Mr Hicks did not act on the calls, fearing an ambush.Mr Hicks also expressed frustration with the lack of a US military response during the night-time attack, saying a second assault could have been deterred.The Pentagon has said nothing could have been done to assist the Americans in Benghazi.Meanwhile, UN Ambassador Susan Rice has been heavily criticised for inaccurate comments about the attack in the days immediately afterwards.She said on a Sunday chat show on 16 September that the attack had grown out of an anti-US protest, while other officials have said they knew at the time it was an organised, armed assault, possibly by an Islamist militant group.""My jaw dropped and I was embarrassed,"" Mr Hicks said on his reaction to her interview.Ambassador Stevens died of smoke inhalation when he was trapped in the burning consulate building, after armed men stormed the compound.

That is good, because it will rage for a long while.  I suspect many in his administration are not quite so pleased about this public airing of secrets, but there is nothing now that can put the genie back in the bottle. It is not only the raw debate that will grow. So will the argument about whether the people behind the leaks are heroes or villains.It strikes me that the revelations made by ex-CIA employee Edward Snowden are of a piece with those of US soldier Bradley Manning when he gave a vast stash of US documents to the website Wikileaks.Neither are leaks in the old sense - of a single, sensational story about a particularly scandalous operation. Instead they are, at heart, about the breadth and depth of intelligence gathering and how the internet changes spying itself. It is also about two young men who were horrified by what they saw going on and decided to expose it - in the words of my colleague, Paul Adams, ""the rise of the idealistic nerd"".It is probable that as the technology changed, intelligence services had to hugely increase the number of fairly low-level experts they employ. Possibly, their background checks were less rigorous than in the past. Maybe the type of person recruited was more committed to a technology that has gone hand in hand with a vaguely libertarian ethos than a commitment to national security, whatever the implications for privacy and freedom.  It is not certain how this will play for Mr Obama, but it does not look great.It is true that it runs against the right's narrative: ""Obama is weak on national security.""Once again, as with drones, he has shown himself to be rather ruthless with the niceties.On the other hand, it plays right in to the hands of another conservative narrative: ""President Obama expands the power of the state.""Given that it comes on top of the tax scandal at the Internal Revenue Service, and the raid on the Associated Press, it builds up a picture of an administration that plays fast and lose with civil liberties.This resonates with the president's own natural supporters as well, and those on the left who feel ""he is just as bad as former President George W Bush"".

As well as the Secret Service men, who were in Colombia as part of an advance team preparing for Mr Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas, 12 members of the US military are also under investigation.The White House has probed the actions of its own team in Cartagena and concluded that its own staff were not involved in the night of debauchery.Twenty women believed to be prostitutes were discovered with American agents or troops at the beachfront Hotel Caribe after one of the men allegedly refused to pay a previously agreed price for sex, sparking a row.On Tuesday, US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said that three US marines and a state department employee had also been punished after an incident involving a Brazilian prostitute in Brazil.""Those who have been involved are no longer in this country and were severely punished,"" Mr Panetta said while on a visit to Brasilia.The woman alleged that in December she broke her collar bone after being pushed from a car by the group of Americans with whom she had left a Brasilia nightclub after a dispute over payment.

Despite this, some sex workers are having unprotected sex - and taking antiretroviral drugs afterwards to cut the infection risk. How reckless is this?""Let me tell you the truth about why many of us don't use condoms,"" says Sheila who has been a prostitute in Nairobi's Korogocho slum for six years. ""We don't have money, and when you meet a client who offers to give you more money than you usually get, you have sex without protection even when you don't know his HIV status.""Sheila says she and other prostitutes can go to a clinic the next morning to get emergency antiretrovirals - drugs which suppress the virus, if taken within 72 hours of infection, and in many cases stop its progression.""We use this medicine like condoms,"" she says. The type of antiretroviral in question is known as post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP.It is intended to be used in emergencies. For example, it is given to victims of rape if their attacker is thought to be HIV-positive, or to medics who have been pricked by a potentially infected needle.There are no definitive figures to show how well PEP works. It's far better, experts say, to prevent exposure to the virus in the first place, by using condoms.Some clinics will only give clients one course of PEP a year. They worry that if they hand the drugs out too freely, prostitutes will stop using condoms altogether. This hasn't stopped 24-year-old sex worker Pamela using PEP four times in the past year. ""I had unprotected sex when I was very drunk one night and the following morning I didn't go to the same clinic where I got the first PEP tablets... I went to a different clinic where they don't have my records, and lied that I was forced into unprotected sex,"" she says.She didn't finish the full course because of the side-effects. ""You feel bad, like vomiting, dizziness, and generally you just feel sick,"" she says. ""So I stopped taking them.""Peter Godfrey-Faussett, senior science adviser with UNAIDS, says there is a place for antiretrovirals among sex workers, but only when used in the right way. ""We know that despite fairly high rates of condom use in many sex-work communities, we still have very high rates of HIV so we need additional tools as well as what's already happening,"" he says.However, emergency use of PEP is not the best way to go about it, he says. Instead it would be better for prostitutes to take a type of antiretroviral designed to be taken before exposure to HIV - known as Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).These are taken daily, and contain fewer drugs than PEP, so there are fewer side effects. But Godfrey-Faussett stresses that they must be used as part of a wider package, including regular HIV testing to make sure that the patient is on the correct medication.There are plans to run a pilot programme with sex workers in Kenya to see if it could be practical for them to use PrEP as an extra layer of defence.The drugs are not cheap, though.In the US, PrEP costs around $14,000 (£8,700) a year at the full price, although people on low incomes can get it much cheaper, or even free. In developing countries, where generic copies of the drugs are used, the cost may be about $150 (£93) a year.Godfrey-Faussett stresses that the cheapest line of defence is, in this case, the strongest.""Condoms are the single most effective way of preventing HIV, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy,"" he says. ""PrEP is not a silver bullet that will suddenly take away all those other issues.""Additional reporting by Alison Gee in London.

""I'm not going to sit here and go on and on and on.""Earlier in the heated council meeting, Mr Ford ran through the gallery, accidentally knocking over city councillor Pam McConnell before catching her.Ms McConnell was later seen holding ice to her lip.Monday's motion reduces Mr Ford's office budget by 60%, and allows mayoral staff to join deputy mayor Norm Kelly, largely making Mr Ford mayor in name only.The council does not have the power to remove Mr Ford from office unless he has a criminal conviction.Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, once a Ford ally but now one of his most outspoken critics, said the mayor's conduct was embarrassing the city.""He's the worst spokesman for the city of Toronto right now,"" he said.The Toronto council began stripping away his powers on Friday, voting 39 to 3 to prevent him from being able to dismiss the deputy mayor and taking away his emergency powers.Despite the scandal, Mr Ford does not seem inclined to shun the spotlight. He gave interviews to US media organisations at the weekend and appeared at a Toronto Argonauts game, despite the Canadian Football League commissioner suggesting he not.Mr Ford and his brother Doug Ford, a city councillor, launched their own current events television programme on Monday evening.The show, Ford Nation, is named after the bloc of conservative, suburban voters who put Mr Ford in office in 2010.The mayor told viewers they would see a change in him over the next few months, saying that he had not touched alcohol in a number of weeks.""I'll take a urine sample right now,'' he said on the pre-recorded show.On Sunday, Mr Ford told US broadcaster Fox News he had ""admitted to drinking too much"", but said he was dealing with it, including going to the gym two hours every day.""I'm seeking professional help, I'm not an alcoholic, I'm not a drug addict,"" he said. ""Have I had my outbursts in the past? Absolutely.""But you know what, I'm only human. I've made mistakes. I've apologised.""He added: ""Yes, one day I do want to run for prime minister.""The Toronto mayor apologised again on Thursday for making an obscene outburst on live television while denying he had offered oral sex to a female staff member.He had been responding to allegations in court papers that he had also driven drunk, used racially abusive language, threatened staff and consorted with an alleged prostitute."

The measure is backed by the government of President Jose Mujica, who says it will remove profits from drug dealers and divert users from harder drugs.Under the bill, only the government would be allowed to sell marijuana.The state would assume ""the control and regulation of the importation, exportation, plantation, cultivation, the harvest, the production, the acquisition, the storage, the commercialisation and the distribution of cannabis and its by-products"".Buyers would have to be registered on a database and be over the age of 18. They would be able to buy up to 40g (1.4oz) per month in specially licensed pharmacies or grow up to six plants at home. Foreigners would be excluded from the measure. The bill was approved by 50 of the 96 MPs present in the lower house following a fierce 13-hour debate in the capital, Montevideo.The supporters of the measure argued that the fight against drugs and drug trafficking had failed, and the country needed ""new alternatives"". ""The regulation is not to promote consumption; consumption already exists,"" said Sebastian Sabini of the governing centre-left Frente Amplio (Broad Front) coalition, which has a majority of one in the lower house.Marijuana use has reportedly doubled in Uruguay over the past year. An estimated 22 tonnes of marijuana are being sold in the country annually, according to Uruguay's National Drugs Committee.But Gerardo Amarilla of the opposition National Party said the government was ""playing with fire"" given the health risks he said were linked to marijuana use. All eyes were on Dario Perez, a member of the governing coalition but a strong opponent of the bill, whose vote could have scuppered the bill.During his 20-minute speech, Mr Perez reiterated his belief that the issue should be put to a referendum and not have been ""imposed"" by the government. But to applause by supporters of the bill in the public gallery, he finally concluded that as long as he was a member of the coalition, he would vote with it, despite his personal misgivings.The bill is now expected to be approved by the Senate, where the left-wing government has a bigger majority. But opposition politicians said that even if the law made it through the senate, they would launch a petition to have it overturned. A survey carried out before the vote by polling organisation Cifra suggested 63% of Uruguayans opposed the bill. The progress of the bill is being watched closely across the region, says BBC Mundo correspondent in the region Ignacio de los Reyes.For decades, drug trafficking has caused tens of thousands of deaths throughout Latin America.Uruguay may have not experienced the bloodshed caused by drug trafficking, but the proposal could be seen as a test for violence-torn nations looking for an end to their drug wars, our correspondent adds. The vote also comes just days after Pope Francis criticised drug legalisation plans during a visit to neighbouring Brazil.The pontiff said it was ""necessary to tackle the problems which are at the root of drug abuse, promoting more justice, educating the youth with the values that live in society, standing by those who face hardship and giving them hope for the future""."

A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are pleased to clarify to Kaleidescope and other drugs support services, that there are no plans to cut funding by up to 20% over four years. ""Although that was among a range of options considered, in recognition of the valuable service being provided, the Welsh government chose to increase the overall amount available under the Substance Misuse Action Fund. ""This mitigates the effects of the new distribution formula to ensure no area would receive a reduction of more than 5%, and partner agencies were informed of this in October 2012. ""There are no plans for further reductions in future years.""Kaleidoscope, which provides support to people with drug and alcohol problems, says the changes in the way money is allocated in Wales could lead to a hidden drug problem without the services to deal with it.  Chief executive Martin Blakebrough said: ""I would say to the Welsh government that they have to take rural communities seriously and the way that this funding formula has been devised is a damning indictment of a government who doesn't care about the heart of its country.""He said that rural services are more expensive to run but money is being taken from those areas and given to cities.Earlier, Melanie Perry, director of mid and west Wales alcohol and drugs advisory service Prism, said: ""I know locally the area planning board has sought to protect frontline services for this year, so where we have seen cuts they have been small, but we don't know how that's going to pan out for 2014 onwards.""People in rural areas do have drug and alcohol problems and we see that moving down the M4 corridor and where people have those problems, they need to seek specialist help and support to address those issues.""In an earlier statement, the Welsh government said while it understands that substance misuse is not confined to urban areas, the new funding formula is ""evidence based and takes rural areas into account through indicators on access to services locally"" among other factors.""North Wales, which is largely rural, received a substantial increase in its share of the formula; emphasising that rurality was not a major factor in changes to the formula,"" said a spokesperson.""In addition, the Welsh government has increased the overall amount allocated to area planning boards by £400,000 to ensure that no area planning board received more than a 5% cut to their allocation."""

Eamon Clarke, 24, with an address at Great Victoria Street, Belfast and Mark Kennedy, 33, Glennor Crescent East, Carryduff, face charges related to the possession and supply of cannabis.Restrictions on reporting the men's names were put into place last week. They were lifted on Monday after it was agreed those issuing the threat were already aware of the men's identity.Restrictions remain in place regarding the details of future court appearances.Lawyers representing the accused told the court how threats identifying their clients had been posted on a republican website. They also raised concerns that reporting the identity of the two men may pose an increased risk to their safety.The court also heard reports that armed and masked men had entered a bar in Belfast this month, read a statement naming people and warned them to leave the area. 'leave or be executed'A police officer investigating the dissident republican murder of Kevin Kearney earlier in October confirmed that a ""credible threat"" had been issued to Eamon Clarke.A police representative said: ""The threat states that he had 48 hours to leave or would be executed.""District Judge Fiona Bagnall acknowledged police evidence showing the seriousness of the threat. She rejected claims by defence lawyers that reporting of the men's names would increase any threat to the safety of the accused.""It's clear that those individuals who issued these threats do know the defendants, they have been named and, I presume, if interested can identify them, where they live and other aspects of their lives. ""My interpretation of the threat is they have already formed a view as to the activities, behaviour and responsibilities of the defendants long before there's been any court process,"" said judge Bagnall."
1537	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22894459	Opinion	1	Elections	Economy	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Many of the US ambassadors to swanky European capitals are campaign donors. Are politically appointed diplomats a bad idea?Last week President Barack Obama recommended 10 new individuals for ambassadorships. Two of them had raised money for his presidential campaign - Denise Bauer for Belgium and James ""Wally"" Brewster for the Dominican Republic.They are ""bag men"", people who give money to political campaigns - a group that is increasingly female, despite its name. They are like dozens of other ambassadors who are chosen by the White House for the postings - though they have no background in foreign service. Rather than serving in the diplomatic corps, political appointees have instead worked as business executives, lawyers, consultants and in other professions. As non-career diplomats, they can be appointed ""without competition"", according to the Office of Personnel Management.Giving money - and later becoming ambassador - is a long-standing tradition in the US diplomatic world. In the early 1970s, President Richard Nixon was blunt about the arrangements he had in place when talking with an aide about a diplomatic posting to Belgium.""Anybody who wants to be an ambassador must at least give $250,000,"" Nixon said. ""I'm not going to do it for political friends and all that crap.""Political appointees are not necessarily wealthy.  At times, presidents nominate individuals who have personal ties. ""There was an ambassador in the Bush administration who used to bicycle with the president,"" says Robert Rizzi, a Washington lawyer who helps clients through the official vetting process for political appointees.Once the president has selected a candidate for an ambassadorship, the individual appears before the Senate foreign relations committee for a confirmation hearing. The proportion of political appointees among ambassadors has remained the same - roughly one-third - since the 1950s. The political appointees are part of the ""spoils system"", says Susan Johnson, president of the American Foreign Service Association. ""It undermines the whole concept of meritocratic professional diplomatic service,"" she says. Many people have found fault with the system over the years.Shortly after being elected president, Obama vowed to ""reform the political appointee process"". A statement on his website reported that ""in the Obama-Biden administration, every official will have to rise to the standard of proven excellence"".Yet instead of declining under Obama, the percentage of political appointees has remained the same.Today about 29% of ambassadorships are held by political appointees, according to the American Foreign Service Association.The UK, Canada and other countries have political appointees - but not as many. Jim LeBlanc, a consultant who used to work for a Canadian ambassador, says: ""It doesn't go as deep.""Bruce Oreck is a lawyer who helped raise $575,000 (£377,000) for Obama's presidential campaign. He got a call from the White House after the election.""They said, 'Would you be willing to serve and, if so, where would you have an interest in serving?'"" Oreck recalls.Oreck, whose father is the founder of Oreck, a company that has sold millions of vacuum cleaners, is now the ambassador in Helsinki. He had never seen the city before his posting.""People who are successful are disciplined,"" Oreck says. ""You want people who've had that kind of success because they're going to be good advocates for America.""Some political appointees do well. Citigroup's Louis Susman raised money for Obama and then went to London as ambassador. Shortly before he left in April, Susman had an audience with the Queen, ""a privilege rarely afforded to departing ambassadors"", reports the Telegraph.The ambassador in Paris, Charles Rivkin, helped raise $800,000 (£524,000). ""Neither the ambassador nor the embassy in Paris have any comment on this topic,"" says embassy spokesman Mitchell Moss.The ambassador in Lisbon, Allan Katz, raised $500,000 (£328,000).Embassy spokeswoman Virginia Staab says: ""In the US Foreign Service, we aim to strike the perfect balance between career and political appointees since each can provide strengths and opportunities to further US foreign policy."" Career diplomats such as Thomas Boyatt, who served as ambassador to Colombia after working for years in the foreign service, resent the way that wealthy individuals end up in cushy posts. ""The media used to call us 'the striped-pant boys',"" says Boyatt. ""I used to say, 'The only stripes I ever had on my pants were from my own blood.' That shut them up.""Whether political appointees or career diplomats, they should accept posts that are located in the developing world - rather than accepting ambassadorships only to European or wealthy nations, says Boyatt.The Obama administration has had an unusual number of high-level disasters among its political appointees, many from postings in Western nations. Cynthia Stroum, a political appointee who served as the ambassador to Luxembourg, was ""hostile and intimidating"", according to a 2011 governmental report about that embassy. ""I'm baffled that I was forced to resign over such petty and unsubstantiated allegations,"" Stroum says.Regarding the selection of ambassadors, Stroum says: ""I have no way of knowing how they made or continue to make their choices or what criteria they use.""Not all political appointees are fundraisers. Some are public figures who are known on a national level or for their work in a local community. One appointee, Douglas Kmiec, a former Catholic University of America dean, resigned as head of the US mission in Malta in 2011. State department officials said he had been spending hours every day writing about Catholicism - and not enough hours, apparently, on his diplomatic work.Kmiec says he chose to resign ""when individuals within the department refused to follow the president's efforts to use faith-based diplomacy"".Another political appointee, Nicole Avant, the former ambassador to the Bahamas, lasted less than two years. The state department's office of inspections gave her a negative report. She says she ""had inherited a dysfunctional embassy. Under the direction of the new executive team that I appointed, the embassy began to recover.""Critics say they wish career diplomats were serving in more posts as ambassadors, since political appointees do not always fare well.""There have been some that have turned out to be real busts,"" says the American Foreign Service Association's Susan Johnson.

1665	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21229118	News	1	Gay Rights	Economy	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"MPs debate plans, opposed by many religious groups, for same-sex marriage next week. Ahead of that occasion, the government has published its assessment of the possible wider impacts. Here are eight ways it believes the bill might change things: Lavish spending often accompanies a wedding, and so a large increase in the number of marriages taking place each year would create a significant boost to certain parts of the economy. Beneficiaries might include ceremony venues, cake manufacturers, function band agencies, and hoteliers. The government estimates the total economic stimulus could be as much as £14.4m - but thinks it is more likely to be closer to £0. ""As the demand for same-sex marriage is uncertain, and because these economic benefits are not guaranteed to be additional (for example, the spending on a civil partnership or marriage ceremony may not be additional if the couple and guests cut back on spending in other areas), we use zero benefit as our best estimate,"" it explains. Also facing increased demand for its services is the Gender Recognition Panel, which furnishes transgender people with certificates documenting their gender transitions. At present, it is impossible for a member of a married couple to change gender and remain legally married. So the government is anticipating a ""noticeable increase"" in the panel's workload as ""those who may have changed gender some years ago but decided not to apply for legal recognition, since they wished to remain in their existing marriage"", adapt to the change in the law.During its consultation on same-sex marriages, the government received evidence from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which said lesbian, gay, and bisexual people (LGB) people experience more mental health problems and a greater likelihood of drug addiction than heterosexuals. Ministers believe that discrimination against LGB people partially accounts for this phenomenon. The removal of discrimination against same-sex couples in the current legal definition of marriage, the government argues, might therefore improve public health. A number of Whitehall departments will need to tweak their computer systems to enable them to administer services properly to same-sex married couples. The biggest impact will be felt at the Home Office, which oversees the registration of marriages, civil partnerships, births and deaths. The government estimates that necessary changes to its online registration system will cost £2m. Lower costs will fall on the Department for Work and Pensions, which will need to adapt its systems to cope with changes to pension entitlements, and the Ministry of Justice, which will need to alter the courts' ""FamilyMan"" IT system.If the government's plans become law, the UK will join a select group of 12 countries where same-sex marriage is legal. The Lesbian and Gay Lawyers Association told the government in its consultation to prepare for a ""modest boost"" in tourism as a consequence. ""We are aware that same-sex couples from the UK travel to places like Canada to get married because they prefer this to a civil partnership. We expect that if marriage is open to same-sex couples in England and Wales, couples especially from elsewhere in Europe will come here to get married here,"" it said. Those who will be conducting same-sex marriages will need to get to grips with the new system. The government assumes that they will need between two and seven hours' training each - ""time which could have been spent on other tasks"", it notes.  ""Currently, if a person discloses that they are in a civil partnership rather than a marriage, they automatically disclose their sexual orientation,"" the government says. People in same-sex marriages will have greater discretion over how, when, or whether to divulge this information. Recent research suggests that one in five LGB people think they have been harassed at work because of their sexual orientation, the government says. Same-sex marriages might encourage greater acceptance of same-sex couples in society, the government believes. This would be good for society as a whole, ministers have concluded, by helping to create ""a more inclusive society where there is more choice and acceptance"". "

President Obama is soon to make one of the big set piece speeches of the year - the State of the Union. The White House has already told us it is part of a twin pack with his controversial inauguration address. Now, they are telling major media outlets like ABC and the Washington Post that, on Tuesday night, the focus will be on the economy. It's not surprising. Two things were striking about Mr Obama's inauguration address. Firstly, that there was little attempt to play the part of a healing president, stretching out to soothe the fears of those who didn't vote for him. It was a forthright, even aggressive, promotion of a liberal agenda for his second term. He argued that progressive values are, fundamentally, the expression of America's deepest values and follow the arc of American history.  Republicans hated that. Secondly, that main concern of many Americans - the economy - was scarcely mentioned. The passion was reserved for the issues of gun control, climate change, gay rights and immigration. It is true he talked about ""new jobs"" twice, once in the context of green energy and once when talking about re-building America's infrastructure.  Republicans have made much play of this, suggesting he was ignoring the country's most fundamental problems. The White House may be acknowledging that the inauguration address was a little lopsided. Maybe Mr Obama simply wanted to say something different. He has, after all, spoken about his economic vision many times before. It was the centrepiece of the election and, indeed, of last year's State of the Union. Then, he talked about restoring ""an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules"".Now, the White House spin doctors want to condition journalists to look out for the economic content of the next speech, rather than the social issues that may dominate business in Congress. The last thing they want is for Americans to think he is merely pleasing his base, concentrating on what some see as side issues rather than the fundamentals.  But, if there is a different accent on content, I very much doubt there will be any change to the approach. I expect to see another iteration of the newly confrontational president, determined to use his bully pulpit to demand change and give notice to his enemies that they had better get out of his way.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell called the talks ""unproductive"".""All we're asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare,'' Mr Boehner told reporters.House Minority Leader, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who also attended the meeting, accused the Republicans of ""moving the goalposts"" on the budget deal.Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said his party were ""locked in tight on Obamacare'' and neither the president nor Democrats in Congress would accept changes to the law as the price for a deal on reopening the government.The Republicans who control the House of Representatives have demanded concessions from Mr Obama and his fellow Democrats in return for funding the government's continued operation and for raising the debt ceiling.Chiefly, the Republicans demand the repeal, delay or defunding of a healthcare reform law - dubbed Obamacare - passed by the Democrats in 2010.Major portions of that law, which was subsequently validated by the US Supreme Court and was a major issue in the 2012 presidential election, took effect on Tuesday.Analysts say Mr Boehner could end the current government showdown by allowing the House to vote on a ""clean"" budget bill that does not alter the health law, because that could pass with a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans.But doing so would risk his standing with the most conservative elements of his caucus.Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Obama met the heads of some of Wall Street's biggest banks - including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America - to discuss the debt ceiling and other economic issues.The bankers are members of the Financial Services Forum, a lobby group which has, along with 250 other businesses, sent a letter to Congress urging it to raise the debt limit by 17 October.Following the meeting, Mr Obama told CNBC ""it's important for them to recognise that this is going to have a profound impact on our economy and their bottom lines"".He said he was ""exasperated"" by events ""because this is entirely unnecessary"".But he said bowing to the demands of any one faction set a dangerous precedent.""If we get in the habit where a few folks, an extremist wing of one party... are allowed to extort concessions based on a threat of undermining the full faith and credit of the United States, then any president that comes after me... will find themselves unable to govern effectively,"" he said. ""And that is not something that I'm going to allow to happen."""

On 1 October, online health insurance marketplaces run by the US federal government or by the states will begin accepting customers.Opposition to the law, which is known to both sides of the debate as Obamacare, has become one of the central tenets of Republican and conservative politics, analysts say.The House of Representatives, which is controlled by the Republican Party, has held dozens of votes on bills to repeal the law or strip it of funding. The bills have gone nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate.The law has become a central point in the ongoing budget battle, with some Republicans pushing to shut down the operation of the US government by not passing a new budget if the Democrats refuse to defund the law.On Friday, the House passed a bill that would prevent a government shutdown - but would strip the healthcare law of its funding. And on Tuesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas undertook a marathon speech on the floor of the Senate to denounce the law and demand the government block its implementation.""Those who have opposed the idea of universal healthcare in the first place and have fought this thing tooth and nail through Congress and through the courts and so forth have been trying to scare and discourage people from getting a good deal,"" Mr Obama said.On Monday, Mr Clinton asked Mr Obama why he had decided to tackle healthcare reform early in his first term, even as the economy was mired in one of the worst downturns since the Great Depression.Mr Obama said healthcare was a ""massive"" part of the American economy, and noted the US was the only advanced industrialised nation that permitted ""large numbers of its people to languish without health insurance"".The current US leader also accused congressional Republicans of using the ""pretty straightforward"" issue as political capital as the government hurdles toward a shutdown on 1 October, when the law funding its operation expires."
1729	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20969944	News	1	Healthcare	Economy	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Most of us will need care and support in our old age. In fact, the evidence suggests about three-quarters of us will. For some it will be no more than a little help in the home with activities such as washing and dressing. For others it will involve round-the-clock support in a care home.But how much is that worth?Unlike NHS care, such help is not free.At the moment anyone with assets of more than £23,250 faces unlimited costs.For one in 10 that can be more than £100,000 over a lifetime.The system means thousands of people are forced to sell their homes or use up their life savings to pay for help.But this could be about to change.It seems likely the government will announce in the coming weeks its intention to cap costs at £75,000.The amount is more than double the £35,000 sum recommended by an independent Dilnot Commission which looked at the issue two years ago.And that makes the move a gamble.The £35,000 cap was based on careful consideration and calculation. Chaired by a leading economist, the commission felt the figure would be both high enough so it was affordable to government, while being low enough to entice the public to start planning for old age.At £35,000 ministers would need to find about £2bn a year - the sum they currently spend on the winter fuel allowance.But after months of debate the government has decided that is too big a price to pay. Hence, the higher cap, which was briefed to journalists as part of the release of the coalition's mid-term review earlier this week and is likely to be fleshed out in more detail within the next month.However, the problem with increasing the cap is that the carefully constructed Dilnot plan could start to fall apart.While the £35,000 figure is a lot for many people, it is considered by most experts to be within a margin that would encourage many people to start planning for old age.That is important. If people start getting engaged with the issue, the insurance industry will begin to come up with policies, safe in the knowledge that the catastrophic costs will be covered by the state.But by increasing the cap to £75,000 there is a risk the public is turned off.So far all those involved in the social care sector have kept their counsel.That is partly an acknowledgement by many of them that the government deserves credit and partly a tactical calculation.Councils, campaigners and charities have been promised reform for the best part of 20 years and so there is a genuine appreciation that this government is doing something at a time when money is so tight.But there is also a belief that establishing a cap - even at a higher rate - is an important stepping stone.As one person involved in lobbying the government told me: ""This will create a new contract between the state and individual over social care.... when it happens we can then start pushing government to make it more generous.""An announcement on the cap, it is fair to say, will not signal the end of the debate."

""Millions more live with the fear that they'll go broke if they get sick. And today, we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear.""While Mr Obama and his supporters in the Democratic Party portray the law as a historic effort to extend healthcare coverage to the millions of Americans who lack it, the law's opponents say it amounts to an unprecedented intrusion into Americans' private lives.The online health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, struggled to meet higher than expected demand on Tuesday, with many users reporting long waiting times.Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters told the Associated Press news agency the agency was ""prepared to make adjustments as needed [to] improve the consumer experience"".Users also reported errors while trying to create accounts and site crashes on the websites.""The first day of something that you know is going to have a lot of bugs, it's not that frustrating,"" Mike Weaver, a self-employed photographer without insurance told the Associated Press. ""If it was the last day to sign up... then I'd be terribly frustrated.""Mr Obama acknowledged the glitches and delays.""We found out that there have been times this morning where the site has been running more slowly than it normally will,"" Mr Obama said. ""The reason is because more than one million people visited healthcare.gov before 7:00 in the morning.""The exchanges will continue to enrol people through the end of the year for healthcare plans slated to begin next year.The opening of the exchanges was the culmination of more than three years of political combat in Washington over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Mr Obama in 2010 and known to both sides as Obamacare.Republicans in Washington and in state capitals across the country have fought hard to undermine or undo the law since its passage, with the US House of Representatives taking dozens of symbolic votes to repeal it or eliminate its funding.A legal challenge led by the law's Republican opponents ended in June 2012 when the Supreme Court validated the law's keystone provision - a requirement that Americans not receiving health coverage from their employers or the government purchase individual plans or pay a fine.That requirement, known as the individual mandate, takes effect in January.The healthcare law was also a central issue in the 2012 presidential election. Republican candidate Mitt Romney vowed to press for its repeal. Mr Obama handily won re-election. On Tuesday, the US government shut non-essential services, keeping more than 700,000 workers at home, when the Democrats who control the Senate refused to agree to Republican demands to repeal the health law or delay the individual mandate.Both Mr Obama and congressional Democrats have said they will not negotiate on Obamacare, with Mr Obama on Monday evening accusing the Republicans of attempting to refight the last election.In spite of the political turmoil in Washington, on Tuesday Americans were able to enrol in insurance plans offered by private companies and ranging in price and level of coverage through exchanges in every state.Sixteen states and Washington DC have opted to operate their own exchanges, while the exchanges in 34 states will be fully or partially run by the federal government.Exchanges will also inform customers of tax subsidies available to ease the cost of the insurance. An estimated six million US citizens are expected to qualify.Customers enrolling under Obamacare will not be covered by the insurance until 1 January however.That corresponds with the start of the individual mandate, as well as consumer protections including a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions.Several Obamacare provisions had taken effect prior to Tuesday, including prescription drug discounts for pensioners, a rule allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance plans up to age 26, a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to children with pre-existing health conditions, and a ban on lifetime limits on health coverage.Another major provision known as the employer mandate - which requires employers with at least 50 full-time workers to provide insurance or incur a $2,000 (£1,320) per employee penalty - has been delayed until 2015. That delay, announced by the Obama administration in July, has been seen as a concession to retailers and other businesses - and an acknowledgement that the health law was not fully ready for implementation."

""They're not focused on you.""The government faces a potential shutdown on 1 October if Congress and the White House do not agree on a temporary budget measure.A temporary bill is needed because Washington's longstanding budget stalemate has derailed the annual bills that would set the country's budget.A government shutdown would delay pay for federal workers, including some military members, send non-essential employees home, close national parks and shut passport offices. But programmes like air traffic control, food inspection and the US border agency would keep running.The Republican-sponsored stopgap bill proposes funding federal agencies at an annualised rate of more than $986bn (£615bn), but includes a provision that strips federal funding for the Affordable Care Act.Also known as Obamacare, the 2010 law requires businesses with more than 50 workers to provide health insurance to all their full-time staff, or pay a series of increasingly severe penalties.House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has called for an end to the law because it ""is turning our full-time economy into a part-time economy"".On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Republicans were ""simply postponing for a few days the inevitable choice"" between passing a bill without the provision or forcing a government shutdown. ""The Affordable Care Act has been the law of the land for three years,"" he said in a statement. ""The Senate will not pass any bill that defunds or delays Obamacare.""The US also faces a deadline to raise the debt ceiling, which authorises the US treasury to borrow up to a set limit.In Missouri on Friday, Mr Obama said that if Congress fails to raise that level, ""the United States will default on its obligations"". ""Basically, America becomes a deadbeat.""Mr Obama has said he will not be forced into making concessions as he did during the 2011 debt crisis, where he accepted a $2.1 trillion spending cut over a decade.

""I'm the first to say that the first month I've not been happy with,"" he said of the website, which launched on 1 October.""Nothing drives me more crazy than the fact that right now, there's great insurance to be had out there, choice and competition, where people can save money for a better product, except too many folks haven't been able to get through the website.""Healthcare.gov - akin to a shopping website for health insurance plans - has been plagued with problems, especially long wait times to sign up for an insurance plan and serious flaws on the back end where customers' data are processed and sent to insurance companies.""This is like having a really good product in a store, and the cash registers don't work and there aren't enough parking spots and nobody can get through the door,"" he said. ""And so we are working overtime to get this fixed.""By the end of November, he said, ""you're going to have families all across this great state of Texas who are going to have the security and the well-being of high-quality, affordable health insurance.""Mr Perry, a hard-line conservative who ran for the Republican Party presidential nomination in 2012, called Mr Obama's trip to Texas ""a desperate attempt to salvage his ill-conceived and unpopular programme"".The governor added that his state needed ""flexibility"" to implement specific reforms rather than a ""one-size-fits-all Washington mandate"".Mr Perry, like many other Republican governors, declined the option under the law of setting up a state insurance website, forcing Texas residents to rely on the federal healthcare.gov site. The 1 October launch of the insurance marketplace websites run by the federal and state governments was the culmination of more than three years of political combat in Washington over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Mr Obama in 2010 and known to both sides as Obamacare.Aside from establishing the healthcare.gov medical insurance marketplace website and others run by the states, the law bolsters coverage requirements for insurance firms, mandates that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and offers subsidies to assist in the purchase of the insurance. It also expands eligibility for the Medicaid government health programme for the poor. However, Texas - like many other states governed by Republicans - has refused to expand its Medicaid programme, rejecting federal funds provided under the law to do so.Ongoing issues with the website have shaken political confidence in the endeavour.Earlier on Wednesday, Senate finance committee chairman Max Baucus, a Democrat, suggested the Obama administration take down the healthcare.gov marketplace until the kinks had been smoothed out.Mr Baucus, a supporter of the health law, suggested that would limit the negative press coverage.But Mr Obama's Health Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, told the panel such an action ""wouldn't delay people's cancer or diabetes or Parkinson's"".Ms Sebelius did acknowledge that the site required hundreds of repairs and that further work was needed before it was fully operational. ""We're not there yet,"" she said.Even as the technical problems have limited Americans' ability to sign up for new health coverage under the law, many other people have been informed that insurance plans they already held were being cancelled because they did not meet the new law's stringent requirements.Mr Obama had long insisted that people would be able to keep insurance plans they liked. Republicans have seized on that, with some going as far as to accuse Mr Obama of lying to the public during his campaign for the law's passage.""President Obama deceived the American people by promising that anyone who liked their health care plan could keep it, but millions of Americans are now discovering that simply isn't true,"" Mr Perry said in a statement.The Obama administration has declined to say how many Americans have actually enrolled in new policies through the websites, rankling Republicans who accuse it of withholding vital information.Republicans view the health law as a costly and inappropriate government intrusion into the healthcare system, and have sought to undo or undermine it at every turn.And they argue the website's problems ongoing reflect broader issues with the healthcare law."

1858	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24963378	Opinion	0	Healthcare	Economy	Negative	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"It has been a pretty dreadful week for President Barack Obama. Flapping around his head are a whole flock of chickens coming home to roost. This is all about his greatest achievement - the law for which he will be remembered - the programme nicknamed for him, Obamacare.It is in trouble. He is in trouble.  The sign-up for Obamacare was pitiful. He was forced into holding a news conference of abject apology while Democrats, most notably Bill Clinton, ran as fast as they could away from the president whose poll ratings had just plunged to a new low.It was capped by a savaging from Jon Stewart. Can it get worse than that?I'm reminded of the doyen of spin doctors, Alistair Campbell, when journalists wrote that some speech or other of Tony Blair's was ""the most important of his career"". He laconically agreed it probably was, since the last most important speech of his career. And until the next one. The same is true of Mr Obama's worst week. That news conference was the full-blown humble-pie-eating act. Here's a selection of quotes:""I understand why folks are frustrated.""""I do make apologies for not having executed better over the last several months.""""We and I did not have enough awareness about the problems in the website.""""That's on me.""""That's something I deeply regret.""""I feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them rather than easier.""""When we don't do a good job on the rollout, we're letting them down. And, you know, I don't - I don't like doing that.""""I said early on when I was running, I am not a perfect man and I will not be a perfect president.""""There have been times where I thought we were - got, you know, slapped around a little bit unjustly. This one's deserved, all right? It's on us.""I haven't seen the president squirm like this since his shell-shocked performance after his shellacking in the 2010 mid-terms. Then he wondered aloud how he'd lost the plot and how he could do better. Then his acute distress must have reflected his understanding of just how bad his plight was. When he lost the House, he lost all hope of pushing through the rest of an ambitious progressive agenda. Now his one historic achievement, the one big law he got through before he lost the House, is in grave danger. With it his whole reputation, his legacy. A colleague pointed out that only last week, we - and the rest of the media - were highlighting the hole the Republicans were in. It is true. They are in a mess, and so is Mr Obama. Their problem is about how to win elections, his is about the limits on what you can do after you've won. At the heart of his problem is a plan that is inherently complex and confusing. He decided at the beginning of his presidency that he would never sell a simple government-run scheme.   It would have been even more controversial than Obamacare, it probably wouldn't have got through Congress, but if it had it would have had the huge advantage of simplicity and clarity. Instead the federal government parts of the plan got whittled away. But then when Republican states refused to set up their own programmes, the federal government came back in. Mr Obama is in a hole now because of the technical failure of an already ideological, controversial plan which bewilders most people with its inherent complexity. He has promised that he will ""chip away"" at the problem, and that everything will be much better by the beginning of next month. Democrats will hope these teething problems will fade and be forgotten. But it may not be a ""chipable"" problem. Mr Obama will be under intense scrutiny as we head into the new year and the mid-term elections. If his worst week turns into his worst month, it will be a pretty dismal 2014 for the president. "
1872	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24330034	News	1	Healthcare	Economy	SomewhatPositive	SomewhatNegative	bbc.co.uk	"The US Senate has rejected a budget bill passed by the Republican-led House of Representatives, with just hours left to avert a government shutdown.The Democratic-led Senate voted 54-46 against the bill, which would fund the government only if President Obama's healthcare law were delayed a year.If no agreement is reached by midnight (04:00 GMT), the government will close all non-essential federal services.The shutdown would be the first in the US in 17 years.More than 700,000 federal government workers could be sent home on unpaid leave, with no guarantee of back pay once the deadlock is over. One of the key points of contention in the political stalemate has been President Barack Obama's healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare.Republicans in the House of Representatives - and their allies in the Senate - have demanded the law be repealed or stripped of funding as a condition for continuing to fund the government.Major portions of the law, which passed in 2010 and has been validated by the US Supreme Court, are due to take effect on Tuesday.After the Senate vote on Monday afternoon, the chamber's Democratic majority leader blamed Republicans for the imminent halt to all non-essential government operations.""It will be a Republican government shutdown, pure and simple,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, referring to the Republicans as ""bullies"".""We are not going to negotiate on this. We have done everything we can to be fair and reasonable.""Following Mr Reid's pledge, Republican House Speaker John Boehner told reporters the House would not pass a budget bill that did not include concessions from the Democrats regarding Mr Obama's healthcare law.In addition to the threat of a shutdown, a second fiscal deadline is approaching in the coming weeks. About 17 October, the US government will reach the limit at which it can borrow money to pay its bills, the so-called debt ceiling.House Republicans have demanded a series of policy concessions - notably on the president's health law and on financial and environmental regulations - in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.Although there were no reports that negotiations over either the budget or the debt ceiling were underway on Monday, Mr Obama said he was ""not at all resigned"" to a government shutdown.But he warned there could not be ""any kind of meaningful negotiations under the cloud of potential default"" on the government's debt.""Our currency is the reserve currency of the world,"" Mr Obama said after an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.""We don't mess with that. And we certainly don't allow domestic policy differences on issues that are unrelated to the budget to endanger not only our economy but the world economy."" The bill the Senate rejected on Monday was passed the day before by the House of Representatives. That bill would have delayed the implementation of the healthcare law and repealed a $29bn (£17.9bn) medical device tax. Mr Obama and his fellow Democrats in the US Senate have vowed to reject any House bill that touches the health law.Some Democrats, including Mr Reid and Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have called on Mr Boehner to put the Senate bill up for a vote in the House.They say a budget bill unencumbered with a delay of the health law could pass the House with Democrats joining a small number of Republicans. If the government does shut down on 1 October, national parks and Washington's Smithsonian museums would close, pension and veterans' benefit cheques would be delayed, and visa and passport applications would go unprocessed.Programmes deemed essential, such as air traffic control and food inspections, would continue.The defence department has advised employees that uniformed members of the military will continue on normal duty, but that large numbers of civilian workers will be told to stay home.As lawmakers grapple with the impending shutdown, the 17 October deadline for extending the government's borrowing limit looms even larger.Earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said that unless the US were allowed to extend its borrowing limit, the country would be left with about $30bn (£18.5bn) to meet its commitments, which on certain days can be as high as $60bn.A failure to raise the limit could also result in the US government defaulting on its debt payments. Washington faced a similar impasse over its debt ceiling in 2011. Republicans and the Democrats only reached a compromise on the day the government's ability to borrow money was due to run out.That fight was resolved just hours before the country could have defaulted on its debt, but nevertheless it led to ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgrading the US for the first time ever.The 2011 compromise included a series of automatic budget cuts known as the ""sequester"", which came into effect earlier this year. The US government has not undergone a shutdown since 1995-96, when services were suspended for a record 21 days. Republicans demanded then-President Bill Clinton agree to their version of a balanced budget. After weeks of negotiation, they reached a compromise similar to what they discussed prior to the shutdown."

On 1 October, online health insurance marketplaces run by the US federal government or by the states will begin accepting customers.Opposition to the law, which is known to both sides of the debate as Obamacare, has become one of the central tenets of Republican and conservative politics, analysts say.The House of Representatives, which is controlled by the Republican Party, has held dozens of votes on bills to repeal the law or strip it of funding. The bills have gone nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate.The law has become a central point in the ongoing budget battle, with some Republicans pushing to shut down the operation of the US government by not passing a new budget if the Democrats refuse to defund the law.On Friday, the House passed a bill that would prevent a government shutdown - but would strip the healthcare law of its funding. And on Tuesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas undertook a marathon speech on the floor of the Senate to denounce the law and demand the government block its implementation.""Those who have opposed the idea of universal healthcare in the first place and have fought this thing tooth and nail through Congress and through the courts and so forth have been trying to scare and discourage people from getting a good deal,"" Mr Obama said.On Monday, Mr Clinton asked Mr Obama why he had decided to tackle healthcare reform early in his first term, even as the economy was mired in one of the worst downturns since the Great Depression.Mr Obama said healthcare was a ""massive"" part of the American economy, and noted the US was the only advanced industrialised nation that permitted ""large numbers of its people to languish without health insurance"".The current US leader also accused congressional Republicans of using the ""pretty straightforward"" issue as political capital as the government hurdles toward a shutdown on 1 October, when the law funding its operation expires."

Ms Rolnik says her recommendation is for the policy to be suspended.She rejected most of the criticisms made by Mr Shapps, although she did apologise for referring to the policy as the bedroom tax, telling the BBC she had done so because that was ""what everyone has been calling it since I got here"".Under the government's benefit changes social tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced since April.Ministers say private sector renters do not get spare rooms free, and argue the change will save around £500m a year and free up much needed larger properties.Ms Rolnik told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she had received ""hundreds of testimonies"" and said there was a ""danger of a retrogression in the right to adequate housing"" in the UK.She cited examples of disabled people, or grandmothers who were carers, and said the measure seemed to have been designed ""without the human component in mind"".She said her recommendation was ""that it should be suspended"" to allow time to better assess the human rights implications, and so it could be redesigned.Ms Rolnik, who is producing a report on adequate housing around the world for the UN human rights council, says she was in the UK for two weeks at the government's invitation.Her visit included trips to London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Manchester.Mr Shapps, responding to her comments on Today, said that she had not been invited by ministers and ""she has clearly come with an agenda"".""It is completely wrong and an abuse of the process for somebody to come over, to fail to meet with government ministers, to fail to meet with the department responsible, to produce a press release two weeks after coming, even though the report is not due out until next spring, and even to fail to refer to the policy properly throughout the report.""That is why I am writing to the secretary general today to ask for an apology and an investigation as to how this came about.""He also said that she came from a country, Brazil, ""that has 50m people in inadequate housing"".In his letter to UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon, Mr Shapps urged the claims to be withdrawn and said: ""By referring to the policy as the 'bedroom tax' and posing for photos receiving 'dossiers' from those opposed to ending the Spare Room Subsidy, I believe that Ms Rolnik has shown political bias.""We would have hoped that Ms Rolnik would have taken the necessary steps to ensure that her report was based on all the information available to her from the Government before she declared her conclusions less than two weeks after her 'mission' began.""The Department for Work and Pensions later confirmed that Ms Rolnik, the UN special rapporteur on housing ""had one meeting with a senior official at the DWP"".On Tuesday there was a further meeting ""at which the findings were presented by the rapporteur"". A spokesman said that at the start Communities Secretary Eric Pickles ""popped in - it would be pushing it to call it a meeting"".Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said the policy should be dropped and said what was ""shocking"" was that the Conservatives were pushing ahead with ""hated"" changes which he said were primarily hitting disabled people.Labour has not committed to scrapping the policy if it wins the next election. Mr Byrne told the BBC that he had to demonstrate it would have the money to reverse the changes: ""I am working very hard... to show how and why this tax should be dropped.""Plaid Cymru welcomed the report, suggesting the benefit changes were one of the ""most toxic policies for decades"".""The UK is a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,"" said Hywel Williams MP""This means that Ms Rolnik's findings should carry weight within the British justice system and prompt the government to abandon this most inhumane of policies."""

Johann Lamont said the current council tax freeze was not working. It comes as an academic advising Labour on how to reduce public spending branded the council tax freeze a ""major problem"" for councils. Professor Arthur Midwinter said it was an ""inefficient use of public money"". The academic told the Scotland on Sunday newspaper by failing to ring-fence some anti-poverty funds, the Scottish government had allowed money to be swallowed up elsewhere as councils tried to patch over cuts.""The result is that about £1bn of targeted spend on poverty has disappeared,"" he warned.Some policies, such as the council tax freeze and fee-free prescriptions, benefited middle and upper income households, he argued.On the BBC's Sunday Politics, Ms Lamont said she would need to look at Prof Midwinter's report in detail. However, she called for a discussion on how to fund local authorities in Scotland, saying the council tax was ""discredited"".Ms Lamont said the freeze in the cost of the council tax, which has been in place since 2007 and looks set to continue until 2017, was underfunded by government and had hit local services.She said: ""I want a discussion not where the parties get dividing lines between each other but come together and address the challenge of how do you properly build a confidence in the way you raise taxes locally?""A spokesman for First Minister Alex Salmond said: ""This is a massive own goal by Johann Lamont.""Voters will be shocked by her announcement that Labour would scrap the council tax freeze.""A poll published on Sunday showed the SNP government's council tax freeze is backed by 82% of voters, with only 9% opposed.""75% of Labour's own voters back the freeze.""This proves how out of touch with ordinary people Ms Lamont is.""The SNP also accused Ms Lamont of trying to rewrite history by claiming she had not used the expression ""something for nothing"" in relation to people in Scotland benefiting from universal services.In a speech in September last year Ms Lamont questioned universal benefits which could see wealthy people receiving tuition fees and prescriptions for free.She told party members in Edinburgh it was time to end a ""something for nothing"" culture.She said that taxes would have to rise or services would be cut in order to maintain popular but expensive SNP pledges on areas such as the council-tax freeze and personal care for the elderly.On Sunday, Ms Lamont told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""It is a reflection of the cartoon politics that the SNP misrepresent and scaremonger about what Labour has said.""I have never said that some people get something for nothing.""What I have said is that you have to look at both what you spend money on and what are the consequences of that.""It is not acceptable to say we have free personal care when people are living with the experience of less than 15 minute visits."" SNP MSP Linda Fabiani said: ""She appeared to deny that she had ever used the expression 'something for nothing' - and the entire 'something for nothing' speech has been airbrushed from the Labour Party's website.""But Ms Lamont did say it. It was the central part of what was described as a major speech made in September last year. ""At the time it was suggested this could become a disastrous approach for her, as Labour adopted the Westminster agenda of cuts, cuts and more cuts - hitting the vulnerable and abandoning hard fought for universal benefits. ""So it is no surprise that Johann Lamont seems to want to forget and distance herself from that disastrous speech."""

A grant to help with funeral costs and a telephone allowance for pensioners have been cut.The price of a pint of beer and a packet of cigarettes will both increase from midnight by 10 cents (8p).The opposition accused the government of targeting the elderly in the budget.The savings measures include a review of the Irish medical card system, which entitles eligible people to access certain health services free of charge.The government said it aims to save 113m euros (£95m) by removing all ""ineligible and redundant"" medical cards, but the opposition said the changes would mean many pensioners would lose access to free health care.There will also be greater restrictions on sickness benefit - the number of days a person must report sick from work before they are eligible to claim will double from three to six days.  Maternity benefit is being ""standardised"" for new claimants, in a move the government said will save 30m euros (£25m) over the next year.However, the government is introducing free GP care for all children under five years of age, and has set aside 37m euros (£31m) to provide this new benefit.The main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, said the medical card changes would badly affect 35,000 pensioners and accused the minister of ""robbing grandparents so he can give free GP care to their grandchildren"".There will be no change to the state pension, child benefit or carers' allowances, and pensioners will still be entitled to free public transport and TV licences.Finance Minister Michael Noonan said his government was ""100% committed to the 12.5% corporation tax rate"". The Irish coalition had come under pressure from Europe to raise the business tax in the aftermath of the international bailout.But Mr Noonan said the Republic of Ireland's corporation tax rate was a ""settled policy"" and ""will not change"".The Irish economy is emerging from one of the deepest recessions in the eurozone, having sought an 85bn euros (£72m) international bailout in November 2010.At the weekend, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny told his annual party conference the Republic of Ireland was on track to exit the bailout programme by December.Mr Noonan introduced his budget by saying: ""The story of insolvent Ireland is familiar to all our people and the sacrifices people have had to make in recent years are well known.He said financial assistance from the IMF and the European authorities ""came at a high price"" as Ireland had ""lost its sovereignty"".However, he said that Tuesday's budget was the first since 2007 to be delivered against a backdrop of rising employment.""By the time the majority of the measures that I have announced today become law on the first of January next, I am confident that Ireland will have left the EU/IMF programme. ""We will have closed this chapter of Ireland's history that began for most of us with the governor of the Central Bank announcing to the Irish public that the country would be forced to turn to the lenders of last resort. ""There will be no promissory notes, there will be no Anglo Irish Bank and there will be no bank guarantee. We will have exited the programme and Ireland will have been handed back her purse.""Mr Noonan added: ""We are well along the recovery path and it is time now, as a nation, to begin to look forward.""Fianna Fáil finance spokesperson, Michael McGrath, said: ""We all hope the country is on the cusp of recovery but I believe it is too early too early to draw any definitive conclusions on that front.""He said: ""This is a budget that targets the elderly, it targets those who hold medical cards, it targets young mothers, it abandons people struggling to kept their home, and yet again, incredibly, the government has gone out of its way to insulate the better off from the worst affects of this budget"".Mr McGrath criticised the withdrawal of the 850 euros (£718) bereavement grant and said the way that pensioners in particular had been treated in the budget was ""nothing short of disgraceful"".""Not only will many of them now lose their medical card, they will have higher prescription charges, they will lose their telephone allowance, their bereavement grant is gone and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is going up.  ""Even the dead, minister, are not safe from this government.  As if it isn't enough to take a property tax from the estate of those who are deceased, but the modest grant that their loved one gets to given them the dignity of a decent burial is now being removed by this government,"" Mr McGrath added."

The Cabinet had put forward a budget to save more than £30m and raise council tax by 1.97% from April.But the Liberal Democrats' proposal for a budget for 2013/2014 was passed by 52 votes to 49, partly due to support from backbench Conservatives. It means the council has frozen its share of council tax for the third year running.Interim chief executive Paul Masters said the decision could cost 135 council jobs.Bodmin East councillor Mr Kennedy said the freeze ""could have a cataclysmic effect on services"".Mullion councillor Ms Rule said: ""What they've done is horrific. Adult care, children and shared services such as libraries are all at risk.""Both keep their Cabinet jobs, but their decision means only three Conservatives remain on the 10-member Cabinet.Conservative group leader Fiona Ferguson, who voted for the freeze, said: ""If you stand as a Conservative candidate, people know you have certain principles and you try to stick by them.""On zero council council tax we have always been consistent, that's what we wanted to achieve if we could possibly do it.""Cuts include £855,000 from adult care and support, £723,000 from children, schools and families and £365,000 from shared services such as libraries.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Alex Folkes said: ""This budget will actually boost jobs numbers, not cut them.""We have said that the bulk of the savings should be made by transferring agency workers on to contract.""Conservative council leader Jim Currie, who supported the tax rise, called the freeze decision ""half baked"".""Everybody is in a state of shock but this is democracy, it's been done.""My job is to manage it and we'll try to make the best of it,"" he said."

For Cristian, this will mean that instead of hiding his plants from the police, the authorities will supervise them to make sure he complies with the new rules.A central body, the National Institute for Cannabis Regulation, will provide those who want to grow marijuana with seeds and ensure that their crop does not exceed the legal limit of 480g (1lb 1oz) per year.Cristian welcomes the change.""I think it was about time that cannabis became legal. Police should worry about fighting crime and drug trafficking, not me,"" he says.The man behind the law is 78-year-old former guerrilla fighter turned President Jose Mujica.The president says he opposes drug consumption but wants to take the multi-million-dollar cannabis business away from the drug cartels. ""This won't be a weed-for-all country,"" Mr Mujica assured critics.Under the new law, buyers will have to officially register - something only residents can do, not tourists.There will also be a strict 40g/month limit on those who grow the drug or buy it at licensed pharmacies.""What I am doing is offering consumers a legal amount,"" President Mujica explains. The bill goes several steps further than existing legislation in the Netherlands, where growing cannabis is not legal, although the authorities turn a blind eye to those who grow some plants at home.It bears some similarities to drug laws in the US states of Colorado and Washington, where the sale of cannabis for medicinal or recreational use was made legal in 2012.But Uruguay is the first nation state to regulate the production, distribution and sale of the drug. The country, which has a population of fewer than 3.5 million people, has so far been spared much of the drug-related violence that other Latin American countries have suffered from, but officials say it is time to tackle drug gangs before they get too strong.""Last year, 82 people were killed in drug-related violence in Uruguay. We are starting to see episodes of criminal score-settling, groups of hitmen ... but we are not aware of anybody who died because of marijuana consumption,"" explains the head of the National Drug Agency, Julio Calzada.Other Latin American countries are watching Uruguay's experiment with interest.Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, whose country is suffering from a wave of violence blamed on drug cartels, has described his Uruguayan counterpart as ""a visionary"".Others view Mr Mujica's experiment with scepticism.Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade recently warned that ""unilateral policies"" would not solve the problem, and asked for a global discussion about drug policy.Uruguay's neighbour Brazil sent a delegation to Montevideo earlier this year to express its concern about the potential impact of the new law.But Mr Calzada insists Uruguay's neighbours will benefit as well as its own citizens. ""Our commitment to other countries is that our legal marijuana will not end up smuggled into their territory. This will not happen,"" he assures foreign sceptics.But the law is also facing criticism at home. According to recent polls, 60% of Uruguayans oppose the bill. Congresswoman Veronica Alonso of the National Party is one of them.""This law does not solve the real problems. If the government really wants to fight insecurity it should tackle the places where illegal drugs are sold,"" she told the BBC.""If it is a matter of public health, then it should work to prevent the consumption of other drugs, like tobacco or alcohol,"" she argues.Ms Alonso fears that the law will encourage drug consumption, especially among young Uruguayans.""There will be a higher availability of marijuana and at the same time the perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug will be lower. Therefore consumption will grow,"" she says.""This is going to cause us a lot of problems, especially from a social and medical point of view, and the State is not ready to face them.""Whether good or bad, the effects of the government's pioneering move are certain to be scrutinised and analysed by both opponents and supporters of cannabis legalisation not just in Uruguay but across the world."

Speeds of up to 250mph on HS2 would reduce a Birmingham to Leeds journey from two hours to 57 minutes.Supporters of HS2 says it holds massive future benefits for the economy and would cut emissions from air travel.Critics - many in traditional Tory-voting areas - argue that HS2's predicted economic benefits have been overestimated by the government, and suggest swathes of picturesque countryside would be blighted by the railway.More than 70 groups oppose HS2. Eighteen councils along the route which are against the scheme, known as the 51m group, say that taxpayers cannot afford the line and it will increase greenhouse gas emissions. But Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ""This commitment is the next important step in securing a modern high-speed rail network linking the north and south of Britain which will unlock significant economic and environmental benefits.""He said the legislation was ""good news for both passengers and the economy and "" key to providing the extra capacity today's booming rail industry will need in the years ahead"".Institution of Civil Engineers director general Nick Baveystock said the plan ""presents an opportunity to bring about a real step-change in rail capacity and help regenerate and boost the economies of our city regions"".Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, which campaigns for lower taxes, said HS2 was a ""great vanity project...  poor value compared to more affordable alternatives, but there is still time to reconsider that white elephant""."

Ms Williamson worked there for two days a week and in London for three days a week. Taxpayers paid for her travel to London and hotel costs between 2008 and 2012.Mr Bacon said: ""Because they are partly a perk, it's been recognised for many years that people get taxed on their company cars and it's surprising that shouldn't be the same in the public sector.""The HMRC doesn't seem to have a problem working out which is which when it comes to the private sector and when it comes to private citizens.""I think the point is that everyone should be treated in the same way, like cases should be treated like.""What we don't want is this sort of sense that there's a small number of people that are treated differently to everyone else, and that's what this starts to smell of in certain cases.""HMRC said more widely 20,000 employees had payments made on their behalf by their employers, most in the private sector.A spokesman said in a statement: ""We can't discuss individual cases. However, cars provided by an employer that are available for employee use are a benefit in kind for the employee and are taxable. These rules have been in place for 37 years.""Employers may choose to pay the tax due on the benefit. If so any such payment will constitute an additional benefit - which will also be taxable on the employee.""This is quite a common practice by employers and is a matter between employer and employee. HMRC makes sure all the tax due is paid.""Dave Penman, general secretary of the First Division Association, the trade union for senior civil servants, told the BBC that the use of government cars had fallen because of recent cuts.Their use ""was not a perk"", but essential for senior staff doing ""demanding jobs"", requiring them to be on call seven days a week.Earlier this week, it emerged that central government spent more than £500m on consultants and short-term staff last year despite a crackdown on the practice.The Times reported that the figure was nearer £800m when ""off payroll"" staff were included - at the same time £287m was spent on staff redundancies.Also this week local councils urged the government to become as ""efficient"" as them at collecting taxes, arguing this could make Whitehall an extra £20bn a year."

A group of Conservative backbenchers have been campaigning for him to firm up this commitment by legislating in the current Parliament for a referendum. In their amendment, the MPs state that they ""respectfully regret that an EU referendum bill was not included"" in last week's the Queen's Speech, which lays out the government's legislative plans for the year ahead.The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has yet to decide whether to select the amendment for debate.But if the debate and vote go ahead on Wednesday, ministers will be ""guided"" to abstain, a senior source told the BBC.Other MPs, including ministers' parliamentary aides, will be free to vote with their consciences. One of them - Gavin Barwell, parliamentary private secretary to Education Secretary Michael Gove - has already said that he intends to support the amendment. The amendment has been signed by nearly 30 Tory backbenchers, including former Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan and former leadership contender David Davis, as well as two Labour MPs, and it is thought about 100 backbench MPs could back it in a vote.But the amendment would stand little chance of being passed because Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs would vote against it - as would many Conservatives. Conservative unrest over Europe has gained fresh momentum following the recent election success of the UK Independence Party and comments by Tory grandees such as Lord Lawson suggesting EU withdrawal.Mr Cameron has promised a referendum if the Tories win the next general election, due in 2015. The prime minister has said a pledge to hold an in/out vote by 2017, once he has negotiated the return of some powers from Brussels, will be in the next Conservative manifesto.Mr Cameron will not vote himself on the amendment as he will be out of the country on a trip to the US. He has told the rebels he cannot introduce a bill paving the way for this because of opposition from his Liberal Democrat coalition partners.Speaking to the Labour group Progress on Saturday, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister was ""hiding behind the sofa"", too scared to confront his party.Mr Miliband said: ""It is wrong now to commit to an in/out referendum and have four years of uncertainty and a 'closed for business' sign above our country.""Labour aides stressed that Mr Miliband was opposing the decision to signal a referendum now but not ruling out the possibility of a referendum in the future. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: ""David Cameron will give the British people their say on our future in Europe in an in-out referendum in the next parliament.""But Ed Miliband has once again made clear he will never trust the British people to have their say - he opposes a referendum. He is too weak to stand up for the British people at home and too weak to stand up for our country's interests abroad.""But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg criticised his coalition partners about their ""endless navel-gazing over Europe,"" which he said was in danger of distracting the government from its priorities.In his weekly email to Lib Dem members, he said: ""Our job is to anchor the government in the centre ground, stopping others from lurching this way and that, and making sure the government delivers our core objectives: a stronger economy in a fairer society.""

This will be replaced by a new £140 flat rate, with inflation expected to push this up to £155 by 2015 or 2016.The state pension age will rise to 66 for both men and women by 2020.The Queen's Speech outlined plans to increase the state pension age further to 67 between 2026 and 2028 - affecting those aged 52 or younger now.The speech also signalled government plans for this state pension age to continue to rise automatically in line with longevity. This could be done either through a formula linking pension age to average life expectancy, or through a regular official review.  A universal flat-rate payment in England, Wales and Scotland would be the biggest overhaul of the system for decades.The flat-rate pension will only be available for new pensioners reaching state pension age, rather than the millions of existing pensioners.This could create a two-tier system of state pension for some time. Existing pensioners, when the system changed, would still gain their entitlement under the old system, but those who reach pension age after the changes come in would get the new flat rate.More than one-and-a-half million eligible pensioners do not claim pension credit, and the government believes that such individual losses of entitlement would not occur under a simpler flat-rate system.The self-employed, and some women, are also likely to benefit, as National Insurance rules have meant they have tended to get a lower state pension.However, there is likely to be debate about the fairness of a flat rate that makes no distinction between poor and wealthy pensioners.""We are delighted by this confirmation of the government's commitment to a long-awaited, landmark reform,"" said Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF).""This is another big step towards a simpler, more generous state pension that no longer penalises people for saving. A new system will take millions out of means-tested benefits and will encourage people to take control of their own age by saving towards it.""We are all living longer, so it is inevitable that retirement ages move upwards to reflect that. The trade-off for working longer must be a better state pension come retirement."""

The average increase for a low income family under the new scheme will be nearly £140 a year, the report found.

About 70% of payments since 2010 were to men living overseas who married women who had a UK National Insurance contribution record.A draft Consumer Rights Bill, to be published in the summer by the government, will bring together a range of consumer protection that has built up over time.It will also update the law to introduce new protection for consumer who buy digital content, such as e-books, digital music, games and software.The draft bill will also outline detail such as amount of time consumers have to return faulty goods for repair, replacement or refund.Trading standards officers will also be given the power to seek compensation from the courts on behalf of consumers. Consumer groups have welcomed the plan to change the law which they regarded as outdated, and to simplify legislation to make it easier for consumers to be aware of their rights.The Trading Standards Institute (TSI) said it welcomed the move, but urged the government not to dilute the powers of trading standards officers powers to enter premises unannounced, currently part of the plans.Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy secretary, said that the plans failed to address issues such as excessive charges on private pensions, and costs affecting consumers such as high rail fares.On energy, there will be legislation aimed at incentivising businesses to invest in new sources of low-carbon power, from wind farms to nuclear power stations.The Bill will also set up a ""capacity market"" aimed at ensuring continuity of electricity supply during periods of peak demand.Other highlights of the legislative programme include: A National Insurance Contributions Bill that aims to reduce business employment costs with the introduction of a £2,000 Employment Allowance. The Bill will also crack down on the use of offshore payroll companies as way of avoiding employer NICs.A Deregulation Bill to ""reduce the burden of excessive legislation on businesses"" by repealing existing laws that no longer have any ""practical use"".The Intellectual Property Bill aims to make it easier for businesses to protect their intellectual property, particularly their designs, with the introduction of a Unified Patent Court that most EU countries have signed up to.The Water Bill aims to make Britain's water supply ""more resilient"" in the face of increasing droughts and floods through the creation of a national water supply network.

But the National Audit Office is concerned that the DCLG - which is responsible for controlling spending by local councils - has not been keeping a proper eye on its own books.The department went over its cash spending limits towards the end of the financial year and took out an unauthorised bank overdraft, the National Audit Office has revealed.Despite this, Downing Street said Prime Minister David Cameron still shared Mr Osborne's favourable opinion of Mr Pickles.""I think the prime minister agrees with the chancellor's assessment,"" a No 10 spokesman said.The department said its accounts showed that it stayed ""well within"" the Treasury's overall spending limits.""The department has taken immediate action to address the issues raised,"" a spokesman said.""Internal audit reports were commissioned and the findings are now being implemented before the next supplementary estimate. This will avoid any recurrence.""But Margaret Hodge said the £217m overdraft was ""a shocking example of incompetence - no-one was keeping an eye on the cash position"". She said she was ""staggered that the department has been so blase with its resources and so poor at staying within some of its budgets. ""If local authorities, for whom the department is responsible, acted in this way, the department would be down on them like a ton of bricks.""The department also went over its capital limit for local government spending. Two quangos - the Valuation Tribunal Service, which handles ratepayer appeals against council tax in England, and the local government ombudsman in England - spent a total of £1.2m, against a limit of £80,000.A DCLG spokesman said: ""The annual report and accounts for 2012-13 show the department has an excellent record for saving money and has stayed well within the Treasury's overall spending limits. ""An administrative error by officials meant the department went overdrawn for one banking night at the end of the financial year, but immediate action was taken to correct it and avoid any recurrence.""This government has stopped excessive and wasteful spending in the department, delivering the largest savings in Whitehall, with administration spending down by more than 40% and the move to Marsham Street next year saving the taxpayer £9m per year.""For Labour, shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn said Mr Pickles needed to ""get a grip"" of his department.""Eric Pickles wastes no opportunity to grandstand and lecture local authorities on properly managing their finances so this public rebuke over his own shocking failure to do the same in his department is hugely embarrassing for him and David Cameron,"" he said.""Eric Pickles must act urgently to get a grip of his department, stop wasting public money and focus on getting his own house in order before he preaches to councils again."""

""Our sensitivity analysis shows that overall migration has a positive impact on the sustainability of the public finances over our 50 year horizon,"" the OBR said."

Now, foreign aid groups that rely on US support fear the cuts will devastate the people in the most desperate need.When Jeremy Konyndyk, director of policy for Mercy Corps, talks about budget cuts in the US, he barely mentions the impact the reductions will have on Americans.Instead, he worries about people overseas - such as those he met recently in Niger.In January, Konyndyk visited a village in the county's Ouallam region, roughly 62 miles (100km) from Niamey, where he met a group of about 20 women who had received a goat through a food-security programme.""This programme at least gives them some prospects for getting through the drought without getting totally wiped out,"" he says. The budget cuts, he says, will make it harder to help those and other women in Niger. The US Congress has slashed $85bn from US spending for this fiscal year, which ends in October. The deficit reduction measures are referred to in Washington DC jargon as sequestration.In Washington, White House officials say the cuts will affect everything from White House tours (cancelled) to domestic airline flights (delayed). Despite those claims, though, some of the cuts to the budget will barely be felt. ""It's not the end of the world,"" says Gordon Adams, an American University professor who was a senior budget official in the Clinton White House. ""It's a haircut.""But the cuts affect not only Americans - people around the world will see its impact. European officials may spend less time in meetings, for example, because their counterparts in Washington will be making fewer overseas trips. Some Pentagon officials have already cancelled trips to Europe this spring.But for people living in other parts of the world, the impact could be more significant. The US is the world's largest provider of humanitarian aid, according to the London-based Overseas Development Institute. The US also offers military assistance to countries in the Middle East and other regions and funds programmes for global health, refugee aid and more.The March law writing the cuts into the budget slashed funding for these and other programmes by roughly 5%.More than $2.7bn will be taken from state department foreign operations and other programmes, according to the Congressional Research Service.In some cases the cuts will affect government institutions in other countries. Aid to countries such as Egypt (the US provides roughly $1.3bn annually to its military) and Israel (roughly $3bn annually) also may be reduced.The budgetary reductions will have an impact on individuals, say aid workers, since the cuts will be applied to programmes already stretched thin.Contributions to international peacekeeping, which helps to tamp down on violence in conflict-ridden countries such as Mali, will be reduced by $20m.And funds for humanitarian programmes, which help families in the Horn of Africa and other places in crisis, will be cut by roughly $200m, state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland has said.Efforts to fight disease in Africa may also be affected, since global health programmes will lose more than $400m in US funding.""We work on programmes for the most needy people on the planet,"" says Tom Hart, US executive director for the ONE Campaign, the advocacy group founded by U2's Bono. ""These people are living on the edge. About a million kids won't be vaccinated. A million bed nets that prevent malaria won't be distributed.""Hart and other advocates fear the lives of many people overseas will become harder if aid programmes, which include food security and agricultural projects, are reduced.And many humanitarian aid workers say their programmes are already financially strapped.""At this point, we are facing an acute number of crises,"" says Jeremy Kadden, a senior legislative manager at InterAction, a consortium of non-governmental organisations based in the US. ""We have more people in need than ever before.""Konyndyk of Mercy Corps says the budget cuts chip away at efforts to help people in other parts of the world and put Americans in a bind.""The government is faced with a kind of Sophie's choice,"" he says.

They are angered by Washington's appeal to reconsider their boycott of the general elections set for next month.American political traction in Egypt has declined sharply following Mubarak's departure amid mass protests in 2011 , so it is not clear how much Mr Kerry can hope to achieve, the BBC's Jim Muir reports.Egypt remains sharply divided between Islamists and their liberal and secular opponents.

The US needs to agree a new spending bill before the financial year ends at midnight on Monday. But political divisions have resulted in a stalemate.There are worries over the economic impact of a failure to do so, which may see non-essential federal services shut and staff placed on unpaid leave. Stock indexes in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea all declined.Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.5%, Australia's ASX dropped 1.7%, while South Korea's Kospi shed 0.7%""It is the fear of the unknown,"" said David Kuo of financial website the Motley Fool. ""No one knows what is really going to happen and markets don't like uncertainty.""""There is likely to be some reduction in US government spending, but we don't know what areas are going to be affected.""Until that is resolved, we are likely to see volatility in the markets,"" he added.One of the key areas of debate between the Democrats and the Republicans has been President Barack Obama's healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare.Early on Sunday, the Republican-run House of Representatives passed an amended version of the Senate spending bill that removed funding from the healthcare law, raising the chances of a shutdown. US Senate Majority leader Harry Reid has vowed that his Democrat-led chamber will reject the Republican bill.""Tomorrow, the Senate will do exactly what we said we would do and reject these measures,"" said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""At that point, Republicans will be faced with the same choice they have always faced: put the Senate's clean funding bill on the floor and let it pass with bipartisan votes, or force a Republican government shutdown.""Speaking for the president, White House spokesman Jay Carney said: ""Any member of the Republican Party who votes for this bill is voting for a shutdown."" The president, he said, would also veto the Republican bill.If the government does shut down on 1 October, as many as a third of its 2.1 million employees are expected to stop work - with no guarantee of back pay once the deadlock is resolved. National parks and Washington's Smithsonian museums would close, pension and veterans' benefit cheques would be delayed, and visa and passport applications would be stymied.Programmes deemed essential, such as air traffic control and food inspections, would continue.The defence department has advised employees that uniformed members of the military will continue on ""normal duty status"", but ""large numbers"" of civilian workers will be told to stay home.The looming shutdown, which would be the first for 17 years, is not the only crisis the US government is facing. The US government and Republicans are also at loggerheads over extending the government's borrowing limit. The US Treasury Secretary has warned that the US will hit its debt ceiling by 17 October, leaving the government with half the money needed to pay its bills.Earlier this month Jack Lew said that unless the US is allowed to extend its borrowing limit, the country will be left with about $30bn to meet its commitments, which on certain days can be as high as $60bn.A failure to raise the limit could also result in the US government defaulting on its debt payments. President Obama has warned that ""failure to meet this responsibility would be far more dangerous than a government shutdown"".Washington faced a similar impasse over its debt ceiling in 2011. Republicans and the Democrats only reached a compromise on the day the government's ability to borrow money was due to run out.That fight was resolved just hours before the country could have defaulted on its debt, but nevertheless led to ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgrading the US for the first time ever.The 2011 compromise included a series of automatic budget cuts known as the ""sequester"" which came into effect earlier this year.

The other costs covered training, accommodation, meals, welfare, health, salary and other support per Army recruit in 2010-11.Army personnel can be deployed once they turn 18 - which the two groups said meant that ""at any one time, approximately 150 soldiers are fully trained but too young to be deployed.""They added that it costs approximately £2.65m to pay the salaries of these un-soldiers, which it said were each paid a salary of £17,690.The report said the drop-out rate for minors was 36.6% compared with 28.3% for adults, the report said.But it added that under-18s who completed their training were likely to serve for an average of 10 years, compared with seven-and-a-half years for adult recruits.The report suggested taxpayers would save between £81.5m and £94m if all recruits were aged 18 and over.Its authors also say the UK is becoming ""increasingly isolated"" internationally in continuing with the practice - no other country in Europe recruits from such a young age - and are calling on the MoD to raise the Army recruitment age to 18.David Gee, of ForcesWatch, said recruiting under-18s into the Army was ""a practice from a bygone era"".""It's not just young recruits who pay the price for outdated MoD policies - taxpayers do too,"" he said.""And so does the Army when it finds itself undermanned on the front line because so many minors have dropped out of training.""An MoD spokesman said it continued ""to actively recruit across all age groups"".""As part of our duty of care to our recruits, no young person under the age of 18 years may join our armed forces without the formal written consent of their parent or guardian,"" he added.""There are currently no plans to revisit the government's recruitment policy for under-18s, which is fully compliant with United Nations conventions.""One former serviceman said that joining the armed forces as a teenager was ""a good thing for young people"".Jason Hardick, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, told the BBC: ""It gives you self-confidence, self-discipline and a certain self-determination.  You never want to fail, you always want to move forward.""He joined two weeks after his 16th birthday, and stayed for 10 years, only leaving to get married. ""I had a brilliant time, it's a good thing for young people to do and I was the youngest of my intake."""
2145	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21760060	News	1	None	Economy	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"House Republicans have begun the latest round of US fiscal negotiations by unveiling a budget proposal that aims to cut through the social safety net.The plan, introduced by Representative Paul Ryan, is similar to previous budgets he has put forward. He said it would cut $4.6tn (£3tn) over 10 years.But White House spokesman Jay Carney said of the Ryan plan in a statement: ""The math just doesn't add up.""Senate Democrats plan to offer a rival budget with both cuts and tax rises.Former vice-presidential candidate Mr Ryan said his plan would stop the US government living beyond its means.""We're introducing a budget that balances in 10 years - without raising taxes,'' Mr Ryan said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed about the plan.The Wisconsin Republican's plan includes tax revenues gained over that time-span as part of a last-minute deal pushed by the White House on 1 January that raised taxes on incomes over $400,000. Both Democrats and Republicans recognise that neither budget is likely to pass both the House and the Senate. But the plans outline the priorities of each party amid wider negotiations to pass a budget by 27 March.That deadline is when the current resolution funding the US government expires.During a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Ryan called his plan an invitation to Democrats and the White House ""to come together to fix these problems"". His budget proposal finds significant parts of its projected savings in healthcare costs.It seeks to repeal President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law and cut spending on Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor, by giving control of its distribution to states.But correspondents say it is highly unlikely that healthcare reform can be repealed.The budget committee chairman has also reintroduced a proposal that replaces traditional Medicare, a government healthcare programme for the elderly, with a government subsidy to buy health insurance for those currently under 55.Critics of the plan say the subsidies will not grow with inflation fast enough, raising the annual price of insurance for seniors. The budget preserves more than $700bn in the Obama healthcare reform law's cuts to Medicare providers over a decade.Also included are about $1tn cuts to domestic programmes.While the document released on Tuesday does not go into specific detail on where those cuts would come from, it assumes day-to-day spending significantly lower than levels called for by across-the-boards cuts, known as the sequester, that went into effect on 1 March. Defence spending would be lower than previous budgets passed by the House, but higher than amounts expected if the sequester remains in place.Despite the sharp cuts, Mr Ryan estimates the proposal increases spending by 3.4% instead of the 5% currently projected.The Senate plan, to be unveiled on Wednesday by Democratic Senator Patty Murray, is expected to call for new tax revenues through ending certain tax loopholes and other tax benefits to the wealthy.""At a time when we absolutely must cut where we can, looking at ways we can close special tax breaks that aren't targeted to help the middle class or our economy just makes sense,"" Sen Murray said at a hearing last week.""There's no good reason, for example, that taxpayers currently subsidise millionaires more, when they purchase a second home, or a yacht, than they do middle-class families purchasing their first home.""Republicans have also called for closing certain loopholes in the tax code, but would use the savings to reduce tax rates.Sen Murray's budget is also expected to include spending cuts equivalent to revenue raised over 10 years.The expected Senate budget proposal is the first since 2009. A series of continuing resolutions - essentially stop-gap measures - have served as the US budget through various political battles over reducing the country's deficit."
2196	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-24346960	News	1	Republican Scandals	Economy	SomewhatNegative	Negative	bbc.co.uk	"The US government has begun a partial shutdown after the two houses of Congress failed to agree a new budget.The Republican-led House of Representatives insisted on delaying President Barack Obama's healthcare reform - dubbed Obamacare - as a condition for passing a bill.More than 800,000 federal employees face unpaid leave with no guarantee of back pay once the deadlock is over, as certain agencies and national parks also close.Under the US presidential system, different branches of government can be controlled by opposing parties. Currently the Senate is controlled by the Democrats, while the Republicans control the House of Representatives.This legislative conflict has led to the current gridlock and subsequent partial shutdown of government, the first for 17 years.With the US political system seemingly in legislative paralysis, is American politics broken? Experts give their views below.The problem with American politics is that Tea Party activists have taken over the Republican Party. They come from small, rural districts and now are demanding that House Speaker John Boehner practises extremist politics. Boehner could end this stalemate today by allowing a continuing resolution to go to the floor for a vote without repealing Obamacare. It would pass and this crisis would be resolved. However, conservatives have warned that if Mr Boehner allows a floor vote without their support, they will depose him and elect another Speaker. This crisis is not so much a governability problem as a war within the Republican Party. It won't be resolved until prominent Republicans demand that the House takes action.""Broken"" is a very strong word. In one way American politics is working exactly how the founding fathers intended when they created the separation of powers.But they always assumed that at times of need, the ""energy"" of government would overcome the separation of government. They never anticipated that there would be this polarisation of politics.We're now in a situation where the intentions of the founders are being overcome by the nature of the political parties and the lack of middle ground between them, so you could say American politics is broken.I don't think it's irreparable but you now have to have a supermajority [60 out of 100] in the Senate [to pass legislation], and the Republicans showed in 2009-10 how the lack of 60 Democrats in the Senate could be exploited to tie up the work of the upper house. I don't imagine the Democrats will lie down and play dead even were the Republicans to become the single party of government in 2016.Charges that America is broken are a longstanding trope of the US Christian Right. Such charges harken back to a fictitious 1950s shared cultural values. Employing this measure, changes of the last 60 years indicate that American is ""broken"". But that fictitious narrative fails to include those on the socio-economic margins eg women, African-Americans, Latinos, and LGBTs, who are now moving at pace into the mainstream. For these benefactors of change, America is not broken - it is increasingly realising its potential as a representative democracy based on justice and equality. Change has left those previously occupying places of privilege outraged. With more states allowing same-sex marriage, the working class accessing affordable healthcare, immigration reform afoot and a black man in the White House, the Tea Party has had enough. This government shutdown is not the culmination of their outrage, it is only a beginning.There's no doubt that the federal budget process is broken, and there is wide acceptance of that. The federal budget system doesn't work. Congress hasn't passed a regular budget in many years now, [instead] they've appropriated money based on continuing resolutions and other special procedures.The instability caused by the Obamacare health law is because it was passed in 2010 on a wholly partisan basis. Not a single Republican voted for the law in either the House or the Senate.In recent decades the most enduring federal legislation has been bipartisan. So I would blame President Obama for ramming through legislation that only his party supported.The battle over Obamacare is unique and has been poisoned, initially by President Obama. That said, it used to be that both parties had both liberal and conservatives. But over the last few decades the Republican Party has become more conservative and the Democratic Party has moved far to the left.In the UK, where you have a parliamentary system, if the prime minister's party loses a floor vote in parliament you have to have a new election - it's a vote of no confidence.In the US, we have a situation where the administration's proposed policies can be blockaded by a minority in either House of Congress - and that can bring the government to a standstill.The unusual thing in this case is that this radical faction, the Tea Party, have chosen to use the national budget [and] are demanding that the healthcare programme be modified or abandoned in return for funding government.It's a form of political extortion. It is broadly unacceptable to the American people, and the Tea Party will be hurt by it.The system is stretched, the system is challenged. But the system itself is not broken. Eventually public pressure will come to play on the Republicans and will force them to accept some compromise solution. Both sides must find a face-saving way through this conundrum.The House Speaker, Mr Boehner, has chosen not to confront the radical minority in his party, but rather to accommodate them.A stronger or more principled House leader would've said ""enough is enough"". But he hasn't done that. So another reason the system is not broken is because it is a personality in a critical position who is not doing his job properly.I don't think the system is broken, the system works. The problem right now is that the two political parties, who are fairly evenly matched in political support across the country, are having a crucial argument about the direction of the country.This is not unusual; there have been prior times in American history where there have been substantive and critical fights over different issues. We have an out of control federal budget, we have a gigantic deficit, and we're having a critical debate over what to do about those problems. I don't think there is a serious structural problem in the US political system, we've just come to a fork in the road about the direction that the country should move in. The system is handling it, we're just at loggerheads over what to do about it - in particular where we should go with the growth and size of the federal government. The [shutdown] goes to the basic structural problem in the US constitution. It's a separated system with separate institutions sharing in power, so that means that each of the major institutions of national government can exercise a veto against any decision they don't like - and that's exactly what's happening.Historically compromise has usually been available. [But] now you have an extremist group in the Republican Party holding the system to ransom.What you have seen over the last 20 years in Congress is a kind of procedural arms race, and this is the latest example of it - one party, and it's usually the Republicans, finding some procedural device, [and] attaching this rider to a resolution to throw a spanner in the works and stop the government working.I wouldn't say it's at breaking point but we've seen an escalation of the use of veto points. The ""arms race"" has been escalating and the parties have become increasingly polarised."

Mr Greenspan, the most powerful figure in economic policy when he ran the Fed between 1987 to 2006, spoke to the BBC's Evan Davis ahead of publication of his new book, The Map and the Territory.In a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on Radio 4's Today programme and the World Service's Business Daily, the former Fed chief had strong words for those who thought the eurozone crisis was over.The crisis is likely to continue until the eurozone sees ""consolidation politically. I think that's where we are going"".He said: ""The culture of Greece is not the same as the culture of Germany, and to fuse them into a single unit is extremely difficult. ""The only way you can do it is by political union, like with East and West Germany, and even that is not working as well as it should be.""But he was optimistic about the UK's attempt to revive its economy.""What Britain has done with its austerity programme has worked much better than I thought it would,"" Mr Greenspan said.""As far as I can judge, it [the economy] is coming out pretty much the way they [the coalition government] had expected.""Mr Greenspan also defended his record at the Fed against criticism that easy-credit policies and light-touch regulation had contributed substantially to the 2008 financial crash. He also declined to criticise the financial derivatives market.He said: ""One thing that shocked me is that not only did the Federal Reserve's very sophisticated model completely miss (the crash on) September 15th, 2008, but so did the IMF, so did JP Morgan, which was forecasting American economic growth three days before the crisis hit, going up all through 2009 and 2010.""There is a difference between predicting economic bubbles, and predicting when they might burst, he said.He rejected suggestions that he was not clear enough in warning that the financial markets might be teetering on the edge of collapse. However, his words of warning had to be couched very carefully in order not to unsettle the markets, he said. ""I was very worried about what the impact would be.""Mr Greenspan, 87, who now runs his own consultancy business, also criticised a growing ""crony capitalism"" in the US.He said: ""Crony capitalism is essentially a condition in which… public officials are giving favours to people in the private sector in payment of political favours.""He said it was prevalent in China and Russia, but had not been common in the US or the UK. But he added: ""I am beginning to worry that we are starting in that direction.""On China, he said that growth rates would begin to slow unless the country could be more innovative.""One of the major problems with China is that its innovation is largely borrowed technology. ""There was a recent Reuters study where they listed the top 100 most innovative companies. Forty were American, none were Chinese. ""Chinese productivity is the highest in the world but the way they do it is by borrowing the technology from abroad, either by joint ventures or other means.""What they are going to find, I suspect sooner rather than later, is that… unless they pick up innovation very specifically, their growth is going to slow down,"" Mr Greenspan said.Part of the problem was that China remained a single-party state which was too conformist, and innovators there still did not ""think outside of the box"" enough."

As he set out a full-blown progressive agenda, he lectured Republicans in Congress. At first his focus was on the economy. His philosophy was clear - only investment and spending would ensure a rising, thriving middle class. This was, in parts, a thickly detailed speech. Yet through it ran a simple chorus: ""Lets get it done"", ""Send me a bill,"" ""I will sign it"", ""Take a vote"".Those hoping for a more conciliatory tone than his notably aggressive inaugural speech were disappointed. Mr Obama threw down challenge after challenge to his opponents.He warned that the automatic spending cuts that come into effect at the beginning of next month would damage the economy. He urged more spending on pre-school education, high schools and training.He announced a plan to spend $70bn (£44bn) to rebuild roads and bridges.He called for tax reform. Immigration reform. Raising the minimum wage. And he argued passionately for gun control. If the focus was, as spun, the economy, the most emotional moment was Mr Obama's refrain for the victims of gun violence: ""They deserve a vote"".People were on their feet, some crying. There is still a central mystery to me about all of this. The support of the Democratic party, even the support of the bulk of Americans, does not win votes in the House of Representatives. Mr Obama's speech certainly has cast Congress as the villain if they do not act, but that does not ensure victory on a single one of his proposals.It might just turn out that Mr Obama's speech is not the one remembered from this night. Republican Senator Marco Rubio gave his party's reply to the State of the Union and it was strikingly different from anything I have heard from his party in the three years I have been here. That is perhaps a measure of how far they have drifted away from those they need to attract.The son of Cuban immigrants said that he was standing up not for the rich but for his neighbours, for immigrants, and retired people who depend on federal pensions and Medicare, free healthcare for seniors.Mr Rubio said he would never harm Medicare - it had provided dignity for his dad as he died of cancer, and his mum depended on it now.His message of smaller government and lower taxation was familiar. But the tone, the setting, the appeal to the less well-off - all were so different to anything Romney said during the election that it really stood out.This perhaps is Mr Obama's best hope - that those Republicans who feel a need for reform may heed some of his pleas for votes for his plans.

""If we did that we might again see a Wales where excellence is championed in a dual education system.""Prime Minister David Cameron is not in favour of increasing selective education in England, a policy that has caused disquiet in the Conservative party and led to the resignation of front-bencher Graham Brady in 2007.Under devolution, the Welsh Tories are free to set their own policy independent of Mr Cameron's party in London.A Conservative Central Office spokesman said: ""We don't have an opinion on Welsh education policy because it is a devolved matter.""If they were in power, the Welsh Conservatives would not adopt the old system of academic testing at 11, which Ms Burns concedes was divisive.But she insists the dual education system would raise standards and help brighter pupils from poorer backgrounds.Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said too many pupils were coming out of education with the wrong type of qualification for employers and it was about making the right choices - academic and vocational - at the age of 14.Pupils would remain in the same schools where appropriate but some would carry on with academic subjects, while others would take vocational options.Mr Davies told BBC Radio Wales they wanted to ""bring the best elements of the grammar school system"" and that the current system was failing in Wales.""Ultimately you are good at vocational courses that would qualify you for the workplace in a vocational manner - or academia,"" he said.""What we have at the moment is a system that actually constrains academic achievement and this homogenised blob that says everyone is the same.""That's no good for the 21st Century. We have got to be pushing academics and we have got to be pushing vocational courses and have parity between the two.""He added: ""If we're going to develop an economy that's fit for the 21st Century we have to have learners coming out of education with the qualifications that are robust and appropriate.""Ms Burns cited research from London University's Institute of Education which she said shows that the abolition of grammar schools has blocked disadvantaged pupils' ""escape routes"" to top universities and high-paid professional careers. She added: ""Instead of separating academic children from their more vocational counterparts, we could see the benefit of creating two equitable streams of education, one alongside the other, a dualling that begins at 14 - giving children the chance to develop important core subject skills before embarking on their chosen path.""Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis said he ""thought someone was pulling my leg"" when he was told of the Welsh Conservatives' proposal.Mr Lewis wrote a series of messages on Twitter criticising the policy, saying the Labour-run Welsh government was ""committed to excellent schools for all, not encouraging a parental scramble for advantage"".There were numerous unanswered questions about the Tory plan, he said, including whether pupils would remain in the same school after the age of 14 and whether all would take the GCSE qualification.The head teachers' union called it an ""intriguing development"" for Wales, where grammar schools were a ""distant memory for most.""Anna Brychan, director of NAHT Cymru said the proposals currently raised more questions than they answered.""The grammar school system is remembered positively by those who benefited from it,"" she said.

The Voting Rights Act was extended for 25 years by Congress in 2006 with broad support.""Congress did not use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula grounded in current conditions,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court's opinion. ""It instead re-enacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day.""The justices did not go so far as to strike down section 5 of the law, known as the pre-clearance provision, which requires certain states to get federal approval before making election-law changes.But since section 4, which sets the test for pre-clearance, has been found unconstitutional, the ruling effectively renders section 5 invalid until a new formula can be agreed by Congress.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was backed by three liberal-leaning colleagues, said in dissent that the court ""errs egregiously by overriding Congress' decision"".Reading aloud her view to a packed courtroom in Washington DC, she said there could be no doubt that voter discrimination still existed.""But the court today terminates the remedy that proved to be best suited to block that discrimination,"" she said.President Barack Obama said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the court's ruling, adding that the Voting Rights Act ""helped secure the right to vote for millions of Americans"".""Today's decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent,"" he said in a statement.Shelby County, in the southern state of Alabama, launched the legal challenge. It argued that the pre-clearance process was out of date and an over-reach of federal power.Critics of the voting law acknowledged that it may have been necessary in the 1960s, but they said times had changed and it was not longer appropriate to hold Southern states accountable for past wrongs.Alabama Governor Robert Bentley told the Birmingham News the decision was ""the most significant ruling"" in his lifetime.""Was there a reason to pass the Voting Rights Act 48 years ago? Yes, there was,"" Mr Bentley said. But he said ""areas of discrimination"" had been ""addressed"".""As governor, I can assure you we're not going to have discrimination in the state of Alabama based on race, especially related to voting,"" he said.The Voting Rights Act was intended to stop practices such as literacy tests, poll taxes or similar measures to keep black people from voting, in states with a history of racial discrimination.Supporters of the provision say recent efforts to change election laws in some parts of the US, including a series of voter identification laws, underline the voting act's continued relevance.Last year, the US justice department blocked changes to voter identification laws in the states of South Carolina and Texas.And a federal court ruled that a plan to change the boundaries of congressional districts in Texas discriminated against the state's large and growing Hispanic population.Activists in favour of preserving the law say that since the Voting Rights Act was renewed seven years ago, as many as 31 proposed changes to election laws have been blocked by Washington.Last week, the US Supreme Court struck down a state law in Arizona that would have required registered voters to provide proof of citizenship at the polls.Democrats say stricter voting laws, mainly championed by Republican legislatures, are designed to make it harder for minorities - who tend to vote Democratic - to cast their ballots."

But the Supreme Court ruled in June that circumstances had since changed and key elements of the Act were intended to be only temporary. In effect, the ruling brought an end to the requirement for federal ""pre-clearance"" of changes to election laws in 15 mainly Southern states.Gov McCrory, who is a Republican, said in a statement: ""Common practices like boarding an airplane and purchasing Sudafed require photo ID and we should expect nothing less for the protection of our right to vote.""The North Carolina law, as well as requiring voter identification, bans election-day registration and reduces the period allowed for early voting from 17 days to 10. College and university photo IDs will not be considered legitimate identification.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit challenging the changes, due to come into effect in 2016.""Eliminating a huge part of early voting will cut off voting opportunities for hundreds of thousands of citizens,"" ACLU official Dale Ho told North Carolina media.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a speech in San Francisco on Monday, criticised the court's ruling, arguing that ""anyone who says racial discrimination is no longer a problem in American elections must not be paying attention"".Texas passed its own voter ID law in 2011 and US Attorney General Eric Holder said last month he would challenge the legislation, describing the Supreme Court's June ruling ""flawed""."

Mr Carney said last week that the top White House lawyer, Kathy Ruemmler, was informed that the inspector general's investigation was under way in April, but he did not mention that more senior officials such as Mr McDonough knew.In 2010-12, the IRS was inundated with new applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status, after the US Supreme Court loosened restrictions on political spending by organisations unaffiliated with candidates' campaigns.According to IRS officials and the inspector general's report, in 2010-12 staff members at an IRS office in Cincinnati, Ohio used keywords such as ""Tea Party"" and ""patriot"" to select organisations for extra scrutiny.The Tea Party is a loosely organised movement of anti-tax conservatives, and in the American political lexicon, ""patriot"" can indicate a conservative orientation.The treasury department inspector general for tax matters has said he had found no evidence the IRS had acted under political pressure from the White House, and officials have said the practice was an effort to handle the heavy workload.Two top IRS officials have resigned over the matter, which Mr Obama has denounced as an unacceptable intrusion into citizens' political activities.The FBI has launched a criminal inquiry. Congress has already held one hearing into the matter and more are planned."

This ends much of the drama on Capitol Hill - but not for House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, whose political future is up in the air. Most Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown of the government. Many focus their ire on Mr Boehner. Some people are now calling for his removal. Others say he did as well as anyone could and should remain in office. Here is a look at what his future holds.It's now clear that he cannot control his caucus. In every episode of this comedy, he's had to do the same thing: look like he's in charge of his caucus, wait for the last minute and then fold his hand. What's next for him? When you're not in charge, and you want to look like you're in charge, then you race to the front of the crowd and find the exit.I don't know what's going to happen to him. But I would like him to pack up, go home and keep his mouth shut - and I would like us to get a conservative constitutional Republican to be speaker of the House, someone with backbone.Nobody's particularly graceful trying to juggle knives while roller skating - though I don't feel pity for him. He asked for the role. We shouldn't be surprised when people who run for powerful offices get damaged by the power they have. It's as old as the ages.I don't think he should be ashamed of anything that he has done. I'm more upset with my Republican conference to be honest with you… If anybody should be kicked out, it's probably those Republicans and not Speaker Boehner.  (presentation, Heritage Foundation, 16 October) Boehner did not lead the charge, and therefore the Tea Party movement is not impressed with the quality of his backbone. It remains to be seen whether or not he will now cave, as established Republicans have done for decades.I think he'll continue as speaker of the House. There's not an easy mechanism to remove a speaker of the House, and I'd be very surprised if that were to occur.He is speaker of the House, and if anybody wanted to move against him, that would have to be voted on by the entire House. I don't think it's going to come to that. I think he has enough support among the party caucus, and he's not a loser. He's one who's followed the wishes of his caucus.

But, Mr Johnson said, ""only by a whisker"".According to OBR estimates, the deficit will fall to £120.9bn this financial year from £121bn in 2011-12 - a mere £100m, which Mr Johnson described as akin to a ""rounding error"".""There is every indication that the numbers have been carefully managed with a close eye on the headline borrowing figures for this year,"" he said.""It is unlikely that this has led either to an economically optimal allocation of spending across years, or to a good use of time by officials and ministers.""The IFS also highlighted how the poor performance of the economy had led the the OBR year after year to cut its forecasts for economic growth, and to raise its forecasts for the deficit, for total government indebtedness, and for the scale of spending cuts needed to bring its finances back under control.In June 2010, the chancellor had expected that by 2014-15 the deficit would have fallen to £37bn. The latest revised OBR deficit now puts the figure at £108bn."

""This growing inequality isn't just morally wrong - it's bad economics.""Mr Obama put the wage stagnation and the ""decades-long erosion"" of middle-class security down to technological advances, globalisation, the declining power of labour unions, and the rise in tax incentives for corporations and the wealthy.But the president said America had seen a stronger economic recovery than other nations, crediting his administration's efforts to rescue the US automobile industry, overhaul the healthcare system, and invest in renewable energy.Mr Obama added that the US now produced more natural gas than any other country and that it would soon produce more oil than it imported. To encourage the recovery and create jobs, Mr Obama called for greater public investment in infrastructure and education. He said the US had to invest in infrastructure if it wanted to remain competitive in the global economy, quipping that many of America's bridges were old enough to collect public pensions.The president said that failure to restore equality of opportunity would be a ""betrayal of the American idea"".Mr Obama also appealed for a raise of the national minimum wage.The president devoted much of his address to criticism of the Republican Party, which controls the House of Representatives, holds enough votes in the Senate to block legislation, and has opposed virtually every item on his agenda.Referring to the Republicans, he said Washington had manufactured an ""endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals"", rather than address big issues.""Washington has taken its eye off the ball,"" he said. ""And I am here to say this needs to stop.""Ahead of Mr Obama's speech, Republicans launched their own offensive.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accused Democrats of ""just sitting on the sidelines and waiting to take their cues from the endless political road-shows the president cooks up whenever he feels like changing the topic"".And House Speaker John Boehner called the speech a ""hollow shell"".""It's an Easter egg with no candy in it.""The president will next travel to the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg. On Thursday he is to speak in Jacksonville, Florida.The string of speeches is intended to build support for Mr Obama's agenda ahead of a budget deadline in the autumn.

The former business secretary said arguments about the depth and speed of cuts were outdated and Labour should focus on how to rebuild the economy.To maximise its appeal, Labour must talk about extending prosperity as well as social justice, he added. Mr Balls declined to comment but Conservative MPs seized on the remarks.They have long argued that Labour have failed to put forward an alternative to the government's deficit reduction plan and would simply borrow more to pay for a short-term stimulus. In the wake of Wednesday's Budget - where growth forecasts were again slashed - Labour leader Ed Miliband and his shadow chancellor Ed Balls reiterated their call for the government to change direction, saying its measures were blunting growth and stalling efforts to cut borrowing. Lord Mandelson, a close ally of Tony Blair who backed Ed's brother David in the contest for the Labour leadership, has avoided personal criticism of the two men but has repeatedly attacked their strategy.He argues Labour needs to spell out its economic plans in more detail and say what it would do in power rather than just criticise the government. Speaking at a CBI dinner on Thursday, he said the ""whole argument about whether we are cutting too far and too fast"" was ""in the past"".""It is rather predictable party political stuff from over the dispatch box and it is a bit tiring to the public,"" he said.Instead, he said Labour must concentrate on the future shape of the economy after a prolonged squeeze on public spending and other austerity measures and how a long-term recovery could be sustained. And he added: ""If the Labour Party is going to go into the next election and fight it on social justice rather than economic transformation and prosperity, it will be limited in its appeal"". At the end of a week in which George Osborne's stewardship of the economy has been under fire, Conservative MPs took to Twitter to highlight Lord Mandelson's comments. ""Even Labour's former business secretary - a man who knows how to win elections - thinks Ed Balls is living in the past,"" said Dover MP Charlie Elphicke.""Labour have opposed every single saving this government is making to deal with the deficit, and are simply offering more of the same spending, borrowing and debt that got us into this mess in the first place.""Last month, Mr Miliband called for the restoration of the 10p tax band scrapped by Gordon Brown and a tax on properties worth more than £2m, his first significant tax pledges since being elected in 2010.

But the president's performance was not about winning an agreement but playing the blame game.The automatic and deliberately harsh spending cuts have come because the politicians are so far apart they cannot agree to a sensible way of balancing the books.Their dispute is simple and as old as the division between left and right.Mr Obama wants to deal with the deficit, in part, with tax rises (or to be precise, by closing tax loopholes). The Republican leader, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, insisted leaving the meeting that the president got his ""tax hikes"" in January, so now it was the time for spending cuts. Mr Boehner has a point - some Republicans pointed out at the time that they had thrown away their best bargaining chip. But Mr Boehner's low-key comments will hardly make headlines. The president's will. He claimed that he had won the election on this very argument and even Republican voters said that the rich should pay more.He said it was time for Republicans in Congress to catch up with their own voters and the American people.That is not how the American system works. But Mr Obama was as insistent today as he has been ever since 6 November - his election victory gives him a moral mandate and deprives the Republicans of theirs.He is determined to keep painting them as intransigent, uncaring and out of touch.Several conservative commentators seem delighted to help him out, portraying these deep cuts as rather a fine thing. The president's stated aim is to encourage public pressure on Congress and so free up moderate Republicans to do a deal. This would, by definition, deepen splits in a fractious and demoralised party only just beginning a debate about its own future.  He seems determined to define the Republicans before they can re-define themselves.Mr Obama may not have Jedi powers, but he knows how to kick a man when he is down.*It seems likely the president was getting the impressive mental powers of the Star Wars Jedi knights confused with the Vulcan mind meld in Star Trek. Mr Obama is sometimes compared to Star Trek's emotionless and hyper-rational protagonist Mr Spock, and I can imagine him, hand gripped to the head of an alien humanoid of a startling orange hue. Or would that be a Vulcan death grip? But perhaps the scoffers are wrong and the president is an ultra nerd, and was referring to the Jedi battle mind meld mentioned in several Star Wars novels."

US diplomatic meetings with North Korea have so far been limited and proven fruitless. In Seoul and Tokyo he will go over preparations to deal with North Korea's expected missile launch and explore ways to move beyond the crisis. But diplomatic prowess will be required in Mr Kerry's conversation with the Chinese in Beijing. Short of engaging North Korea directly itself, the US believes the best way forward is to get China to exert more influence on North Korea.""It's no secret that China has the most leverage, the most influence over North Korea,"" a senior state department official told reporters travelling with Mr Kerry. ""We want to see them use some of that leverage."" Washington has hoped for years that China would rein in its tempestuous, smaller neighbour and client state. American officials regularly convey their impression that the Chinese are getting frustrated with Pyongyang. But the frustration rarely translates into Chinese pressure over North Korea or even a public rebuke. American officials insist that their efforts to engage the Chinese on this issue have come a long way and are paying off.They point to the last round of sanctions imposed on North Korea in February, which China approved. Last week Chinese President Xi Jinping warned that ""no-one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains"", prompting renewed American hope that China's patience with North Korea was running out. Beijing appears increasingly concerned about the consequences of North Korea's behaviour on its own strategic interests in the region. ""We want to see them do what the Japanese do, what the South Koreans do, which is to stick to UN sanctions,"" the senior state department official said, ""and help stem the money trail to Pyongyang."" The secretary of state will also press on the Chinese that any engagement with the North Koreans must be clearly conditioned on de-nuclearisation.  On Thursday, South Korea appeared to soften its tone on North Korea, calling on Pyongyang to come to the dialogue table to resolve problems like the Kaesong industrial complex. There was no mention of de-nuclearisation and South Korea's Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae stopped short of a formal offer of dialogue. American officials were eager to dispel any impression that the US and South Korea were diverging on how to deal with North Korea. ""The South Koreans are prepared to move forward on small things, like some humanitarian assistance, if there are no further provocations,"" the state department official said. Any missile launch or other similar expected provocations seem already to be factored in. US officials praised South Korean President Park Geun-hye's handling of the crisis so far, saying they could not ""imagine how she could have done it better"". Mr Kerry will hold talks with Ms Park in Seoul. His experience and knowledge in this part of Asia is limited. A Vietnam war veteran who was later deeply involved in normalising relations with Hanoi, Mr Kerry did not focus much on North-East Asia during his 29 years as a senator on the foreign relations committee. Since starting his job as secretary of state in February, Mr Kerry has devoted most of his energy to the Middle East and has also indicated climate change is a priority for him - two intractable issues for different reasons. Despite the Korean crisis, Asia is still seen as an area of positive gains and co-operation for the Obama administration. In all three countries he will be visiting, Mr Kerry will find new leaders - Ms Park was inaugurated in February, Xi Jinping came into office in March and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power in December. Senior officials travelling with Mr Kerry said that the exchange with those leaders would not be burdened by perceptions of American decline, unlike during Hillary Clinton's maiden voyage to Asia as secretary of state in February 2009, in the midst of financial crisis. The investment in Asia during Mr Obama's first term and the work done by Ms Clinton over the last four years has bolstered American credibility and influence in Asia and set the stage for Mr Kerry to begin sketching out with allies in the region ""what we want to achieve over the next four years"". China's efforts to assert itself in the region over the last few years has pushed traditional American allies like Japan and South Korea - but also countries like Vietnam - closer to Washington. In a bitter irony for China, the unpredictable behaviour of its own ally, North Korea, means that the US will only continue to strengthen its position in Asia."

Mr Obama said his priority now was to make sure the website worked.As the deadline approached, the controversial HealthCare.gov site was taken down on Friday night for maintenance and upgrades to the software and hardware systems. It was due to go back online on Saturday morning.In an interview with ABC News, President Obama said he still believed his Affordable Care Act would make good on his manifesto promise to deliver affordable health care to Americans. ""I continue to believe and [I'm] absolutely convinced that, at the end of the day, people are going to look back at the work we've done to make sure that in this country you don't go bankrupt when you get sick, that families have that security,"" said President Obama. ""That is going be a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of."" Obamacare has come under constant fire from Republican party critics and many private health providers, who say it is too expensive and an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.But opposition intensified after a succession of technical glitches accompanied the launch of HealthCare.gov in October. Only 27,000 people were able to use the website to sign up in the first month, and there is still a backlog of Americans attempting to meet the deadline of 23 December to be guaranteed cover from 1 January 2014. According to an ABC News-Washington Post poll released last week, the president's job approval rating fell to 42%, down 13 percentage points this year and 6 points in the past month.But Mr Obama said he was used to difficult periods in his presidency.""The good thing about when you're down is that usually you got nowhere to go but up,"" he said.The problems with the website have forced Mr Obama to apologise for ""fumbling the ball"" by not delivering a more successful launch, while Republicans have accused the president of breaking his promises. Seated alongside his wife Michelle, Mr Obama referred to criticism that he had appeared not to be aware of the extent of problems with the website, which his administration has promised to deal with by the end of November.""We're evaluating why it is exactly that I didn't know soon enough that [it] wasn't going to work the way it needed to,"" Mr Obama said. ""But my priority now has been to just make sure that it works.""  In the interview with ABC News's Barbara Walters, being aired in the United States at 22:00 EST, Mr Obama also suggested that his family may stay in Washington after the end of his second term, due in part to considerations of the continuing education of his daughter Sasha."
2710	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24751202	Opinion	1	Healthcare	Elections	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Voters in the US state of Virginia go to the polls on Tuesday for a new governor. So why does it matter to anyone else?Only one in three people voted when Republican Bob McDonnell became Virginia's 71st governor in 2009. That's fewer than two million people.So the contest to become his successor might not seem like a battle of national, even international, importance. But the result of Tuesday's election - between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Ken Cuccinelli - will have implications far beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains and Chesapeake Bay.It's a key swing state, closely contested in presidential elections, but it's a different electorate who make the effort to vote in these kinds of elections. In fact, for 36 years, whichever political party holds the White House has lost the governor's seat a year later. There's a theory that presidential candidates are at an advantage when campaigning in a state with a friendly governor, but it didn't help Mitt Romney win the state in 2012. So why is this election important?1. It could shape Republican identityIn Virginia, the Republicans have put forward a candidate closely allied to the Tea Party, the group that other members of the party have blamed for the recent government shutdown.National Republicans should be really worried if McAuliffe wins, says Craig Brians, professor of political science at Virginia Tech. ""They could be thinking: 'This is perhaps the second time in a month that people associated with the Tea Party have really hurt us and we need to rethink things.' ""At some point, the national Republican party needs to decide: 'Are we going to be a majority party or go to the right, stake out that ground and maybe never hold national office again.'""The emergence of a third-party candidate polling at double-figures, libertarian Robert Sarvis, reflects the fissures within the Republican party, says John Avlon, author of Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe is Hijacking America. Libertarians traditionally vote Republican, he says, but many have been put off by Cuccinelli's extreme social conservatism. 2. There's a Hillary factorBoth Clintons have helped McAuliffe, who was co-chairman of the former president's re-election campaign and chairman of his wife's 2008 presidential campaign.""Terry McAuliffe is a really old friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton so the fact that they would come and help him campaign is not surprising. But they are not super popular in Virginia so the fact he brought them here is interesting, in the sense that Hillary is keeping her hand in, simply by being part of it and keeping her face in it,"" says Brians.With Hillary braced to run in 2016, a McAuliffe win would be interpreted as a boost for her, he adds, because such a divisive figure inflicted no fundamental damage to his campaign.Writing in the National Review, conservative blogger Jim Geraghty goes even further and suggests it's been a dry run for the Hillary campaign machine.3. It's what the US is going to look likeThe demographics in Virginia are changing in the same way as they are across the country - a growing Hispanic and Asian population, and more people in urban areas.""It's a microcosm of what's happening nationally,"" says Dustin Cable of the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, especially in southern cities like Atlanta and Raleigh. The northern Virginia suburbs are a Mecca for young college-educated professionals, he says, many of them federal employees working in Washington DC.These groups have helped Obama win two elections but it's not yet clear how these shifts will play out in elections that historically have older, white voters, says Cable. 4. Effects on ObamacareSupporters and opponents of the highly controversial Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature law that aims to extend health insurance coverage, will be watching Virginia.Cuccinelli has led the battle against Obamacare in the state, says Brians. If he fails, people could infer that voters in Virginia are in favour of Obamacare. The present governor, Republican Bob McDonnell, has said no to expanding Medicaid and no to running a state insurance exchange. McAuliffe has said he will reverse both those if he wins.""That will make a huge difference in one of the biggest issues of the campaign,"" says Brians.5. It's provided comedy fodderWhen Ken Cuccinelli proposed outlawing sodomy and oral sex, he immediately earned national coverage on The View and The Daily Show, as the likes of Whoopi Goldberg and Jon Stewart ripped into him.His opponent, Terry McAuliffe, was not spared either. At a debate, he was asked by the Daily Show if he thought his image had improved from debilitating to moderate revulsion.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook"
2737	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24671677	News	1	International News	Elections	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	Votes are being counted in the Czech Republic after an election aimed at electing a new government after months without a proper administration.The last elected government collapsed in June amid a corruption scandal.A subsequent attempt to form a caretaker government failed because it could not win a vote of confidence.Opinion polls suggest the Social Democrats will take about 25% and win, but it is not clear if they will be able to form a stable coalition. Polling took place over a period of two days.If they win, the Social Democrats may team up with the Communists, who - opinion polls suggest - are on about 18%. Otherwise, Social Democrat leader Bohuslav Sobotka may try to survive in a minority government.In third place is a new party led by billionaire businessman Andrej Babis.He may be another coalition option for the Social Democrats, many of whom are dismayed at the prospect of helping the Communists back to power two decades after they were forced out.Support for the centre-right has collapsed since the coalition formed by Petr Necas after the 2010 elections imploded.His government fell as the result of a corruption and abuse-of-power scandal involving the prime minister's chief-of-staff.Czechs had also tired of its austerity programme, amid an 18-month recession that ended earlier this year.Another factor in the election is the role of President Milos Zeman.A former member of the Social Democrats, he has fallen out with the party.Critics fear that if the election result is inconclusive, he may take advantage to pursue his alleged goal of moving power from parliament to the presidency.One opponent, artist David Cerny, made his protest visible this week by floating a huge purple middle finger along the Vltava river in front of the presidential castle.What is at stake here is not only the search for stability after the spectacular demise of Petr Necas's centre-right government, says the BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague.The election is also a referendum on the established political parties - right and left - who have governed this country in various constellations for 20 years, our correspondent says. They are asking for another chance; a crowd of colourful newcomers are clamouring to be let in, he says. 
2740	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24416480	News	0	International News	Elections	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"In a major political realignment in Brazil, the former senator and Environment Minister Marina Silva has joined the Brazilian Socialist Party.The popular environmentalist joined the Socialists after failing to officially register her new party. The Socialist Party is headed by the state governor of Pernambuco and presidential hopeful Eduardo Campos, who also boasts high approval ratings. Brazilians will choose a successor to President Dilma Rousseff in a year.While Mr Campos is expected to be the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Ms Silva's role in the ticket is not yet clear. Ms Silva's announcement came after more than a day of intense negotiations.Her Sustainability Network was 50,000 signatures short of the 492,000 required by Brazilian law to be officially registered.Late on Thursday, Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court rejected an appeal to consider about 100,000 signatures that had been considered invalid.As the country's legislation requires potential candidates to be affiliated to a party one year before running for an election, Ms Silva had to join a party until Saturday in order to keep her presidential hopes alive. At an event in the capital, Brasilia, Ms Silva and her closest allies of the Sustainability Network joined the Socialist Party.The former Amazon activist joked that hers was the ""first clandestine party founded in democracy"".""This is a historic re-alignment, burying once and for all the old republic,"" Ms Silva said.The president of Socialist Party, which counts former Brazil striker and current federal deputy Romario among its ranks, also said the alliance was ""historic"".Mr Campos, whose government of the north-eastern state of Pernambuco has one of the country's highest approval ratings, also said the move broke a ""false polarisation"" in Brazilian politics. ""Those who understood what happened on the streets in June [during Brazil's massive protests], won't find it hard to understand what is happening here,"" he told a crowd in Brasilia.Ms Silva came third with nearly 20m votes in her 2010 presidential bid. Recent opinion polls show her trailing only President Rousseff, while Mr Campos has about 4% support.Political analysts are divided as to what impact the alliance could have, with some arguing it will create a more united opposition front, threatening Ms Rousseff's re-election plans, while others say it could actually disappoint potential Marina Silva voters.Ms Silva served as an environment minister for five years, before stepping down in 2008, citing disagreements with the government.Since her surprising success in 2010 as the Brazilian Green Party's presidential candidate, she has seen her political influence grow, even though she left the party a year later."

2758	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21379192	News	0	International News	Elections	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Religious radicals, right-wing politicians and some elements in the security services are increasingly harassing non-governmental organisations (NGOs), human rights workers and other civil society groups, even as Pakistan enters into a delicate political phase with polls imminent, writes author Ahmed Rashid.The space for NGOs and civil society workers appears to be shrinking as they receive threats, several have been killed and others forced to go into hiding. There appears to be less protection for NGO workers at a time they are badly needed as the state fails to carry out basic functions such as education and health care. At the same time there is growing intolerance in society as the use of violence and weapons to address grievances rather than courts of law is on the increase. At least 19 male and female officials working with a countrywide children's polio immunisation campaign have been killed by the Taliban and other Islamic radicals since last July. The worst incident took place in December when five health workers were shot dead by militants in different parts of the country. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the killings, with Mr Ban saying they were ""cruel, senseless, and inexcusable"". But nobody has been caught and the government appears paralysed - unable to prevent further killings.In a worrying development this year, policemen escorting polio teams are now being deliberately targeted. The vaccination drive remains partially suspended in two of Pakistan's four provinces - Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) - and despite the deployment of security forces, there is no indication when the vaccination drive can be completed. Last October the young but prominent educationalist Malala Yousafzai was attacked in her school bus and had to be flown to England for a series of operations. Her attackers were self-proclaimed Pakistani Taliban. Malala, who is only 14, has become an international celebrity and has now been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, but it is still not safe for her to come home. Asma Jahangir, the country's leading human rights lawyer and women's rights advocate, has been forced to respond to a campaign launched by right-wing politicians such as Imran Khan and religious leaders who have called her unsuitable to become the caretaker prime minister when parliament is dissolved.  In reality, no political party has nominated her for the job and it is only the speculative Pakistani media that has suggested her. She has several times refuted claims that she would ever be a candidate for such a job and yet she continues to be attacked by political parties. On 6 February she delivered a blistering rebuttal to Imran Khan, describing his statement against her as ""illogical but also vicious"", saying that he seems to be acting on the cue of the ""establishment"" which is shorthand for the army. His PTI party responded by ""taking note"" of her comments, reasserting their belief she is not suitable for the job and accusing her of bias against the party.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its representative in Pakistan, Ali Dayan Hasan, have been accused by the army of maligning Pakistan in a recent report, which the army described as ""a pack of lies, propaganda-driven and totally biased"". A statement by the media wing of the military said that HRW was trying to add fuel to ""ongoing sectarian violence"" in Pakistan. The military has never before used such language. It was responding to HRW's World Report 2013, a 665-page annual tome which covers human rights in every country in the world and is compiled in New York. The report said ""the security and intelligence services"" have ""continued to allow extremist groups to attack religious minorities"". It also said Pakistan's human rights worsened in 2012 and the military perpetrated ""abuses with impunity in Balochistan"".In fact, such charges against the security forces have been made repeatedly over the years by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, local media groups and other local and international human rights groups such as Amnesty International and the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.  In March 2012, the Supreme Court issued a stern warning to military intelligence services not to overstep their writ, with Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudry saying: ""Who gave you the right to hound people?""In 2012, more than 400 Shias, most of them belonging to the Hazara community of Balochistan, were killed in targeted attacks by Sunni militants. So far this year, more than 100 Shia Hazaras have been killed. No culprits have been arrested and the Hazaras are now fleeing Pakistan en masse as the government provides no relief.Meanwhile some 800 schools have been closed down in KP province and the Federal Administered Tribal Areas because of attacks by militants, while hundreds of primary schools are shut in Balochistan because of violence. Teachers have fled these areas and NGOs dealing with health and education have reduced their operations because of security threats. Farida Afridi, a prominent activist working with tribal women in KP province, was shot dead in July 2012. In January 2013 gunmen shot dead seven aid workers including six women working with ""Support with Working Solutions"", a local NGO in KP province. The culprits have not been found.Foreign aid workers are not immune. A British Muslim doctor working for the International Committee for the Red Cross, Khalil Dale, was kidnapped and then killed in April 2012. More than 60 foreign aid workers left Pakistan in 2012, largely because of security concerns or the refusal of the authorities to renew their visas. Suspicions against foreign NGOs have increased substantially after an unethical ruse by the US Central Intelligence Agency to try to kill Osama bin Laden, by using a fake NGO to try to obtain his blood sample. In the next few months, general elections are expected to be held. But there is a grave political crisis with some parties wanting to delay the elections and the ruling party accusing unnamed dark forces of conspiring to do this. If elections are held, civil society groups are expected to be at the forefront of monitoring the polls, as they have done for past elections. However, the lack of protection for NGOs, the inability or refusal of the state machinery to protect them and the growing intolerance of their neutral stance is dismaying many."
2763	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22922141	News	1	International News	Elections	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The victory of reformist-backed figure Hassan Rouhani in Iran's 14 June presidential election has a number of uncomfortable messages for the country's ruling right-wing establishment. Mr Rouhani was not the reformists' first, or even the second, choice of candidate. Most had pinned their hopes on former President Mohammad Khatami, but he did not put his name forward. The reformists then looked to the pragmatic veteran politician Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, who was disqualified from standing by Iran's top election body, the Guardian Council. And when Mohammad Reza Aref, the only reformist candidate in the running, withdrew earlier this week in favour of Mr Rouhani, the reformists reached a consensus and threw their weight behind him.His victory in the first round - when he unexpectedly gained 50.7% of the votes in a turnout of over 72% - has certainly emboldened the reform movement. After four years of seeing their leaders placed under house arrest, many of them imprisoned and their media outlets curtailed, they sense that voters have given them a mandate for change.This is despite the fact that Mr Rouhani is seen as more of a ""moderate, centrist"" figure, rather than a ""true"" reformer in the vein of Green movement leaders Mir Hussein Mousavi  and Mehdi Karroubi, who are both under house arrest. The downbeat mood of the ""principle-ist"" - or conservative ruling coalition - is evident by the tone of their media. Tabnak news agency, which is affiliated to defeated principle-ist candidate Mohsen Rezai, set the agenda.An online editorial appearing a day after the poll and before the final outcome was announced, spoke of the 2013 presidential election as a ""necessary defeat for the principle-ists"".""The principle-ists must understand that they must be accountable and answerable,"" said the editorial. ""The principle-ists... must know that the era of monopolizing the media has ended.""The hardline Javan newspaper chose to put a gloss on the affair, concentrating on the reported high turnout. ""The Iranian nation, with its epic presence at polling stations, proved it has a strong bond with the Islamic system and again disappointed and defeated the enemy. This election, irrespective of the result, should be considered as a model for correcting the current political behaviour of groups and political activists."" The conservatives had assumed an easy ride. Apart from controlling all branches of state power, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) and virtually all the mainstream media, they have the ear of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So Mr Rouhani's outright victory must come as somewhat of a shock to the hardliners. It demonstrates that the pro-reformists have returned to Iran's political arena and are a still force to be reckoned with.""Moderation over extremism""Mr Rouhani himself seems to acknowledge the significance of the support he received from reformers in initial comments after his win. He called it a ""victory of moderation over extremism"", but warned that there would be ""no overnight solutions"" to Iran's many problems.He has also extended the hand of cooperation to Iran's establishment, pledging to work closely with the conservative-dominated parliament in his first meeting with Speaker Ali Larijani. Both camps await his first encounter with the press corps on Monday, when he can expect specific questions on the economy, the nuclear issue and Syria.But the question remains: Will the hardline establishment recognise the message of change that the electorate have sent them?"

He likened his main rival candidate, Henrique Capriles, to Spanish conquerors fighting indigenous people in the 16th Century.A centuries-old curse, he said, would fall on those who did not vote for him.Mr Capriles responded by saying the only curse for Venezuelans would be if Mr Maduro won the election. The country goes to the polls next Sunday to elect a successor to Hugo Chavez, the long-time leftist leader who died of cancer last month.Opinion polls suggest Mr Maduro, who was Chavez's deputy, has a lead of at least 10 points over his rival.Wearing a local indigenous hat at a rally in Amazonas state, a largely jungle territory on the borders of Brazil and Colombia, Mr Maduro said: ""If anyone among the people votes against Nicolas Maduro, he is voting against himself, and the curse of Maracapana is falling on him.""He was referring to a 16th Century battle when Spanish colonial fighters defeated indigenous fighters decisively.""If the bourgeoisie win, they are going to privatise health and education, they are going to take land from the Indians, the curse of Maracapana would come on you,"" the candidate continued.Analysts say that Venezuela's mix of Catholic and animist beliefs, especially in the south-central plains and jungles, is fertile ground for talk of spirits and curses which may otherwise seem out of place in an election campaign. Mr Capriles dismissed the election favourite's rhetoric.""Anyone who threatens the people, who tells the people a curse can fall on them, has no right to govern this country,"" he said at a rally in the western state of Tachira.""I tell you here, all Venezuelans, the real curse is that little group that we are going to get rid of on April 14.""There are five other candidates for the presidency but they trail far behind Mr Maduro and Mr Capriles."

For a political party struggling to survive, the choice of a huge Athens stadium for its annual congress was probably a bad one. A few thousand loyal supporters gathered, but the tens of thousands of vacant seats spoke of a party nearing oblivion.The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) has dominated the Greek political scene for more than three decades. It soared to power in 1981. The dictatorship had just ended here; Pasok created a welfare state, transforming Greece into a modern, European country.But today it languishes at around 6% in the polls, widely reviled for corruption and for accepting hated austerity while in power in 2009. At the congress, it still inspires some loyal supporters. ""The party has been misrepresented,"" says Panagiotis Alamanas. ""Any government would have had to cut wages and pensions. Everyone is trying to accuse Pasok of all the mistakes Greece made in the past 40 years.""""It is really difficult to explain to someone today that you support Pasok,"" admits Marina Mithou, a student. ""It's like a dirty word. But we will try to revive it.""For now Pasok is on life support as part of the coalition government. But few expect it can truly rise again. At its height, it was backed by almost half the Greek electorate under the adored leadership of Andreas Papandreou.""He was a genius,"" recalls Sifis Valirakis, one of the founding members. ""Pasok was a love affair. It was about a dream of freedom, democracy and a better future.""The 70-year-old pauses, his smile fading. ""But I feel a little disappointed, because the dream was not realised as we expected. We have a country bankrupt, corrupt and not functioning as it should.""Is Pasok to blame, I ask?""Among others, yes. It is no longer the party we fell in love with.""Pasok modernised Greece, enriched it, but then mismanaged it. The country racked up vast debts while Pasok and the centre-right New Democracy alternated in power. Both parties have been shaken by corruption and clientelism.""Pasok isn't to blame for everything that went wrong here,"" says political commentator Pavlos Tsimas, ""but being the natural party of government for over three decades, it is now being punished"".The party is criticised for sowing the seeds of future problems by building a bloated public sector based on patronage. Tens of thousands of jobs were created in state companies and then given to Pasok members: a system that continued under New Democracy.The notion of meritocracy was pushed aside as senior positions in universities and local councils became party appointees. Public construction licences were often decided on the basis of political support, with MPs lining their pockets through kickbacks. Corruption blossomed - even Andreas Papandreou himself went on trial in 1991 accused of embezzlement. He was narrowly acquitted.But Pavlos Tsimas says that the investment Pasok made in the country was essential, despite the extravagant way it was handled.""When Pasok took over, Greece was not a European state,"" he says. ""It had no public services to speak of. Pasok installed the national health system and free education. So it was a shock to its voters when the party of the welfare state suddenly said it was cutting pensions, salaries and jobs.""The collapse of Pasok has gone hand-in-hand with the decline of the Greece it created. And with it has fallen the once omnipotent Papandreou dynasty: George senior, Andreas and George junior were all prime ministers here, the former leading a party that preceded Pasok. Nepotism has long had a grip on Greek politics.But in their family village of Kalentzi in the Peloponnese, the name is still held high. The tiny community of 600 people nestles in the mountains, overlooking a lush valley. In George Papandreou Square, an iron statue of Andreas faces another of his father, George senior. The Papandreou home has become a cafe. Inside, I meet a cousin, Vasilis Stavropoulos. ""The Papandreous are a great political family,"" he says proudly. ""But perhaps democracy shouldn't be about dynasties.""Maria Leventi remembers the Papandreous fondly. ""All of them are beloved here,"" she tells me, ""because they gave us a better life when we were poor. They gave us the money to buy food and clothes. We could buy four televisions for one house, four cars for one family,"" she adds with a smile.Did they make Greece feel richer than it actually was, I ask?""Yes - a little,"" she confesses.So what is replacing Pasok's Social Democracy? The answer is clear in nearby Patras. The city was always a party stronghold. But in last year's election, it ditched Pasok for the first time, backing the new anti-bailout leftists, Syriza. Its leader is often compared to Andreas Papandreou for his firebrand rhetoric.Alexandros Liakopoulos and his family were among those who switched sides. Former staunch Pasok supporters, they are now suffering as many Greeks are, with two family members out of work and his mother's pension slashed by 60%.""Now the party has destroyed our national identity, our social and business environment. It has destroyed everything,"" Alexandros says.Would the Liakopoulos family ever return to Pasok?""Of course not. It's a corpse.""One of Europe's leading left-wing parties has fallen far. Its destiny has been tied to that of Greece: a confident European nation that has now lost its way. Pasok dreamed of a different legacy, to be remembered for its considerable early achievements. But instead it has become the political victim of a crisis it helped create. And one which might bring it down for good. "

Panama's vice-president and a former ally of outgoing President Ricardo Martinelli, Mr Varela won a clear majority and easily defeated the president's hand-picked successor, Jose Domingo Arias. Mr Varela leads the conservative Panamenista Party and helped Mr Martinelli get elected in 2009. But the two had a bitter falling out in 2011, when Mr Varela was fired from his job as foreign minister. He subsequently became one of Mr Martinelli's fiercest critics, accusing his government of corruption. Mr Varela, aged 50, is the scion of one of Panama's richest families and studied engineering in the United States. He is likely to continue many of Mr Martinelli's economic policies, but says he will focus on helping the poor and reducing inequality.

This was a reference to Mr Raisi, who is not overly impressed by the nuclear deal President Rouhani reached with world powers - a deal which removed a serious threat of war hanging over the country. President Rouhani is keen to see the nuclear deal survive - even though US President Donald Trump and opponents of the deal in the United States Congress are looking for ways to put further pressure on Iran, or even scrap the deal. Mr Rouhani also promised to revive the sluggish economy, to extend individual and political freedoms, to steer the country away from the extremist ideas of the hardliners, to ensure equality for men and women, to extend access to internet and generally work for moderations and an outward-looking Iran.  Time and again, he praised the reform movement in Iran and its leaders - something that is likely to bring him into constant clashes with the hardliners in his second term. He was re-elected in May 2017 with an emphatic margin of victory.Hassan Rouhani has been a key player in Iran's political life since the revolution in 1979.He was an influential figure in Iran's defence establishment during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and subsequently held several important political posts.From 1989 to 2005, Mr Rouhani was secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), the top decision-making body in Iran, appointed by and answerable to the Supreme Leader. He served as deputy speaker of parliament between 1996 and 2000 (while simultaneously completing a thesis on Sharia - Islamic law - as a post-graduate student at Glasgow Caledonian University) and in 1997 became a member of the Expediency Council, the highest arbitration body on issues of legislation.Mr Rouhani was Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, from 2003 to 2005, earning the moniker ""the diplomat sheikh"", when he agreed to suspend uranium enrichment. He resigned from the SNSC and from his role leading the nuclear talks just weeks after the election of the combative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, amid sharp differences with the new president.When Mr Rouhani stood as a presidential candidate in 2013, he knew he was up against an establishment stacked with hardliners who were highly suspicious of him. His campaign slogan ""moderation and prudence"" resonated with many Iranians who had seen their living standards, and their country's reputation, plummet under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Although he was seen as part of the establishment, Mr Rouhani promised to relieve sanctions, improve civil rights and restore ""the dignity of the nation"" - and drew large crowds on the campaign trail.Many believe he was not the first choice of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But seeing that he might offer a way to end the nuclear confrontation with big world powers without destabilising the whole system, Mr Khamenei backed Mr Rouhani. Within weeks of taking office in 2013, Mr Rouhani spoke on the phone to US President Barack Obama - the first direct contact at the highest level between Iran and the US since the 1979 revolution.The conversation paved the way for historic open and direct talks between Iran and the US, as well as with other world powers. After assuming office himself in 2013, Mr Rouhani got the Supreme Leader to allow the foreign ministry, rather than the SNSC, to take charge of nuclear negotiations with the West, and appointed his Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to lead the talks. The sight of Mr Zarif and US Secretary of State John Kerry taking a stroll around Lake Geneva just outside the venue of nuclear talks, chatting and joking together, would once have seemed extraordinary.But as the negotiations progressed, it became almost commonplace.From the outset Mr Rouhani had cautioned that there would be ""no overnight solutions"" to Iran's many problems. The nuclear deal ensured that many sanctions against Iran were lifted, but the benefits of this have been slow in coming for many Iranians. Ordinary Iranians say they have not felt it in their day-to-day lives. The economy remains sluggish, and desperately needed foreign investment has been far slower than had been expected.  Mr Rouhani had pledged to help free reformist opposition leaders, held without trial since 2011, but the hardliners have stood firm and they remain under house arrest.He also promised to usher in an era of more freedoms in a country where human rights abuses are rife. However, few believe there has been much improvement here, and in some areas the situation may have worsened. There are still many journalists and opposition activists in jail, and the number of executions carried out in Iran has soared. Censorship in the media has not eased under Mr Rouhani, although in one of his key speeches as president he told state media chiefs that Islam could tolerate a lot more than state TV allows its viewers. Iran's internet also remains tightly controlled, forcing many to use proxy servers to circumvent the restrictions in a country whose internet speeds rank among the lowest in the world. "

The Socialist Party is headed by the state governor of Pernambuco and presidential hopeful Eduardo Campos, who also boasts high approval ratings. Brazilians will choose a successor to President Dilma Rousseff in a year.While Mr Campos is expected to be the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Ms Silva's role in the ticket is not yet clear. Ms Silva's announcement came after more than a day of intense negotiations.Her Sustainability Network was 50,000 signatures short of the 492,000 required by Brazilian law to be officially registered.Late on Thursday, Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court rejected an appeal to consider about 100,000 signatures that had been considered invalid.As the country's legislation requires potential candidates to be affiliated to a party one year before running for an election, Ms Silva had to join a party until Saturday in order to keep her presidential hopes alive. At an event in the capital, Brasilia, Ms Silva and her closest allies of the Sustainability Network joined the Socialist Party.The former Amazon activist joked that hers was the ""first clandestine party founded in democracy"".""This is a historic re-alignment, burying once and for all the old republic,"" Ms Silva said.The president of Socialist Party, which counts former Brazil striker and current federal deputy Romario among its ranks, also said the alliance was ""historic"".Mr Campos, whose government of the north-eastern state of Pernambuco has one of the country's highest approval ratings, also said the move broke a ""false polarisation"" in Brazilian politics. ""Those who understood what happened on the streets in June [during Brazil's massive protests], won't find it hard to understand what is happening here,"" he told a crowd in Brasilia.Ms Silva came third with nearly 20m votes in her 2010 presidential bid. Recent opinion polls show her trailing only President Rousseff, while Mr Campos has about 4% support.Political analysts are divided as to what impact the alliance could have, with some arguing it will create a more united opposition front, threatening Ms Rousseff's re-election plans, while others say it could actually disappoint potential Marina Silva voters.Ms Silva served as an environment minister for five years, before stepping down in 2008, citing disagreements with the government.Since her surprising success in 2010 as the Brazilian Green Party's presidential candidate, she has seen her political influence grow, even though she left the party a year later."

""Unless he is instructing all Tory councils and Tory councillors not to take an increase in allowances, then his words are just meaningless posturing."" Elsewhere in the report it said other issues facing local councillors included an increasing workload and difficulties in getting the time needed off work.Mr Betts said: ""Few councillors will vote themselves higher allowances, even if there is a legitimate reason for doing so, because it provokes so much public controversy.""Councils should be given the power to transfer decisions about allowances to independent local bodies.""It would be inconsistent for Parliament to deny councils the option it has chosen for the determination of its own pay and conditions."""

They lead the so-called Republican hawks who believe limited strikes are not enough, but their comments when they emerged left little doubt they are now in tow.On Tuesday it was the turn of House Speaker John Boehner to get a private audience, along with other chairmen and ranking members from the national security committees.

Polling took place over a period of two days.If they win, the Social Democrats may team up with the Communists, who - opinion polls suggest - are on about 18%. Otherwise, Social Democrat leader Bohuslav Sobotka may try to survive in a minority government.In third place is a new party led by billionaire businessman Andrej Babis.He may be another coalition option for the Social Democrats, many of whom are dismayed at the prospect of helping the Communists back to power two decades after they were forced out.Support for the centre-right has collapsed since the coalition formed by Petr Necas after the 2010 elections imploded.His government fell as the result of a corruption and abuse-of-power scandal involving the prime minister's chief-of-staff.Czechs had also tired of its austerity programme, amid an 18-month recession that ended earlier this year.Another factor in the election is the role of President Milos Zeman.A former member of the Social Democrats, he has fallen out with the party.Critics fear that if the election result is inconclusive, he may take advantage to pursue his alleged goal of moving power from parliament to the presidency.One opponent, artist David Cerny, made his protest visible this week by floating a huge purple middle finger along the Vltava river in front of the presidential castle.What is at stake here is not only the search for stability after the spectacular demise of Petr Necas's centre-right government, says the BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague.The election is also a referendum on the established political parties - right and left - who have governed this country in various constellations for 20 years, our correspondent says. They are asking for another chance; a crowd of colourful newcomers are clamouring to be let in, he says.

2920	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24388669	News	1	Republican Scandals	Elections	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	bbc.co.uk	"John Boehner has spent most of his House speakership trying to keep the various factions of his Republican majority together. With the recent government shutdown crisis, Boehner's ability to manage his caucus is once again being tested.On 26 September, the US was days away from a deadline to pass legislation funding the government. A small group of House Republicans gathered to plot strategy on a conference call with Texas Senator Ted Cruz.According to a report in the National Review, the congressmen - some of the most conservative in Washington - asked Mr Cruz for advice on how to respond to House Speaker John Boehner's proposal to keep the government open. They hoped to tie it to the uphill battle of defunding President Obama's health care reform. The first-term senator, a darling of the conservative Tea Party movement that gained prominence opposing Obamacare in 2010, told them to oppose it. The Republicans took the message to the floor of the House, and the speaker's plan died that evening without a vote. Five days later, Mr Boehner was throwing all his efforts behind the drive to end Obamacare, and the government was shuttered.House rank and file organising against a leadership position - conspiring with a junior member of the Senate, no less - would have been unthinkable in previous congresses. But this was only the most recent example of the ongoing problem Mr Boehner has had controlling his party caucus. The rebellious faction hails from solidly conservative, mostly rural areas across the country. They've been called the ""weird caucus"" by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the ""suicide caucus"" by Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, in reference to a disregard for their party's survival. They sometimes refer to themselves as ""wacko birds"", adopting as their own the derisive label given to them by Republican Senator John McCain. Time and again - in national security debates, immigration reform, disaster relief, defence authorisations, and even agriculture appropriations - Mr Boehner has found his position undermined by these rebellious legislators. Buoyed by the Tea Party, the backbenchers are unswayed by the kinds of carrots and sticks that kept their predecessors in line. This group includes Justin Amash of Michigan - who has voted against his party's leadership 126 times, more than any other Republican House member. At the end of last year, he was one of four Republican congressmen stripped of committee seats because of political apostasy. Undeterred, on 24 July he bucked leadership once again. He led efforts to curtail drastically the warrantless surveillance programme of the National Security Agency (NSA), which failed by only 12 votes. Steve King of Iowa is another thorn in Mr Boehner's side, working all year to round up votes to block a bipartisan immigration reform bill passed by the Senate - if it comes to the floor of the House. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana helped kill a leadership-backed agriculture bill because it contained funding for food stamps. Scott Rigell of Virginia was one of the first to demand that a reluctant Mr Boehner call the House back from recess in August to vote on strikes against Syria. Paul Broun of Georgia, who is currently running for a Senate seat, said he would not vote for legislation that ""does not fit the Judeo-Christian biblical principles that our country was founded on"". He has voted against House leadership 84 times, including on a January bill to provide disaster aid for Hurricane Sandy victims.""The thing that's different about these Republicans is their unwillingness to bargain,"" says Vanderbilt University public policy professor Bruce Oppenheimer. ""I'm not sure if it's because they lack government experience or they've made such strong promises to their constituencies, but they've put their feet in cement and can't or won't move.""Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker looked at their congressional districts and found that, wacko or not, these representatives are reflecting the will of the voters who sent them to Washington, a decidedly different demographic than America at large.They ""represent an America where the population is getting whiter, where there are few major cities, where Obama lost the last election in a landslide, and where the Republican Party is becoming more dominant and more popular,"" he wrote. ""Meanwhile, in national politics, each of these trends is actually reversed.""In effect, writes Philip Bump in the Atlantic, there is a third party - with Mr Cruz as its leader - forming in Congress to the right of the Republican Party. This has forced Mr Boehner to operate more like the tolerant head of a coalition government than an iron-fisted speaker of a past era, who could make or break a politician's career at will. These challenges to Republican leadership will likely continue as long as party members fear a primary opponent from their right more than general election defeat or punishment from the House leadership. Recent Republican-led reforms have limited the leadership's ability to dole out appropriations to reward loyalty, and the power of the Republican establishment to protect its chosen candidates has waned.The ""weird caucus"" is only a small segment of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, but it represents the spear tip of the restive Tea Party base. Its support, or approbation, can mean the difference between a clear field in the next round of primary elections or a battle for political survival.""Although very few Republicans have been defeated in primaries, there's always concern among some that if they don't at least toe the line, someone will fund a challenger,"" Mr Oppenheimer says. ""It's like a monster in the closet or under the bed for them. Of course, sometimes there really are monsters in the closet."""

They include FedEx chief executive Frederick Smith.Money for the trust would come out of revenues from federal leases on current offshore drilling. The US government collects more than $6bn a year from production on federal lands and waters.Unlike the business group's proposal, the White House says it will not require the expansion of drilling.The fund would be used to sponsor research for technologies such as electric-car batteries, bio-fuels, natural gas or other non-oil fuel sources.In a bid to make it attractive to both parties, Mr Obama has argued that such a trust would not only be good environmental policy, but also a job-creation programme that would keep the US a technology leader.But a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said Mr Obama needs to expand drilling to get the support of the House's top Republican.""For this proposal to even be plausible, oil and gas leasing on federal land would need to increase dramatically,"" said the spokesman, Brendan Buck. On his way to Argonne, Mr Obama's motorcade passed protesters demonstrating against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport oil from Canada's tar sands to US Gulf Coast refineries. Republicans have pilloried Mr Obama's administration for delaying approval of the Keystone pipeline.White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters new investments in green energy technology were more important for easing the effects of climate change than whether or not the controversial pipeline gets built.During his first term, Mr Obama's administration invested $90bn of stimulus money into green energy projects.But the high-profile failure of California solar panel maker Solyndra, which had received $527m of government money, became a political cudgel for Republicans to bash the White House."

BBC Scotland has learned a pair of the birds have raised a male chick, after nesting at a secret location in Fife.The country's last native white-tailed eagle was shot in Shetland in 1918.The species only returned to the UK following a reintroduction project in the west of Scotland, which began on the Isle of Rum in 1975.Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse welcomed the news.""I hope this will be the first of many of this magnificent species, which will eventually spread their territories right across Scotland,"" he said.""I'd like to thank all the partners who have played their part in making this exciting and special event happen.""The east coast reintroduction project involved RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Commission Scotland, with financial support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Fife and Rural Tayside Leader programme.A total of 85 young white-tailed eagles taken from nests in Norway were released in Fife between 2007 and 2012.The pair which bred this summer were both released in 2009.Stuart Housden, director of RSPB Scotland, said: ""This success further strengthens the strong bond we have formed with the people of Norway, who kindly gifted birds for release in Scotland throughout the reintroduction process, which started over 30 years ago on the west coast.""We owe a great deal to the project staff, farmers, landowners, partners and, of course, the general public, for their support and enthusiasm.""The reintroduction of white-tailed eagles to Scotland has attracted criticism from some farmers and crofters, worried about the impact the birds could have on their lambs.Andrew Stevenson, of Scottish Natural Heritage, said: ""We are working with the National Farmers' Union in Scotland and the Scottish Crofters' Federation to manage any incidents which do occur.""In the east, it's very early days, we only have one breeding pair, but we will take any problems which do take place very seriously.""BBC Scotland revealed in June that police were investigating allegations that a white-tailed eagle nest had been destroyed on an estate in Angus.RSPB Scotland has asked members of the public to email reports of white-tailed eagle sightings on the east coast to eastscotlandseaeagles@rspb.org.uk."

The Chancellor insisted that a decision on 2030 should be delayed until 2016 at the earliest  (after the election) but many Lib Dem and Conservative MPs are expected to join Labour in voting for an amendment to introduce the target immediately.Mr Davey claims the bill will still prompt a major change in the way power is generated.His colleagues will suspect that his speech on climate sceptics and the media is a way of bolstering his party’s credibility on the issue.The speech is an explosion of anger from a politician who has long been privately frustrated about the extent to which right-wing newspapers have swung Conservative back-benchers behind the climate sceptic cause.He believes editors are corrupting public understanding of science and making it more difficult to impose measures to tackle the emissions that are disrupting the climate.Last week, for instance, the green-minded Tory MP Tim Yeo, who has laid the amendment calling for 2030 targets, was ""outed"" as a closet climate sceptic after saying there was a chance that climate change could be natural. Mr Yeo insists that he went on to say that the overwhelming consensus is that climate change is man-made, but this crucial fact was drowned out.Meanwhile, a newsletter from Lord Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation trumpeted: ""We are all climate sceptics now.""Mr Davey says climate change is being turned into a political football. In a draft of his speech, he says: ""Of course there will always be uncertainties within climate science and the need for research to continue. ""But some sections of the press are giving an uncritical campaigning platform to individuals and lobby groups.""This is not the serious science of challenging, checking and probing.""This is destructive and loudly clamouring scepticism born of vested interest, nimbyism, publicity seeking contraversialism or sheer blinkered, dogmatic, political bloody-mindedness. ""This tendency will seize upon the normal expression of scientific uncertainty and portray it as proof that all climate change policy is hopelessly misguided. ""By selectively misreading the evidence, they seek to suggest that climate change has stopped so we can all relax and burn all the dirty fuel we want without a care.""Those who argue against all the actions we are taking to reduce emissions, without any serious and viable alternative, are asking us to take a massive gamble with the planet our children will inherit, in the face of all the evidence, against overwhelming odds.""The speech at a Met Office event in London takes place as 55 organisations from green groups to manufacturing bodies issued a joint statement calling on MPs to vote in favour of the 2030 decarbonisation amendment.It says: ""We represent different parts of society but are united in the belief that the Energy Bill represents a major opportunity to put the UK firmly on track to becoming a world leading low-carbon economy, boost employment and show genuine leadership in the fight against dangerous climate change.""The list of signatories includes SSE electricity, the Royal Society of Arts and Commerce; Dong Energy; Renewable UK; the Carbon Capture and Storage Association; the Solar Trade Association, the Renewable Energy Association; Business in the Community; the Church of Scotland; the National Farmers Union and the TUC.

""The referendum result must not be the reason for new divisions,"" he warned.The government, human rights groups and prominent public figures had all spoken out against the referendum, urging people to vote no.Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic had argued that the referendum threatened people's right to happiness and choice. His government has pledged to push forward in the coming days proposals to give greater rights to same-sex couples.But leaders of the opposition HDZ party supported the referendum.Gay rights protesters, under a heavy police presence, marched for an hour through the the capital Zagreb on Saturday and unfurled a giant rainbow flag outside parliament.""We urge voters... to protect minority rights so that no-one in Croatia becomes a second-class citizen,"" activist Sanja Juras told a crowd in the city.The plan for a referendum was allowed parliamentary scrutiny after a Catholic group called ""In the Name of the Family"" gathered enough signatures to pass the required threshold of support.""Marriage is the only union enabling procreation.

If crossbench peer Lord Dear's amendment, aimed at preventing the legislation getting a second reading, were passed, it would effectively kill it.The former chief constable of West Midlands Police told peers the bill was ""ill-considered"" and sought to ""overturn centuries of tradition"".It was ""blind to the laws of unintended consequences"", he added, calling homosexuals ""a very small minority"".Lord Dear also said: ""The concept should be sent back to the drawing board. This is too serious a matter to be hurried through on a whim and in a cavalier fashion.""But equalities minister Baroness Stowell of Beeston said: ""For gay and lesbian couples this matters. It matters because it means the final acceptance of who they are.""She added that discrimination against homosexuals was ""wrong"" and that ""no religion or faith would be required to change its beliefs or doctrines"" as a result of the bill.Same-sex marriage was ""new and different"" but would ""not affect the nature of existing marriage"", Lady Beeston said.Baroness Royall, Labour's leader in the Lords, said she understood the bill had caused ""anguish"" for some people of faith, but she did not understand the argument that gay marriage could ""harm marriage between a man and a woman"".But the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told the Lords the plans would ""weaken"" existing marriage, adding that ministers were confusing ""equality"" with ""uniformity"".He added: ""I and many of my colleagues retain considerable hesitations about this bill.""Conservative former cabinet minister Lord Tebbit: ""This bill is promoted as a measure to end discrimination against homosexuals, but the present law of marriage does not discriminate against homosexuals.""The rights of a homosexual man are identical to mine. Subject to the laws on incest and bigamy, we are both free to marry a woman. Neither he nor I may marry another man. Our positions are identical.""And Labour's Lord Anderson of Swansea challenged Mr Cameron to hold a referendum on the issue, saying: ""Surely this proposed change is far more fundamental to our society than any transfer of power to Brussels.""He said the prime minister ""and his friends can put their case"", but added that ""many of us - Conservatives, Labour and crossbenchers - will be on the other side.  Let the people decide.""Some 86 peers are expected to speak in the debate with a final vote due on Tuesday evening.The Conservative Grassroots group has called on peers to reject the bill, but Mr Cameron hopes it will become law soon and that the first ceremonies can take place by next summer.The Scottish government has confirmed it will introduce a bill shortly to allow same-sex marriage."

It is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so, while protecting the rights of those who don't agree.""On Sunday, more than 20 current and former constituency chairmen delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street urging the prime minister to delay any parliamentary decision on gay marriage until after the next election.It warned of ""significant damage to the Conservative Party in the run-up to the 2015 election"" if the plans enter law. But supporters of the plan have hit back, with more than 50 Conservative activists, including constituency chairmen, the chair of Conservative Future - the party's section for under 30s - and the chair of the National Conservative Convention - which leads the party's grassroots work - urging MPs to listen to the ""wider views"" of voters.In an open letter they warned that opposing gay marriage could ""risk alienating the voters we will need in 2015"" adding: ""To win, the Conservative Party must mount a broad appeal.""Former Conservative minister Sir Peter Bottomley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme arguments against same sex marriage ""do not add up"" and insisted the party had included the plan in their last manifesto.""Conservatives believe in fairness. We now understand that to move from a civil partnership to a civil marriage is to allow the words 'I will' at the ceremony,"" he said. ""That is not going to be a big deal.""However, a number of Mr Bottomley's colleagues have opposed the change.Former Education Minister Tim Loughton said the bill would ""set MP against MP"" and it was the ""wrong time"" to introduce such legislation.A report by think tank ResPublica, to be launched by Conservative MP David Burrowes later, will argue that marriage is ""inescapably heterosexual"" and the legislation would compromise the meaning of both traditional heterosexual marriage and homosexual partnership.The new Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, who was confirmed in the role on Monday, said he stood by the Church of England's criticism of same sex marriage.He said: ""I have no idea how the vote will go, so I am not going to get into hypothetical questions.""I stand, as I have always stood over the last few months, with the statement I made at the announcement of my appointment, which is that I support the Church of England's position on this.""In the bill, the Church of England and the Church in Wales will be banned from offering same-sex marriages because of their strong stated opposition, but other religious organisations will be able to ""opt in"" to holding ceremonies.Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ""I'll be voting for equal marriage for a very simple reason: I don't think that the person you love should determine the rights you have. ""I'll be urging other Labour MPs to maximise our vote so that we can get a decisive majority in the House of Commons, it can then pass through the House of Lords and we can get it into legislation."""

It replaced a system where allegations and removals were held separately.It revealed that about 6% of claims had led to an investigation and 1.5% had resulted in removals.The committee said it was ""extremely concerned about the number of allegations that are made to the Allegations Management System that are not investigated. ""We recommend that all allegations are actioned and checked against national databases. It is incomprehensible that only 1.5 in 100 reports of illegal immigration result in someone being removed from the country.""Mr Vaz said there was a ""very poor record"" on removals, which did ""not give confidence to those who go out of their way to help the Home Office"".The committee's report revealed that between its introduction on 30 September last year and 30 June this year, the database had received 48,660 allegations - about 178 a day. It said the rates of investigation and removal risked undermining confidence in the system and ""could lead to reluctance to report such allegations if the public perceive that no action is being taken"".The MPs recommended that those who made allegations of illegal immigration be told the outcome of investigations, in an effort to improve public confidence. After a series of damning reports, Home Secretary Theresa May abolished the UKBA and replaced it with UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, which were brought back under the control of ministers.""There are still over 430,000 cases languishing in the backlogs, enough to fill Wembley Stadium almost five times over,"" Mr Vaz went on.""As we have said on numerous occasions, the backlogs must be cleared as a matter of priority. Only then will the Home Office be able to tackle the deeper problems in the immigration system.""Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ""The UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation since its formation in 2008 and its performance was not good enough. That is why we split the agency and brought its work into the Home Office under two distinct directorates.""He added: ""Our newly created UK Visa and Immigration directorate is focused on delivering a high-volume, high-quality visa service, while Immigration Enforcement is getting tough on those who break our immigration laws.""Mr Harper also said: ""We are building an immigration system that the public can have confidence in. We have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010.""But Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said the committee's ""damning report"" shows that ""for all the rhetoric Theresa May's Home Office is failing badly in tackling illegal immigration, backlogs of cases, and can only show progress by sleight of hand.""This out of touch government's response to real challenges has been to use taxpayers' money on ineffective and offensive gimmicks like the ad vans and 'go home' texts."" He added: ""The home secretary urgently needs to get a grip on the shambolic performance of the Home Office and make sure people are removed when they shouldn't be here, and sort out the backlogs that are increasing on her watch.""Under plans announced by the Home office last month, landlords would be asked to check the immigration status of their tenants.There would also be new powers to check driving licence applicants' immigration status and a reduction in the number of grounds for appeal against deportation decisions from 17 to four."

Some of the measures take effect immediately.The state assembly passed the legislation by 105 to 44 after more than a dozen hours of debate.As well as a gun offender registry, the restrictions introduce background checks on all firearms buyers and a ban on new magazines holding more than 10 rounds.The law also expands the state's assault weapons ban by 100 firearms, including the Bushmaster AR-15, which was used by 20-year-old Adam Lanza in December's Newtown shooting.But gun rights groups argue the legislation would not have prevented that massacre.Newtown reignited a national debate on firearms control, and led to President Barack Obama making gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term.The president plans to visit Connecticut on Monday as his proposed gun control measures in Congress appear to have stalled. Meanwhile, on Wednesday the House of Delegates in the state of Maryland voted on gun control measures that would be some of the most restrictive in the US if approved, as expected, by the state's Senate.In addition to requiring fingerprinting of all gun buyers, Democratic-leaning Maryland would become the first in the US to propose a gun license in nearly two decades. The legislation also limits magazine capacity to 10 bullets, places new restrictions on weapons purchases by the mentally ill and bans more than 40 types of assault rifle.While opinion polls show that most Americans support stricter gun control, the powerful National Rifle Association lobby group argues that more firearms keep people safer. It insists that the US Constitution enshrines the right to bear arms.  Speaking on a Thursday at a campaign event in California, President Obama said it would be harder to make progress on gun control than immigration reform - the president's other major legislative push.He visited the state of Colorado on Wednesday to praise the passage of sweeping gun control measures there.New York and California are among other states that have tightened their gun laws since the Newtown school shooting.But according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, while five states have passed seven laws this year curbing firearms access, 10 states have passed 17 laws loosening gun control.They include:South Dakota allowing school boards to arm teachersArkansas now permits guns on college campuses and in churchesKentucky has changed its rules to make it easier to obtain a concealed gun licenceTennessee allows employees to bring guns to work and keep them in their cars

But will it work?No single policy can end gun deaths and prevent massacres like that at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where last month a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children.Mr Obama admitted as much when he announced a plan to change America's gun culture on Wednesday.""Reducing gun violence is a complicated challenge,"" he said. ""If there's even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there's even one life that can be saved, we have an obligation to try.""Most public health officials agree on the need for a patchwork approach to the problem - one encompassing gun regulations, mental health initiatives and a hard look at violence in popular culture.""Gun violence is not just an issue of ownership and criminality and not just an issue of mental health,"" says Dariush Mozaffarian, co-director of the programme in cardiovascular epidemiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. ""If we look at it broadly as a public health issue, we will be much more successful than just trying to address one or two specific pathways.""Driving accidents and smoking deaths are two such issues that benefitted from a broad approach, he says. But can Mr Obama's proposals be effective? We take a closer look at some of the provisions in the plan.""The most important thing we need to do is fix our current system of background checks,"" Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said this week at a press conference.  ""It is indefensible that we have a system that allows people to sell guns with no background checks.""According to the US justice department, up to 40% of gun purchases take place without a background check - those from private sellers and some at gun shows.Closing the loophole will weed out those with criminal or psychiatric backgrounds legally barring them from gun ownership, Mr Webster said.But background checks would not have stopped most school shootings, in which the gunmen took legally obtained weapons from parents with spotless backgrounds, says Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University in Boston.Many gunmen have a clean criminal history - they are just having a really bad day, he says.He says most gun deaths are classified as manslaughter, which implies a crime committed without forethought.""In those cases, the criminal may not have a psychiatric record or a criminal history,"" says Mr Levin.""His pathology is situational. He loses his cool, loses his temper, and in the heat of the moment he takes out his knife from the kitchen drawer or gun from his trench coat and shoots.""The proposed assault weapons ban would eliminate the sale of weapons designed, as Mr Obama said, ""to pump out as many bullets as fast as possible"".Mr Webster said these weapons are particularly dangerous - and their ban could reduce deaths.""We believe they pose a unique threat with respect to mass shootings,"" he said. ""The casualty numbers tend to be larger with such weapons.""Limiting magazine size - and thus the number of bullets that can be shot without reloading - could help reduce fatalities, Mr Webster said.Mr Obama noted the gunman at a cinema in Colorado in July shot 70 people in minutes. When gunmen need to reload, victims and first responders have a chance to fight back, says Mr Levin.But Mr Levin also points out that most gun deaths are the result of handguns. ""One bullet, one body,"" he says.Mr Levin says addressing mental health provides the biggest way to prevent shootings - but it is important that the motivation is right.""We wait until someone looks troublesome, but we should get in touch with them and intervene when they're troubled,"" he says.  ""Not to prevent a murder, but to help them.""Mr Obama called for mental-health counsellors, as well as anti-bullying resources for 8,000 schools.National Rifle Association Executive Vice-President Wayne LaPierre last month called violent video games and television programmes part of the problem.That line was widely ridiculed by gun control advocates as an oversimplification, but Mr Obama has since said he wants to study the impact of violence in pop culture.That's progress, says Mr Mozaffarian. ""Even during the day if I'm watching a sporting program... almost every commercial break there's a commercial with people being shot, guns being pulled out,"" he says.He says ubiquitous images of violence create ""a strong unconscious acceptability"".""We have common-sense regulations to minimise obscenity and nudity, and almost nothing for gun violence,"" he says.While he says larger cultural change is possible - and necessary - he admits that it can take a long time.  The question is how long the nation can wait. "

The powerful gun lobby vows to oppose new gun control measures, arguing the US Constitution forbids them.Thursday's procedural vote to begin debate passed 68-31, with a handful of Republicans joining all but two Democrats, who have the majority in the chamber.It is the furthest into the legislative process any gun control bill has moved since 1994, when an assault weapons ban passed.But where the debate goes from here is uncertain, says the BBC's Paul Adams in Washington. Senators could take weeks to thrash out all the likely amendments. And crucially, there's absolutely no guarantee that any of this will actually become law, our correspondent says. Gun control advocates planned several events on Thursday to draw attention to what is described as a national gun violence epidemic.Religious leaders from Newtown, Connecticut began a 24-hour vigil at 11:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on the National Mall near the White House and Capitol building.More than 3,300 grave markers placed there will represent those killed by guns since a gunman killed 26 people at a primary school in Newtown in December.Another group has been reading aloud the names, places and ages of these gun violence victims.The lobbying push by both gun control and gun rights groups comes as a Democratic and a Republican senator have announced an agreement on a bill to expand background checks.On Wednesday, Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania unveiled a deal that would expand criminal background checks to online and gun show sales, establish a commission on mass violence, and ease some restrictions on transporting guns across state lines.Their proposal is being hailed as the best chance for new gun control legislation, though it falls short of the far stricter measures backed by the White House.Currently, so-called private gun sales by dealers who are not licensed, including some at gun shows, are not subject to criminal background checks on the purchaser. Vice-President Joe Biden, a strong supporter of new gun control legislation, told MSNBC's Morning Joe programme on Thursday that gun control was ""one of the cases where the public is so far ahead of the elected officials"".Mr Biden also accused the nation's top gun rights lobbying group, the National Rifle Association (NRA), of spreading disinformation, and promised expanded background checks would not lead to a national gun registry.But the NRA opposes the Manchin-Toomey deal, arguing background checks do nothing to prevent gun violence.In a letter to senators on Wednesday, NRA lobbyist Chris Cox warned that the organisation would score lawmakers based on their votes on the Manchin-Toomey deal and other measures it opposes.President Barack Obama's other proposals, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, have not gained traction in Congress.After Thursday's vote, President Obama spoke to the families of Newtown victims, some of whom have become advocates for gun control, his spokesman said.""The president congratulated the families on this important step forward, noting that the bipartisan progress would not have been possible without their efforts,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters.Senators will soon vote on a series of amendments to the legislation and then once more to close debate, before voting on the bill itself.Prospects for legislation in the House are unclear, with Republican House Speaker John Boehner declining to say whether the lower chamber would hold a floor vote on the issue.""I've made it clear that if the Senate passes a bill, the House will certainly review it,"" Mr Boehner told reporters on Thursday.""The thing that we have to remember is that laws are only as good as our citizens' willingness to obey them. And law-abiding citizens, do, in fact, obey them. Criminals don't obey them. In addition to that, we've got a system of laws that are not in force today."""

But it is viewed as narrower than congressional Democrats' proposals.Sales among friends or family members would be exempt from the background-check requirement, under the two senators' proposal.Sen Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said he did not believe expanding background checks to block illegal buyers amounted to gun control.""[Checks] are not a cure-all, but they can be helpful,"" the senator said, adding that 1.8 million firearms sales have been blocked by the current system.The plan has also won the backing of New York Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, who attempted to broker an earlier compromise, and of a group lobbying for stricter gun controls founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.""Our bipartisan coalition of more than 900 mayors strongly supports this bill,"" Mr Bloomberg, an independent, said in a statement.Also in the agreement is a plan to establish a federal commission on mass violence that would seek the expertise of those in the fields of mental health, school safety, firearms and entertainment.The Senate's Democratic leadership believes it now has enough Republican support to thwart a conservative attempt to stop the bill even being considered on the floor of the chamber.In a statement, the National Rifle Association said that more background checks ""will not prevent the next shooting, will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools"".Sen Manchin said he and Sen Toomey had been in touch with multiple groups during their discussions, including the NRA.And a White House spokesman confirmed that Mr Obama had called negotiators from both parties on Tuesday. The White House will continue its campaign on Wednesday as First Lady Michelle Obama visits a Chicago high school where 29 current or former students have been shot in the past year. Relatives of those killed in the December school massacre at Newtown, Connecticut, lobbied lawmakers on Tuesday. The family members were whisked to Washington by Mr Obama aboard Air Force One. ""People should listen to what we have to say and move the debate forward,"" said Mark Barden, who lost his seven-year-old son, Daniel at Sandy Hook Elementary School.""It's not just about our tragedy. Lots of kids are killed every day in this nation. We have to help lead the change.""White House calls for a ban on assault weapons and a limit on the capacity of ammunition magazines have not gained traction in Congress."

Firearms sales in the US have risen since the shooting.Ms Giffords, who is still recovering after being shot by a mentally ill gunman while meeting her constituents in Tucson, opened Wednesday's hearing saying: ""Violence is a big problem. ""Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something. It will be hard. But the time is now. You must act. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you.""Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, also testified.The couple, both gun owners, recently launched a political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, intended to combat firearms violence.During the hearing, reports of another mass shooting emerged from Ms Giffords' home state.Police in Phoenix, Arizona, said three people had been shot - one killed and two others critically wounded - at an office complex. The gunman's whereabouts were unknown.Wayne LaPierre, executive vice-president of the NRA, an influential firearms lobby group, told Wednesday's hearing that gun control measures had failed in the past.President Barack Obama this month proposed sweeping measures on guns, including a renewed ban on assault rifles and wider background checks on buyers. But Mr LaPierre said the government's own figures had shown the last assault-weapons ban from 1994-2004 made no impact on lowering crime. ""Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals,"" said Mr LaPierre.

""But the president is going to act. There are executive orders, executive action that can be taken.""The White House has pledged to send its proposals to Congress at the end of January, shortly after Mr Obama is sworn into office on 21 January for his second term.But an assortment of gun-rights groups are planning a Gun Appreciation Day over the inauguration weekend. They are encouraging gun enthusiasts to visit gun shops, gun ranges and gun shows.In his remarks, Mr Biden suggested that the White House would consider a range of measures.The BBC's Paul Adams, in Washington, reports that they would almost certainly include reinstating a ban on so-called assault weapons, as well as a more comprehensive system of background checks on people buying guns.Also on Wednesday, Mr Cuomo, whose state has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, came out in favour of a ban on assault weapons and on high-capacity ammunition magazines.""Some weapons are so dangerous and some ammunition devices so lethal that we simply cannot afford to continue selling them in our state,"" he said during his State of the State speech.Mr Cuomo also called for follow-up checks for people with handgun licences, to make sure they are still qualified to own their weapon, and longer sentences for gun crimes.He has been joined by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who called on policy-makers to examine the US mental health system and broaden access to drug treatment.Mr Christie also said the impact of violent video games should be examined.On Thursday, the vice-president is scheduled to meet the National Rifle Association, the powerful pro-gun group. In the wake of the Connecticut school shooting, the NRA advocated having armed guards at every US school.Mr Biden will also meet representatives of Walmart, the world's largest retailer and the biggest-seller of guns in the US.Walmart had initially declined to send anyone to the White House, but a spokesman told Reuters news agency the retailer had ""underestimated the expectation to attend the meeting"".In California on Wednesday, the nation's largest teacher pension fund took the first step to divest from companies that manufacture guns and ammunition.CalSTRS' investment in companies like Sturm, Ruger & Co and Smith & Wesson Holding Corp account for $11.7m (£7.3m) of the system's $155bn portfolio."

Firearms sales in the US have risen since the shooting.Ms Giffords, who is still recovering after being shot by a mentally ill gunman while meeting her constituents in Tucson, opened Wednesday's hearing saying: ""Violence is a big problem. ""Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something. It will be hard. But the time is now. You must act. Be bold. Be courageous.

The gunman's whereabouts were unknown.Wayne LaPierre, executive vice-president of the NRA, an influential firearms lobby group, told Wednesday's hearing that gun control measures had failed in the past.President Barack Obama this month proposed sweeping measures on guns, including a renewed ban on assault rifles and wider background checks on buyers. But Mr LaPierre said the government's own figures had shown the last assault-weapons ban from 1994-2004 made no impact on lowering crime.

Some of the measures take effect immediately.The state assembly passed the legislation by 105 to 44 after more than a dozen hours of debate.As well as a gun offender registry, the restrictions introduce background checks on all firearms buyers and a ban on new magazines holding more than 10 rounds.The law also expands the state's assault weapons ban by 100 firearms, including the Bushmaster AR-15, which was used by 20-year-old Adam Lanza in December's Newtown shooting.But gun rights groups argue the legislation would not have prevented that massacre.Newtown reignited a national debate on firearms control, and led to President Barack Obama making gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term.The president plans to visit Connecticut on Monday as his proposed gun control measures in Congress appear to have stalled. Meanwhile, on Wednesday the House of Delegates in the state of Maryland voted on gun control measures that would be some of the most restrictive in the US if approved, as expected, by the state's Senate.In addition to requiring fingerprinting of all gun buyers, Democratic-leaning Maryland would become the first in the US to propose a gun license in nearly two decades. The legislation also limits magazine capacity to 10 bullets, places new restrictions on weapons purchases by the mentally ill and bans more than 40 types of assault rifle.While opinion polls show that most Americans support stricter gun control, the powerful National Rifle Association lobby group argues that more firearms keep people safer. It insists that the US Constitution enshrines the right to bear arms.  Speaking on a Thursday at a campaign event in California, President Obama said it would be harder to make progress on gun control than immigration reform - the president's other major legislative push.He visited the state of Colorado on Wednesday to praise the passage of sweeping gun control measures there.New York and California are among other states that have tightened their gun laws since the Newtown school shooting.But according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, while five states have passed seven laws this year curbing firearms access, 10 states have passed 17 laws loosening gun control.They include:South Dakota allowing school boards to arm teachersArkansas now permits guns on college campuses and in churchesKentucky has changed its rules to make it easier to obtain a concealed gun licenceTennessee allows employees to bring guns to work and keep them in their cars

If he is sentenced to life with the possibility of parole, Sgt Bales could be eligible for release in 20 years. ""I'm truly, truly sorry to those people whose families got taken away,"" he told Thursday's hearing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. ""If I could bring their family members back, I would in a heartbeat.""Sorry just isn't good enough, but I am sorry.""Prosecutors have disputed whether he actually does feel remorse, playing a recording of a phone call in which an incarcerated Sgt Bales and his wife laugh as they discuss the case.His lawyers argued the conversation had been taken out of context.The soldier said on Thursday he was mad at himself for being angry all the time, drinking too much and hiding his problems.He was also taking drugs and alcohol at the time of the attack, while serving his fourth combat deployment.Former professional football player Marc Edwards appeared in court as a character witness for him.The ex-New England Patriots fullback said Sgt Bales had been an ""unbelievable leader"" in their time at high school in the US state of Ohio.His older brother, William Bales, 55, also paid tribute to him.""There's no better father that I've seen,"" he said of Sgt Bales. ""If you brought the kids in here today, they'd run right to him.""Major Brent Clemmer, who served with Sgt Bales in Iraq, told the jury he could not believe him capable of such an atrocity.Earlier this week, the jury heard in grim detail, compound by compound, how Sgt Bales attacked two villages in the middle of the night in Kandahar province, spraying bullets into mostly women and children.Nine Afghans, who were flown out by the US Army to attend the court martial, have testified about how the attack changed their lives.Among them was Haji Mohammad Wazir, who lost 11 family members, including his mother, wife and six children. He told the court the killings had ""devastated"" him.Mr Wazir received $550,000 (£350,000) in compensation from the US government.A total of nearly $1m in condolence money was paid to families over the incident.

3513	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23656197	News	0	International News	Gun Related Crimes	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"A controversial republican parade in Castlederg, County Tyrone has passed off without major incident.The Tyrone Volunteers Day Parade commemorated republicans who died during the Troubles, including two IRA men killed by their own bomb.Several hundred bandsmen and republican supporters took part in the march.Hundreds of protesters, including some family members of IRA murder victims, staged a counter-demonstration against the parade.Earlier, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers had urged organisers to call off the march, saying it was ""causing great hurt"" to victims of terrorism.The commemoration angered many unionists and several leading politicians had called on Ms Villiers to ban the parade.A heavy police presence was in place in the town ahead of both the parade and the protest, after 56 officers were injured during a loyalist demonstration against a republican parade in Belfast on Friday evening. The Castlederg parade, which was supported by Sinn Féin, began after 15:00 BST on Sunday and supporters clapped as it moved off.The counter-demonstration was staged by the Derg Valley Victims Voice, who said the march would glorify terrorism and traumatise families affected by IRA violence. The protesters held banners opposing the commemoration and some of them shouted 'disgrace' as the march began.At one stage, a man whose relative had been killed by the IRA managed to break through the line to vent his anger, but was stopped by stewards.The Parades Commission had placed restrictions on the march, which the parade organisers had already re-routed away from the town's war memorial.At a newly built republican memorial in Castlederg, the names of dead republicans were read out to the marchers.They included the names of the two IRA men, who died when the bomb they were transporting exploded prematurely in 1973.Sinn Féin North Belfast MLA, Gerry Kelly, addressed the marchers, criticising what he called the ""media maelstrom of attacks"" ahead of the event.Mr Kelly said: ""No unionist MLA, councillor, MP or minister, no loyalist paramilitary or loyal order spokesperson - no matter how loud they shout, will prevent me or any other republican honouring our comrades who gave their lives in the struggle for Irish freedom and equality.""He added that the centre of Castlederg was supposed to be a ""shared space"" and almost 20 unionist marches had taken place in the town so far this year.""Yet when a single republican commemoration parade is organised we are confronted with a deluge of orchestrated complaints.  ""In effect we are being told that it is right for unionism to remember their British dead without interference but how dare republicans remember their Irish dead in the same way.""Mr Kelly said there must not be ""a hierarchy of victims which would discriminate against republicans and nationalists not just in life, but in death also"".The Ulster Unionist representatives for the area, Ross and Derek Hussey, were among those attending the counter-demonstration. Ross Hussey said: ""In the face of intense provocation from apologists for murder, the families maintained their dignity and ensured that the memories of their loved ones will always rise above that of the bombers and those that celebrate murderers."" He added: ""Despite Sinn Féin dancing on the graves of IRA victims, the people of Castlederg sent out a strong message today that they will not be faced down by Sinn Féin.""As for Sinn Fein themselves, I don`t think they have any shame - celebrating Irish republican bombers on the same day as families gather in Omagh to remember their loved ones, murdered by Irish republican bombers in that town 15 years ago"""
3514	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23285869	Opinion	0	International News	Gun Related Crimes	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"A senior rebel commander with the Free Syrian Army has been shot and killed by jihadis. As Paul Wood reports, the killing is part of an escalating struggle within the armed uprising between moderates and Islamists linked to al-Qaeda. The Free Syrian Army commander, stocky, bearded, dressed in camouflage, oozed menace and seethed with righteous anger. We were speaking about the biggest jihadi group in Syria, the Nusra Front, who had kidnapped his brother. ""I know the names of all their emirs [leaders]. They will have nowhere to hide. This will be all-out war,"" he said.He explained that he was now free to take his revenge because he had just paid $50,000 (£33,000) to get his brother out. He had hated to do this because Nusra would just spend the money on weapons to use against the FSA. He told me they had sent a suicide bomber to infiltrate his command post, killing 12 of his men. They were able to do that, he complained bitterly, only because he had sent most of his troops to fight in Qusayr, which later fell to the regime. I met that particular commander in Turkey, not far from the border with Syria, 10 days ago. He was describing a long-standing and often bloody enmity among those fighting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad - ""secular"" against jihadi, ""moderate"" versus ""extremist"". That struggle has now resulted in the loss of one of the FSA's most senior figures, Kamal Hamami, who commanded an important brigade in his native north-western province of Latakia.Even as the Syrian regime pushes back the rebels on several fronts, a civil war within the civil war is building on the opposition side. A spokesman for the FSA's Supreme Military Council said Mr Hamami had been driving through Latakia when they ran into a checkpoint run by the main group linked to al-Qaeda in Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.The fighters at the checkpoint refused to let him pass, saying he would need to get permission from their emir. He told them they had to take their checkpoint down. As the argument raged, one of the fighters - a foreign jihadi from Iraq, it is said - raised his weapon and shot Mr Hamami. The FSA men retreated with their mortally wounded commander.According to the FSA, the emir gave a long list of reasons for the killing, one of which included the fact he was a member of the FSA's Supreme Military Council. The FSA said the Islamic State had threatened to kill all of the other members of the Supreme Military Council - another sign of the escalating struggle within the armed uprising. This is partly a battle over spoils, partly ideological. In truth, almost all of those fighting the regime are to some degree religious, including those FSA brigades commonly labelled ""secular"". The crucial difference, though, is that the ""secular"" FSA will accept a civil state while the jihadis are fighting to establish an Islamic theocracy. A year ago, the jihadis were still operating almost underground in Syria. Now they are powerful and important players, in some places running whole towns, where they impose Sharia law.  ""This is a disaster for us, a disaster for the revolution,"" a female opposition activist told me. She was complaining about Islamist gunmen telling her not to smoke, to cover her head, and to leave meetings where she was the only woman. ""We do not want these people,"" she went on, referring to the foreign fighters who have joined jihadi brigades. ""This is not Syria.""She admitted that the jihadis had grown in popularity because of corruption and infighting among the FSA. Many rebel groups were preying on the people they are supposed to be fighting for, she conceded. I spoke to another activist who had spent two years on the run from the regime, only to finally flee Syria because he spoke out against looting by the FSA. ""One word about this on Facebook can earn you a bullet,"" he told me. The moral clarity of the early days of the uprising has been lost. Then, people wanted to defend themselves against overwhelming and brutal force - and ultimately to replace a corrupt, one-party dictatorship. Now many people tell me the revolution itself has become corrupt and, in rebel-held areas, they fear a different kind of tyranny: crime, kidnapping, gangsterism. By the laws of sheer demographics in Syria, President Assad should have been finished long ago. Three quarters of the country is Sunni and this is a predominantly Sunni uprising. But now some who supported the revolution are even switching, however reluctantly, to the regime, as the lesser of two evils. The result is that the government is looking stronger than ever.The town of Qusayr fell to a government offensive six weeks ago. It looks very much like the last rebel pockets in the much bigger city of Homs will be next. One of those pockets is Khaldiya. For two years the rebels held out here, but now government tanks are closing in. An activist reached by Skype told us that most people have fled Khaldiya, just fighters and their families remaining, living in medieval conditions without power and running water.In a video uploaded to YouTube, three FSA fighters stand looking at the camera and declare they will defend Khaldiya to their last breath. ""This is the only weapon we have left,"" says one, pointing to a suicide belt he is wearing. ""By God's will, we can hold this place."" The suicide belt is a sign of how Islamist ideology has spread even through the FSA, as well as of how desperate the battle against the regime has become. The rebels in the Khaldiya suicide belt video are clear where the blame lies for what - despite their declaration - seems like an imminent defeat. They have been abandoned by the outside world, they say, and even by their own leadership in the FSA. They say that, starved of weapons, they had little against a Syrian regime armed with tanks, artillery, jets and Scuds.For Western governments thinking about arming the rebels, there are many worrying questions: What if the weapons are used in a sectarian massacre of Shias and Alawites? What if the jihadis get hold of anti-aircraft missiles and use them in Europe or the US? Against that, there is the risk that staying out will allow the Syrian inferno to light fires beyond Syria's borders. One in four Syrians have fled their homes, many into neighbouring countries. There is a risk of destabilising the whole region. Sectarian violence has already spread to Lebanon. A car bomb in Shia, Hezbollah-controlled southern Beirut, this week was payback for Hezbollah's involvement in the battle for Qusayr, it is said. Jordan, straining with more than half a million refugees, is also said to be at risk. To stop the killing, outside powers are trying to force both sides to the negotiating table. President Assad will not go, presumably, unless he feels seriously in peril - that is one reason, it is argued, to arm the rebels. But if the balance tips too far the other way, the rebels would not want to talk if they felt they were winning on the battlefield. If Western governments do decide to step in, there are some rebels they might feel they could do business with, represented by the FSA's Supreme Military Council, the body on which the murdered commander, Kamal Hamami sat. At the top of the Supreme Military Council sits General Salim Idris, the FSA's chief of staff. He talks, reassuringly for Western governments, not of revenge or of Sharia law, but of human rights and democracy. The relatively secular rebel groups are in the minority. On many frontlines, they are not militarily as significant as other groups that Western governments would find problematic.  The hope in London, Paris and Washington, is that the ""moderate"" FSA will grow in power and influence with Western support. The question is, as the regime's offensive continues, is it too late? "

Prosecutors had argued that Mr Zimmerman, 29, opened fired on 26 February 2012 because he racially profiled Trayvon Martin as he walked through his neighbourhood wearing a hooded sweatshirt in the rain, and assumed he was up to no good. Trayvon Martin was African-American. Mr Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.But the defence said he shot Trayvon Martin in self defence after the teenager had punched their client, slammed his head into the pavement and reached for Mr Zimmerman's gun.Mr Zimmerman was facing possible conviction for second-degree murder or manslaughter. On Saturday he was cleared of all charges by the six-woman jury at Seminole County Criminal Justice Center in Sanford, Florida. Defence lawyer Mark O'Mara said he was ""ecstatic"", and that Mr Zimmerman ""was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self defence"". ""I'm glad that the jury saw it that way,"" he said.Another defence lawyer, Don West, said the prosecution of his client had been ""disgraceful"".""As happy as I am for George Zimmerman, I'm thrilled that this jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty,"" he said.However, following the verdict, protest marches were staged in US cities including San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta.In Oakland, California, some protesters started small fires and smashed windows.Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson told CNN on Sunday: ""I remain stunned at the decision.

Rights activist Al Sharpton also appealed for calm, but said the verdict was ""a slap in the face to the American people"".He compared the case to the beating of African-American man Rodney King by police in 1991, which sparked widespread rioting.A petition launched by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), demanding that the DoJ open a civil rights case against Mr Zimmerman, had received more than 350,000 signatures by midday on Sunday.The petition says that ""the most fundamental of civil rights - the right to life - was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin"".Daryl Parks, lawyer for the Martin family, told BBC News he hoped the case would be a wake-up call for the US.""Many will realise that if there is a law that would allow you to kill an unarmed teenager, then that's a law that we probably should look at and change,"" he said.Florida police had angered many by not arresting Mr Zimmerman for six weeks after the shooting, citing the state's controversial ""stand your ground"" law, which allows a citizen to use lethal force if he or she feels in imminent danger. But Mr Parks said the trial had given the US ""a new perspective on black life - when a young black person gets killed, the approach that it takes to investigate, to arrest the person that did it"".Meanwhile Mr Zimmerman's family and representatives have said they are afraid he could fall victim to revenge attacks.His brother, Robert said he had received frequent threats on social media and there was ""more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him"".

In Oakland, California, some protesters started small fires and smashed windows.Mr Zimmerman's family and representatives have said they are afraid he could fall victim to revenge attacks.His brother, Robert said he had received frequent threats on social media and there was ""more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him"". ""He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,"" he said.His lawyer, Mark O'Mara, told ABC News on Sunday that Mr Zimmerman had no regrets about having carried a gun on the night of 26 February 2012.He said his client would now be entitled to have his weapon returned to him and to carry it, saying there was ""ever more reason now, isn't there? There are a lot of people out there who actually hate him, though they shouldn't.""Jorge Rodriguez, a friend of Mr Zimmerman's, said he had told him of his relief. He told Reuters he did not understand the anger at the verdict.""Everybody asked for justice, and they got it. Everybody asked for George to be arrested, and they got it.

Ms Davis' marathon speech, known as a filibuster, prevented Republicans in the legislature from passing the bill during the end of a June legislative session. Governor Rick Perry ordered a new session in July, in which the bill was passed.The subsequent lawsuit was brought by Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers in the state.They argued that the law's requirement for doctors to have an admissions agreement with a local hospital within 30 miles (48km) of their clinic would force the closure of many providers.In a trial before Judge Yeakel's decision, one set of clinics said they had applied for admitting privileges at 32 hospitals, with only 15 accepting the applications and zero announcing a decision.Tuesday's ruling provides an immediate reprieve for those providers expecting to be shut down on Tuesday.In his ruling, Judge Yeakel said the provision ""places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable foetus and is thus an undue burden to her"".A similar law is working its way through the federal court system in Mississippi. A federal judge temporarily blocked the measure as a trial on the law's constitutionality is scheduled to take place in March, and an appeals court declined the Mississippi attorney general's request to lift the injunction."

But will the rest of the party stick with them?It is a high-stakes gambit - the US has never before breached its authority to borrow money to fund its obligations, and most experts warn it could be catastrophic. But a group of hard-line conservatives in Congress think it is worth the risk. Dozens of Republican politicians, such as Steve King of Iowa, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, and Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, have suggested in interviews that the US government could prioritise its payments in the event of a debt limit breach, choosing to fund some government expenses - while drastically cutting others. ""If you don't raise the debt ceiling, what that means is you have a balanced budget,"" Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said on CNN last week. ""It doesn't mean you wouldn't pay your bills.""The strategy hinges on convincing President Barack Obama that conservatives are willing to break the debt ceiling and devastate the Democratic Party's government priorities, while assuring Republican big-business backers that this would not destroy the economy. It is a fine line, but conservative grass-roots groups think they have found the silver bullet to kill Mr Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law, which Republican Representative John Fleming of Louisiana called in typical remarks ""the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress"".If the debt limit is breached so that ""Obamacare"" can be destroyed and Americans be taught they can live with less government, so be it. ""Liberals might be so concerned about settling this issue because they do not want Americans to realize that we can survive just fine with a lot less government spending,"" Jeffrey Dorfman writes in Forbes. ""Perhaps we will be better off in the long run if government gets a little taste of what so many families have been experiencing for years: staying within a budget.""First-term Republican Representative Ted Yoho of Florida said in an interview with the Washington Post that hitting the debt limit would ""bring stability to the world markets"", as it would prove the country is serious about balancing its budget.Without the risk of a sovereign debt default, and with Democratic interests feeling the pain of a predicted 32% cut in overall government spending, the theory goes, Republicans would finally have a negotiating advantage. ""We hit the debt ceiling, and the world won't end,"" says Dean Clancy, vice-president of public policy for FreedomWorks, a conservative grassroots activism group. ""Once the public and Wall Street understand that default is not really a possibility, the president's leverage will be greatly diminished and a bipartisan compromise will be achievable.""Other Republicans counter that such a strategy is both impractical and dangerous. Even if the treasury department could figure out how to prioritise payments, the uncertainty created by such an action would devastate financial markets.""The issue here is honouring our debt obligations,"" says Bill Hoagland, a senior vice-president at the Bipartisan Policy Center who served as a budget aide to former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. ""It's stupid, and it's unbelievable we're even having this conversation.""Speaker of the House John Boehner, a reluctant recruit to the current budget fight over healthcare reform, has shown hesitation to take the plunge with the conservative caucus once more. Although he continues to assert that his party is united, there were reports in the media last week that he told nervous colleagues that he would not allow a default on the debt - even if that meant relying on Democratic support to pass a debt limit increase. Civil warAccording to Republican campaign strategist and pollster Matthew Towery, the hard-line conservatives will soon learn their plan is unworkable. As in the economic crisis of 2008, when Congress did not pass an economic rescue bill until the stock market took a 700-point drop, rank-and-file Republicans will turn once the financial markets show signs of stress, he says.""The president has blatantly stated that Wall Street should be concerned,"" Mr Towery says. ""He wants a drop, as he knows what that would do. They would have to take immediate action.""At that point, enough Republicans would come around to give Mr Boehner cover to bring a debt limit increase to a vote in the House. ""The [Republican] House majority has a pack mentality until things start to go wrong,"" Mr Towery says. ""Once that happens, Boehner not only will have the votes, he'll probably get a majority of the conference to go along with him."" As the debt limit approaches, what has been termed a Republican ""civil war"" between hard-line conservatives and the party establishment may be approaching its end game. The conservative caucus has proven it is willing to continue to escalate the standoff until it achieves unconditional victory. With strong backing from voters at home and a view the ""Obamacare"" healthcare reform is an existential threat to the country, compromise is not an option.At some point, however, the rest of the Republican Party may decide it is ready to get off this ride.""I think Republicans just want out of this mess altogether,"" Mr Towery says."

As he set out a full-blown progressive agenda, he lectured Republicans in Congress. At first his focus was on the economy. His philosophy was clear - only investment and spending would ensure a rising, thriving middle class. This was, in parts, a thickly detailed speech. Yet through it ran a simple chorus: ""Lets get it done"", ""Send me a bill,"" ""I will sign it"", ""Take a vote"".Those hoping for a more conciliatory tone than his notably aggressive inaugural speech were disappointed. Mr Obama threw down challenge after challenge to his opponents.He warned that the automatic spending cuts that come into effect at the beginning of next month would damage the economy. He urged more spending on pre-school education, high schools and training.He announced a plan to spend $70bn (£44bn) to rebuild roads and bridges.He called for tax reform. Immigration reform. Raising the minimum wage. And he argued passionately for gun control. If the focus was, as spun, the economy, the most emotional moment was Mr Obama's refrain for the victims of gun violence: ""They deserve a vote"".People were on their feet, some crying. There is still a central mystery to me about all of this. The support of the Democratic party, even the support of the bulk of Americans, does not win votes in the House of Representatives. Mr Obama's speech certainly has cast Congress as the villain if they do not act, but that does not ensure victory on a single one of his proposals.It might just turn out that Mr Obama's speech is not the one remembered from this night. Republican Senator Marco Rubio gave his party's reply to the State of the Union and it was strikingly different from anything I have heard from his party in the three years I have been here. That is perhaps a measure of how far they have drifted away from those they need to attract.The son of Cuban immigrants said that he was standing up not for the rich but for his neighbours, for immigrants, and retired people who depend on federal pensions and Medicare, free healthcare for seniors.Mr Rubio said he would never harm Medicare - it had provided dignity for his dad as he died of cancer, and his mum depended on it now.His message of smaller government and lower taxation was familiar. But the tone, the setting, the appeal to the less well-off - all were so different to anything Romney said during the election that it really stood out.This perhaps is Mr Obama's best hope - that those Republicans who feel a need for reform may heed some of his pleas for votes for his plans.

He said it would cut $4.6tn (£3tn) over 10 years.But White House spokesman Jay Carney said of the Ryan plan in a statement: ""The math just doesn't add up.""Senate Democrats plan to offer a rival budget with both cuts and tax rises.Former vice-presidential candidate Mr Ryan said his plan would stop the US government living beyond its means.""We're introducing a budget that balances in 10 years - without raising taxes,'' Mr Ryan said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed about the plan.The Wisconsin Republican's plan includes tax revenues gained over that time-span as part of a last-minute deal pushed by the White House on 1 January that raised taxes on incomes over $400,000. Both Democrats and Republicans recognise that neither budget is likely to pass both the House and the Senate. But the plans outline the priorities of each party amid wider negotiations to pass a budget by 27 March.That deadline is when the current resolution funding the US government expires.During a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Ryan called his plan an invitation to Democrats and the White House ""to come together to fix these problems"". His budget proposal finds significant parts of its projected savings in healthcare costs.It seeks to repeal President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law and cut spending on Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor, by giving control of its distribution to states.But correspondents say it is highly unlikely that healthcare reform can be repealed.The budget committee chairman has also reintroduced a proposal that replaces traditional Medicare, a government healthcare programme for the elderly, with a government subsidy to buy health insurance for those currently under 55.Critics of the plan say the subsidies will not grow with inflation fast enough, raising the annual price of insurance for seniors. The budget preserves more than $700bn in the Obama healthcare reform law's cuts to Medicare providers over a decade.Also included are about $1tn cuts to domestic programmes.While the document released on Tuesday does not go into specific detail on where those cuts would come from, it assumes day-to-day spending significantly lower than levels called for by across-the-boards cuts, known as the sequester, that went into effect on 1 March. Defence spending would be lower than previous budgets passed by the House, but higher than amounts expected if the sequester remains in place.Despite the sharp cuts, Mr Ryan estimates the proposal increases spending by 3.4% instead of the 5% currently projected.The Senate plan, to be unveiled on Wednesday by Democratic Senator Patty Murray, is expected to call for new tax revenues through ending certain tax loopholes and other tax benefits to the wealthy.""At a time when we absolutely must cut where we can, looking at ways we can close special tax breaks that aren't targeted to help the middle class or our economy just makes sense,"" Sen Murray said at a hearing last week.""There's no good reason, for example, that taxpayers currently subsidise millionaires more, when they purchase a second home, or a yacht, than they do middle-class families purchasing their first home.""Republicans have also called for closing certain loopholes in the tax code, but would use the savings to reduce tax rates.Sen Murray's budget is also expected to include spending cuts equivalent to revenue raised over 10 years.The expected Senate budget proposal is the first since 2009. A series of continuing resolutions - essentially stop-gap measures - have served as the US budget through various political battles over reducing the country's deficit."

It remains unclear whether Congress can agree a deal in time to avert the economic calamity in the US and across the world that economists say could result.The US House of Representatives would vote on Tuesday night on its bill to reopen the government and avoid default, said Republicans.Meanwhile, Fitch credit agency placed the US AAA rating under review for a downgrade.The Senate plan, outlined on Monday evening, would fund the government through mid-January and raise the debt ceiling until February, creating room for negotiators to agree a longer-term budget.The House plan largely mirrored the Senate timeline until Representative Devin Nunes said on Tuesday afternoon it had been amended to fund the government only until 15 December.The California Republican said the revised House plan also dropped earlier attempts to delay a medical device tax used to pay for healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.The House plan would also eliminate healthcare subsidies for the president, vice-president, members of the president's cabinet, and members of Congress and their staff.The health law passed in 2010, was subsequently validated by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 presidential election, which Mr Obama won handily. Many key provisions have already taken effect, and more begin next year.On Tuesday, Mr Obama rejected what an aide described as Republicans' attempts to extort ""ransom"" while the government remained shut and the threat of a debt default loomed.""Unfortunately, the latest proposal from House Republicans does just that in a partisan attempt to appease a small group of Tea Party Republicans who forced the government shutdown in the first place,"" said White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage, referring to a faction of hardline conservatives who hold significant sway in the House.Later, Republican House Speaker John Boehner said that both parties were trying to find a way forward and that Tuesday morning's House plan was focused on ""fairness for the American people under Obamacare"".""There have been no decisions about exactly what we will do,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. ""There are a lot of opinions about what direction to go.""But following a meeting with Mr Boehner and GOP moderates on Tuesday Republican representative Charlie Dent told the media his ""best estimate is that there aren't the votes to pass it"".House and Senate Democrats immediately joined Mr Obama in denouncing the House Republican proposal.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the plan was ""an extreme piece of legislation and it's nothing more than a blatant attack on bipartisanship"". He said it would never pass the Democratic-controlled Senate.Mr Obama is scheduled to meet House Democrats on Tuesday afternoon as the clock ticks to Thursday's debt ceiling deadline.Even if a deal is reached in the Senate, it is unclear whether Congress could act in time to pass legislation that would avert the 17 October default deadline.Hardline conservatives such as Texas Republican Ted Cruz could use Senate rules to stonewall a vote.In the House of Representatives, the Senate deal could meet fierce resistance from the Tea Party-aligned Republicans.One of those conservative hardliners, Kansas Representative Tim Huelskamp, was quoted by the New York Times as labelling his upper chamber colleagues ""the Senate surrender caucus"".""Anybody who would vote for that [Senate deal] in the House as Republican would virtually guarantee a primary challenger,"" he said.Republicans have taken the brunt of blame for the latest fiscal cliffhanger to cripple Capitol Hill, according to opinion polls. A Washington Post/ABC News survey on Monday found 74% of voters were unhappy with congressional Republicans' handling of the standoff, compared with a 53% disapproval rating for President Obama.Some in the party have voiced concern that the affair could damage its prospects in next year's midterm elections.The US Treasury has been using what are known as ""extraordinary measures"" to pay its bills since the nation reached its current debt limit in May. Those methods will be exhausted by 17 October, it has said.Meanwhile, the government remains partially shut down because Congress failed to agree on funding by a 1 October deadline.The impasse has closed a swathe of federal services and left hundreds of thousands of employees out of work.

And in the federal website, tens of thousands are enrolling every single day.""While reiterating that he would not negotiate over raising the debt ceiling, the federal government's borrowing cap, he praised Congress for a recent budget compromise that averted a fresh government shutdown.""It's probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship,"" Mr Obama said. ""But it's also fair to say we're not condemned to endless gridlock.""The US president highlighted improving economic data, saying 2014 would be a ""breakthrough year"" for the nation's economy.But he also argued Congress should extend unemployment benefits for those who have been out of work for extended period of time. The current long-term unemployment scheme is due to end days after Christmas.""We head into next year with an economy that's stronger than it was when we started the year [and] more Americans are finding work and experiencing the pride of a paycheck,"" he said."

The US faces another deadline on Thursday to raise its debt limit. If a deal is not reached by then, the US faces potential default, a prospect which has caused alarm both domestically and abroad. Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said the aim was to reach a deal on extending the debt limit before markets reopen on Monday.The talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell earlier on Saturday represented the first face-to-face meeting between the two since July, the New York Times reported.""The conversations were extremely cordial but very preliminary of course - nothing conclusive, but I hope that our talking is some solace to the American people and to the world,"" said Mr Reid.""We had a good meeting,"" said Mr McConnell, without elaborating.Mr Reid then went to the White House for talks with President Barack Obama.But he rejected a plan put forward by Republican Senator Susan Collins to allow the government to increase its debt limit until 31 January.Democrats have a majority in the Senate, but could not muster enough support to advance a proposal to lift the debt ceiling there.Talks between House Republicans and the White House had collapsed earlier.Republicans have refused to pass a new budget unless President Barack Obama agrees to delay or eliminate the funding of the healthcare reform law of 2010.Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been sent home as a result of the shutdown.The White House has repeatedly said it would not undermine the law, known as Obamacare, nor negotiate over larger budget matters, until Republicans vote to end the threat of default.It has also rejected a short-term deal over the debt limit.""It wouldn't be wise, as some suggest, to just kick the debt ceiling can  down the road for a couple of months, and flirt with a first-ever intentional  default right in the middle of the holiday shopping season,"" Mr Obama said."

""They're not focused on you.""The government faces a potential shutdown on 1 October if Congress and the White House do not agree on a temporary budget measure.A temporary bill is needed because Washington's longstanding budget stalemate has derailed the annual bills that would set the country's budget.A government shutdown would delay pay for federal workers, including some military members, send non-essential employees home, close national parks and shut passport offices. But programmes like air traffic control, food inspection and the US border agency would keep running.The Republican-sponsored stopgap bill proposes funding federal agencies at an annualised rate of more than $986bn (£615bn), but includes a provision that strips federal funding for the Affordable Care Act.Also known as Obamacare, the 2010 law requires businesses with more than 50 workers to provide health insurance to all their full-time staff, or pay a series of increasingly severe penalties.House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has called for an end to the law because it ""is turning our full-time economy into a part-time economy"".On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Republicans were ""simply postponing for a few days the inevitable choice"" between passing a bill without the provision or forcing a government shutdown.

The Republicans have called for more negotiations.A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner called the White House's position ""unsustainably hypocritical"".Rory Cooper, a spokesman for Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, accused Mr Obama of ""hyper-partisan speeches"".An opinion poll released on Tuesday suggested the American public disagreed with the Republican strategy.An estimated 72% of voters oppose Congress shutting down the federal government in order to block the health law, according a poll by Quinnipiac University.The healthcare law passed in 2010, was subsequently validated by the US Supreme Court, and was a major issue in the 2012 presidential election.The next key deadline in the US is 17 October, when the government reaches the limit at which it can borrow money to pay its bills, the so-called debt ceiling.House Republicans have demanded a series of policy concessions - including on the health law and on financial and environmental regulations - in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.President Obama is due to meet the heads of some of Wall Street's biggest banks - including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America - to discuss the debt ceiling and other economic issues.The bankers are members of the Financial Services Forum, a lobbying group which has, along with 250 other businesses, sent a letter to Congress urging it to raise the debt ceiling.

The Wales and Chester Circuit of Barristers has voted unanimously to refuse to sign up to a new system regulating the quality of criminal lawyers in England and Wales.Barristers will also refuse to attend court if the plans are implemented.The UK coalition is trying to cut £2bn it spends on what it calls one of the world's most expensive legal systems.Possible changes to legal aid in criminal law include fee cuts of up to 17.5%, price-competitive tendering for legal aid contracts and clients no longer being able to choose their own defence lawyer. Andrew Taylor, a Cardiff-based barrister, told BBC's The Wales Report with Huw Edwards that he and his colleagues were striking because of the serious concerns they had that the changes would restrict people's access to justice in Wales. ""The justice system in Wales at the moment is very much in danger. The effect of these cuts if they come in, to Wales in particular, will be absolutely devastating,"" he said. ""Freedom of choice will go. The provision of legal services in Wales will be very much reduced. People will be denied access to justice.""The Ministry of Justice says that the changes to legal aid for criminal cases would save a further £220m per year by 2018-2019. The criminal legal aid consultation closes in June, but cuts to legal aid for civil cases have been in effect since the beginning of April. Legal aid is no longer available in most civil law cases involving employment and education, immigration, debt, housing, family, and clinical medical negligence. But a Bridgend family who relied on legal aid to fight their daughter's medical negligence case have called the legal aid cuts in this area ""unethical"".Emily Weaver, 26, was born with cerebral palsy, and when she was two, doctors failed to spot that a tube draining fluid from her brain had blocked. The delays in diagnosing and treating the problem caused her to suffer further brain damage, losing her sight and most of her hearing. Legal aid funded the Weavers' successful medical negligence claim which ultimately provided care and equipment for the rest of her life. But now, under the new rules, Ms Weaver would not be eligible for legal aid to take her case. Legal aid is only available in cases of clinical medical negligence where a child has suffered severe brain damage during pregnancy, or up until two months of age. Ms Weaver's father John said that without legal aid, they would not have been able to take the case. Lawyers are warning that without access to legal aid in many areas, more and more people will be forced to represent themselves in court. Mr Weaver said: ""To attack the most vulnerable people in society and people who already have a great disadvantage, and take away the little hope they've got, I don't care what government it is - it's unforgiveable.""In a statement to The Wales Report, Justice Minister Lord McNally said: ""In recent years, millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been spent effectively encouraging people to take their problems to court when there are often quicker, cheaper and less stressful options available. ""At £2bn a year we had one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world, and it was costing taxpayers too much at a time when resources are not limitless. ""We had to make some difficult decisions, and it was not a process we embarked on lightly, but we have safeguarded legal aid to ensure lawyers are there for those who really need them.""  The Wales Report is on Sunday, 28 April at 22:25 BST on BBC1 Wales."

The move followed the death of Savita Halappanavar.The four Catholic Archbishops of Ireland, including Cardinal Sean Brady, have criticised the decision. Abortion is currently illegal in the Republic, except where there is a real and substantial risk to a mother's life, as distinct from her health.However, up until now the government has not enacted legislation to give certainty to doctors as to when terminations can be carried out and under what circumstances.The Irish government said the new legislative framework will require a combination of legislation and regulations in cases where the life of a woman is at risk.

In fact, the evidence suggests about three-quarters of us will. For some it will be no more than a little help in the home with activities such as washing and dressing. For others it will involve round-the-clock support in a care home.But how much is that worth?Unlike NHS care, such help is not free.At the moment anyone with assets of more than £23,250 faces unlimited costs.For one in 10 that can be more than £100,000 over a lifetime.The system means thousands of people are forced to sell their homes or use up their life savings to pay for help.But this could be about to change.It seems likely the government will announce in the coming weeks its intention to cap costs at £75,000.The amount is more than double the £35,000 sum recommended by an independent Dilnot Commission which looked at the issue two years ago.And that makes the move a gamble.The £35,000 cap was based on careful consideration and calculation. Chaired by a leading economist, the commission felt the figure would be both high enough so it was affordable to government, while being low enough to entice the public to start planning for old age.At £35,000 ministers would need to find about £2bn a year - the sum they currently spend on the winter fuel allowance.But after months of debate the government has decided that is too big a price to pay. Hence, the higher cap, which was briefed to journalists as part of the release of the coalition's mid-term review earlier this week and is likely to be fleshed out in more detail within the next month.However, the problem with increasing the cap is that the carefully constructed Dilnot plan could start to fall apart.While the £35,000 figure is a lot for many people, it is considered by most experts to be within a margin that would encourage many people to start planning for old age.That is important. If people start getting engaged with the issue, the insurance industry will begin to come up with policies, safe in the knowledge that the catastrophic costs will be covered by the state.But by increasing the cap to £75,000 there is a risk the public is turned off.So far all those involved in the social care sector have kept their counsel.That is partly an acknowledgement by many of them that the government deserves credit and partly a tactical calculation.Councils, campaigners and charities have been promised reform for the best part of 20 years and so there is a genuine appreciation that this government is doing something at a time when money is so tight.But there is also a belief that establishing a cap - even at a higher rate - is an important stepping stone.As one person involved in lobbying the government told me: ""This will create a new contract between the state and individual over social care.... when it happens we can then start pushing government to make it more generous.""An announcement on the cap, it is fair to say, will not signal the end of the debate."

The US government faces mounting criticism over its surveillance operations after the leaks of US whistle-blower Edward Snowden.The court, whose rulings are normally kept secret, said the NSA may have violated US law for collecting as many as 56,000 emails on an annual basis between 2008 and 2011. But intelligence officials speaking to reporters anonymously say the scooping of emails was unintentional, blaming it on a technological problem. The NSA was unable to separate out emails between Americans with no direct connection to terrorism, so the agency was collecting tens of thousands of ""wholly domestic communications"" every year, the court documents said. In the ruling, Judge John Bates criticised the NSA over the breach of privacy, marking it as ""the third instance in less than three years in which the government has disclosed a substantial misrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection programme"".The court found that the data gathering violated the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution, prohibiting ""unreasonable searches and seizures"".The court's opinions, which are usually kept secret, were revealed by the government in response to a Freedom of Information request. Government officials said that the court rulings had been declassified to show that eavesdropping programmes at fault had been found and fixed, highlighting its oversight measures.The scope of the NSA's massive surveillance programme, which sweeps up internet traffic and phone records, was exposed in June in leaks to media by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.Earlier this month, President Barack Obama promised to be more transparent about US spying programmes, with ""appropriate reforms"" to guarantee greater oversight."

It's now up to the House to do the same,"" Mr Obama said in a statement.""As this process moves forward, I urge everyone who cares about this issue to keep a watchful eye. Now is the time when opponents will try their hardest to pull this bipartisan effort apart so they can stop common-sense reform from becoming a reality. We cannot let that happen.""Members of the Senate's so-called Gang of Eight, the bipartisan group of senators who drafted the bill and hoped a resounding vote total would pressure the House, echoed the plea.""To our friends in the House, we ask for your consideration and we stand ready to sit down and negotiate with you,"" Republican Senator John McCain said.""You may have different views on different aspects of this issue, but all of us share the same goal, and that is to take 11 million people out of the shadows, secure our borders and make sure that this is the nation of opportunity and freedom.""At a news conference, Republican House Speaker John Boehner said the House would chart its own legislation with a focus on border security.How exactly Mr Boehner will proceed remained unclear, but the Speaker has called a special meeting of his majority Republicans for 10 July to go over options.""The House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes. We're going to do our own bill,"" he said.The bill passed by the Senate devotes $46bn (£30bn, 35 euros) to border security improvements, including calling for a doubling of the border patrol stationed on the US-Mexico border and the completion of 1,100km of fencing - changes added at the last minute to attract Republican support.No-one would be able to get a permanent resident green card until those border enhancements and others were in place.The bill also makes it mandatory for employers to check their workers' legal status, sets up new visa programmes to allow workers into the country and establishes new tracking systems at seaports and airports to keep better tabs on people entering and leaving the country.At its contentious core, though, is the 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants living in the US illegally.Without such a provision, senators say the legislation could not pass the Senate. With it, its prospects are difficult in the House.Mr Boehner declined to say whether there were circumstances under which he could support a pathway to citizenship, but he made clear that securing the border was a priority."

Several thousand women wait to receive their bounty in the humid early evening air. Many of them have dressed-up for the rally, their shalwar kameezes a riot of colour, their foreheads decorated with bright bindis (dots of colour). They are here to celebrate the birthday of the late Bal Thackeray, the founder of Shiv Sena.  Little-known outside Mumbai, Shiv Sena wields extraordinary power in India's economic capital. Founded in 1966 by Thackeray, a political cartoonist at the time, the party initially pushed for the rights of the native Maharashtrian community in the face of a wave of immigration from South India. With a militant wing, a fondness for bandhs (mass strikes) and violence, Shiv Sena has been a major political force in the city, winning control of the state of Maharashtra in 1995. The charismatic figure of Thackeray led the strikes until his death in November last year.In the wake of the horrifying Delhi rape case in December, Shiv Sena has turned its focus to the issue that is dominating the country's newspapers and television channels - women's rights. I spoke to the girl next to me on the bus the morning I arrived in Mumbai, a student from Chennai. She disapproved of Shiv Sena's politics, she said, but claimed that the party's white-coated ""moral police force"" had made life better for women in Mumbai. She had taken a train at midnight the night before, something she would never be able to do in her home city. The culture of ""Eve teasing"" - an ugly euphemism for sexual harassment - is far less pronounced in Mumbai than in any of India's other major cities and Shiv Sena can take much of the credit for this. While the party has its bigots and bruisers, its record on putting forward female candidates, on speaking out against practices such as sati (the banned practice of burning widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands) and forced marriage, is impressive.I arranged to meet Thackeray's biographer, the political journalist Vaibhav Purandare, in The Gaylord - a glitzy restaurant in south Mumbai. I walked to our rendezvous through Churchgate and past the hockey stadium which still carries traces of recent Shiv Sena protests that forced the Pakistani team to flee the country. We sat outside, looking out on to a road lined with vine-clad baobab trees in which hooded crows cackled and croaked. I asked Purandare about the party's role as defender of the city's women.""Shiv Sena is facing a crisis of identity,"" he told me. ""Since they lost power in the state in 1999, they've been struggling. They are desperately looking for issues. ""Suddenly, since the rape on the Delhi bus, people are concerned about the safety of women. There are spontaneous protests, the feeling that the government is not doing enough. Shiv Sena thinks it can cash in on this.""I asked him about reports of the party's ""moral police force"" attacking women for wearing short skirts and harassing couples for walking arm-in-arm in public. ""There's some truth to those stories,"" Purandare told me, ""but they aren't just brutal thugs."" And this is from a man whose face bears the scars of a recent run-in with the Shiv Sena militia, while reporting on a city-wide strike. He escaped with two broken cheekbones. ""The Maharati community has strong, independent-minded women,"" he continued.""In a Maharati family it's the women who call the shots and Shiv Sena needs to work with this, to appeal to them.""The next morning I walked along Marine Drive, to a meeting with one of the rising political stars of Shiv Sena - Shweta Parulekar. She is a serious, self-contained woman dressed in saffron and red and frowns at my description of Shiv Sena as a party of violence. ""What can you do if you try all of the normal, legal methods?"" she asked, holding up her hands. ""Ultimately, what does the common man do? He goes out on to the streets."" Parulekar called the handing out of knives by the party: ""A publicity stunt, to make a point."" From the brief time we spent together I cannot think the pun is intended. On the television that evening, a local Shiv Sena leader energetically defended the arming of the city's female population. ""Bal Thackeray used to say women should prefer a rampuri (knife) in their purse, to a lipstick,"" he said. ""This government has failed to provide security to women so we are distributing these knives to empower them."" I tried to buy one from a plump grandmother at the rally as a souvenir, but she was unwilling to part with it. She showed it to me, though.

Mr Borda and Mr Miranda said they would celebrate their wedding in September. It would be a ""very public affair"", not only because they wanted to share the moment with ""all the world"", but also because they wanted ""to give an example to those gay couples who may be thinking about getting married but don't dare to"", the couple added.Three years ago, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to allow same-sex marriages.Since then, Brazil's Supreme Court overwhelmingly voted in favour of granting same-sex couples the same legal rights as married heterosexuals, effectively authorising gay marriage. In Colombia, a judge recently ordered a notary to sign a document which - while not a marriage certificate - in effect gave a same-sex couple the same rights as a heterosexual one.In Mexico, legislation on same-sex unions is a matter for individual states. Gay marriage is legal in the capital and the southern state of Quintana Roo, while the states of Coahuila and Colima allow gay couples to enter into civil unions. Gay marriage remains illegal in the rest of the country. The gay-marriage bill is among a series of liberal reforms in Uruguay backed by President Mujica.Since the left-wing politician came to power, parliament has also passed a law allowing abortion beyond cases of rape, incest or threats to a woman's health.Last week, the House of Representatives voted in favour of a bill which, if passed by the Senate, will legalise marijuana and put its production and sale into the hands of the state."

""We have been working over the past several months to improve our systems to respond to reports of violations, but the guidelines used by these systems have failed to capture all the content that violates our standards.""Facebook has been involved in a number of recent rows over content.At the beginning of May, it reversed a decision not to remove a video which showed a man being beheaded as it did not break the social network's policy.Following this most recent outcry, Ms Levine put forward several changes the social network would be making.She said Facebook would consult lawyers and interest groups to upgrade its guidelines on removing hate speech.Training of staff will be stepped up, again by working with interest groups to ensure coaching is appropriate.Facebook also pledged to work to make sure the posters of such material were made to ""stand behind the content they create"" so that other users could hold them accountable.Commenting on Ms Levine's blog post, many Facebook users expressed annoyance at the length of time it had taken for the issues to be addressed.""It took incredible public pressure for you to look at it... you should have had the guts and morals to do it on your own!"", wrote one user.Facebook's response comes off the back of a large-scale online campaign from a number of prominent women's rights groups. They included the Everyday Sexism Project, a site that uses social media to highlight what it sees as casual sexism in the media and other arenas.In addition to their letter to the social network, the groups also called on advertisers to boycott the site, noting that their advertising appeared alongside user-created pages showing images of violence towards women that were ""shared, boasted and joked about"".One petition calling for action closed with 225,049 signatures.The groups called on Facebook to take three specific actions. They were to:""Recognize speech that trivializes or glorifies violence against girls and women as hate speech and make a commitment that you will not tolerate this content.""Effectively train moderators to recognize and remove gender-based hate speech.""Effectively train moderators to understand how online harassment differently affects women and men, in part due to the real-world pandemic of violence against women.""According to campaigners Women, Action & the Media, one high-profile advertiser, Nissan, suspended its advertising on Tuesday.

Nor was President Barack Obama called away on urgent business.Rather, the guest of honour announced last month that she would not be attending. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was aggrieved that her private communications had apparently been snooped upon by American intelligence.In cancelling her state visit, she was making a pointed personal and national protest.On Wednesday afternoon, rather than preparing to welcome one of America's allies to the White House, Mr Obama found himself listening to grievances from another. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called to complain that her private mobile had been tapped.The president's spokesman assured the news media that the National Security Agency (NSA) ""is not monitoring and will not monitor"" her phone. But he was unable to tell her that it had not listened to her calls previously.His inability to speak in the past tense was tantamount to an admission that the NSA was guilty as charged.The ""Snowden effect"" has created an ever angrier diplomatic backlash. The secrets that the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden took with him when he left America are causing ructions around the world.On Monday, it was French President Francois Hollande who complained to Mr Obama about the vast surveillance operation the NSA had allegedly conducted against political and business figures in France.Mexico is annoyed that their president, Enrique Pena Nieto, and his predecessor Felipe Calderon, had been snooped upon. America has also been accused of bugging the United Nations and European Union.The latest allegations, published in Britain's Guardian newspaper, are that the phone conversations of 35 world leaders have been monitored.Doubtless, some of the outrage from aggrieved allies is intended for domestic consumption. And it is hardly as if America is the only country to spy on its allies.  But as the list of wronged friends grows by the day, the Snowden effect is not just complicating US diplomacy but also seriously compromising it.  When Secretary of State John Kerry touched down in Paris this week he was confronted by the spying allegations published in that morning's Le Monde.On the day Angela Merkel challenged her American counterpart, two senior Obama administration officials were in Berlin for talks on a new transatlantic trade deal called the biggest such agreement in history.For the Obama administration it is not merely a case of smoothing some ruffled feathers. Daily, it needs to put out diplomatic fires. And, increasingly, the damage looks as though it could be lasting. Consider the impact on the personal relationship between Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, which up until now has been close.""Spying among friends is not on,"" complained the German Chancellor at the EU Summit in Brussels. ""Trust will now have to be rebuilt."" Nor is it merely the NSA revelations that are hampering US diplomacy. This week John Kerry has been trying to allay Israel's concerns about America's openness to the recent overtures from the new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Saudi Arabia, its other main strategic ally in the Middle East, has also been dismayed that Washington has warmed towards Tehran.Fuelling its anger is what Prince Turki al-Faisal, a member of the royal family and former director of Saudi intelligence, this week described as the Obama administration's ""lamentable"" policy towards Syria. Riyadh's decision this month not to take up its seat on the UN Security Council was intended to send a message to the US, not the UN. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have similar misgivings over the president's failure to intervene more strongly in Syria's civil war.  Further afield, America is confronted by problems of its own making. Less than two years after announcing Washington's much-vaunted ""Asian pivot,"" the federal shutdown prevented Mr Obama from attending the key annual gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders. Instead, China was left to take centre stage.To argue that the NSA scandal threatens to damage Barack Obama in the same way that the Iraq War undercut George W Bush is surely too strong.The Bush administration's hyper-unilateralism and wilful disregard for the views of longstanding allies caused deep resentment in Europe.But this is turning out to be a major embarrassment for a president who entered office in 2009 determined to repair frayed relations with some of its longstanding allies, like France, and to restore America's international standing.

This is the first hard evidence that the state department did ask for changes to the CIA's original assessment.Specifically, they wanted references to previous warnings deleted and this sentence removed: ""We do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack.""There's little doubt in my mind that this will haunt Hillary Clinton if she decides to run for president, unless she executes some pretty fancy footwork.State department spokesperson Victoria Nuland is directly implicated, and the fingerprints of senior White House aides Ben Rhodes and Jay Carney are there as well.In the interests of full disclosure I have to say I have not in the past been persuaded that allegations of a cover-up were a big deal. It seemed to me a partisan attack based on very little. I remember listening to reports from the BBC and others at the time that did suggest the attack in Benghazi was a spontaneous reaction to a rather puerile anti-Islamic video.I understand President Barack Obama's careful use of the word ""terrorism"" when it actually means something, rather than as a knee-jerk description of any violence by foreigners against Americans, often in order to justify a ""war on terror"".But the evidence is there in black and white, unless we doubt the documents obtained by ABC, which I don't.Mr Obama's critics are often not very clear what is behind their allegations. I presume they think that the White House wanted to avoid claims the murders were the result of terrorism because this would undermine his claim that al-Qaeda was seriously ""degraded"". There's also a vague sense he's ""soft on terror"".The new documents contain two rationales for the changes in language. The first is that it would prejudice the FBI investigation. Perhaps, but I am not at all persuaded.The other reason given, old-fashioned butt-guarding, is more credible. As Ms Nuland puts it, such a report ""could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either?"" However you read the motives, the state department and apparently the White House did get the CIA to change its story. This is now very serious, and I suspect heads will roll. The White House will be on the defensive for a while."

The Wales and Chester Circuit of Barristers has voted unanimously to refuse to sign up to a new system regulating the quality of criminal lawyers in England and Wales.Barristers will also refuse to attend court if the plans are implemented.The UK coalition is trying to cut £2bn it spends on what it calls one of the world's most expensive legal systems.Possible changes to legal aid in criminal law include fee cuts of up to 17.5%, price-competitive tendering for legal aid contracts and clients no longer being able to choose their own defence lawyer. Andrew Taylor, a Cardiff-based barrister, told BBC's The Wales Report with Huw Edwards that he and his colleagues were striking because of the serious concerns they had that the changes would restrict people's access to justice in Wales. ""The justice system in Wales at the moment is very much in danger. The effect of these cuts if they come in, to Wales in particular, will be absolutely devastating,"" he said. ""Freedom of choice will go. The provision of legal services in Wales will be very much reduced. People will be denied access to justice.""The Ministry of Justice says that the changes to legal aid for criminal cases would save a further £220m per year by 2018-2019. The criminal legal aid consultation closes in June, but cuts to legal aid for civil cases have been in effect since the beginning of April. Legal aid is no longer available in most civil law cases involving employment and education, immigration, debt, housing, family, and clinical medical negligence. But a Bridgend family who relied on legal aid to fight their daughter's medical negligence case have called the legal aid cuts in this area ""unethical"".Emily Weaver, 26, was born with cerebral palsy, and when she was two, doctors failed to spot that a tube draining fluid from her brain had blocked. The delays in diagnosing and treating the problem caused her to suffer further brain damage, losing her sight and most of her hearing. Legal aid funded the Weavers' successful medical negligence claim which ultimately provided care and equipment for the rest of her life. But now, under the new rules, Ms Weaver would not be eligible for legal aid to take her case. Legal aid is only available in cases of clinical medical negligence where a child has suffered severe brain damage during pregnancy, or up until two months of age. Ms Weaver's father John said that without legal aid, they would not have been able to take the case. Lawyers are warning that without access to legal aid in many areas, more and more people will be forced to represent themselves in court. Mr Weaver said: ""To attack the most vulnerable people in society and people who already have a great disadvantage, and take away the little hope they've got, I don't care what government it is - it's unforgiveable.""In a statement to The Wales Report, Justice Minister Lord McNally said: ""In recent years, millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been spent effectively encouraging people to take their problems to court when there are often quicker, cheaper and less stressful options available. ""At £2bn a year we had one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world, and it was costing taxpayers too much at a time when resources are not limitless. ""We had to make some difficult decisions, and it was not a process we embarked on lightly, but we have safeguarded legal aid to ensure lawyers are there for those who really need them.""  The Wales Report is on Sunday, 28 April at 22:25 BST on BBC1 Wales."

Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid told the chamber on Monday evening: ""We've made tremendous progress.""We hope with good fortune... perhaps tomorrow will be a bright day. We're not there yet.""Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also sounded upbeat, hailing ""substantial progress"".Democratic Senator Mark Pryor told CNN he was ""pretty confident"" an agreement would be announced on Tuesday afternoon, but said some Republicans ""almost want a shutdown"".""They almost want to see us break the debt ceiling,"" he said.Republican Senator Richard Shelby called the proposed short-term agreement a ""temporary fix"".""It's punting because no one, Democrats, Republicans, wants to face up... to the tough reality that we're in,"" he told Associated Press news agency.Meanwhile, on Tuesday morning leaders of the Republicans who control the House of Representatives announced they intended to pursue their own debt ceiling and government funding bill.Their bill would alter the Affordable Care Act, Mr Obama's signature healthcare overhaul, delaying a tax on medical devices for two years and requiring income verification before insurance customers were eligible for government subsidies.Under that proposal, the government would be funded through 15 January and the debt ceiling lifted until 7 February.Mr Obama and congressional Democrats have said they are unwilling to negotiate over the Affordable Care Act while the government remains shut and the threat of a debt default looms.By Tuesday morning Democrats appeared to have fended off Republican attempts to force any major changes to President Obama's signature healthcare law.Conservative hardliners were initially vocal in demanding that the White House agree to delay or eliminate funding for the Affordable Care Act.However, Senate Republicans are still reportedly pushing for slight modifications to the law. According to US media, they want stricter measures to verify the incomes of those seeking health insurance subsidies. Other measures include the suspension of a per-employee tax paid by companies and labour unions who participate in the health law, and the establishment of a committee to negotiate a longer-term budget.Even if a deal is reached in the Senate, it is unclear whether Congress could act in time to pass legislation that would avert the 17 October default deadline.Hardline conservatives such as Texas Republican Ted Cruz could use Senate rules to stonewall a vote.In the House of Representatives, a deal could meet fierce resistance from the Tea Party-aligned Republicans.One of those conservative hardliners, Kansas Representative Tim Huelskamp, was quoted by the New York Times as labelling his upper chamber colleagues ""the Senate surrender caucus"".""Anybody who would vote for that [Senate deal] in the House as Republican would virtually guarantee a primary challenger,"" he said.Republicans have taken the brunt of blame for the latest fiscal cliffhanger to cripple Capitol Hill, according to opinion polls. A Washington Post/ABC News survey on Monday found 74% of voters were unhappy with congressional Republicans' handling of the standoff, compared with a 53% disapproval rating for President Obama.Some in the party have voiced concern that the affair could damage its prospects in next year's midterm elections.Economists and bankers have warned for weeks of dire consequences should Congress fail to reach an agreement on raising the nation's debt ceiling.The US Treasury has been using what are known as ""extraordinary measures"" to pay its bills since the nation reached its current debt limit in May.Those methods will be exhausted by 17 October, US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said.Meanwhile, the government remains partially shut down because Congress failed to agree on funding by a 1 October deadline.The impasse has closed a swathe of federal services and left hundreds of thousands of employees out of work.

But what exactly has the economic impact been?Standard & Poor's says the shutdown has cost the US economy $24bn (£15bn), shaving 0.6% off of economic growth this quarter.And investors have not been happy - particularly foreign nations, like China, which own US debt.The yield on short term US Treasury bonds - the amount the US government most pay to investors to hold US debt - has risen, increasing US borrowing costs and indicating that global investors have become unhappy with Washington wrangling.However, markets have not reacted as sharply as they did during prior budget negotiations, particularly during the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations that saw yet another last-minute deal.Overall, US stocks are up 18% for the year.The business community remains focused on other concerns, like when the Federal Reserve will begin to ease off its extraordinary efforts to prop up the US economy - something the central bank says will not happen any time soon, partially due to Washington dysfunction.""They're going to eventually get to a compromise and then we'll move on,"" O'Neil Securities trader Kenny Polcari told the BBC from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.A veteran trader, Mr Polcari was also at the NYSE during the last government shutdown, from 1995-96. Back then, he remembers, markets sold off but then actually rebounded. ""A government shutdown is not necessarily a comment on the state of the US economy,"" says Mr Polcari.""All indications are that the US economy is starting to turn a corner.""Benedict Willis, another trader at the NYSE, said that in fact, companies might start to use the shutdown as a way to justify less than stellar third-quarter results.""Every company will look for an excuse if they're weak,"" says Mr Willis, a managing director at Albert Fried & Company.""The government has certainly given them one.""For many businesses, another debt squabble in Washington is just background noise during a time of good, if not great, economic growth. ""The difference between now and a couple years ago was that a couple years ago we were coming out the depths of a recession,"" says David Zarin, who owns a fabric store on Manhattan's Lower East Side.During the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011, he says he saw his business decline in the wake of so much uncertainty at a fragile time of the US economic recovery.Now, while business isn't as a robust as it was before the crisis, he's no longer as sensitive to what he calls ""Washington posturing.""""Frankly, I'm a little numb,"" he says.One place, however, was significantly impacted by the shutdown.According to George Mason University professor George Fuller, the Washington DC area lost an estimated $220m a day while federal workers and contractors were furloughed.Overall, the federal government accounts for one-third of the region's economy.Furthermore, uncertainty is never good for hiring.One-half of bosses surveyed by the Business Roundtable ""indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months"".Consumer confidence measures plunged as a result of the shutdown - not a good sign for the US economy, because consumers account for 70% of all spending.Furthermore, the shutdown impacted the release of economic data, particularly important measures of job creation and prices.So the full impact of the shutdown may not be understood for many months, until the various agencies responsible for collecting and releasing the data can get restarted."

Economic ties between the two are already stronger than most realise.The UK is the number one source country for foreign direct investment projects in Texas, valued at $2.5bn (£1.7bn) and accounting for 22% of such investments, according to a report by the Texas Office of the Governor's economic development and tourism department.On many levels, the UK and Texas could not be more different. Texas, which is three times larger than the UK, is a low-tax state that abhors centralised governmental interference and is sceptical about the UK's brand of social welfare. But when it comes to business, the odd couple is finding common ground.""Competitive economies like Texas and the United Kingdom stand to gain the most from this process of liberalisation,"" says Philip Barton, deputy head of mission at the British Embassy in Washington.""This is a strategic moment for the US and EU to come together on trading standards and gain a commercial advantage.""Texas' exports to the EU totalled $29bn last year. In 2011, Texan companies exported more than $4bn worth of materials to the UK - a 22% increase over 2010's exports - making the UK the third most popular European export destination after the Netherlands and Belgium, according to the US Department of Commerce.UK is the top source country in three out of Texas' top five sectors for attracting foreign direct investment, namely software and IT, business services and industrial equipment. In oil, gas and mining, the UK is second behind Canada and in communication it's fourth behind China, South Korea and Japan.""The UK is incredibly important to Texas,"" says state representative Rafael Anchia, who chairs the Texas House Committee on International Trade and Intergovernmental Affairs. ""It ranks at or near the top in many trading categories and is responsible for tens of thousands of jobs."" And Texas can offer plenty in return, he insists, pointing to how it is - in standalone terms - the 14th largest economy in the world, in a prime geographic spot in North America, the world's most powerful economic engine, offering ready access to attractive markets in Canada and Mexico.With plenty of wind power and cheap oil and natural gas from fracking, good value commercial real estate and wages that are much lower than those in, say, New York, investors could do worse, he believes.More than 80% of UK-based foreign direct investment projects in Texas are located in Houston, Dallas and Austin, including companies such as Rolls-Royce, BP and Aveva.BAE Systems has more than 1,600 employees in nine Texas locations. In Fort Worth, it supplies Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet assembly line with fuselages.These are constructed by 2,000 workers in BAE Systems' plant in Samlesbury, Lancashire, and the new aircraft represents the largest military procurement programme in history, says Ian Reason, vice-president for F-35 BAE Systems. The programme is projected to run into the 2030s and, based on current assumptions, produce more than 3,000 aircraft -138 going to the Royal Air Force - which will require support into the 2060s.BAE Systems is one of 130 British companies supplying the F-35 programme, which is worth more than $1.5bn per year to UK industry and will support about 25,000 British jobs over the next 25 years.The proposed US-EU free trade agreement would not provide any direct advantages for BAE Systems in Texas, Mr Reason says, though like any business it would benefit from the potentially huge economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.""This is the best stimulus package you will get for free,"" he says."
4336	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24342521	News	1	Economy	International News	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"As the United States approached a budget crisis that will shut down many federal services and affect more than 700,000 workers, other countries looked on with a mixture of puzzlement and dread. For most of the world, a government shutdown is very bad news - the result of revolution, invasion or disaster. Even in the middle of its ongoing civil war, the Syrian government has continued to pay its bills and workers' wages. That leaders of one of the most powerful nations on earth willingly provoked a crisis that suspends public services and decreases economic growth is astonishing to many. American policymakers ""are facing the unthinkable prospect of shutting down the government as they squabble over the inconsequential accomplishment of a 10-week funding extension"", Mexico's The News wrote in an editorial. In the United States, however, government shutdowns - or the threat thereof - have become an accepted negotiating tactic, thanks to the quirks of the American federal system, which allows different branches of government to be controlled by different parties. It was a structure devised by the nation's founders to encourage compromise and deliberation, but lately has had just the opposite effect. Elsewhere in the world, such shutdowns are practically impossible. The parliamentary system used by most European democracies ensures that the executive and legislature are controlled by the same party or coalition. Conceivably, a parliament could refuse to pass a budget proposed by the prime minister, but such an action would likely trigger a failure of the government and a new election - witness the current situation in the Netherlands, where Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government faced a no-confidence vote at the start of debate over his 2014 budget proposal. And even when there is a gap prior to a new government taking office, national services continue to operate. In non-parliamentary democracies, such as Brazil, a strong executive branch has the ability to keep the lights on during a budget impasse. Such was the case in the United States as well, until a 1980 Carter administration interpretation of the 1884 Anti-Deficiency Act strictly limited the powers of federal agencies in the absence of congressional funding authorisations.Now, as the latest shutdown crisis plays out, policymakers in other nations are left to ponder the worldwide impact of the impasse.""Globalisation … means every country is in it together,"" writes David Blanchflower in the Independent in the UK. ""Americans sneeze and Brits catch the flu."" ""Canadians can only pray their economy won't be collateral damage,"" writes John Ibbitson in Canada's Globe and Mail. ""Anything that drags down the American economy drags the Canadian economy down with it."" And this could be another reason why the United States has shutdown crises and other countries don't - because the United States can afford to. At least up until now, the American economy has been able to continue to grind along despite shutdown disruptions that would stagger other nations. ""Constant-shutdown, permanent-emergency governance is so destructive that no other serious country engages in or could tolerate it,"" James Fallows writes in the Atlantic. ""The United States can afford it only because we are - still - so rich, with so much margin for waste and error."" "

Now, foreign aid groups that rely on US support fear the cuts will devastate the people in the most desperate need.When Jeremy Konyndyk, director of policy for Mercy Corps, talks about budget cuts in the US, he barely mentions the impact the reductions will have on Americans.Instead, he worries about people overseas - such as those he met recently in Niger.In January, Konyndyk visited a village in the county's Ouallam region, roughly 62 miles (100km) from Niamey, where he met a group of about 20 women who had received a goat through a food-security programme.""This programme at least gives them some prospects for getting through the drought without getting totally wiped out,"" he says. The budget cuts, he says, will make it harder to help those and other women in Niger. The US Congress has slashed $85bn from US spending for this fiscal year, which ends in October. The deficit reduction measures are referred to in Washington DC jargon as sequestration.In Washington, White House officials say the cuts will affect everything from White House tours (cancelled) to domestic airline flights (delayed). Despite those claims, though, some of the cuts to the budget will barely be felt. ""It's not the end of the world,"" says Gordon Adams, an American University professor who was a senior budget official in the Clinton White House. ""It's a haircut.""But the cuts affect not only Americans - people around the world will see its impact. European officials may spend less time in meetings, for example, because their counterparts in Washington will be making fewer overseas trips. Some Pentagon officials have already cancelled trips to Europe this spring.But for people living in other parts of the world, the impact could be more significant. The US is the world's largest provider of humanitarian aid, according to the London-based Overseas Development Institute. The US also offers military assistance to countries in the Middle East and other regions and funds programmes for global health, refugee aid and more.The March law writing the cuts into the budget slashed funding for these and other programmes by roughly 5%.More than $2.7bn will be taken from state department foreign operations and other programmes, according to the Congressional Research Service.In some cases the cuts will affect government institutions in other countries. Aid to countries such as Egypt (the US provides roughly $1.3bn annually to its military) and Israel (roughly $3bn annually) also may be reduced.The budgetary reductions will have an impact on individuals, say aid workers, since the cuts will be applied to programmes already stretched thin.Contributions to international peacekeeping, which helps to tamp down on violence in conflict-ridden countries such as Mali, will be reduced by $20m.And funds for humanitarian programmes, which help families in the Horn of Africa and other places in crisis, will be cut by roughly $200m, state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland has said.Efforts to fight disease in Africa may also be affected, since global health programmes will lose more than $400m in US funding.""We work on programmes for the most needy people on the planet,"" says Tom Hart, US executive director for the ONE Campaign, the advocacy group founded by U2's Bono. ""These people are living on the edge. About a million kids won't be vaccinated. A million bed nets that prevent malaria won't be distributed.""Hart and other advocates fear the lives of many people overseas will become harder if aid programmes, which include food security and agricultural projects, are reduced.And many humanitarian aid workers say their programmes are already financially strapped.""At this point, we are facing an acute number of crises,"" says Jeremy Kadden, a senior legislative manager at InterAction, a consortium of non-governmental organisations based in the US. ""We have more people in need than ever before.""Konyndyk of Mercy Corps says the budget cuts chip away at efforts to help people in other parts of the world and put Americans in a bind.""The government is faced with a kind of Sophie's choice,"" he says. ""Which disaster do you save?"""

About 70% of payments since 2010 were to men living overseas who married women who had a UK National Insurance contribution record.A draft Consumer Rights Bill, to be published in the summer by the government, will bring together a range of consumer protection that has built up over time.It will also update the law to introduce new protection for consumer who buy digital content, such as e-books, digital music, games and software.The draft bill will also outline detail such as amount of time consumers have to return faulty goods for repair, replacement or refund.Trading standards officers will also be given the power to seek compensation from the courts on behalf of consumers. Consumer groups have welcomed the plan to change the law which they regarded as outdated, and to simplify legislation to make it easier for consumers to be aware of their rights.The Trading Standards Institute (TSI) said it welcomed the move, but urged the government not to dilute the powers of trading standards officers powers to enter premises unannounced, currently part of the plans.Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy secretary, said that the plans failed to address issues such as excessive charges on private pensions, and costs affecting consumers such as high rail fares.On energy, there will be legislation aimed at incentivising businesses to invest in new sources of low-carbon power, from wind farms to nuclear power stations.The Bill will also set up a ""capacity market"" aimed at ensuring continuity of electricity supply during periods of peak demand.Other highlights of the legislative programme include: A National Insurance Contributions Bill that aims to reduce business employment costs with the introduction of a £2,000 Employment Allowance. The Bill will also crack down on the use of offshore payroll companies as way of avoiding employer NICs.A Deregulation Bill to ""reduce the burden of excessive legislation on businesses"" by repealing existing laws that no longer have any ""practical use"".The Intellectual Property Bill aims to make it easier for businesses to protect their intellectual property, particularly their designs, with the introduction of a Unified Patent Court that most EU countries have signed up to.The Water Bill aims to make Britain's water supply ""more resilient"" in the face of increasing droughts and floods through the creation of a national water supply network. The Bill also aims to encourage competition by allowing business customers to switch their water and sewerage supplier."

""Of course, we live in very complex and dangerous times, as we saw again just today at our embassy in Ankara, where we were attacked.""But she said she was ""more optimistic"" now than when she took up her post in 2009.""I am so grateful that we've had a chance to contribute in each of our ways to making our country and our world stronger, safer, fairer and better,"" she told staff.Earlier in the day, Mrs Clinton officially tendered her resignation to President Barack Obama, her former bitter rival in the 2008 race for the Democratic presidential nomination. In her letter, she said she was more convinced than ever of America's strength as a global leader and its potential to be a force for good.Mrs Clinton has been coy about a possible White House run in four years' time. She has said she has no specific plans for the future, but that she ""absolutely"" still plans to make a difference on issues she cares about.""I am going to be secretary of state until the very last minute when I walk out the door,"" she told the Associated Press on Thursday.""And then I am going to take the weekend off and then I may start thinking about all the various offers and requests and ideas that have come my way.""Mrs Clinton's time in office will also be remembered for the attack last September on a consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed a US ambassador and three other Americans.

4385	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-21573733	Opinion	1	Elections	International News	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	Italians have voted in the country's general election.The election was called two months early after Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom party withdrew support for Mario Monti's government.Mr Monti's reform and austerity measures have been unpopular with many voters.BBC News website readers in Italy have given their views on the election.The atmosphere in Rome is vibrant. This election feels different from the previous ones.I voted for the Democratic Party. I like the party's leader, Pier Luigi Bersani. I feel I can trust him. Italy doesn't need another big personality like Berlusconi. Berlusconi came along and he seemed to be acting on behalf of everyone in Italy. People really believed what he told them.But Italy has had many problems with corruption. I feel that this is Italy's chance to finally get rid of Berlusconi. But more than that, it's the first real chance to get over the past and vote for a change in the country.Beppe Grillo, the leader of the Five Star Movement, is too distractive. He has a big personality and a lot of people are voting for him as a protest vote, rather than for his policies.We have many problems in Italy with our culture. People often stick with their political ideologies and are reluctant to change. They may vote for the same party as their parents.But this election represents an opportunity for Italians to take responsibility and change things for the better. In this election I finally withdrew my support for Berlusconi after supporting him for 20 years.Italy needs change. It needs new politicians - honest men and women. I voted for Mario Monti. I wanted to support a new party, so I didn't vote for Bersani's Democratic Party or Berlusconi's People of Freedom because these parties are old.The Five Star Movement is new, but it's only really a movement of protest. It is a party without structure. For deep change to take place, a party needs structure.Italy has many problems, including economical ones. It's strange to have this feeling of stillness and stagnation in the country. Many sectors are no longer doing well. For example, building and mechanical engineering aren't seeing much movement. We need to relaunch our markets and show our excellence in mechanics, food, fashion and tourism.We can't bear all this mess and disorder any longer. Only Berlusconi has the experience to deal with the situation. The Beppe Grillo movement is an Italian phenomenon that is so bog-standard here. No-one will vote for him. All will pretend to have voted for Bersani and his Democratic Party, but I suspect many many more than predicted will vote for Berlusconi.  The one and only thing holding back Italy is the Euro.  It is fixed at the wrong rate - the German one - and Italy's pricing points across the board are not geared to Germany's pricing points.At the very least, Berlusconi will have a strong say in the next legislation, and he just might win the election and become prime minister again.I have lived here for years with my Italian husband and three children.My husband and I both chose to vote for Beppe Grillo and the Five Star Movement. The alternatives are simply the same old, often corrupt candidates just re-presenting themselves.Before the many complex issues are dealt with here, we need new faces who can give people hope that we can finally turn the page over and start over.Things are not in the best shape here. A lot of people that were previously complacent and have good jobs in local authorities and banks, are now suffering and finding that they are not getting paid.I don't normally go for extremes, and the same is true in elections. But I get the impression that Beppe Grillo is an honest man and ready to represent the people.Italy desperately needs representatives who are trustworthy and genuine to improve things for everyone. We don't want politicians simply looking to line their own pockets. Voting for Grillo is really the only effective way of getting that message across. Fingers crossed that things are going to change for the better here.I voted for Mario Monti because I think he worked well during the technocratic government. If Silvio Berlusconi obtains a considerable proportion of the vote, we are in danger. We are in a deep recession after 20 years of his government, but a lot of Italians still vote for him because he is a good communicator. I am worried about our public debt. I believe that we can't have real growth with this dangerous state.Monti wants to reduce our huge public debt and to reduce our high cost of work to encourage companies hiring workers. He thinks our companies have to become more competitive on the international scene and invest more in research and development.Unfortunately, Mario Monti's party has not engaged in civil matters very much, such as looking at marriage for homosexuals or immigration issues. He wants economic and fiscal reform, but he remains conservative about civil rights.

America, on the other hand, is still mired in a months-long process that only brings the country down.Republicans are gathered near Washington for the 40th annual running of the bulls known as the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).  This year, CPAC marks the unofficial beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign. Sadly.American campaigns have evolved, or devolved, into ultra-marathons far longer than in any other democracy in the world.  Few Americans would disagree with the propositions that elections are too expensive, that they impede sensible governance, that they devour the time and energy of officials on the taxpayers' payroll and that they have become more obnoxious. Measured by polling, trust and confidence in politicians, government institutions and the news media have declined steadily since the 1970s when campaigns began their relentless growth. Reformers have tried to repair the election process with equal relentlessness. Since Watergate, efforts to curb the costs of campaigns have been tried and failed. Indeed, the flow of money in and out of campaign and special-interest war chests is less transparent than ever. Projects to make debates more enlightening, ads more honest, journalism more highbrow and politics more civil have been tried and tried. Yet the simplest fix of all, shortening the campaign season, has never been put on the table. Long elections are an anomaly in US history and internationally. Most democracies seem to have learned that campaigns bring out the worst in politicians so best to keep them short. In parliamentary systems, campaigns generally take four to six weeks. The last campaigns in the France and the UK took one month. Israel's last election began on 9 October, 2012 and the voting was held on 22 January. Canada's longest campaign ever lasted 74 days.It took the Catholic Church and its 1.2 billion followers just a month to elect a new pope. The official American presidential campaign season lasts 10 months, from the New Hampshire primary in early January to the voting on the first Tuesday in November.But the overt, semi-official campaign is now between 23-24 months. The new custom is for candidates to officially declare themselves in the months after the congressional mid-term elections, two years before the next presidential vote.And the unofficial campaign? Well, the 2016 cycle has started.  A few weeks after the inaugural tents were cleared from the Capitol, Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, published a new book and appeared on every major political news show. Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio gave ""big"" speeches at CPAC that were slathered in news coverage and punditry.  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the potential candidate the press corps seems to like most for now, wasn't invited to CPAC and that, of course, is an enormous story. The ills of the Permanent Campaign are obvious.  There is a legitimate argument about whether the cost of campaigns is as malevolent as the press assumes. The last presidential race cost something north of $5bn (£3.3bn) by most estimates.  Some see the ads, emails and tweets this money funds as important expressions of free speech, signs of an engaged and argumentative democracy. They might add that $5bn is peanuts compared with the money spent advertising snack food, soda pop, beer or cars. What is not debatable is that campaigning is now a big business.  The $5bn spent this cycle doesn't include state and local elections, referenda and mid-term races. There is a campaign industry, and it has become a vested interest, an industry that wants to grow, not shrink - an industry that doesn't just influence officeholders, it creates them.My experience is that about nine in 10 members of Congress hate the long campaigns - the perpetual fundraising, the distraction, the triviality, the nasty ads, the indignities.  But there is a professional class of political consultants who love expensive campaigns.Television stations love campaigns that buy and buy ad time. Reporters love campaigns because they are easier to cover than government, which can be boring and technical. Perhaps these are some of the reasons why the rather obvious idea of trying to shorten the campaigns we all complain about isn't on the menu of good government reforms. Legally, it wouldn't be hard to adjust the duration of election races, but the nuts and bolts are tough.Campaigns are longer because the primary elections where parties choose their candidates come earlier and earlier in election years. Moving primary elections closer to general elections would solve the problem. The dates of primaries are chosen by state legislatures but are heavily influenced by what the national party organisations want.If both parties got together to lobby states to shorten the electoral calendar, it would happen. The two parties, for example, co-operate to organise the presidential debates. Congress could have a role. The uniform general election day - the first Tuesday of November - was established by Congress, not the Constitution.  I imagine there are constitutional challenges to Congress making rules about primary dates, but it is an interesting question.Short of that, the US will need some kind of College of Cardinals to resurrect the older and better way of holding elections. It shouldn't take so long to declare,Habemus Presidentum."

4397	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22922141	Opinion	0	Elections	International News	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The victory of reformist-backed figure Hassan Rouhani in Iran's 14 June presidential election has a number of uncomfortable messages for the country's ruling right-wing establishment. Mr Rouhani was not the reformists' first, or even the second, choice of candidate. Most had pinned their hopes on former President Mohammad Khatami, but he did not put his name forward. The reformists then looked to the pragmatic veteran politician Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, who was disqualified from standing by Iran's top election body, the Guardian Council. And when Mohammad Reza Aref, the only reformist candidate in the running, withdrew earlier this week in favour of Mr Rouhani, the reformists reached a consensus and threw their weight behind him.His victory in the first round - when he unexpectedly gained 50.7% of the votes in a turnout of over 72% - has certainly emboldened the reform movement. After four years of seeing their leaders placed under house arrest, many of them imprisoned and their media outlets curtailed, they sense that voters have given them a mandate for change.This is despite the fact that Mr Rouhani is seen as more of a ""moderate, centrist"" figure, rather than a ""true"" reformer in the vein of Green movement leaders Mir Hussein Mousavi  and Mehdi Karroubi, who are both under house arrest. The downbeat mood of the ""principle-ist"" - or conservative ruling coalition - is evident by the tone of their media. Tabnak news agency, which is affiliated to defeated principle-ist candidate Mohsen Rezai, set the agenda.An online editorial appearing a day after the poll and before the final outcome was announced, spoke of the 2013 presidential election as a ""necessary defeat for the principle-ists"".""The principle-ists must understand that they must be accountable and answerable,"" said the editorial. ""The principle-ists... must know that the era of monopolizing the media has ended.""The hardline Javan newspaper chose to put a gloss on the affair, concentrating on the reported high turnout. ""The Iranian nation, with its epic presence at polling stations, proved it has a strong bond with the Islamic system and again disappointed and defeated the enemy. This election, irrespective of the result, should be considered as a model for correcting the current political behaviour of groups and political activists."" The conservatives had assumed an easy ride. Apart from controlling all branches of state power, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) and virtually all the mainstream media, they have the ear of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So Mr Rouhani's outright victory must come as somewhat of a shock to the hardliners. It demonstrates that the pro-reformists have returned to Iran's political arena and are a still force to be reckoned with.""Moderation over extremism""Mr Rouhani himself seems to acknowledge the significance of the support he received from reformers in initial comments after his win. He called it a ""victory of moderation over extremism"", but warned that there would be ""no overnight solutions"" to Iran's many problems.He has also extended the hand of cooperation to Iran's establishment, pledging to work closely with the conservative-dominated parliament in his first meeting with Speaker Ali Larijani. Both camps await his first encounter with the press corps on Monday, when he can expect specific questions on the economy, the nuclear issue and Syria.But the question remains: Will the hardline establishment recognise the message of change that the electorate have sent them?"

The law has been criticised by Western politicians and human rights groups, and has raised concerns that visiting gay athletes and spectators could face discrimination or even legal action.Gay rights campaigners have launched a tentative campaign for a boycott of the Games, due to be held in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi in February.US President Barack Obama spoke out against the legislation on NBC's The Tonight Show, broadcast on Tuesday.""I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them,"" he said.It was in the best interests of Russia to ""make sure the Olympics work"", he added.""I think they understand that for most of the countries to participate in the Olympics, we wouldn't tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently,"" he said.Johnny Weir, the openly gay US figure skater, has told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he would not observe any boycott of the Games .""To attack Russia is silly.

4428	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22291239	Opinion	0	Gay Rights	International News	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Few things tweak the patriotic nerve of Australians more strongly than being outstripped by their trans-Tasman neighbours, New Zealand. Traditionally, the rivalry plays out on the sports field. Yet this month has seen a kind of legislative equivalent of the Bledisloe Cup, the annual rugby union clash between the All Blacks and the Wallabies. Rather than out-muscle the Australians, the Kiwis have out-reformed them. They did so by becoming the first Asia-Pacific nation to legalise same-sex marriage.In a country famed for its Maori hakas, the moment that the bill became law was celebrated in impromptu song: an Edelweiss moment, where the public gallery, then the well of the chamber itself, joined in a stirring rendition of the New Zealand love song, ""Pokarekare Ana,"" sung in the indigenous tongue. Not only did it became an instant YouTube sensation but it also highlighted the quietness on the issue from Australian parliamentarians. When last September the most recent gay marriage bill was put before the House of Representatives in Canberra, it was defeated 98 votes to 42.As if to emphasise the distance between the two neighbours on this question, the reform came from a conservative government led by Prime Minister John Key, whereas Australia's Labor leader Julia Gillard remains opposed.  Now the embattled Ms Gillard is under heightened pressure to shift her stance, although she has publicly reaffirmed her opposition since the historic vote in Wellington. Still, given most commentators believe she will suffer a landslide defeat in September's election, some supporters of same-sex marriage think she will not want to go down in history as perhaps the last Labor leader to oppose marriage equality. Her party, the ALP, is already officially in favour, though its policy is not binding either on the leader or her MPs.With or without her backing, Australia appears to be experiencing a transitional moment on this issue. Here, as was recently noted of America, the advocates of same-sex marriage have not yet won, but there is a mounting sense that its opponents have lost.""Those who agree with same sex marriage have gone from being in favour to being strongly in favour,"" says Rodney Croome, the national convenor of Australian Marriage Equality. ""Opponents have gone from 'strongly opposed' to 'opposed.'"" In both the pro- and anti-camps, he claims, there is a growing sense that reform is inevitable. Polls suggest that almost two-thirds of Australians support same-sex marriage, compared with just 38% in 2004. Backing is especially high among young people, 81% of whom are thought to agree with marriage equality. ""These are people who take concerns about gay marriage into the voting booth,"" says Mr Croome. ""They don't just support it, they passionately support it.""He predicts that the first of the two major political parties to embrace same-sex marriage could reap a political dividend of 1.3 million votes. ""This is a vote-winner, not a vote-loser,"" he claims. The Australian Greens, led until last year by an openly gay Senator, Bob Brown, are already strongly in favour.Many same-sex marriage advocates have given up already on Julia Gillard and are looking beyond the election, and the strong likelihood of a conservative government.""Like most Australians we are looking at the possibility of an Abbott government, and realise that we need to speak directly to conservatives,"" says Rodney Croome. ""This is a not a left-right issue. There are many conservative arguments for reform: chiefly, it's about individual freedom and the strengthening of relationships and the family.""For reformers, it helps that a number of leading conservatives have either voiced outright support for same-sex marriage or called for a conscience vote in parliament where lawmakers would be allowed to make up their own minds. The most significant backer is Barry O'Farrell, the premier of New South Wales and arguably the country's second most powerful conservative politician, who voiced support earlier this month. Malcolm Turnbull, the former Liberal leader, is also a supporter. Colin Barnett, the influential premier of Western Australian, remains opposed but thinks that MPs should be allowed to vote their conscience. The Liberal leader Tony Abbott, a former seminarian whose Catholicism is an important part of his political make-up, recently signalled a new openness to the idea of a conscience vote should he become prime minister. Recently, two of his daughters spoke out in favour of reform. His sister, Christine Forster, is very open about the fact she is in a same sex relationship.A shift in Republican thinking in America has also created an intellectual milieu among Australian conservatives far more receptive to change. The fact that New Zealand conservatives gave such vocal backing to same-sex marriage is also significant. The now famous parliamentary speech by the 63-year-old conservative National MP Maurice Williamson mocking the notion of some ""gay onslaught"" - which, like the song, also became a viral hit - has reverberated here. It was the precisely the kind of gruff, plain speaking that appeals to Australians.Less instrumental has been David Cameron's support for same-sex marriage. Partly because of his ""greening"" of the Conservative Party, he does not have much bearing over an Australian conservative movement that includes leading climate change sceptics. In this debate, Washington and Wellington have had more of an impact than Westminster.Tim Wilson, the policy director of the right-wing think tank, the Institute of Public Affairs, says there has been a sea-change amongst fellow conservative gays and lesbians. ""Five years ago, the issue didn't matter to gay Liberals,"" he says. ""Now it does. It's gone from a private matter to a public matter.""Practical rather than philosophical concerns have shifted the conservative mood, he reckons. ""When you get so many people coming out of the closet, it affects attitudes among mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, and friends and relatives. It's become a real thing for people, based on personal experience. That comes to be reflected in our politics."" For many conservatives, he says, this is a basic question of fairness, more so than equality. Religiosity, which is nowhere near as central to Australian politics as it is to American politics, is not as big an obstacle. Indeed, an irony of the Canberra debate is that Julia Gillard is an atheist, whereas Barack Obama had to reconcile his newfound support for same-sex marriage with the Biblical teachings he had grown up to believe. Australians overwhelmingly do not have a problem with an unmarried prime minister, who lives with her partner, Tim Matheson, in The Lodge. It is simply not an issue, as it would be, say, in America. The polls suggest that a majority of Australians exhibit the same spirit of tolerance on the question of same marriage. "

It needs upper house endorsement, too.The vote follows the case of an Indian woman who died in hospital after she was refused an abortion.The debate revealed deep splits in the predominantly Catholic country.Opponents say the bill could lead to more widespread abortion.Anti-abortion campaigners say that the bill will allow the intentional killing of the unborn for the first time in the Republic of Ireland.For them, it is not just a religious but a human rights issue as they believe that in any pregnancy the mother and foetus have equal rights to life.Others argue the bill is too limited as it does not allow for terminations in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality.Nor does it allow for termination when the foetus cannot survive outside the womb.Members of parliament (TDs) backed the proposal shortly after midnight, after two hotly debated sessions.  Those who support access to abortion say the bill ignores the fact that, on average, 11 women leave the country every day for an abortion in Britain.Since a Supreme Court ruling in 1992, known as the X case, abortion has been constitutionally available when a woman's life, as distinct from her health, is at risk from the continued pregnancy.X was a suicidal 14-year-old schoolgirl who had been raped by a neighbour and was initially prevented from leaving the country for an abortion in Britain.Since then, the credible threat of suicide is, constitutionally, regarded as grounds for a termination.But in the intervening years, until now, no government has introduced legislation to give doctors legal certainty on when an abortion can be carried out. And that uncertainty provided part of the context for the Savita Halappanavar case. She was a 31-year-old Indian dentist who was admitted to hospital in Galway in October 2012 while miscarrying.She died a week later from septicaemia.Her request for an abortion was turned down.Her inquest heard that she could not get a termination at the time because her life was not in danger but, by the time her life was at risk, an abortion would have been too late to save her.The Fine Gael-Labour coalition government says its proposed legislation will bring the law and constitution into line.There have been consequences for TDs who did not support the changes proposed.Fine Gael Junior Minister of State for European Affairs, Lucinda Creighton, voted against the government on the amendment. As a result, she was automatically expelled from the party.She said she felt ""deeply and strongly"" that aspects of the bill were based on ""flawed logic and absolutely zero medical evidence"".Last week, four other Fine Gael TDs, were removed from the party after they voted against the bill's first reading in the Dáil.Sinn Féin TD Peadar Toibín also chose to vote against the amendment, which was supported by his party.In a statement, Sinn Féin said all of its TDs had been ""mandated"" to vote for the legislation.""The decision this evening by Peadar Toibín TD to vote against the Sinn Féin position is a serious breach of party rules,"" said Sinn Féin's party whip in the Dáil, Aengus Ó Snodaigh.""As a consequence Peadar Toibín has been suspended from Sinn Féin for six months with immediate effect."""

""In other words, they demanded ransom just for doing their job.""Mr Obama had been scheduled to begin his four-nation Asian trip on Saturday, heading to Bali for an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit and Brunei for the East Asia summit before travelling on to Malaysia and the Philippines.National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden called the cancellation of the trip ""another consequence of the House Republicans forcing a shutdown of the government"". ""This completely avoidable shutdown is setting back our ability to promote US exports and advance U.S. leadership in the largest emerging region in the world,"" she said.The White House said that ""logistically, it was not possible to go ahead"" with the trips to Malaysia and the Philippines.""Because they are on the back end of the president's upcoming trip, our personnel was not yet in place and we were not able to go forward with planning,"" the White House said in a statement.""Unlike the Apec and East Asia Summits, these trips can also be rescheduled, and President Obama looks forward to visiting Malaysia and the Philippines later in his term.""Earlier, the office of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Mr Obama had called him to inform him that Secretary of State John Kerry would address an entrepreneurship conference in Kuala Lumpur on 11 October in his place.""I empathise and understand,"" Mr Najib told the media. ""If I were in his shoes, I would do the same.""Mr Obama has been forced to call off trips to Asia before because of issues at home.In 2010, a vote on healthcare and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill forced separate cancellations in March and June, though he did make it to India, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia in November of that year.The US government ceased operations deemed non-essential at midnight on Tuesday, when the previous budget expired.National parks and Washington's Smithsonian museums are closed, pension and veterans' benefit cheques will be delayed, and visa and passport applications will go unprocessed.However, members of the military will be paid. One group of elderly military veterans managed to bypass the shutdown when the WWII Memorial in Washington DC - that they had travelled from Mississippi to see - was opened for them.Treasury department employee Peter Gamba told the BBC he was worried by the turn of events.""For whatever reason I cannot fathom, you're asking me to again give up my pay and give up service to the American public,"" he said.""It's a nightmare for me financially, it causes me a lot of anxiety and stress and I don't sleep well at night.""President Obama has blamed conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives for the government shutdown, saying ""one faction of one party"" was responsible because ""they didn't like one law"". Late on Tuesday the White House rejected a Republican plan to fund only a few portions of the government - national parks, veterans' programmes and the budget of the District of Columbia. The Republicans have called for more negotiations.A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner called the White House's position ""unsustainably hypocritical"".Rory Cooper, a spokesman for Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, accused Mr Obama of ""hyper-partisan speeches"".An opinion poll released on Tuesday suggested the American public disagreed with the Republican strategy.An estimated 72% of voters oppose Congress shutting down the federal government in order to block the health law, according a poll by Quinnipiac University.The healthcare law passed in 2010, was subsequently validated by the US Supreme Court, and was a major issue in the 2012 presidential election.The next key deadline in the US is 17 October, when the government reaches the limit at which it can borrow money to pay its bills, the so-called debt ceiling.House Republicans have demanded a series of policy concessions - including on the health law and on financial and environmental regulations - in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.President Obama is due to meet the heads of some of Wall Street's biggest banks - including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America - to discuss the debt ceiling and other economic issues.The bankers are members of the Financial Services Forum, a lobbying group which has, along with 250 other businesses, sent a letter to Congress urging it to raise the debt ceiling.

The Houphouet-Boigny prize, created in 1989, is intended to honour people that have made a significant contribution to peace and stability.Other winners include former Irish president Mary Robinson, South Africa's former leader Nelson Mandela and the first president of East Timor, Xanana Gusmao. President Hollande was presented with a diploma, a gold medal and a cash prize of $150,000 (£98,000, 115,000 euros), which he will reportedly donate to two relief organisations working in Mali.Joaquim Chissano, president of the deciding jury, said: ""Having assessed the dangers and the repercussions of the situation on Africa and on Mali in particular, as well as on the rest of the world, the jury appreciated the solidarity shown by France to the peoples of Africa.""Mali's President, Dioncounda Traore, thanked Mr Hollande and referred to the ""humiliation"" suffered by people living in the north of of the country before the French troops arrived.Benin President Thomas Boni Yayi meanwhile told the news agency AFP: ""If France had not intervened, where would we be? God alone knows.""France has begun to withdraw some of its 4,000 troops from Mali after driving Islamist groups from the main towns and cities of the north.It plans to gradually hand over to the Malian army and a UN peacekeeping force before presidential and parliamentary elections are held.But tensions remain between the Malian authorities and the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which is fighting mostly for the rights of the minority Tuareg community. There have also been attacks from Islamist militants hiding in the mountains and desert of the north.Mireille Fanon-Mendes-France, president of human rights organisation Fondation Frantz Fanon, told the BBC that the decision to award Mr Hollande the Houphouet-Boigny prize was ""cynical"", pointing to unresolved issues in Mali.The choice of recipient was perceived by some to be both cultural and political, reports the BBC's Catherine Zemmouri in Paris.The prize is named after Felix Houphouet-Boigny, a politician who served in the French government before becoming the first president of the Ivory Coast and playing a leading role in the decolonisation of Africa."

The man in charge of assessing the leaks' damage, Richard Ledgett, said he could be open to an amnesty deal. Disclosures by the former intelligence worker have revealed the extent of the NSA's spying activity. But NSA Director Gen Keith Alexander has dismissed the idea.  Mr Ledgett spoke to US television channel CBS about the possibility of an amnesty deal: ""So my personal view is, yes it's worth having a conversation about. ""I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high, would be more than just an assertion on his part."" But Gen Alexander, who is retiring early next year, rejected the idea of any amnesty for Mr Snowden.""This is analogous to a hostage taker taking 50 people hostage, shooting 10, and then say, 'if you give me full amnesty, I'll let the other 40 go'.  What do you do?""In an earlier interview with the Reuters news agency, Mr Ledgett said he was deeply worried about highly classified documents not yet public that are among the 1.7 million files Mr Snowden is believed to have accessed.Mr Snowden's disclosures have been ""cataclysmic"" for the agency, Mr Ledgett told Reuters.Earlier this month, a UK newspaper editor told UK MPs only 1% of files leaked by Mr Snowden had been published by the newspaper.The state department says its position has not changed and that Mr Snowden must return to the US to face charges, says the BBC's Suzanne Kianpour.The US has charged Mr Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence.

Mr Hai is believed to have defected to the Taliban along with two of his bodyguards on Tuesday.   Officials say it is unclear why he decided to join the Taliban and played down the impact of his decision and dismissed his influence.""His defection does not have any impact on his people in the district, because he was not a very influential person,"" Abdul Ghafore Dastyaar, deputy governor of Sar-e-Pol, told the BBC's Jafar Haand in Kabul.  He added that Mr Hai had left Afghanistan and was believed to be over the border in Pakistan.The Taliban welcomed the move, describing it as an achievement that supports their cause and said that it was partly due to their efforts in the area. Mr Hai also appears in a video posted on the Taliban website in which he describes himself as a former mujahideen fighter and says that in his four years in Kabul he saw what he describes as ""the corrupt face of the government"".""In my four years' time during which I represented my people in the Senate I saw that a lot of cruelty and corruption carried out by the government people towards the Afghan population . Our villages were bombarded and our houses were searched by the invaders,"" he says on the video.Correspondents say the video is being used as an opportunity to bolster Taliban propaganda effort as well. They add that fact he is ethnically Aimaq - as opposed to Pashtun from whom the Taliban draw most of their strength - will be important for the Taliban, who want to present themselves as a cross-ethnic movement.  Abdul Khabir, a former MP from Sar-e Pol who knows Mr Hai very well, told BB Uzbek that the former senator had links with the Taliban from the time they were in power.He added that Mr Hai had influence in some 20 to 30 villages in the district. ""Because elections are coming, the Taliban might want to use him to somehow disturb the process of the vote in the local areas where he has loyal followers,"" he said.Sar-e-Pol, a mountainous region in Afghanistan's north, has not suffered the worst of Taliban violence over the years, but militants have increased their presence in the north in recent years.Last year there were several defections to the Taliban among police with a police commander and 13 junior officers joining militants in western Farah province in late July.

But it warned it would be costly to maintain a level of intelligence-gathering which would meet the encryption and computer security standards of its bigger partners. And it pointed out a senior, more powerful partner, such as the rest of the UK, would dictate the policy and costs, raising questions about how much independence a Scottish security service would really have. Mr Pearson said it was clear experts had real concerns about the security implications of breaking up the UK. He said: ""As part of the UK we currently enjoy a high level of security. ""Why would we want to put this at risk because of Alex Salmond's obsession with independence?"" He said: ""The SNP can't answer basic questions about what kind of intelligence and security service a separate Scotland would have, how much this would cost and whether we would enjoy the same level of security.""From my experience as a police officer for over 35 years, developing effective working relationships with colleagues across the UK is far easier because we are part of the UK.""Mr Burnett, previously counter-terrorism co-ordinator with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (Acpos), said: ""Based upon my experience, I simply do not accept these criticisms of Scotland's abilities to have effective security arrangements - and it is worth recalling that Graeme Pearson fought very hard to keep the SCDEA as a Scottish institution, and not part of a UK-wide unit. ""This helped ensure that Scotland got a better deal in fighting drugs and serious organised crime.""An excellent Scottish intelligence organisation could be developed in an independent country.""He added: ""I have witnessed great Scottish talent in military, secret and police intelligence services, and can readily envisage the huge ability, energy, integrity and innovation they would pour into this exciting mission.""The Scottish government also rejected the claims. A spokesperson said: ""An independent Scotland will have first-rate security arrangements to counter any threats we may face.

Many expected the missiles would be in the air by now. Instead the attack has been put on hold for at least 10 days.It may not impress those who habitually accuse him of dithering, but at least members of Congress are, this time, unlikely to complain. He is likely to win the vote, going by the public expressions of members of Congress in the last few days. Clearly he thinks he will. But then so did his mate, David Cameron. The humiliation of the British prime minister played directly into his decision. The shock made some advisers even more averse to letting Congress have a say. But its real impact was perverse. It led to the recall, according to White House insiders. In the past, Britain has been accused of being America's poodle. This time MPs clamped their teeth into the seat of Mr Obama's trousers, ripping a hole in his argument of the obvious virtue of action. The forcible removal of America's oldest enemy (John Kerry pointedly referred to the French on Friday as ""our oldest ally - they were helping the Americans fight the British from 1778-83) from the world stage meant Obama needed some more moral support for his case. Protesters in the US who start arguing, ""But even Britain…"" can be answered with, ""But Congress has…""Presuming they do vote in favour, that is. Some will say this shows Obama is weak. Rather, it shows his hand is weak. He was elected to end America's wars, and in reaction to the fallout of the invasion of Iraq.Many of his own supporters want him to focus on what he calls ""nation-building at home"". But he is trapped within his own red lines and, perhaps, the need to send a signal to Iran and North Korea. A recent poll indicated 80% of Americans thought Congress should vote before any military action.Taking action that is unpopular, with an uncertain international coalition and domestic reluctance, is not a strong position to be in.  But it is sensible to make sure the responsibility for unpopular action is shared with other politicians, as Caesar's assassins knew.It is also canny for domestic reasons to keep a very sour Congress sweet. Some might even argue in a democracy it is the right thing to do."

They said the MoD had failed to properly equip the tanks and to give soldiers adequate training.The MoD had argued that there was ""combat immunity"" where troops in action were concerned and it was not ""fair, just or reasonable"" to impose a duty of care on the MoD when soldiers were on the battlefield.But during Wednesday's hearing, the Supreme Court justices ruled that immunity did not apply in this case.Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ""I am very concerned at the wider implications of this judgement, which could ultimately make it more difficult for our troops to carry out operations, and potentially throws open a wide range of military decisions to the uncertainty of litigation.  ""We will continue to make this point in future legal proceedings as it can't be right that troops on operations have to put the European Convention on Human Rights ahead of what is operationally vital to protect our national security.""Debi Allbutt, the widow of Cpl Stephen Allbutt, told the BBC she was pleased with the outcome, but that the families' fight would continue.She said: ""We want combat immunity thrown out of the rulebook, so instead of soldiers having to sue the Ministry of Defence, the equipment and the training will be in place to stop things like this happening again.""Susan Smith, mother of Pte Phillip Hewett, described the judgement as ""absolutely brilliant"".""They can no longer treat soldiers as sub-human with no rights,"" she said.""Phillip's dead. Nothing is going to bring him back, but this might help save lives in the future.""Lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, who is acting for the Snatch Land Rover families, said the MoD ""can't be given a carte blanche to fail to equip our troops"".She said: ""I think what they have established is what seems to many families is common sense - that soldiers have human rights, and they do remain within the jurisdiction of the UK, and they don't lose those because they are on the battlefield.""The families' claims will now be able to proceed to trial to determine if the MoD owes damages."

But on Sunday Bild newspaper quoted US intelligence sources as saying NSA head Keith Alexander personally briefed the president about the covert operation targeting Mrs Merkel in 2010.""Obama did not halt the operation but rather let it continue,"" the newspaper quoted a senior NSA official as saying.Her number was still on a surveillance list in 2013.Germany is sending its top intelligence chiefs to Washington in the coming week to ""push forward"" an investigation into the spying allegations, which have caused outrage in Germany.The documents seen by Der Spiegel give further details about the NSA's targeting of European governments.A unit called Special Collection Services, based on the fourth floor of the US embassy in Pariser Platz in Berlin, was responsible for monitoring communications in the German capital's government quarter, including those targeting Mrs Merkel.Germany's Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Bild that running such an operation on German soil would be illegal under German law, and adds that those ""responsible must be held accountable"".  Similar listening units were based in around 80 locations worldwide, according to the documents seen by Der Spiegel, 19 of them in European cities.If the existence of listening stations in US embassies were known, there would be ""severe damage for the US's relations with a foreign government,"" the documents said.Mrs Merkel - an Americophile who was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 - is said to be shocked that Washington may have engaged in the sort of spying she had to endure growing up in Communist East Germany."

What is more important now is that Barack Obama's blow to Bashar al-Assad will inevitably occur. It is a new Obama, whose tough face we have not seen since he was elected.""Commentary in pan-Arab, Saudi-owned daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat:""No matter what Obama decides on the scope and nature of the strike, he will obviously remain a weak president even if he chooses war... Obama seems to be afraid of any consequences such a strike may entail. What he wants is a quick, limited and narrowly focused strike. He does not want to be dragged into a wider regional war.""London-based pan-Arab newspaper Al-Arab al-Alamiyah:""Will the Obama administration make up its mind and realize that stability in the Middle East requires the removal of the Syrian regime? Otherwise, it will contribute once again to dispelling any hope of restoring some stability in the Middle East.""Commentary in government-owned Syrian newspaper Al-Thawra: ""Regardless of whether the [US] Congress gives the red light or the green light to an aggression, and of whether the prospects for war have been enhanced or reduced, by prevaricating or through implication President Obama yesterday announced the start of a historic US retreat.""Commentary in government-owned Syrian newspaper Tishrin:""The USA is planning to attack a country in which chemical weapons have been used by terrorists, and the pretext of using these weapons will lead to war and aggression... The USA distorts facts and fabricates events to justify its wars and aggression.""Editorial in conservative Iranian newspaper Siyasat-e Ruz: ""Obama is using the red line of chemical weapons as a pretext... to go back on his pledges to American people and the world. Obama will emerge as the loser if he wages a war against Syria even if the USA achieves victory, because the world will become more familiar with his false humanitarian claims.""Commentary in hardline Iranian newspaper Jomhuri-ye Eslami: ""The USA has failed to build an international consensus for a military strike against Syria. The US is only beating the drums of war with the help of France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Although this war can be initiated by the warmongers in the White House, it certainly cannot be concluded by Washington.""Editorial in Egypt's state-owned daily Al-Jumhuriyah:""The USA, which has killed, maimed and displaced millions of Arabs and Muslims in the Middle Eastern wars in order to steal oil and strengthen Israel, has no merciful heart to look at hundreds of Syrians who were allegedly killed with chemical weapons. The USA is not a messenger of God who will take revenge against the killers, as it claims. In actual fact, it uses fake pretexts to play its real role in destroying the Arab countries and their armies so that Israel will enjoy supremacy and security.""Commentary in Egypt's pro-reform liberal daily Al-Shuruq al-Jadid: ""The poor and children will bear the brunt of the new US adventure. Syria will become more divided, and new terrorist groups will spring up after Washington gives them justification to strike here and there. The innocent in the West will also pay the price as was the case on 11 September 2011.""Editorial in Qatar's leading independent daily Al-Sharq: ""Yesterday's announcement by US President Barack Obama that he decided to launch a military strike against the ruling regime in Syria is a step forward in terms of bringing Bashar al-Assad and his suppressive militias to account for genocide and crimes against humanity. However, this announcement came too late following more than two-and-a-half years of horrible massacres perpetrated against the Syrian people.""Dubai-based newspaper Khaleej Times, part-owned by the UAE government:""If the US directly attacks Syria, the real cause will not be the recent chemical attacks... The Syrian conflict is a proxy war being waged against Iran by the United States, conservative Arab oil producers, and three former Mideast colonial powers, Britain, France and Turkey who are seeking to restore their domination in the region.""Israeli centrist mass-circulation newspaper Yediot Aharonot:""Senior Israeli officials were stunned last night by US President Barack Obama's speech... Al-Assad is sitting rubbing his hands gleefully, and the Iranians are laughing all the way to the nuclear bomb, not to mention the fact that they have now given Al-Assad time to set up his defences.""Website of liberal Turkish daily Taraf:""The huge gap between the envisaged strategy and the targeted outcome should be reason enough to oppose this intervention. This is an inconsistent strategy even with a sound mind.""BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The sale of V22 would also mark the first time the planes have been released to any country outside America.Mr Hagel said President Obama had made ""not only maintaining but improving Israel's [military] qualitative edge a top priority"".He told reporters that all options for dealing with Iran remained on the table, while Israeli defence secretary Moshe Yaalon said ""one way or another Iran's nuclear programme will be stopped"".Mr Hagel also said the US would continue to invest in Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile defence system, saying Washington would seek a further $220m for funding, on top of $460m it has spent on the programme already.The defence secretary's trip is the first leg of a tour of Middle East allies, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates."

Meanwhile, Russia and Iran have strongly denounced the attack.In her final press interview as US Secretary of State, Mrs Clinton said one of Iran's ""highest priorities"" was keeping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power.""We believe they have acted on that by sending in more personnel, not only to help Assad, but to support and advise military security forces,"" she told reporters.Mrs Clinton added that Iran had increased the quality of its arms sent to Syria because ""Assad is using up his weaponry"".She expressed similar concerns with regards to Russia's involvement in the conflict.""We have reason to believe that the Russians continue to supply financial and military assistance in the form of equipment,"" she said.Mrs Clinton declined to comment on the alleged Israeli strike but voiced fears that the conflict could worsen or spread. More than 60,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began 22 months ago, the UN said.""I personally have been warning for quite some time of the dangers associated with an increasingly lethal civil war and a potential proxy war,"" she said.""Therefore, I think it's incumbent on those nations that have refused to be constructive players to reconsider their positions because the worst kind of predictions of what could happen internally and spilling over the borders of Syria are certainly within the realm of the possible now.""Earlier, the Syria army said Israeli fighter jets had bombed a scientific research centre in Jamraya, near Damascus, killing two people and wounding five.But a US official told the BBC the target had been a convoy carrying SA-17 surface-to-air missiles bound for the Shia militant movement Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon. Meanwhile, some rebel groups said they had targeted the Jamraya centre.The White House did not confirm details of Israel's raid itself, but issued a warning to Syria.""Syria should not further destabilise the region by transferring weaponry to Hezbollah,"" the White House's deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said.There has been increasing concern in Israel that Syria's chemical weapons could fall into Hezbollah's hands. Correspondents say Israel is also worried the Shia militant group could obtain anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, thus strengthening its ability to respond to Israeli air strikes.Wednesday's reported attack came days after Israel moved its Iron Dome defence system to the north of the country."

Ms Rice said in Monday's meeting that waiting to sign the deal ""would not provide the United States and Nato allies the clarity necessary to plan for a potential post-2014 military presence"". Nor would it give Afghans certainty, she said. The deal under discussion may see 15,000 foreign troops remain after 2014, although the US says it has not yet taken a decision on any presence.The soldiers who stay beyond 2014, when most foreign combat forces leave, would primarily train and mentor Afghan forces. Some special forces would stay to conduct ""counter-terror operations"".Member of Afghanistan's grand assembly of elders, or Loya Jirga, approved the deal on Sunday. ""The Loya Jirga requests the president to sign the agreement before the end of 2013,"" a declaration reached at the end of the meeting said.Opening the assembly on Thursday, Mr Karzai urged delegates to support the pact, but said he would not sign it until after the election scheduled for April 2014.The BSA also has to be approved by the Afghan parliament."

Some protesters attempt to force their way inside, smashing a window and attacking councillors' cars parked in the grounds of the building, including a vehicle belonging to DUP councillor, Guy Spence.Alliance councillor for east Belfast, Laura McNamee, confirms she has moved out of her home as a result of internet threats, amid controversy over the council's vote on union flag policy.

4658	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21389200	Opinion	1	National Security	International News	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"By the time John Brennan, President Barack Obama's nominee to be the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency, finished three hours of public testimony before the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, two things were clear. First, Mr Brennan will be confirmed. And second, despite nearly a dozen years of war, there are profound disagreements both within the United States and beyond about how this conflict has been and should be waged.Mr Brennan provided a forceful defence of the Obama administration's war against al-Qaeda over the past four years, particularly its increased employment of drones in various countries he declined to specify. He made clear that the administration believes it has the legal authority to use lethal force in self-defence against al-Qaeda and associated forces wherever there is an imminent threat against the United States and capture is not feasible. The committee was clearly supportive of the continued use of drones in the ongoing war against al-Qaeda. Americans by a wide margin share this view.But that is not the case outside the United States. The rest of the world questions the legality of their use, viscerally so in a country such as Pakistan, where drone attacks increased significantly during President Obama's first term.While Mr Brennan declined to discuss where drones are employed, Ambassador Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, displayed no such reticence. In a discussion with reporters in Washington two days before Mr Brennan's testimony, she made clear that the civilian government in Islamabad views America's continued deployment of drones as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty, as well as strategically counter-productive. ""We need to drain this swamp and instead it [the drone campaign] is radicalising people,"" Ambassador Rehman said. ""It creates more potential terrorists on the ground and militants on the ground instead of taking them out. If it's taking out, say, a high-value or a medium-value target, it's also creating probably an entire community of future recruits.""Recent polling tends to support Ambassador Rehman's view. An estimated 74% of Pakistanis polled by Pew last year termed the United States an ""enemy."" Drones are a clear factor. Mr Brennan says the administration takes into account the potential backlash from ongoing counter-terrorism operations. But rather than address Pakistani concerns publicly as part of a long-term public diplomacy approach, the Obama administration has chosen, at least at the moment, to pretend the problem does not exist. It refuses to acknowledge (despite widespread news reports) the existence of a drone campaign in Pakistan.Whether this approach is sustainable and for how long is an open question.According to Pakistani authorities, whether or not there was close co-ordination regarding drone operations in the past, there is none now. Ambassador Rehman denies that Pakistan criticises the use of drones in public, but co-operates in private.""There is no question of any quiet complicity. No question of wink and nod,"" she insisted.This represents a genuine conundrum for the Obama administration. There is no question that drone strikes have been a major factor in virtually eliminating the strategic threat posed by core al-Qaeda. But what started out as a strategic campaign against high-value targets has morphed into something far more tactical. Drones are increasingly employed not against al-Qaeda operatives plotting attacks against the American homeland, but to target lower-level Taliban forces that continue to attack US forces in Afghanistan. Presumably, Washington wants to keep up pressure on al-Qaeda's sanctuary in the tribal areas until US forces withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014.But at what cost?At the start of the Obama administration, strengthening of civilian governmental institutions in Pakistan was considered the long-term solution to extremism linked to Pakistan. Now the drone campaign undercuts the very civilian government the United States is spending billions in aid to build up.Relations between the two countries have stabilised, but the lack of trust remains deep. The Pakistani parliament has made clear that drones are a ""red line"", one Washington chooses for the moment to ignore, putting its long-term standing and influence with Pakistan in jeopardy.""Every time there is a drone strike, you see it on 40 channels at least in Pakistan,"" said Ambassador Rehman. ""They lend an unfortunate view of US power and how the United States projects its power abroad.""Drones may be a key element in the US strategy, but as Ambassador Rehman makes clear, they are ""not part of our playbook. The time for drone strikes is really over.""But based on the Brennan hearing, there is no indication the United States plans to follow her advice any time soon."

Just as predictable as the changing seasons is Pyongyang's reaction to the annual military exercise between South Korea and the US, known as Foal Eagle. The US says it has detected no signs that North Korea is actively preparing to go on the offensive - there has been no large-scale mobilisation of forces, for example.  Pyongyang's threats are usually conditional - if there is a real danger of a US attack, there will be a response, or a pre-emptive strike. The tension usually goes down when the exercises end - until the next round of theatre and threats. But the possibility of an accident provoking a military confrontation is always real.North Korea has been a vexing problem for Washington for years, and so far the Obama administration has also failed to successfully engage Pyongyang and break this cycle - or curb its nuclear programme.This year, the threats emanating form North Korea have sounded even more bombastic for several reasons. There's a new young leader sitting in Pyongyang who's still asserting himself domestically and consolidating his power. And South Korea has just elected its new president, Park Geun-hye - the country's first female leader. So, Kim Jong-un is - no doubt - testing her too. The US reaction has remained mostly the same - with a few variations, officials in Washington repeat the line that North Korea's actions are not helpful and only further isolate the reclusive nation. There seem to be no creative ideas on the horizon. During the Clinton administration, the US repeatedly cancelled military exercises to assuage Pyongyang's fears and defuse tension. But more recently, Washington has matched the intensity of Pyongyang's rhetoric with a display of hardware. After a deluge of 20 threats in a just a few weeks, the Obama administration also dispatched B-2 stealth bombers over the Korean peninsula. The move was also meant to decrease pressure on South Korea to take unilateral action to sound tough in the face of its northern brethren. But every attempt by the US and the international community to hold Pyongyang accountable, with sanctions for example, leads to even more erratic behaviour by the North Koreans. And every time the US ignores Pyongyang's pleas for attention, responding with a resolve to continue military exercises, the North Koreans are further infuriated - partly because their thinking is driven by a different rationale.They perceive US-South Korean defensive military exercises as potentially offensive, and analysts say the North Koreans believe their nuclear weapons are the only thing keeping them safe from a US attack.President Obama spoke at the start of his first term about his willingness to extend a hand if America's foes were willing to unclench their fist. Efforts to restart the six-party talks, which stalled in 2009, have failed. And Pyongyang's behaviour makes it difficult for Mr Obama to be bold and engage in open, direct talks with the North Koreans without risking being lambasted by critics for caving in to threats and legitimizing Kim Jung-un. Administration officials did travel to North Korea on secret missions last year in an effort to persuade the newly-anointed leader to moderate his foreign policy. One of the trips took place in April 2012 and was led by Joseph DeTrani - a North Korea expert who then headed America's National Counter-Proliferation Center. Mr DeTrani, who is now president of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, an industry group, would not openly confirm to the BBC that he had been on a mission to Pyongyang.But he spoke about the need for diplomacy while indicating that the American approach had been rebuffed. ""The North Koreans know the US and China are available in the six-party talks. Their rhetoric is over the top and puts them in a difficult position."" Mr DeTrani added that the US was handling the situation well and that it was up to North Korea to break the cycle.US policy towards North Korea is partly driven by Washington's support for Japan and South Korea and efforts to show that the US remains in lock-step with allies in the face of North Korea.  Diplomacy with North Korea takes place mostly through the six-party talks, which also involve Japan, China, South Korea and Russia. Denuclearisation is always the stated end goal of every discussion. Because of North Korea's fears, justified or not, this often undermines the basis of the talks.  Over the past four years, the Obama administration's posture on North Korea was also dictated by former South Korean president Lee Myung-bak's hardline stance towards the North. But Christopher Nelson, an Asia expert and vice-president of Samuels International Associates, points out that while the new South Korean leader has responded with tough words to Pyongyang's rhetoric, she has also indicated that if the North Koreans are willing to resume North-South talks, denuclearisation would not have to be the state end goal. Mr Nelson said there are indications from the North Korean team at the UN that Pyongyang is now willing to engage. While this still needs to be tested, what's unclear is whether the US is ready to go along with this approach. In public, and for now, it's unlikely that the US will signal any easing of its policy towards North Korea.But if Mrs Park persists with her offer, the US could say it respects its ally's choice and will support the approach. There will be many opportunities to explore this and other diplomatic options in policy towards North Korea. The South Korean foreign minister is in Washington this week. The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, will be heading to Asia next week for his first trip to the region in the new job - with stops in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul. And President Park herself will meet President Obama in Washington in May."

It prevents the use of US troops on the ground. President Barack Obama is battling to build support at home and abroad for military action.Despite Wednesday's vote, the bill's ultimate fate in the wider Senate is unclear. And the US House of Representatives must also approve the measure.So far, only 23 senators have said they support or are likely to back the resolution, according to a tally by ABC/BBC News.Sixteen have said they oppose or are likely to oppose the resolution, while 61 votes are undecided or unknown.However, those numbers are expected to shift as the language in the resolution changes, the White House and its congressional allies apply pressure, and lawmakers hear from their constituents.Earlier in the day, France - whose government has strongly advocated intervention - held an extraordinary debate in the National Assembly, though MPs will not vote on the matter as the country's president can mobilise the military without their backing.The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is accused of using chemical weapons against civilians on several occasions during the 30-month conflict, most recently on a large scale in an attack on 21 August on the outskirts of Damascus.The US has put the death toll from that incident at 1,429 - though other countries and organisations have given lower figures - and says all the evidence implicates government forces.At a press conference on Wednesday in Stockholm, Sweden, President Obama said: ""My credibility is not on the line. The international community's credibility is on the line.""America and Congress's credibility is on the line, because we give lip-service to the notion that these international norms are important.""Mr Obama said he believed the US Congress would approve intervention, but stressed that as commander-in-chief, he had the right to act in his country's national interest regardless.The Senate foreign relations committee approved the resolution, with one abstention, after accepting an amendment by Republican Senator John McCain that advocated increasing support for rebel forces. The measure pledges support for ""decisive changes to the present military balance of power"" in Syria.  It also states US policy is to ""change the momentum on the battlefield in Syria so as to create favorable conditions for a negotiated settlement that ends the conflict and leads to a democratic government"".Senator Dick Durbin, a senior Democrat on the panel, said he had voted against the war in Iraq, but that ""this is different"".""What we've done today is a step in the right direction,"" he said. ""I hope it makes a safer world.""But another Democrat, Senator Tom Udall, said he had voted no because he believed it would embroil the US in the Syrian civil war. He was joined by five Republicans in voting against the resolution, including Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, both of whom are tipped as potential 2016 presidential candidates.Two top Obama administration officials, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, meanwhile continued to press the case for intervention, this time before a House of Representatives panel.Mr Hagel said any US military strike would not be a mere ""pin prick"", but would reduce the Syrian government's military capability. He said he thought there was a ""very high"" likelihood that Mr Assad would use chemical weapons again if the US did not act.In Syria, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad said Damascus was mobilising its allies, who were ""offering it all sorts of support"". He cited Iran, Russia, South Africa and some Arab countries.Syrian state TV denied reports that a former Defence Minister, General Ali Habib, had defected to Turkey.The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed and two million others have fled the country since the uprising against President Assad began in March 2011."

The US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, was killed when gunmen stormed the compound and set it on fire. Some US Republicans accuse the Obama administration of failing to admit the involvement of terrorist groups. But the New York Times (NYT) says a local Islamist militia leader was key.The paper bases its report on months of interviews with local residents who have extensive knowledge of the events of 11 September 2012 and American officials linked to a criminal investigation. Initially, Washington said the attack grew out of violent protests against an anti-Islam video produced in the US. Later findings suggested that it was an organised attack planned by local militias. Some Republicans accused al-Qaeda of launching the assault to mark the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US.The NYT reports that the reality was ""murkier"". The assault was neither ""meticulously planned"", nor ""spontaneous"", though ""fuelled in large part"" by anger at the video. The paper's investigation ""turned up no evidence that al-Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault"".In the aftermath of the attack, Republicans repeatedly criticised the Obama administration for blaming the video protest instead of a deliberate terrorist attack.An investigation commissioned by the US state department found in December 2012 that security at the consulate had been inadequate but that there had been ""no immediate, specific"" intelligence pointing to threats. The NYT says the attack was led by fighters who had benefited from Western support during the uprising against long-time Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. It says a central figure was ""an eccentric, malcontent militia leader, Ahmed Abu Khattala"".Mr Khattala denies involvement, but witnesses describe him ""strolling calmly through the chaos"" at the compound, according to the NYT.He is also alleged to have directed local fighters in the attack. Mr Khattala, whose exact whereabouts are unknown, was charged by US investigators in August. Charges have also been filed against an unknown number of other alleged attackers. Ambassador Chris Stevens was one of four Americans to die. The others killed were another state department worker and two former Navy Seals.  "

Mr Rouhani, who spoke to President Obama late on Friday, has said he wants to seek a deal with world powers on Iran's nuclear programme within months.The phone conversation was the first top-level conversation between the two countries for more than 30 years. Mr Rouhani, a moderate, was elected in June, replacing hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.On his return to Tehran on Saturday, Mr Rouhani was welcomed by hundreds of supporters hailing his trip, as well as a smaller number of opponents chanting ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"".The Israeli government has not officially reacted to the Iranian president's remarks and his historic phone conversation with Mr Obama. Israeli media reported that ministers had been instructed not to speak publicly about the issue, to avoid gaffes before Monday's White House meeting.But writing on his Facebook page, former Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned that the Iranian president was engaging in a ""deceitful exercise"".Hours after Mr Netanyahu's plane took off for New York, Israel's Shin Bet intelligence service disclosed that a Belgian man of Iranian origin had been arrested on 11 September on suspicion of spying.Ali Mansouri, 50, entered Israel under the name Alex Mans and had been sent by Iran's Revolutionary Guard elite Quds force, a Shin Bet statement said.He was detained at Ben Gurion airport at the end of a five-day trip, during which he had photographed the roof of the US embassy in Tel Aviv, it said.Tehran insists its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes but last month the UN's nuclear agency said Iran had further boosted its capacity for uranium enrichment, installing more than 1,000 advanced centrifuges at the Natanz enrichment plant.Iran is due to take part in substantive negotiations on its nuclear programme in Geneva on 15 October with a group of nations known as the P5+1, which include the US, Russia, China, the UK, France and Germany.Mr Rouhani has said Iran will bring a plan to that meeting, but has not provided details.The P5+1 have called on Tehran to halt production and stockpiling of uranium enriched to 20%.

Mr Snowden, a former contractor to the American National Security Agency (NSA), has admitted leaking information about widespread US surveillance on electronic communications to the media. He fled the US - where he now faces espionage charges - and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia.Lavabit came under scrutiny following reports that Mr Snowden was using the service while holed-up in Moscow airport.""I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people, or walk away from nearly 10 years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit,"" Mr Levison wrote in a letter posted on the Lavabit website.He said he had decided to ""suspend operations"" but was barred from discussing the events over the past six weeks that led to his decision. ""This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States,"" he wrote.Silent Circle said it shut down its email service for both technical and political reasons. ""Email as we know it... cannot be secure,"" wrote Jon Callas, co-founder and head of technology officer at Silent Circle, in a blogpost. ""Email that uses standard Internet protocols cannot have the same security guarantees that real-time communications has.""By contrast, he said, the firm was keeping its secure voice and text services going because it had control over the infrastructure supporting them and could guarantee that messages were not intercepted or tampered with en route.In addition, said Mr Callas, it was anticipation of future government calls to hand over customer details that prompted the Silent Mail shutdown.""We see the writing (on) the wall, and we have decided that it is best for us to shut down Silent Mail now,"" he said. ""We have not received subpoenas, warrants, security letters, or anything else by any government, and this is why we are acting now.Speaking to the BBC, Silent Circle co-founder Phil Zimmermann said the service was closed because of Lavabit's action and because it feared it would be coerced into handing over keys that can unscramble messages.In addition, he said, email was very hard to make secure.

The anti-secrecy group said Mr Snowden's asylum request would be formally processed when he arrived in Ecuador.Spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told the BBC he believed history would show that the former analyst had performed ""a great public service"".The US state department said Mr Snowden's passport had been revoked, saying this was ""routine and consistent with US regulations"".However, one US official told the Associated Press that if a senior official in a country or airline ordered it, a country could overlook the lack of a passport.Hong Kong officials said Mr Snowden had left ""on his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel"" because the US extradition request was incomplete and there was no legal basis to restrict him from departing.The US justice department said it was ""disappointed"" that Hong Kong did not arrest Mr Snowden and that it ""disagrees"" with its reasons for not doing so.An official said that at no point during talks on Friday did Hong Kong raise issues regarding the sufficiency of the US request.""In light of this, we find their decision to be particularly troubling,"" the official said.Mr Snowden left on Aeroflot flight SU213 and landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport shortly after 17:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Sunday, where he was reportedly picked up by either a Venezuelan or Ecuadorean embassy car.Reports suggest he will fly out of Russia on an early afternoon flight to the Cuban capital Havana, where he is booked on another flight to Caracas, Venezuela.Following that route would enable him to fly on to Ecuador without risk of arrest by US authorities.It is unclear where Mr Snowden currently is, but he is reported to have not left the airport, and the Ecuadorean ambassador was spotted at an airside hotel.The US and Ecuador have a joint extradition treaty, but it is not applicable to ""crimes or offences of a political character"".The US justice department has said it will seek co-operation from whichever country Mr Snowden arrives in.But if Mr Snowden ends up in Ecuador, it is going to be extremely difficult for the Americans to get him, the BBC's Paul Adams in Washington reports.Mr Snowden had left his home in Hawaii after leaking details of his work as an NSA (National Security Agency) analyst and the extensive US surveillance programme to the UK's Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post.He has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. The complaint is dated 14 June - although it was made public only on Friday.NSA chief Keith Alexander told ABC News on Sunday there had been no warning that Mr Snowden had taken the documents.""Clearly, the system did not work as it should have,"" he said.Gen Alexander also said the spying agency was overhauling its operations to tighten security on contractors.The leaks have led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under an NSA programme known as Prism.Mr Snowden said earlier that he had decided to speak out after observing ""a continuing litany of lies"" from senior officials to Congress.US officials have defended the practice of gathering telephone and internet data from private users around the world.They say Prism cannot be used to intentionally target any Americans or anyone in the US, and that it is supervised by judges."

Instead they are, at heart, about the breadth and depth of intelligence gathering and how the internet changes spying itself. It is also about two young men who were horrified by what they saw going on and decided to expose it - in the words of my colleague, Paul Adams, ""the rise of the idealistic nerd"".It is probable that as the technology changed, intelligence services had to hugely increase the number of fairly low-level experts they employ. Possibly, their background checks were less rigorous than in the past. Maybe the type of person recruited was more committed to a technology that has gone hand in hand with a vaguely libertarian ethos than a commitment to national security, whatever the implications for privacy and freedom.  It is not certain how this will play for Mr Obama, but it does not look great.It is true that it runs against the right's narrative: ""Obama is weak on national security.""Once again, as with drones, he has shown himself to be rather ruthless with the niceties.On the other hand, it plays right in to the hands of another conservative narrative: ""President Obama expands the power of the state.""Given that it comes on top of the tax scandal at the Internal Revenue Service, and the raid on the Associated Press, it builds up a picture of an administration that plays fast and lose with civil liberties.This resonates with the president's own natural supporters as well, and those on the left who feel ""he is just as bad as former President George W Bush"". It adds to the general feeling of cynicism about politicians and suspicion of the power of the state."

The Shia militants were planning attacks on the US and the Netherlands, Suriname's former colonial ruler, US prosecutors say. The son of President Desi Bouterse was extradited from Panama in August.He had already been charged with trying to smuggle cocaine and weapons into the United States. Mr Bouterse could be sentenced to life in jail for the drugs and weapons smuggling charges and to up to 15 years for the terrorism-related accusations.The Suriname president's son insists he is innocent, but his lawyers have not yet reacted to the latest charges.The US authorities say they have recorded meetings of Mr Bouterse with undercover agents and informants posing as Hezbollah operatives in Panama and in Greece.""Alleged criminals like Bouterse and his facilitators pose a direct threat  to the safety and security of the United States,"" the administrator of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, Michelle Leonhart, told the Associated Press news agency.At a meeting in Greece, Mr Bouterse reportedly accepted $2 million (£1.25m) to help Hezbollah fighters settle in Suriname, give them passports and arm them with surface-to-air missiles and other weapons.He reportedly told them he would present within two months a list of the weapons he could provide.Mr Bouterse was arrested in Panama in late August, while travelling on a diplomatic passport, and quickly handed over to the US authorities.He was sentenced to eight years in prison in Surinam in 2005, after being found guilty of trafficking in drugs, weapons and stolen luxury cars.But Mr Bouterse was released three years later for good behaviour and was later named director of Suriname's Counter Terrorist Unit.His father,  Desi Bouterse, a former coup leader, was elected president of Suriname in 2010.He was accused of numerous human rights violations in the 1980s but was given immunity by parliament in 2012. In 2000, President Bouterse was himself convicted in absentia of drug trafficking by a court in the Netherlands. He has always denied the charges. "

We have to prove, first and foremost, that it is safe."""

Mr Joyce also said the surveillance had been essential to disrupting the 2009 conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway, resulting in the capture of that plot's mastermind, Najibullah Zazi.Asked what was next for Mr Snowden, Mr Joyce said simply: ""Justice.""The former NSA contractor fled to Hong Kong shortly before the scandal broke. His leaks revealed that US agencies had systematically gathered vast amounts of phone and web data.On Tuesday, Google challenged the US government's gagging order on its internet surveillance programme, citing a constitutional right to free speech.The web firm asked the secretive US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to allow it to publish the number of government requests in the name of national security for data about its customers.Tech firms including Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and Yahoo have released limited information about the number of surveillance requests they receive.But they are currently not allowed to show the split in numbers between requests related to national security and to criminal investigations.

Unless Congress wills it otherwise.President Obama clearly feels this deal may be the answer. Others at home and abroad will argue it is not - and that he is in danger of being  hoodwinked.A lot of effort has gone into this - some of it secret. AP has a fascinating article detailing secret talks leading up to the deal. A senior Obama administration official tells us that there has been ""a several-year"" effort intended to ""reinforce"" the wider talks.  Allies are unlikely to mind this, unless they want to find offence. Which brings us to a vital question - what about Israel?Particularly tricky is the obvious dismay of Israel's Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu - he's branded the deal ""a historic mistake"" - and this will embolden the president's critics at home who may claim he has betrayed Israel - always a potent charge in American politics. It is clear from the initial reaction that many will take some convincing that this is a good deal.Politicians in congress have been planning new sanctions and show every sign of pressing ahead with them.A couple of days ago the Democrat leader of the Senate Harry Reid said:""I will support a bill that would broaden the scope of our current petroleum sanctions, place limitations on trade with strategic sectors of the Iranian economy that support its nuclear ambitions, as well as pursue those who divert goods to Iran."" This is critically important. A senior Obama administration official is warning that ""the introduction of new sanctions would, we believe, derail the agreement"". Although technically Obama could veto any new sanctions that would be politically very awkward. Determined senators might find a way to bundle them in with other laws the President wouldn't want to stop. Once again Congress finds itself in a position where it can bring Mr Obama's plans crashing down in flames. Their opposition derailed his plans to attack Syria (although for that he may have been grateful). It brought about a government shutdown and took America to the brink of what some warned was ""economic Armageddon"".It has stopped his plans for gun controls and immigration reform.The recent decision of Senate Democrats to scrap the filibuster for some important deals has only sharpened the sense of hyper-partisan dysfunction. This was called, in a good example of beltway linguistic inflation, ""the nuclear option"". It may play into Iran's very real nuclear option in an unforeseen way. Going on the evidence Mr Obama must know of the risk he is now taking.The gamble that Iran will keep its word is one thing.The gamble that Congress will do as he wishes is quite another - not one I would like to take a bet on.

On Monday in a Washington DC federal court, Judge Leon called the NSA's surveillance programme ""indiscriminate"" and an ""almost Orwellian technology that enables the government to store and analyze the phone metadata of every telephone user in the United States"".The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by conservative activist Larry Klayman, a user of a Verizon mobile telephone who challenged the NSA's collection of metadata on his behalf and that of a client.On Tuesday morning, US President Barack Obama met chief executives from the nation's top technology companies - including Google and Apple.He was expected to discuss the NSA's surveillance programmes as well as government information technology reforms; the legal ruling may also come up.The NSA had ordered Verizon - one of the largest phone companies in the US - to disclose to it metadata, including telephone numbers, calling card numbers and the serial numbers of phones, of millions of calls it processes in which at least one party is in the US.Judge Leon ruled the plaintiffs had demonstrated ""a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their Fourth Amendment claim and that they will suffer irreparable harm absent… relief"", referring to the clause in the US constitution that bars unreasonable search and seizure by the government.He issued a preliminary injunction against the NSA surveillance programme but suspended the order to allow for an appeal by the justice department, thus enabling the programme to continue for now.Mr Klayman told the BBC the ruling ""could have immediate impact. ""If the NSA continues to do this, they're now on notice that it's illegal, and we will seek to have them held in criminal contempt of court.""Through Glenn Greenwald, a journalist with whom he has close ties, Mr Snowden issued a statement hailing the ruling.""I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts,"" he wrote, according to the New York Times.

Such occasions are traditionally marked with shows of military strength and it is thought this year the date could be used for a missile launch.Some estimates suggest that the Musudan missiles which North Korea has moved to its east coast could travel 4,000km (2,500 miles).That would put US bases on the Pacific island of Guam within range, although the exact threat is unclear as it is not believed that the Musudan has been tested before.Mr Kerry has stressed that it would be a ""huge mistake"" for the North to go ahead with a launch, saying it would further isolate North Korea and that the people of the country are in need of food, not missiles."

A master on computers"".Explaining why he decided to leave the US, he told the Guardian: ""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things… I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.""The US has charged Mr Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.Mr Snowden, 30, had been living with his girlfriend in Hawaii, but left, initially for Hong Kong where, with his consent, the UK's Guardian newspaper revealed his identity.After the US filed charges and asked local authorities to extradite him, Mr Snowden left Hong Kong on 23 June, initially for Moscow, but with the intention of seeking asylum in Ecuador.Ecuador has said it could not consider Mr Snowden's asylum request until he had arrived in the Latin American country, or one of its diplomatic missions.With the knowledge that the US does have an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, Mr Snowden left on an Aeroflot flight to Moscow.He remained in a transit zone in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport for more than a month after the US revoked his travel documents. In August, he was given permission to enter Russia after he was offered asylum there for one year.His father, Lon, visited him in October.Mr Snowden is reported to have grown up in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and later moved to Maryland, near the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade.Describing himself as a less-than-stellar student, he is said to have studied computing at a Maryland community college to get the necessary credits to obtain a high school diploma. However, he never finished the course.In 2003, he joined the US Army and began training with the special forces, only to be discharged after breaking both his legs in a training accident.His first job with the NSA was as a security guard for one of the agency's secret facilities at the University of Maryland. He then worked on IT security at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).Despite his lack of formal qualifications, it is said that his computer wizardry allowed him to quickly rise through intelligence ranks.By 2007, he was given a CIA post with diplomatic cover in Geneva.Mr Snowden told the Guardian: ""Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world. I realised that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.""Mr Snowden said he had considered going public earlier, but waited to see whether President Barack Obama's election in 2008 would change the US approach.""[Mr Obama] continued with the policies of his predecessor,"" he said.According to campaign finance records, Mr Snowden gave money in 2012 to Republican presidential long-shot Ron Paul, who supports strictly curtailing the powers of government.Mr Snowden reportedly made two donations of $250 (£160) over the course of the campaign.He left the CIA in 2009 and began working at the NSA as an employee of various outside contractors, including consulting giant Booz Allen.In a statement, the company confirmed he had been an employee of the firm for less than three months, assigned to a team in Hawaii. ""News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm, it said.Mr Snowden admitted to Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper that he took the job at Booz Allen because he wanted access to classified information to gather evidence.He was formally sacked on 11 June.Mr Snowden was on a salary of $122,000 according to a statement from his employer.He and his girlfriend moved out of their home in Waipahu, West Oahu, Hawaii, on 1 May, estate agents said, leaving nothing behind.A neighbour told ABC that the couple usually kept the blinds and doors closed and ""didn't really talk to anyone at all around here"".His then-girlfriend, whose personal blog includes photos of her pole dancing, has said her partner's sudden disappearance caught her by surprise.""My world has opened and closed all at once,"" Lindsay Mills wrote.

4869	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22860239	News	1	National Security	International News	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Squaring secrecy and accountability is not a new challenge. But the information that Edward Snowden has put into the public domain has raised serious questions about how open the state should be when it comes to surveillance.UK Foreign Secretary William Hague was forced to respond to allegations about a secret US spy programme Prism and the idea that Britain's GCHQ had used it to evade the law.  There is no doubt that GCHQ and America's National Security Agency enjoy a close, even intimate relationship.Information is shared as a matter of course in a way that does not happen between MI6 and the CIA, their counterparts in the human intelligence world.    Mr Hague tried to deal head on with concerns that this relationship had been used to swerve the law, but he did so without mentioning Prism or providing any real details, other than a blanket assurance that no laws had been broken and the system of accountability and oversight was strong. In other words, the public was asked to take his answers on trust. The foreign secretary said GCHQ operated under a legal framework.  When I asked one official to explain the legal framework they pointed me to two pieces of legislation - the Intelligence Services Act of 1994 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. But when I then started to ask how those two pieces of legislation (written in the early days of the internet age and long before Twitter and social media) applied to the different forms of modern communication, they said they could not go any further.In other words a legal framework exists, but how it is interpreted and applied by government remains secret.A similar issue exists in the US. There are sweeping powers under the Patriot Act and other pieces of legislation to gather information. But the way in which these are actually used is not public. So for instance when the government requests that telecoms company Verizon passes on huge volumes of call data on Americans, it is done through a secret order the public would not have known about without Edward Snowden's revelations.Governments and intelligence agencies say this has to be the case because too much information about what communications they are intercepting can tip off hostile actors such as terrorists who will then modify their behaviour. Some analysts already claim that is happening now. ""Jihadists are now actively sharing the reporting from the Washington Post and Guardian on Prism and recommending increased security measures in their operations,"" according to IntelCenter, which monitors jihadist communications. ""Among the recommended measures are ceasing the use of services listed in the Washington Post and Guardian reports, increased use of encryption tools and other operational security and tradecraft measures designed to significantly impede efforts by intelligence agencies to identify and monitor their activities.""Against the argument that the revelations damage national security, though, is the counter-argument that the public have a right to know what is done in their name by institutions they pay for and which are supposed to be accountable to them. Especially if those actions might involve surveillance of the domestic public itself.Members of the public do not have much idea what the state is able to do when it comes to surveillance. And the state in the past has wanted to keep it that way. But the downsides of this are now becoming more apparent. When the UK's Communications Data Bill emerged (known to critics as the ""snoopers' charter""), there was outrage in some quarters at the idea that the government was seeking information about people's phone calls and emails (although not the content). What many did not realise was that the government already had this power and used it extensively (half a million requests in 2011 were made for communications data) and the new bill was simply a way of expanding it into new forms of online communication and mandating that certain types of information was kept by companies. Similarly with Prism, some people were shocked that the state might be getting information from companies like Google and Microsoft and did not realise the state could already do this using court orders and warrants.The lack of information in the public domain may well have suited the state in the past, but the consequences now in terms of public trust could be serious, particularly when faced with a partial release of certain documents by a whistleblower keen to make his point. Governments in the UK and US will now have to look at whether the potential loss in capability by talking more about the activities of the state is nonetheless necessary in order to ensure public confidence - not just in the intelligence services, but the democratic system as a whole."

On Tuesday, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Senate committee that cyber attacks and cyber espionage had supplanted terrorism as the top security threat facing the country.A day earlier in New York, US National Security Advisor Tom Donilon called on Beijing to take steps to stop cyber crime.Last month, a report from US security firm Mandiant said a unit of China's People's Liberation Army had mounted data raids on the computer systems of more than 140 mostly US-based organisations.US state department officials have said hacking comes up ""in virtually every meeting we have with Chinese officials"". In January, the New York Times said it had been subject to cyber attacks from China, following the newspaper's report on the wealth of outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao's family."

He lived in Manchester after fleeing Colonel Gaddafi's regime.Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the committee would raise the matter with Mrs May.The home secretary is due to be questioned by the Home Affairs Select Committee on 15 October.Mr Liby, also known as Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, is accused of helping to plan twin attacks on US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, which killed 224 people in 1998.Ali Soufan, a former senior FBI agent, wrote in his book on hunting al-Qaeda leaders of how he and British police investigated Mr Liby's activities in the UK. The former investigator said the suspect was held in the year after the embassy bombings - but he was released without charge because of a lack of ""smoking gun evidence"". Mr Liby is said to have then fled the UK. Mr Vaz said: ""This case raises serious questions about the motives behind asylum and national security decisions in the UK. ""It is not the first time that someone, who has been brought to the attention of the authorities and released, has gone on to be linked to further terrorist activity.""Noman Benotman, who is now president of the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremist thinktank, got to know Mr Liby when he was commander of Islamist organisation the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group.He told the BBC's Newshour: ""He's smart. He's not like the usual terrorist or mad people we are dealing with now.""He's from the old generation, he graduated from the university, he has a degree in IT from Tripoli University."" US commandos also carried out an unsuccessful raid in southern Somalia on Saturday, targeting a leader of the al-Shabab group blamed for the deadly attack on a shopping centre in neighbouring Kenya.The Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases.

Army General Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency (NSA), told the House intelligence committee the snooping operations were critical.Plans to attack the New York Stock Exchange were among those foiled, the panel heard.Meanwhile, Mr Snowden's father urged his son not to commit ""treason"".It was Gen Alexander's second public appearance before Congress since the internet and telephone surveillance programmes were exposed this month.""In recent years these programmes, together with other intelligence, have protected the US and our allies from terrorist threats across the globe to include helping prevent potential terrorist events over 50 times since 9/11,"" he said.Ten of those plots had been intended for the US, the panel heard.Sean Joyce, deputy FBI director, told the committee one of the cases had involved a ""nascent"" plot to bomb the New York Stock Exchange.Mr Joyce said a tip from the NSA had led the FBI to arrest Khalid Ouazzani of Kansas City, Missouri, on conspiracy charges.Ouazzani admitted in a federal court in 2010 plotting to provide material support to a terrorist organisation, but he was not charged with the alleged stock exchange plot. Mr Joyce also said the surveillance had been essential to disrupting the 2009 conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway, resulting in the capture of that plot's mastermind, Najibullah Zazi.Asked what was next for Mr Snowden, Mr Joyce said simply: ""Justice.""The former NSA contractor fled to Hong Kong shortly before the scandal broke.

The deal will last for six months, while a permanent agreement is sought. US President Barack Obama welcomed the deal, saying it would ""help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon"".Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran's right to uranium enrichment had been recognised. Israel, however, said the agreement was a ""historic mistake"".World powers suspect Iran's nuclear programme is secretly aiming at developing a nuclear bomb - a charge Iran has consistently denied.In a nationwide broadcast on Sunday, President Rouhani repeated that his country would never seek a nuclear weapon. He hailed the deal, saying it met one of Iran's fundamental principles.""No matter what interpretations are given, Iran's right to enrichment has been recognised,"" he said.Iran agreed to halt enrichment to medium-grade (20%) purity, which can be further enriched to weapons-grade level relatively easily, and give better access to UN  inspectors.Tehran insists it must be allowed to enrich uranium to use in power stations.The deal comes just months after Iran elected Mr Rouhani - regarded as a relative moderate - as its new president, succeeding the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.It has also been backed by Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in nuclear matters.After four days of negotiations, representatives of the so-called P5+1 group of nations - the US, the UK, Russia, China, France and Germany - reached the agreement with Iran in the early hours of Sunday. Key points of the deal have been released by the White House: Iran will stop enriching uranium beyond 5%, and ""neutralise"" its stockpile of uranium enriched beyond this pointIran will give greater access to inspectors including daily access at Natanz and Fordo nuclear sitesThere will be no further development of the Arak plant which it is believed could produce plutonium In return, there will be no new nuclear-related sanctions for six months if Iran sticks by the accordIran will also receive sanctions relief worth about $7bn (£4.3bn) on sectors including precious metalsUS Secretary of State John Kerry said the agreement would make the region safer for its allies, including Israel.But the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet it was a ""historic mistake"" and that his country reserved the right to defend itself.""Today the world became a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world made a significant step in obtaining the most dangerous weapons in the world,"" he said.At a later news conference, Mr Netanyahu said Israel would not be bound by the agreement.""We cannot and will not allow a regime that calls for the destruction of Israel to obtain the means to achieve this goal. ""Israel has many friends and allies, but when they're mistaken, its my duty to speak out.""The Israeli comments came as it was revealed that the US and Iran had held a series of face-to-face talks in recent months that paved the way for the agreement but were kept secret even from their allies.At least five meetings, involving Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, Vice President Joe Biden's senior foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan and Iranian officials, began in March at undisclosed locations, including the Gulf state of Oman, according to the Associated Press news agency.The final four meetings were held after President Rouhani was elected in August. The talks were personally authorised by President Obama, AP reports quoting senior US administration officials. The officials told AP they were ""convinced that the outreach had the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei"".Oman's Sultan Qaboos played a key role after offering himself as a mediator, according to AP.Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the agreement was an opportunity for the ""removal of any doubts about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme"". But he insisted that Iran had not given up its right to enrich uranium. ""We believe that the current agreement, the current plan of action as we call it, in two distinct places has a very clear reference to the fact that Iranian enrichment programme will continue and will be a part of any agreement, now and in the future,"" he said.The US denied any such right had been conceded, while UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the agreement was ""good news for the whole world"". But Mr Obama warned that if Iran fail to keep its commitments, ""we will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure"". This deal may be the most significant agreement between the world powers and Iran for a decade, says the BBC's James Reynolds in Geneva.In this latest round of talks, negotiators had been working since Wednesday to reach an agreement that was acceptable to both sides. It became clear that a breakthrough had been made in Geneva shortly before 03:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Sunday. In further reaction, President Vladimir Putin of Russia said he looked forward to a more comprehensive agreement.""What is done is a breakthrough but it is merely the first step on a long and difficult road,"" he said in a statement. ""In conjunction with our partners we are ready to continue the patient search for a mutually-acceptable, broader and comprehensive solution that upholds Iran's inalienable right to develop a peaceful nuclear programme.""

4921	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23980533	News	1	National Security	International News	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Every day the possibility of the US and France leading military action against Syria edges closer. If it happens, it will mark another twist in a long and complex relationship.Barack Obama and Francois Hollande were the only two leaders at the G20 meeting in Moscow committed to using force against Syria. They make a pretty unexpected coalition of the willing, when you remember the American anti-French backlash over Iraq a decade ago, when french fries were off the menu and French wine down the plug-hole.But the image of the two presidents with fortunes entwined provides a neat historical symmetry. After all, if it wasn't for France then George Washington might today only be a name known to avid history students.In 1778, a fledgling nation called the United States made its first alliance, an event that many experts believe altered the course of its war of independence with Britain.The treaty signed by Francophile Benjamin Franklin in Paris meant France recognised the United States as a sovereign nation and was committed to the defence of its new ally. In effect, it brought France into the war against its long-standing enemy, Britain.""It was the first formal alliance for the US, this treaty of alliance and friendship and it probably made the difference between victory and defeat,"" says Gregory Urwin, a professor of history at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""They were already providing covert aid, shipping weapons and munitions to Americans through front trading companies, but once they entered the war it changed the entire dynamic because Britain could no longer count on mastery of the sea."" Every American is taught about the famous victory at Yorktown and the heroics of a dashing Frenchman, the Marquis de Lafayette, the young idealist who joined the Americans before his country had even entered the war. But it's another Frenchman, the Count of Rochambeau, who is the real French hero, says Urwin, because as commander of the French forces he had a decisive influence on Washington's triumph at Yorktown.The friendship between the two nations didn't last long. France expected American assistance in the wars that followed the French Revolution but Washington was reluctant to get drawn into a European conflict in the 1790s and chose neutrality, ignoring the terms of the treaty and sparking a quasi-war with France.But the mythology of Lafayette was set in stone in 1824 when the park adjoining the White House on its northern side was renamed Lafayette Square, in a city designed by another Frenchman, Pierre L'Enfant. Lafayette was further immortalised in World War I when, on American Independence Day in 1917, US troops paraded through Paris and stopped at his tomb, where at his request he was buried in soil brought from the US. The shouts of ""Lafayette, we are here!"" symbolised a country repaying its debt 140 years later.By then, the Statue of Liberty was already fast becoming one of New York City's most visible landmarks. It was a gift from ""the French people"" in 1886 that expressed the two countries' shared values.The second world war of the 20th Century offered another chance for American soldiers to be warmly welcomed on French soil. In Normandy, the Stars and Stripes can still be seen fluttering from homes on the anniversary of the D-Day landings. But there persisted a belief among some Americans that the French were too ready to give up without a fight, a sentiment that entered popular culture in a Simpsons episode in 1995 that characterised the French as ""cheese-eating surrender monkeys"".This phrase was further popularised on the eve of the Iraq War, when France refused to support a US-led invasion, sparking a backlash against all things Gallic. The most memorable expression of this came when a restaurant in North Carolina, now closed, changed ""french fries"" to ""freedom fries"" on its menu. Others followed, including the canteen at the House of Representatives. The presidential plane Air Force One served ""stuffed freedom toast topped with strawberries,"" instead of the usual French toast.France was added to a new ""Axis of Weasel"" with Germany, by satirist Scott Ott. After coining the phrase in his blog, it was on the front page of the New York Post two days later. But Ott doesn't believe a joint operation against Syria will mark a new love affair with France. On Iraq and on Syria, the French have been on the wrong side of the argument, he says.""So France will find itself against American public opinion again,"" he says, adding that he loves France but makes a distinction between its government and country.French fries were soon back on the menu but many Americans were embarrassed by the headlines it generated around the world.""Iraq was a ridiculous over-reaction to what could be considered a rational response by the French government and French people,"" says Steve Smith, an American who writes about France for Rick Steves' guidebooks.American tourism to France dropped, he says, either because Americans were angry with the French or embarrassed. Some that did visit pretended they were Canadian. ""There was a huge drop in business. The number of tours to the country and guide books sold fell off the table, although it recovered years later.""He thinks Americans love France but don't really understand the French. ""There's such a fundamental difference in outlook. The French are driven not by how much money you make but what's on the menu for dinner tonight and what you are reading."" Americans will ask early on what do you do for a living but the French won't, he says. And an American suspicion that French people are lazy exists because the French are more appreciative of leisure time.""They also expect more from government. The French are more willing to sacrifice the rights of the individual for the good of the community.""The French played a leading role in Libya but it's the prospect of the two nations standing shoulder to shoulder on Syria that has ministers gushing. US Secretary of State John Kerry has talked fondly of the nation's ""oldest ally"" and spoke French as he made the case for military action while in Paris. One security analyst in Washington said: ""We're all over here learning French, saying 'Vive la France!' That's the new thing.""The rapprochement between the two leaders over Syria will matter to public perceptions, says Smith, because Americans love it when other people are on their side.""I feel it, listening to Hollande's words on the radio. And I think the average American is listening and will pay attention.""The man who took french fries off the menu at the House of Representatives says it's ironic that the French are now leading the charge. ""What a turnaround,"" says former Congressman Bob Ney, who maintains that what he did was a gesture to the troops in response to the heated anti-Americanism coming out of Paris at the time.And then, with a joking reference to the British, he adds: ""Maybe we will have to ban fish and chips now.""You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

America's weak spot is its economy, which began to totter from the drain of its military and security expenditure,"" he says.Zawahiri advocates ""continuing the drain of military and security expenditures so that we keep America in a state of tension and anticipation, [wondering] when and where the next blow will come"".""Keeping America in a state of tension and anticipation does not cost us anything but [organising] dispersed strikes here and there. In other words, just as we defeated it in a war of nerves in Somalia, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan, we must afflict it with a similar war in its own home.""These dispersed strikes can be carried out by one brother, or a small number of brothers."" The emphasis on smaller-scale strikes may well be seen as an acknowledgement of a diminishing ability of al-Qaeda's central leadership to plan and carry out major, organised attacks of the type it managed in the past.That shift is evident in Zawahiri calling on supporters to begin an economic boycott.""We must explain to them that every dollar's worth of goods that we buy from America and her allies amounts to a bullet or shrapnel that kills a Muslim in Palestine or Afghanistan.""Most analysts believe that the al-Qaeda core in Pakistan has been severely damaged and this message appears to be an acknowledgement of that reality.However, affiliates in other parts of the world - notably al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen - are said by government officials to remain a threat. Zawahiri, who has historically tended to focus more on ideology and strategy, also spends a significant amount of the message talking about recent events in Egypt.He says that the US was behind the ""coup"" against the Muslim Brotherhood.He also criticises Mohammed Morsi, the deposed president who hails from the Muslim Brotherhood, saying he was not governing according to Islamic law and had committed to abide by security agreements with the US and Israel.Zawahiri, whose background before joining al-Qaeda was in Egypt's Islamist movements, also emphasises his opposition to the Brotherhood's willingness to work through democratic politics.He criticises other Islamist movements in places like Tunisia for coming to ""an understanding with America"".The events in the Middle East have raised serious ideological challenges for al-Qaeda, with it appearing increasingly irrelevant amid signs that protests, people power and even democratic elections might be a more viable vehicle for change than the kind of violence that al-Qaeda espoused.However, with the optimism of the past few years fading fast, Zawahiri appears to be hoping that al-Qaeda's ideology of rejecting democracy and promoting uncompromising violence might be able to gain more of a foothold.Syria remains a key focus for international attention - including for al-Qaeda. Zawahiri warns Islamist opposition groups there not to come to any agreement with ""secularists"" who are also fighting the Assad regime.""Let what happened in Egypt be a lesson to them,"" he says, before arguing that the jihadists groups need to unite in the region.This may well be a reference to recent reports of splits and divisions, not just within Syrian jihadist groups but also with the Iraqi-based groups.

The anti-secrecy group said Mr Snowden's asylum request would be formally processed when he arrived in Ecuador.Spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told the BBC he believed history would show that the former analyst had performed ""a great public service"".The US state department said Mr Snowden's passport had been revoked, saying this was ""routine and consistent with US regulations"".However, one US official told the Associated Press that if a senior official in a country or airline ordered it, a country could overlook the lack of a passport.Hong Kong officials said Mr Snowden had left ""on his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel"" because the US extradition request was incomplete and there was no legal basis to restrict him from departing.The US justice department said it was ""disappointed"" that Hong Kong did not arrest Mr Snowden and that it ""disagrees"" with its reasons for not doing so.An official said that at no point during talks on Friday did Hong Kong raise issues regarding the sufficiency of the US request.""In light of this, we find their decision to be particularly troubling,"" the official said.Mr Snowden left on Aeroflot flight SU213 and landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport shortly after 17:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Sunday, where he was reportedly picked up by either a Venezuelan or Ecuadorean embassy car.Reports suggest he will fly out of Russia on an early afternoon flight to the Cuban capital Havana, where he is booked on another flight to Caracas, Venezuela.Following that route would enable him to fly on to Ecuador without risk of arrest by US authorities.It is unclear where Mr Snowden currently is, but he is reported to have not left the airport, and the Ecuadorean ambassador was spotted at an airside hotel.The US and Ecuador have a joint extradition treaty, but it is not applicable to ""crimes or offences of a political character"".The US justice department has said it will seek co-operation from whichever country Mr Snowden arrives in.But if Mr Snowden ends up in Ecuador, it is going to be extremely difficult for the Americans to get him, the BBC's Paul Adams in Washington reports.Mr Snowden had left his home in Hawaii after leaking details of his work as an NSA (National Security Agency) analyst and the extensive US surveillance programme to the UK's Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post.He has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. The complaint is dated 14 June - although it was made public only on Friday.NSA chief Keith Alexander told ABC News on Sunday there had been no warning that Mr Snowden had taken the documents.""Clearly, the system did not work as it should have,"" he said.Gen Alexander also said the spying agency was overhauling its operations to tighten security on contractors.The leaks have led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under an NSA programme known as Prism.Mr Snowden said earlier that he had decided to speak out after observing ""a continuing litany of lies"" from senior officials to Congress.US officials have defended the practice of gathering telephone and internet data from private users around the world.They say Prism cannot be used to intentionally target any Americans or anyone in the US, and that it is supervised by judges."

His decision to put off an attack on Syria and seek authorisation from Congress apparently stunned some of his closest advisers. Secretary of State John Kerry has defended the president's abrupt change of approach, telling NBC: ""He didn't think it was worthwhile acting and having the Syrians and a whole bunch of other folks looking at the United States arguing about whether or not it was legitimate, or should he have done it, or should he have moved faster.""But that is precisely what will happen for at least the next 10 days. There's lots of criticism already and a lot of rehashing of how he got to this position. Only on Friday, the Secretary of State went out on a limb stressing what was at stake for the world and America's reputation. It is hard to imagine that he's best pleased that Assad's punishment has been put on hold. If Congress votes ""No"", his words will come back to haunt him and Obama.That could happen: victory is by no means assured, particularly in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Perhaps the Senate isn't safe either - this will be a free vote and there'll be no formal attempt by party leaders to persuade their colleagues. After receiving a lengthy classified intelligence briefing on Capitol Hill, several senators and congressmen seemed unconvinced. The draft resolution from the White House calls for authorisation for action to ""deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade"" Syria's ability to use chemical weapons: two senators - one Republican, one Democrat - called that too open-ended.Republican Senator John McCain, who has been leading the demand for military intervention in Syria, said that there was ""no strategy, no plan"" - and both were needed before he'd back the motion.If Congress doesn't back him, it will be disastrous for the president. His decision to call for a vote will look foolish and he would be left with an appalling choice.Ignore the vote and enrage Congress and many Americans. Or don't strike and live with John Kerry's words that America will be weakened, petty dictators emboldened and history's judgement harsh on America's leaders.  So everything hangs on Obama winning the vote. But even if he does, the delay gives Assad more time to prepare for the blow.The decision has left many commentators questioning his leadership and asking how Obama managed to box himself in.But to have taken action without the UN, without the UK, without Congress and without the American people's support would have been very uncomfortable for a man who came to office vowing to end America's foreign wars."

""The danger is that we could be reaching a point where nuclear weapons would become almost conventional, and there will be the possibility of a nuclear conflict at some point... that would be a turning point in human history,"" he said.""If Iran acts as a nation and not as a revolutionary cause, there is no reason for America or other permanent members of the UNSC to be in conflict with it, nor any countries in the region. On that basis I would hope that a negotiated solution would be found in a measurable time.""Meanwhile, Mr Kissinger advocated a US-Russia understanding over the conflict in Syria, while opposing military intervention.

""So this is a just war - a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defence.""He added: ""And yet as our fight enters a new phase, America's legitimate claim of self-defence cannot be the end of the discussion.

Declaring America at a ""crossroads"" in its efforts to combat militancy, Mr Obama also said his administration would be willing to accept increased oversight of drone strikes outside war zones like Afghanistan.Human rights groups have long condemned the use of unmanned drones to carry out killings.Mr Obama warned that a ""perpetual"" US war on terror, whether through drone strikes, special forces operations or troop deployments, would be ""self-defeating"".As the president addressed efforts to close the detention centre at the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, he was interrupted by a protester shouting about the current hunger strike at the prison.""I'm willing to cut the young lady who interrupted me some slack because it's worth being passionate about,"" he said.Mr Obama told his audience: ""Guantanamo has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.""The president had made shutting the prison a top priority at the beginning of his first term, but his effort foundered amid strong opposition in Congress.Calling on Congress not to block his efforts to transfer the facility's inmates to American high-security jails, he added: ""No person has ever escaped from one of our super-max or military prisons in the United States.""Mr Obama said he was appointing envoys from the defence and state departments to negotiate transfers of detainees to other countries, and said he would lift a moratorium on transfers to Yemen.After the speech, Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss told reporters Mr Obama was wrong to lift the Yemen moratorium because Yemeni authorities could not be trusted to ""handle them"".""We've got 166 of the meanest, nastiest killers in the world located at Guantanamo Bay today,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Yemen welcomed the move, a spokesman at the country's Washington embassy said.Mr Obama's speech coincided with the signing of new ""presidential policy guidance"" on the use of drone strikes, the White House said. The policy document curtails the circumstances in which drones can be used in places that are not overt war zones, such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.In an outline of the new policy released to the news media, the administration said it preferred to capture terrorist suspects, with drone strikes used only amid a ""continuing, imminent threat"" to the US.Reports suggested that the military would assume greater control over the drone programme, which is currently led in most areas by the CIA.However, it was also reported that the CIA would maintain control of the programme in Pakistan, where most strikes have been carried out.Beyond that, the administration listed criteria for the approval of a drone strike:""Near certainty"" the target was present and that civilians would not be injured or killedCapture would not be feasibleAuthorities of the country in question could not or would not address the threatNo other reasonable alternatives were availableOn Wednesday, the US disclosed that four Americans had been killed in drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan since 2011, marking the first formal public acknowledgement of the US citizen deaths in drone strikes.In a letter to the Senate judiciary committee, US Attorney General Eric Holder defended the targeted killing in 2011 of Anwar al-Awlaki, whom he described as a ""senior operational leader"" of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.Awlaki, who was born in the US state of New Mexico, was killed in a missile strike from an unmanned plane in Yemen in September 2011 along with Samir Khan, a naturalised US citizen who produced an online al-Qaeda magazine.Awlaki's 16-year-old son Abdulrahman, born in Colorado, was killed in Yemen a month later.Mr Holder also confirmed Jude Kenan Mohammad, a North Carolina resident, had been killed in a drone strike. He is thought to have died in a strike in November 2011 in Pakistan's South Waziristan region.Mr Holder said only Awlaki had been ""specifically targeted and killed"", and that the other men ""were not specifically targeted by the United States""."

The son of President Desi Bouterse was extradited from Panama in August.He had already been charged with trying to smuggle cocaine and weapons into the United States. Mr Bouterse could be sentenced to life in jail for the drugs and weapons smuggling charges and to up to 15 years for the terrorism-related accusations.The Suriname president's son insists he is innocent, but his lawyers have not yet reacted to the latest charges.The US authorities say they have recorded meetings of Mr Bouterse with undercover agents and informants posing as Hezbollah operatives in Panama and in Greece.""Alleged criminals like Bouterse and his facilitators pose a direct threat  to the safety and security of the United States,"" the administrator of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, Michelle Leonhart, told the Associated Press news agency.At a meeting in Greece, Mr Bouterse reportedly accepted $2 million (£1.25m) to help Hezbollah fighters settle in Suriname, give them passports and arm them with surface-to-air missiles and other weapons.He reportedly told them he would present within two months a list of the weapons he could provide.Mr Bouterse was arrested in Panama in late August, while travelling on a diplomatic passport, and quickly handed over to the US authorities.He was sentenced to eight years in prison in Surinam in 2005, after being found guilty of trafficking in drugs, weapons and stolen luxury cars.But Mr Bouterse was released three years later for good behaviour and was later named director of Suriname's Counter Terrorist Unit.His father,  Desi Bouterse, a former coup leader, was elected president of Suriname in 2010.He was accused of numerous human rights violations in the 1980s but was given immunity by parliament in 2012.

Mr Kucherena said Mr Snowden was being looked after by a legal expert from the whistleblowing organisation Wikileaks.Russia's Federal Migration Service later officially confirmed that Mr Snowden had been granted temporary asylum for one year, Interfax news agency reported.In a statement issued on the Wikileaks website, Mr Snowden said: ""Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law, but in the end the law is winning.

The man he wants as defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, faces a real risk of being given the thumbs down and will certainly get a rough ride. A decorated Vietnam veteran, he has an aversion to war and a view of Israel that falls short of what many Republicans demand. Not that Mr Obama's pick for CIA director, John Brennan, will be uncontroversial. He has been the president's main man on national security since 2008 and is a CIA veteran of 25 years so no-one doubts he knows his way around. But liberals say he was too close to George W Bush's administration - particularly the faulty intelligence that led to the Iraq war and the torture of terrorist suspects. But any trouble he has will be minor compared to Mr Hagel.The former Republican senator is a renegade to many in his own party. He broke with them over the Iraq war. He has been accused of anti-Semitism for saying that: ""the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here, [Congress]. I'm a United States senator. I'm not an Israeli senator.""

About a million people were killed in the civil war that raged in Mozambique after it achieved independence from Portugal in 1975.  Mozambique's economy has been booming since the civil war ended. Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga said that government soldiers had bombarded the Sathunjira base in central Sofala province with heavy weapons before occupying it on Monday.""Peace is over in the country... The responsibility lies with the Frelimo government because they didn't want to listen to Renamo's grievances,"" Mr Mazanga told Reuters news agency.The attack was an attempt to assassinate Mr Dhlakama but he managed to escape to an undisclosed location, Mr Mazanga said.In a statement, Renamo blamed President Armando Guebuza for the attack.""This irresponsible attitude of the commander-in-chief of the defence and security forces puts an end to the Rome peace deal,"" it said.The BBC's Jose Tembe in the capital, Maputo, says Renamo's statement suggests that it plans to go back to war, but it has denied this in the past. Defence ministry spokesman Cristovao Chume said government forces had taken control of the base in response to an earlier attack on an army post by Renamo fighters.He confirmed that Mr Dhlakama had fled.Mr Chume and Mr Mazanga did not give any casualty figures. Mozambique's Frelimo government has repeatedly accused Renamo of dragging the country back to war, an allegation it denies. In April, at least five people were killed in central Mozambique after Renamo members attacked a police post.A force of about 300 Renamo men has remained armed since the peace accord, despite efforts to integrate them into the army or police force.Mr Dhlakama has said he needs his own personal bodyguards, and the men usually stay in his bush camp in the Gorongosa mountains.After the civil war ended, Mr Dhlakama moved out of the camp to live in Maputo and later in the northern Nampula province  But he returned to the mountains last year, saying he needed to be close to his men who were feeling ignored. Mozambique is due to hold local elections in November, and presidential and parliamentary elections next year.Mr Guebuza's Frelimo party has governed Mozambique since independence in 1975.Renamo, which was formed around the same time, was backed by the white minority governments in neighbouring South Africa and what is now Zimbabwe.

She had to watch the consequences of his firmness from the sidelines, as she had been removed from office by her own MPs in the last weeks before the American-led invasion of Iraq and Kuwait began in January 1991.  Lady Thatcher's belief in the importance of Britain's relationship with the United States was only part of the reason why she sent RAF aircraft to Saudi Arabia within 48 hours of the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and soon after started the deployment of what became a force of more than 53,000 British troops. Her response to what was happening in Kuwait was conditioned by her own experience of the war to recapture the Falklands Islands from Argentina in 1982. And Britain had its own reasons to protect oil supplies from the Gulf, and what had become a highly lucrative business relationship with Saudi Arabia. Britain had pulled its military forces out of the Middle East after the decision to retreat from east of Suez in the 1960s. The UK's Middle Eastern moment appeared to be over, so when the Thatcher government rushed troops to Saudi Arabia in 1990 the British army had to announce that it no longer had desert pattern uniforms. Embarrassingly, it emerged that it sold its stocks to Iraq in the 1980s. But Britain had retained big business interests. From early on in her premiership Mrs Thatcher had recognised the commercial possibilities in the Gulf. She was closely involved in the negotiations that led to the al-Yamamah arms deal, selling British warplanes worth tens of billions of pounds to Saudi Arabia. The deal has also been surrounded by allegations that bribes were paid to members of the Saudi royal family. Since the first war against Iraq in 1991, many thousands of British soldiers have spent time in the Middle East.  Mrs Thatcher's government revived Britain's political and military role in the region, which continues.Since Margaret Thatcher's death was announced both Israel's president and prime minister have praised her support for their state. During her time in Number 10 though, Britain was one of the first Western countries to establish relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, pressing it to recognise the existence of Israel. In 1989 she sent William Waldegrave, then a junior minister in the Foreign Office, to Tunis to meet PLO officials and eventually the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It was one of the steps that led to the Oslo process, the attempt to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s. "

First, Mr Brennan will be confirmed. And second, despite nearly a dozen years of war, there are profound disagreements both within the United States and beyond about how this conflict has been and should be waged.Mr Brennan provided a forceful defence of the Obama administration's war against al-Qaeda over the past four years, particularly its increased employment of drones in various countries he declined to specify. He made clear that the administration believes it has the legal authority to use lethal force in self-defence against al-Qaeda and associated forces wherever there is an imminent threat against the United States and capture is not feasible. The committee was clearly supportive of the continued use of drones in the ongoing war against al-Qaeda. Americans by a wide margin share this view.But that is not the case outside the United States. The rest of the world questions the legality of their use, viscerally so in a country such as Pakistan, where drone attacks increased significantly during President Obama's first term.While Mr Brennan declined to discuss where drones are employed, Ambassador Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, displayed no such reticence. In a discussion with reporters in Washington two days before Mr Brennan's testimony, she made clear that the civilian government in Islamabad views America's continued deployment of drones as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty, as well as strategically counter-productive. ""We need to drain this swamp and instead it [the drone campaign] is radicalising people,"" Ambassador Rehman said. ""It creates more potential terrorists on the ground and militants on the ground instead of taking them out. If it's taking out, say, a high-value or a medium-value target, it's also creating probably an entire community of future recruits.""Recent polling tends to support Ambassador Rehman's view. An estimated 74% of Pakistanis polled by Pew last year termed the United States an ""enemy."" Drones are a clear factor. Mr Brennan says the administration takes into account the potential backlash from ongoing counter-terrorism operations. But rather than address Pakistani concerns publicly as part of a long-term public diplomacy approach, the Obama administration has chosen, at least at the moment, to pretend the problem does not exist. It refuses to acknowledge (despite widespread news reports) the existence of a drone campaign in Pakistan.Whether this approach is sustainable and for how long is an open question.According to Pakistani authorities, whether or not there was close co-ordination regarding drone operations in the past, there is none now. Ambassador Rehman denies that Pakistan criticises the use of drones in public, but co-operates in private.""There is no question of any quiet complicity. No question of wink and nod,"" she insisted.This represents a genuine conundrum for the Obama administration. There is no question that drone strikes have been a major factor in virtually eliminating the strategic threat posed by core al-Qaeda. But what started out as a strategic campaign against high-value targets has morphed into something far more tactical. Drones are increasingly employed not against al-Qaeda operatives plotting attacks against the American homeland, but to target lower-level Taliban forces that continue to attack US forces in Afghanistan. Presumably, Washington wants to keep up pressure on al-Qaeda's sanctuary in the tribal areas until US forces withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014.But at what cost?At the start of the Obama administration, strengthening of civilian governmental institutions in Pakistan was considered the long-term solution to extremism linked to Pakistan. Now the drone campaign undercuts the very civilian government the United States is spending billions in aid to build up.Relations between the two countries have stabilised, but the lack of trust remains deep. The Pakistani parliament has made clear that drones are a ""red line"", one Washington chooses for the moment to ignore, putting its long-term standing and influence with Pakistan in jeopardy.""Every time there is a drone strike, you see it on 40 channels at least in Pakistan,"" said Ambassador Rehman. ""They lend an unfortunate view of US power and how the United States projects its power abroad.""Drones may be a key element in the US strategy, but as Ambassador Rehman makes clear, they are ""not part of our playbook. The time for drone strikes is really over.""But based on the Brennan hearing, there is no indication the United States plans to follow her advice any time soon."

His leaks revealed that US agencies had systematically gathered vast amounts of phone and web data.The criminal complaint was lodged with a federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia,  court documents show, and a provisional arrest warrant had been issued, officials said.On Saturday a senior US administration official said: ""If Hong Kong doesn't act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong's commitment to the rule of law.""Mr Snowden left a hotel in Hong Kong on 10 June after allowing newspapers to name him as the source of the leaks. His current whereabouts are unknown. However, a report in Hong Kong's Sunday Morning Post suggested he was ""in a safe place"" in the city and not in custody, nor under police protection, as reported elsewhere.Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, signed an extradition treaty with the US in 1998.It has a separate legal system from the Chinese mainland, and Mr Snowden's right of appeal could drag out any future extradition proceedings for several years.Some Hong Kong politicians have voiced support for Mr Snowden.Left-wing MP Leung Kwok-hung said Beijing should tell the authorities to protect him from extradition, and the people of the territory should ""take to the streets"" to shelter him. The BBC's Juliana Liu in Hong Kong says Beijing is highly unlikely to interfere in the early stages of what could be a long legal battle. The leaks have led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under an NSA programme known as Prism.Mr Snowden also alleged that US intelligence had been hacking into Chinese computer networks. Further details of his allegations emerged on Sunday in a report by the Sunday Morning Post, which said that as recently as January this year the NSA hacked computers and servers at the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing.He said earlier that he had decided to speak out after observing ""a continuing litany of lies"" from senior officials to Congress.US officials have since defended the practice of gathering telephone and internet data from private users around the world.They say Prism cannot be used to intentionally target any Americans or anyone in the US, and that it is supervised by judges.Mr Snowden is charged with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. The complaint is dated 14 June although it was made public only on Friday.In the US, the charges were welcomed by Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.""I've always thought this was a treasonous act,'' he said in a statement.  ""I hope Hong Kong's government will take him into custody and extradite him to the US.""Julian Assange, founder of the Wikileaks organisation, issued a statement supporting Mr Snowden.""The US government is spying on each and every one of us, but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off,"" said Mr Assange, who has been living in Ecuador's London embassy for the past year, fighting extradition to Sweden for questioning on alleged sex offences."

Angela Merkel is a texter: she does it all the time.  There she is during a debate, thumbs going furiously. Sometimes she texts colleagues across the chamber, and then looks up and catches their eye to check they have got the message.   In her office in the Kanzleramt - the Chancellery - it lies on the floor, charging.  But the rest of the time, it is not far from her hand.Since she has learnt that others might be reading her messages at the National Security Agency in Maryland outside Washington, she has said that she doesn't plan to change her habits.  An enterprising German company has marketed what it calls the Chancellor Phone - one so secure that prying eyes and ears cannot intrude. The chancellor will no doubt use the Chancellor Phone - but you cannot doubt that recent events have shaken her.In Germany, particularly in East Germany where Angela Merkel grew up, people feel strongly about the state tapping phones and bugging rooms.  In the east of Berlin,  an amazing complex of buildings houses what was once the headquarters of the ministry of state security, the Ministerium fur Staatssicherheit - the Stasi.Today, the headquarters is a museum and a home for the vast archive where East Germans can learn who spied on whom.One Berlin politician learnt after the Berlin Wall came down that her husband had spied on her.  She divorced him.The offices themselves now display all the paraphernalia of eavesdropping - the hollow tree-trunks with a hole for the camera; the jacket buttons that turn out to be lenses.  The spying of the past is there for all to see.When communism collapsed, there were 91,000 people working for the Stasi.  It is easy to find maps showing old Stasi premises, and just in the area where I live in Berlin, there are seven places used by the spooks of the Stasi - seven secret flats within an area not much bigger than a football field.  That's how pervasive spying on citizens was.  Just behind where I live, 79 Dunckerstrasse was, it turns out, rented by the Stasi.  At the end of my square - Helmholzplatz - there was an apartment which purported to be for students but which was actually the place where one Major Grabner and his colleague, Wolf, met informers.  At the other end of the square, there is now a bright blue door between a second-hand clothes shop and a chi-chi restaurant.  This used to be the door through which informers would go.  Everybody knew what was going on. After all, Chancellor Kohl used to go off to telephone boxes to make sensitive calls when he was the leader of West Germany - he assumed the official phones he used might be tapped by the East German authorities.    So when Angela Merkel says now that friends do not spy on friends, she means what she says. She knows about it.      But perhaps Chancellor Merkel has just been too trusting despite growing up in a police state.  I've noticed how she seems to have far less security in general than do other world leaders.  I once went to a meeting she was addressing, a big meeting with demonstrators.  One man was striding up and down along the entrance hall, waiting for her.  He had a long stick with a banner on the end of it.    I can remember thinking as she was about to arrive that he was not going to be allowed to remain there, right on her route as she walked by.  And sure enough, the police went up to him.  There was a long discussion.  But instead of him being carted off, as would have happened in the United States or, I think, Britain, he was told that the big stick was a problem. He was welcome to stay and wave the banner in her face, but not with the stick.I found that refreshing.  And also the way she keeps texting.  What did the Americans learn?  Only they know.  It would be nice to think that it was nothing more useful than:  ""I'll be back from Brussels later, dear. Why don't you get a couple of schnitzel from the corner shop?"""

Congress is due to reconvene on 9 September.The Syrian government denies it was behind the attacks and blames rebels.UN inspectors who have been investigating the attacks arrived in the Netherlands on Saturday with samples from site visits, which will be tested in laboratories in Europe. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is overseeing the investigation, said the whole testing process could take up to three weeks, although ""every effort"" would be made to expedite it. Senior White House officials told the BBC's Katty Kay that Mr Obama's decision to seek congressional approval was made by the president on Friday afternoon. It had not been planned until then.The officials added that they believed they would get congressional approval, although they were aware of the risks, our correspondent adds. Later on Saturday, Mr Obama formally asked Congress to authorise military action. The draft legislation seeks approval for the use of force to prevent the Syrian government from carrying out chemical weapons attacks.President Obama said the US was prepared to strike whenever it chose. ""Our capacity to execute this mission is not time-sensitive.""He added: ""We cannot and will not turn a blind eye to what happened in Damascus.""Mr Obama says he has the constitutional authority as commander-in-chief to order military action without the backing of Congress.However, he said it was important to have the debate. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the announcement, saying the president's role as commander-in-chief was ""always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress"".Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have been pushing for US intervention in Syria, also gave their backing to the vote.However, they warned against limited strikes which would not change the balance of the conflict, calling the prospect ""an inadequate response to the crimes against humanity that [Syrian President] Assad and his forces are committing"".The BBC's Katy Watson in Washington says that if Mr Obama is to intervene, he wants the people - and politicians - on his side.But what is unclear is what action he would take if Congress votes against involvement, our correspondent says.On Thursday, British MPs defeated a government motion to take part in any military action in Syria. After the president's address UK Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted:  ""I understand and support Barack Obama's position"".Mr Obama did not speak to Mr Cameron before his statement but did call President Hollande of France, the White House said.France has also backed military action in Syria. The French parliament is due to reconvene next week.France will wait for discussions in the US Congress and French parliament before making a decision on military intervention, a French official told the Associated Press. Earlier on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin challenged the US to present to the UN evidence that Syria had attacked rebels with chemical weapons. Mr Putin said it would be ""utter nonsense"" for Syria's government to provoke opponents with such attacks.Russia - a key ally of Syria - has previously warned that ""any unilateral military action bypassing the UN Security Council"" would be a ""direct violation of international law"".Moscow, along with China, has vetoed two previous draft resolutions on Syria.The BBC's Jeremy Bowen in Damascus says people there are worried and are making preparations.They do not know what Mr Obama meant by a limited attack and what consequences it will have, he adds.The main findings of the unclassified US evidence state that:the attacks killed 1,429 people, including 426 childrenSyrian military chemical weapons personnel were operating in the area in the three days before the attackSatellite evidence shows rockets launched from government-held areas 90 minutes before the first report of chemical attack100 videos attributed to the attack show symptoms consistent with exposure to a nerve agentCommunications were intercepted involving a senior Damascus official who ""confirmed chemical weapons were used"" and was concerned about UN inspectors obtaining evidenceSyrian President Bashar al-Assad has said his country will defend itself against any Western ""aggression"".Forces which could be used against Syria:•Four US destroyers - USS Gravely, USS Ramage, USS Barry and USS Mahan - are in the eastern Mediterranean, equipped with cruise missiles. The missiles can also be fired from submarines, but the US Navy does not reveal their locations•Airbases at Incirlik and Izmir in Turkey, and in Jordan, could be used to carry out strikes•Two aircraft carriers - USS Nimitz and USS Harry S Truman are in the wider region•French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is currently in Toulon in the western Mediterranean•French Rafale and Mirage aircraft can also operate from Al-Dhahra airbase in the UAECorrection 3 September: An earlier version of the story stated that President Obama has the constitutional authority to order military action without the backing of Congress.

It's now up to the House to do the same,"" Mr Obama said in a statement.""As this process moves forward, I urge everyone who cares about this issue to keep a watchful eye. Now is the time when opponents will try their hardest to pull this bipartisan effort apart so they can stop common-sense reform from becoming a reality. We cannot let that happen.""Members of the Senate's so-called Gang of Eight, the bipartisan group of senators who drafted the bill and hoped a resounding vote total would pressure the House, echoed the plea.""To our friends in the House, we ask for your consideration and we stand ready to sit down and negotiate with you,"" Republican Senator John McCain said.""You may have different views on different aspects of this issue, but all of us share the same goal, and that is to take 11 million people out of the shadows, secure our borders and make sure that this is the nation of opportunity and freedom.""At a news conference, Republican House Speaker John Boehner said the House would chart its own legislation with a focus on border security.How exactly Mr Boehner will proceed remained unclear, but the Speaker has called a special meeting of his majority Republicans for 10 July to go over options.""The House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes. We're going to do our own bill,"" he said.The bill passed by the Senate devotes $46bn (£30bn, 35 euros) to border security improvements, including calling for a doubling of the border patrol stationed on the US-Mexico border and the completion of 1,100km of fencing - changes added at the last minute to attract Republican support.No-one would be able to get a permanent resident green card until those border enhancements and others were in place.The bill also makes it mandatory for employers to check their workers' legal status, sets up new visa programmes to allow workers into the country and establishes new tracking systems at seaports and airports to keep better tabs on people entering and leaving the country.At its contentious core, though, is the 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants living in the US illegally.Without such a provision, senators say the legislation could not pass the Senate. With it, its prospects are difficult in the House.Mr Boehner declined to say whether there were circumstances under which he could support a pathway to citizenship, but he made clear that securing the border was a priority."

Sir Francis Richards said it was ""not a very good idea"" for an ex-Conservative minister to head Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.But Sir Malcolm Rifkind said he was well placed to do the job as he had ""handled intelligence"" as a minister.It follows questions about intelligence leaked by US whistleblower Ed Snowden. Sir David Omand, a former UK homeland security adviser, has suggested the public disclosure of thousands of top-secret files by former CIA spy Edward Snowden was the most ""catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever"".The episode has raised questions about the oversight of the British security services, with Business Secretary Vince Cable among those urging a review of current arrangements. The Guardian - which published the original revelations about the data-gathering and surveillance activities of the US National Security Agency and its relationship with UK agencies - has suggested that a debate was starting in government about updating the way politicians oversee the security services. The intelligence and security committee has access to classified intelligence material and holds its meetings in private for security reasons.Reporting to Parliament, it publishes an annual review of the UK's intelligence policy as well as the administration and funding of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.Its remit was expanded earlier this year to cover operational matters, as well as the intelligence-related work of other government agencies such as the Joint Intelligence Committee, the National Security Secretariat, the Defence Intelligence department in the Ministry of Defence and the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism.Sir Malcolm, a former foreign and defence secretary under John Major, was appointed to chair the committee by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010.Sir Francis Richards, a career diplomat and former director of the GCHQ listening post, said he did not doubt Sir Malcolm's qualifications or ability to do the job but questioned whether he is ""well-placed to command confidence"".Sir Malcolm told BBC Radio 4's World At One, that the committee was ""completely bipartisan"" and the views he expressed as chairman were those of the whole committee, which has members from all parties. ""I'm perfectly happy to criticise and attack the government if they do something silly or stupid,"" he added.""Quite a number of people on the Intelligence and Security Committee are former ministers because we are people who've actually handled intelligence. We've had to deal with it as users of the product.""We are responsible for deciding whether the security services do something dumb or stupid or illegal and if they do, we are prepared to be very very brutal with them.""Sir Malcolm also said those calling for more scrutiny ""seemed to have forgotten"" that the government had ""dramatically increased"" the powers of the committee.No 10 has insisted there is no government review of oversight of the security services and the prime minister thinks the current system is working effectively.But he said it was open to members of the National Security Council and the Privy Council to ask the security agencies questions, and he said David Cameron was prepared to listen to ideas from others.Mr Clegg told the BBC that the ISC's powers had already been ""significantly strengthened"" but there was an ""ongoing debate"" about whether more needed to be done.""And I think many of these revelations have quite rightly raised questions about how we can increase oversight further where that is clearly justified,"" he said."

The last Labour government agreed transitional controls on immigration from Bulgaria and Romania when the two countries joined the European Union in 2007, but these expire at the start of next year.The government has said it is impossible, under EU law, to keep the limits in place any longer.But ministers are coming under increasing pressure to act, from MPs concerned about the repercussions of any increase in arrivals for public services and commitments to cut net migration. According to newspaper reports, Downing Street is considering restricting access to public services for future migrants, as one of a number of potential responses.According to The Financial Times, options being considered included asking immigrants who had not found a job within three months or did not have necessary funds to support themselves for six months to leave. No 10 said it was is considering all options open to it, but a spokesman stressed there was a ""clear legal framework"" underpinning guarantees on the free movement of people within the European Union and ""we have to operate within that"".The spokesman played down suggestions Britain might try to deter Bulgarian and Romanian arrivals by launching an advertising campaign in those countries stressing the negative aspects of life in the UK, including the weather.But Mr Vaz, who is chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said any suggestion of spending money on ""advertisements and propaganda trying to stop Romanian and Bulgarians coming to Britain borders on the farcical"".""On the one hand, the Home Office doesn't want them in but on the other hand, the minister for Europe is saying there is freedom of movement,"" he said. ""The government is in danger of actually encouraging more people to come.""""These kinds of tactics have been used in the past and been found to be counterproductive.""He also suggested there were divisions in government about how to deal with the issue.Mr Vaz said the question of whether foreign workers should have guaranteed access to public services, including the NHS, should be looked at, but warned against ""singling out"" workers from individual countries.""Ministers would be better off working with their Romanian and Bulgarian counterparts and the EU to address the reasons migrants want to come here in the first place.""Migration figuresMinisters have warned against ""scare stories"" about a potential surge in numbers. But Mr Vaz said officials had failed to come up with an estimate of the number of arrivals expected, despite repeated requests.The think tank Migration Watch, which supports tighter immigration controls, has said about 50,000 people from Romania and Bulgaria will come to the UK each year until 2019 and that this will have ""significant consequences"" for housing and jobs.The government's own migration advisory committee says there is evidence Bulgarians would move to Britain because of its stronger economy, and it is ""plausible"" Romanians would come for the same reasons.Since 2007, Bulgarians and Romanians have been able to come to the UK as self-employed businessmen or women, or as students, provided they do not seek benefits or any other employment. But the end of existing controls will give Bulgarian and Romanians who want to work in the UK the same rights as foreign nationals from the other 24 EU nations.Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said ministers were ""utterly opposed"" to European Commission proposals which he claimed would allow future migrants - including those from Bulgaria and Romania - to claim benefits on ""day one"" after arriving. But a spokesman for the European Commission described the minister's claims as ""total tosh"" and said EU nations were not obliged to do so unless certain residency tests are met. "

The operation, dubbed ""Minaret"", was originally exposed in the 1970s.However, the names of those on the phone-tapping ""watch list"" had been kept secret until now.The secret papers were published after a government panel ruled in favour of researchers at George Washington University.The university's National Security Archive - a research institute that seeks to check government secrecy - described the names on the NSA's watch-list as ""eye-popping"".The agency eavesdropped on civil rights leaders Martin Luther King and Whitney Young as well as boxing champion Muhammad Ali, New York Times journalist Tom Wicker and Washington Post columnist Art Buchwald.The NSA also monitored the overseas phone calls of two prominent US senators - Democrat Frank Church and Republican Howard Baker. Many of those targeted were considered to be critics of US involvement in the Vietnam War.In 1967 the strength of the anti-war campaign led President Lyndon Johnson to ask US intelligence agencies to find out if some protests were being stoked by foreign governments. The NSA worked with other spy agencies to draw up the ""watch lists"" of anti-war critics, tapping their phone calls.The programme continued after Richard Nixon entered the White House in 1969. US Attorney General Elliot Richardson shut down the NSA programme in 1973, just as the Nixon administration was engulfed in the Watergate scandal.The latest revelations come as the NSA is embroiled in fresh controversy over its surveillance programmes.US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden recently exposed far-reaching electronic surveillance of phone records and internet traffic by the agency.Researchers Matthew Aid and William Burr, who published the documents on Wednesday, said the spying abuses during the Vietnam War era far surpassed any excesses of the current programme.""As shocking as the recent revelations about the NSA's domestic eavesdropping have been, there has been no evidence so far of today's signal intelligence corps taking a step like this, to monitor the White House's political enemies,"" they wrote."

The UK's security services face a Commons inquiry after it was confirmed the two men arrested over the murder were known to MI5.Communities Secretary Eric Pickles suggested the Communications Data Bill could be re-examined, once the inquiry had been completed.But he gave no indication the government was planning immediate action. He told BBC News: ""I've seen nothing in the reports so far that suggests these communications powers would have made any difference whatsoever. However, the prime minister has announced an inquiry, clearly that inquiry will look at all aspects and some time we may come back and re-look at this.  ""But it is perhaps too tempting to think there is an instant solution. This is extraordinarily primitive, almost Stone Age behaviour.""  Speaking on Newsnight on Wednesday both Lord Carlile, the Lib Dem former independent reviewer of terror laws, and Labour's Former Home Secretary John Reid urged the government to consider introducing the Data Communications Bill.Prime Minister David Cameron has previously warned that scrapping the plans would put national security at risk by making it harder to bring terror suspects and other criminals to justice.But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg blocked the change, insisting storing records of internet use for a year and allowing police and security service access to a vast ""treasure trove"" of information was neither workable nor proportionate."
5202	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23123964	News	1	Civil Rights	National Security	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the CIA, left the US in late May after leaking to the media details of extensive internet and phone surveillance by American intelligence. Mr Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia, faces espionage charges over his actions. As the scandal widens, BBC News looks at the leaks that brought US spying activities to light.The scandal broke in early June 2013 when the Guardian newspaper reported that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was collecting the telephone records of tens of millions of Americans.The paper published the secret court order directing telecommunications company Verizon to hand over all its telephone data to the NSA on an ""ongoing daily basis"". That report was followed by revelations in both the Washington Post and Guardian that the NSA tapped directly into the servers of nine internet firms, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, to track online communication in a surveillance programme known as Prism. Britain's electronic eavesdropping agency GCHQ was also accused of gathering information on the online companies via Prism.Shortly afterwards, the Guardian revealed that ex-CIA systems analyst Edward Snowden was behind the leaks about the US and UK surveillance programmes.He has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence.The GCHQ scandal widened on 21 June when the Guardian reported that the UK spy agency was tapping fibre-optic cables that carry global communications and sharing vast amounts of data with the NSA, its US counterpart. The paper revealed it had obtained documents from Edward Snowden showing that the GCHQ operation, codenamed Tempora, had been running for 18 months.GCHQ was able to boast a larger collection of data than the US, tapping into 200 fibre-optic cables to give it the ability to monitor up to 600 million communications every day, according to the report.The information from internet and phone use was allegedly stored for up to 30 days to be sifted and analysed.Although GCHQ did not break the law, the Guardian suggested that the existing legislation was being very broadly applied to allow such a large volume of data to be collected.GCHQ and NSA eavesdropping on Italian phone calls and internet traffic was reported by the Italian weekly L'Espresso on 24 October. The revelations were sourced to Edward Snowden. It is alleged that three undersea cables with terminals in Italy were targeted. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta called the allegations ""inconceivable and unacceptable"" and said he wanted to establish the truth. After fleeing to Hong Kong, Edward Snowden told the South China Morning Post that the NSA had led more than 61,000 hacking operations worldwide, including many in Hong Kong and mainland China. He said targets in Hong Kong included the Chinese University, public officials and businesses.""We hack network backbones - like huge internet routers, basically - that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one,"" Mr Snowden was quoted as saying.Claims emerged on 29 June that the NSA had also spied on European Union offices in the US and Europe, according to Germany's Der Spiegel magazine.The magazine said it had seen leaked NSA documents showing that the US had spied on EU internal computer networks in Washington and at the 27-member bloc's UN office in New York.The paper added that it had been shown the ""top secret"" files by Edward Snowden.One document dated September 2010 explicitly named the EU representation at the UN as a ""location target"", Der Spiegel wrote.The files allegedly suggested that the NSA had also conducted an electronic eavesdropping operation in a building in Brussels, where the EU Council of Ministers and the European Council were located.It is not known what information US spies might have obtained. But observers say details of European positions on trade and military matters could be useful to those involved in US-EU negotiations.The German government summoned the US ambassador on 24 October - a very unusual step - after German media reported that the NSA had eavesdropped on Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone. The allegations dominated an EU summit, with Mrs Merkel demanding a full explanation and warning that trust between allies could be undermined. She discussed the matter by phone with US President Barack Obama. He assured her that her calls were not being monitored now and that it would not happen in future. But the White House did not deny bugging her phone in the past. Past surveillance by secret police - whether Nazi or communist - has made Germans very sensitive about privacy issues. Mrs Merkel grew up in the former East Germany, where the Stasi spied on millions of citizens.France's President Francois Hollande meanwhile expressed alarm at reports that millions of French calls had been monitored by the US. The Guardian later reported that the NSA had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by another US government official. Again, Edward Snowden was the source of the report. A total of 38 embassies and missions have been the ""targets"" of US spying operations, according to a secret file leaked to the Guardian.Countries targeted included France, Italy and Greece, as well as America's non-European allies such as Japan, South Korea and India, the paper reported on 1 July.EU embassies and missions in New York and Washington were also said to be under surveillance.The file allegedly detailed ""an extraordinary range"" of spying methods used to intercept messages, including bugs, specialised antennae and wire taps.The Guardian report also mentioned codenames of alleged operations against the French and Greek missions to the UN, as well as the Italian embassy in Washington.US Secretary of State John Kerry said that activities to protect national security were ""not unusual"" in international relations.US allies in Latin America were angered by revelations in Brazil's O Globo newspaper on 10 July that the NSA  ran a continent-wide surveillance programme.The paper cited leaked documents showing that, at least until 2002, the NSA ran the operation from a base in Brasilia, seizing web traffic and details of phone calls from around the region.US agents apparently joined forces with Brazilian telecoms firms to snoop on oil and energy firms, foreign visitors to Brazil, and major players in Mexico's drug wars.Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Chile all demanded answers from the US.But the revelations on Latin America kept coming, and in September more specific claims emerged that emails and phone calls of the presidents of Mexico and Brazil had been intercepted.Also, the US had been spying on Brazil's state-owned oil firm Petrobras.Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff  cancelled a state visit to the US in the most high-profile diplomatic move since the scandal hit.Documents leaked to the Washington Post in mid-August suggested the NSA breaks US privacy laws hundreds of times every year.The papers revealed that US citizens were inadvertently snooped on for reasons including typing mistakes and errors in the system,In one instance in 2008, a ""large number"" of calls placed from Washington DC were intercepted after an error in a computer program entered ""202"" - the telephone area code for Washington DC - into a data query instead of ""20"", the country code for Egypt.Later in August, the Washington Post reported that US spy agencies had a ""black budget"" for secret operations of almost $53bn in 2013. In January 2014, the Guardian newspaper and Channel 4 News reported that the US had collected and stored almost 200 million text messages per day across the globe.A National Security Agency (NSA) program is said to have extracted and stored data from the SMS messages to gather location information, contacts and financial data.The documents also revealed that GCHQ had used the NSA database to search for information on people in the UK.The programme, Dishfire, analyses SMS messages to extract information including contacts from missed call alerts, location from roaming and travel alerts, financial information from bank alerts and payments and names from electronic business cards, according to the report.Through the vast database, which was in use at least as late as 2012, the NSA gained information on those who were not specifically targeted or under suspicion, the report says.The revelations came on the eve of an expected announcement by President Obama of a response to recommendations by a US panel on ways to change US electronic surveillance programmes."

In a statement, US President Barack Obama congratulated the panel.He said the bill was ""largely consistent with the principles of common sense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system"". Mr Obama added he was ""hopeful"" the amendment process would ""lead to further improvements"".Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not block the measure from coming to the floor for a full debate, but did not say how he planned to vote.Three Republicans joined all 10 Democrats on the committee in voting for the bill.Approval came after committee members agreed to a Republican move to ease visa restrictions on hiring skilled workers from countries such as China and India. The Democratic chairman of the committee, Patrick Leahy, also withdrew an amendment that would have allowed people to sponsor foreign same-sex partners for permanent legal status. ""I don't want to be the senator who asks people to choose between the love of their life and the love of their country,"" Sen Leahy said.The bill's supporters had asked him to remove the proposal in order to save the legislation.""I believe in my heart of hearts that what you're doing is the right and just thing,"" Democrat Senator Richard Durbin said. ""But I believe this is the wrong moment, that this is the wrong bill.""At the centre of the legislation is a provision that would allow the estimated 11 million people living in the US illegally to obtain ""registered provisional immigrant status"", six months after the bill's enactment if certain conditions are met.That status is the beginning of a 13-year process that would one day allow immigrants to be eligible to apply for a green card.The bill also includes provisions to strengthen security along the US-Mexican border, using additional agents and drones.The president of the powerful AFL-CIO union group, Rich Trumka, attacked the last-minute deal allowing an increase in the number visas for hi-tech specialists as ""anti-worker"". But he said organised labour would continue to support the larger bill.In the other chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, immigration legislation is due to receive a hearing in the judiciary committee on Wednesday.US lawmakers' last attempt at immigration reform was more recent - a bipartisan bill failed in the Senate in 2007.The latest push for reform follows Mr Obama's announcement last June that the US would allow young undocumented workers who immigrated as children to apply for two-year, renewable visas. Republicans have increasingly embraced the idea of immigration reform after a large majority of Hispanic voters supported Mr Obama in last year's election."

And those distortions still exist,"" he said.The report says that while some practices such as waterboarding have now been banned, medical professionals are still being required to force-feed detainees, including those at Guantanamo Bay. ""One [example] is the use of physicians to force-feed detainees and using very coercive restraint chairs in a way that violates the ethical standards of the World Medical Association and American medical groups,"" said Mr Rubenstein, Senior Scholar at the Center for Human Rights and Public Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Another is participation in interrogations where health professionals search for vulnerabilities which interrogators can exploit.""The report  calls on the US Senate Intelligence Committee to fully investigate medical practices at the detention sites.However, the CIA and the Pentagon rejected the report's findings.CIA public affairs chief Dean Boyd said the report ""contains serious inaccuracies and erroneous conclusions"".""It's important to underscore that the CIA does not have any detainees in its custody and President [Barack] Obama terminated the Rendition, Detention and Interrogation Program by executive order in 2009,"" he said. Pentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale said that none of the critics of prisoner care had access to the detainees, their medical records, or the procedures at Guantanamo.He described the doctors and nurses working at Guantanamo as ""consummate professionals"".Mr Breasseale said they routinely provided ""not only better medical care than any of these detainees have ever known, but care on par with the very best of the global medical profession""."

The website has not further elaborated on Mr Snowden's exact whereabouts.Both Wikileaks and Russia have denied reports that the Russian secret police have questioned the American.Mr Snowden first fled to Hong Kong before flying to Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on Sunday.He was expected to board a flight to the Venezuelan capital Caracas on Monday but his seat remained vacant. The 30-year-old IT expert has had his US passport revoked and applied for Ecuadorean asylum.Speaking during a visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Wednesday, Mr Patino compared the case to that of Mr Assange, who has been living inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London for more than a year.Mr Assange walked into the embassy when his appeal against extradition to Sweden for questioning on accusations of sex crimes was turned down last June.Mr Patino was quoted as saying that ""it took us two months to make a decision in the case of Assange, so do not expect us to make a decision sooner this time.""But on his Twitter account he later accused the media of misrepresenting what he had said.""In Kuala Lumpur I said that the decision about asylum could be taken in a day, a week, or - as in the case of Assange - could take two months,"" he wrote.""Some media cut off the first half of my statement and left only the second. They are trying to confuse, we know what they are like.""Mr Patino also said Ecuador had not yet decided whether to offer protection to Mr Snowden in the meantime.""If he goes to an embassy, then we will make a decision."" Ecuador said it would consider the American's application ""responsibly"" and would weigh ""human rights obligations"".It added that the US would have to submit its position in writing regarding Mr Snowden.Venezuela has also said it will consider an asylum application from Mr Snowden.Mr Snowden's case has caused a diplomatic spat, with the US accusing Russia and China of assisting the fugitive. Both nations have rejected the charges.Russia earlier confirmed that Mr Snowden was still in a transit zone at the Moscow airport.Although the country has no extradition treaty with the US, Washington said it wanted Moscow to extradite Mr Snowden without delay.But Russia said that the American was technically not yet under its jurisdiction because he had not passed through immigration.However, the United States is in ongoing discussions with the Russian authorities over the fate of Edward Snowden, according to White House spokesman Jay Carney.He told reporters travelling with the US President to Africa that he was ""not at liberty to get into the details of those conversations"" but that they were taking place.  Meanwhile, China described accusations that it allowed Mr Snowden to leave Hong Kong despite an arrest warrant as ""groundless and unacceptable"".The Chinese government has expressed deep concern about the leaker's allegations that the US had hacked into networks in China.Mr Snowden is wanted by the US for leaking highly sensitive information to the media about a secret government surveillance programme, which he obtained while working as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA).He is charged with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence.His leaks have led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under an NSA programme known as Prism.US officials have defended the practice of gathering telephone and internet data from private users around the world.They say Prism cannot be used to target intentionally any Americans or anyone in the US, and stress that it is supervised by judges."

As the hair-raising ride seemingly slows down, he has not lost. He may even have won. Through a series of highly unlikely gambles, he has come close to getting what he wanted. The Syrians have promised to get rid of chemical weapons, and it looks highly likely it was American threats that pushed them to a deal. But no military action has been taken.There is a serious plan in place, and the Syrians say they will comply.If they do not, the Russians say they will back a UN Security Council resolution that could allow the use of force.Everyone, except the rebels, is claiming a measure of victory.But getting here was not glorious and that in itself will have consequences. One price, according to The Observer's Peter Beaumont, is President Putin's re-invention of Russian relevance. That leaves some - such as The Daily Telegraph's Janet Daley - spluttering, but it is a logical outcome of Obama's approach. The outcome also shines a light on something more profoundly important than one conflict in one region of the world. It is clear that Mr Obama wants America to reduce its footprint in the world - no boots on the ground, or on the neck of regimes disobedient to American will. It is clear he wants to work, when he can, through the international system.He acknowledges the importance of the rise of the rest - particularly China. Logic dictates all of this means the US will be one voice among many. Perhaps the loudest, perhaps the most vocal, but not the sole voice. Importantly, it will not be a harmonious chorus - different voices will say different things, some extremely uncomfortable for the West. That is disturbing to those think it is imperative that the world follows America's lead. But it could reinvigorate the United Nations.For now, the deal looks like a minor miracle, won against all the odds. It is no wonder the president found time for a round of golf at the weekend, on one of those Washington days so cool it heralds autumn, even though it is actually hotter than many British summers. He could afford to relax, just a little. Just before he headed to the course, he had spoken to John Kerry to congratulate him on the deal with the Russians.The last few weeks have in many ways seemed the worst of Obama's presidency - but he has managed to pull off the considerable feat of appearing weak and incapable of making decisions, while at the same time being found guilty of making bold and questionable ones.  He has seemed almost torn apart by conflicting instincts. On the one hand, he obviously wanted to avoid high-profile military action in the Middle East. But on the other, he could not allow his threats about red lines and chemical weapons to prove hollow. In a piece for the Today programme on Saturday, I wrote that the last 10 days had seriously damaged the president. I also said that in a year's time he may look like the smartest man in the room. Perhaps that moment has come a little sooner.True, there are lots of potential pitfalls ahead. The Syrians could give the world the run-around.Defining non-compliance could be hard. Getting a UN resolution to condemn it could be harder. Congress could still be a problem if Obama did want to take action.If that happened, Obama could slither down the snake back to square one, without the prospect of a Russian ladder to help him back up. Even if it all goes smoothly, not everyone will be happy. Not the opposition who were hoping for a hammer blow against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Not hawks in Washington who wanted the same and do not trust the deal. And not those who think the whole episode highlights a muddle-headed Middle East policy.The president got here by delay, not by design. I suppose the history books may show there was a cunning plan all along, but I doubt it. It reminds me of the old story, variously described as Persian, Russian, or Middle Eastern, about the man sentenced to death by a tyrannical monarch. He tells the king that if he calls off the execution, he will teach the monarch's horse to sing. Just give him a year. The king grants his plea. Fellow prisoners are astounded - how on earth does he think he can teach the horse to sing? He replies he has bought himself a year - ""the king may die, I may die, the horse might die - the horse might actually learn to sing"". It seems as if Obama's horse is at least making strangled noises that might save it from history's chopping block. "

Mr Kerry, in his remarks to a conference organised by the Open Government Partnership, said that while some surveillance may have been excessive, claims that up to 70 million were being monitored were an ""exaggeration"".Claims about the extent of US surveillance of targets such as European leaders have strained Washington's diplomatic relations with some of its key allies.Last week it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone had been tapped for up to 10 years. More recently there have been claims that the NSA hacked links connecting data centres operated by Google and Yahoo.According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Australia embassies in Asia had been used to spy on Asian countries such as China, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.""If confirmed, such action is not only a breach of security, but also a serious breach of diplomatic norms and ethics,"" Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said.The report describes a signals intelligence programme called Stateroom which involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic using equipment in US, British, Australian and Canadian diplomatic missions. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade declined to comment on the latest reports. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: ""Every Australian governmental agency, every Australian official... operates in accordance with the law.""The claims are the latest to emerge from documents leaked by ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia and is wanted in the US in connection with the unauthorised disclosures.In Germany, a member of parliament has said Mr Snowden is willing to travel to Berlin to help investigate allegations about the tapping of Mrs Merkel's phone.Hans-Christian Stroebele, who represents the opposition Green party, said there would need to be safeguards against Mr Snowden, who he recently visited in Moscow, being deported to the United States. The BBC's Steve Evans, in Berlin, said Germany's Christian-Democrat-led government may be unwilling to invite Mr Snowden to the country, particularly as his presence would raise issues over extradition agreements with the United States.In the wake of the claims about surveillance of online data centres, six major technology companies have called for the US government to do more to control the NSA's activities.The six called for ""appropriate oversight and accountability"" in a letter sent to a US Senate committee sponsoring a bill designed to rein in the NSA.AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo signed the letter to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, saying the greater control would help to rebuild trust in government surveillance programs."

I will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.""Mr Obama also said he would reduce by more than half the number of US troops in Afghanistan over the next year. He asked Congress to raise the minimum wage $7.25 to $9 an hour, called for legislation to ensure women are paid equally to men and announced a commission to improve the voting process.On gun control, Mr Obama said an ""overwhelming"" majority of Americans supported ""common-sense reform"" on firearms, including tighter background checks and restrictions on ""weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines"".And he urged gun-control opponents to allow a vote in Congress on his proposals.""The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence - they deserve a simple vote,"" he said.He also praised bipartisan efforts to draw up an immigration reform bill, adding that if he is sent legislation, ""I will sign it right away"".House Speaker John Boehner told US media on Wednesday said that immigration was the only issue on Mr Obama's state of the union list that had any chance in Congress this year.He added he believed the president was more interested in getting a Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress in the 2014 mid-term elections.Less than a day after North Korea tested a nuclear device, Mr Obama said the US will ""lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats"".Mr Obama will take to the road in the coming days to push his economic recovery proposals, stopping in the US states of North Carolina and Georgia and in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois.But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, was not impressed by what he called ""pedestrian liberal boilerplate"".""An opportunity to bring together the country instead became another retread of lip service and liberalism,'' he said on Wednesday.Sen Rubio, a possible 2016 Republican presidential candidate, delivered his party's official riposte.In it, he attacked Mr Obama's economic policies and said ""more government isn't going to help you get ahead, it's going to hold you back"".The Cuban-American senator, who also made his address in Spanish, referred to the pain felt by residents of the working-class neighbourhood in which he grew up.He told Mr Obama: ""I don't oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich. I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbours.""The Florida senator also warned the president that the ""tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle-class families"".Underscoring conservative divisions, immediately after the Rubio speech Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul delivered the Tea Party's rebuttal to Mr Obama's address.He said both parties had failed voters by driving up trillion-dollar deficits."

He is already going to clash with lawmakers over the debt ceiling and spending. He has signalled he won't dodge a confrontation over guns and immigration. Now, his choice of two new cabinet members will mean a couple of fractious confirmation hearings.   The man he wants as defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, faces a real risk of being given the thumbs down and will certainly get a rough ride. A decorated Vietnam veteran, he has an aversion to war and a view of Israel that falls short of what many Republicans demand. Not that Mr Obama's pick for CIA director, John Brennan, will be uncontroversial. He has been the president's main man on national security since 2008 and is a CIA veteran of 25 years so no-one doubts he knows his way around. But liberals say he was too close to George W Bush's administration - particularly the faulty intelligence that led to the Iraq war and the torture of terrorist suspects. But any trouble he has will be minor compared to Mr Hagel.The former Republican senator is a renegade to many in his own party. He broke with them over the Iraq war. He has been accused of anti-Semitism for saying that: ""the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here, [Congress]. I'm a United States senator. I'm not an Israeli senator."" He has been reluctant about sanctions on Iran and labelling Hamas a terrorist group. Opponents say he is ""anti-Israel"". Supporters say he has not anti-Israel, he just does not slavishly back the current right-wing government's policies. If that wasn't enough, he is in trouble from the other side for anti-gay comments, for which he has apologised. Perhaps more significant than all of this, he would be a very reluctant war leader, on record as saying, in 2006, that taking military action against Iran ""is not a viable, feasible, responsible option"".In 2002, talking about Iraq, he said: ""Many of those who want to rush the country into war and think it would be so quick and easy don't know anything about war. They come at it from an intellectual perspective versus having sat in jungles or foxholes and watched their friends get their heads blown off. I try to speak for those ghosts of the past a little bit"". There is a lot for antagonistic senators to chew on, in an atmosphere where some are determined to block the president whenever they can.

The US needs to agree a new spending bill before the financial year ends at midnight on Monday. But political divisions have resulted in a stalemate.There are worries over the economic impact of a failure to do so, which may see non-essential federal services shut and staff placed on unpaid leave. Stock indexes in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea all declined.Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.5%, Australia's ASX dropped 1.7%, while South Korea's Kospi shed 0.7%""It is the fear of the unknown,"" said David Kuo of financial website the Motley Fool. ""No one knows what is really going to happen and markets don't like uncertainty.""""There is likely to be some reduction in US government spending, but we don't know what areas are going to be affected.""Until that is resolved, we are likely to see volatility in the markets,"" he added.One of the key areas of debate between the Democrats and the Republicans has been President Barack Obama's healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare.Early on Sunday, the Republican-run House of Representatives passed an amended version of the Senate spending bill that removed funding from the healthcare law, raising the chances of a shutdown. US Senate Majority leader Harry Reid has vowed that his Democrat-led chamber will reject the Republican bill.""Tomorrow, the Senate will do exactly what we said we would do and reject these measures,"" said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""At that point, Republicans will be faced with the same choice they have always faced: put the Senate's clean funding bill on the floor and let it pass with bipartisan votes, or force a Republican government shutdown.""Speaking for the president, White House spokesman Jay Carney said: ""Any member of the Republican Party who votes for this bill is voting for a shutdown."" The president, he said, would also veto the Republican bill.If the government does shut down on 1 October, as many as a third of its 2.1 million employees are expected to stop work - with no guarantee of back pay once the deadlock is resolved. National parks and Washington's Smithsonian museums would close, pension and veterans' benefit cheques would be delayed, and visa and passport applications would be stymied.Programmes deemed essential, such as air traffic control and food inspections, would continue.The defence department has advised employees that uniformed members of the military will continue on ""normal duty status"", but ""large numbers"" of civilian workers will be told to stay home.The looming shutdown, which would be the first for 17 years, is not the only crisis the US government is facing. The US government and Republicans are also at loggerheads over extending the government's borrowing limit. The US Treasury Secretary has warned that the US will hit its debt ceiling by 17 October, leaving the government with half the money needed to pay its bills.Earlier this month Jack Lew said that unless the US is allowed to extend its borrowing limit, the country will be left with about $30bn to meet its commitments, which on certain days can be as high as $60bn.A failure to raise the limit could also result in the US government defaulting on its debt payments. President Obama has warned that ""failure to meet this responsibility would be far more dangerous than a government shutdown"".Washington faced a similar impasse over its debt ceiling in 2011. Republicans and the Democrats only reached a compromise on the day the government's ability to borrow money was due to run out.That fight was resolved just hours before the country could have defaulted on its debt, but nevertheless led to ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgrading the US for the first time ever.The 2011 compromise included a series of automatic budget cuts known as the ""sequester"" which came into effect earlier this year.

""With John's 25 years of experience at the Agency, our extraordinary men and women of the CIA will be led by one of their own.""Mr Brennan was President Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser and he had long appeared to hold enough votes to win confirmation.But a final vote was held up by both Sen Paul's marathon speech, known as a filibuster, and by requests from an intelligence panel to see White House documents laying out the legal basis for drone strikes on US citizens in anti-militant strikes overseas.Mr Brennan was confirmed on Thursday by a 63-34 vote.Sen Paul - a critic of the use of drones - had demanded a pledge from either President Obama or Mr Holder that drones would not be used in the US to kill US citizens.As Mr Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser, Mr Brennan helped oversee the drone programme.Sen Paul began the Senate floor filibuster about noon on Wednesday, a day after Mr Brennan's nomination was approved by the Senate intelligence committee. Also on Wednesday, Mr Holder testified in front of a separate committee and was pressed on the drone programme.Sen Paul said Mr Holder's responses in that hearing had come close to assuring him the government would not attack Americans with drones in the US, but he said he was ""alarmed"" by the difficulty of getting the White House to define clearly what qualified as a legitimate target.On Thursday, Mr Holder sent a 43-word statement to Sen Paul: ""It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the president have the authority to use a weaponised drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?'""The answer to that question is no.""Sen Paul claimed victory and the Senate proceeded to a vote.Mr Brennan's nomination was the latest in a series of tough confirmation battles as Mr Obama rounds out his second term-leadership team.But Mr Brennan largely avoided a personally bruising nomination process like that experienced by Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel.Mr Hagel was confirmed in a 58-41 Senate vote after Republicans stalled his nomination for more than a week, questioning his past positions on Israel and Iran and his qualification for the job."

Recently relations between the two countries seem to have improved and Saturday's meeting between the two men appears to have been brief but cordial, the BBC's Karen Allen reports from Kabul.There has been a fresh impetus to revive Afghanistan's peace process before Nato troops withdraw next year.The Taliban have refused direct contact with President Karzai or with the Afghan High Peace Council, dismissing them as puppets of Washington.The High Peace Council wants to open negotiations with Taliban insurgents, who have fought US-led Nato and Afghan forces since 2001.President Karzai was also angered when the Taliban opened an office in Qatar in June, dealing another blow to reconciliation hopes.Mr Karzai visited Islamabad in August for talks with the Pakistani prime minister but Saturday's one-day visit is Mr Sharif's first to Kabul since he took office in May.The two leaders also met British Prime Minister David Cameron in London last month for the fourth of a series of trilateral meetings designed to foster regional stability.One of President Karzai's main demands has been the release of high-profile Taliban prisoners held in Pakistan in the hope that this will help jump-start direct talks with insurgents.Meanwhile, Washington and Kabul are still finalising a deal allowing US troops to remain in Afghanistan after 2014.Mr Karzai has so far refused an early signature of the pact, seeking further assurances from the US.

Some say that Russia's decision to grant temporary asylum to the fugitive US intelligence analyst Edward Snowden is the reason for the crisis in bilateral relations. Others, however, point to stalled negotiations on nuclear arms reduction and the lack of progress on other important issues for the past several years. According to one commentator, problems between Washington and Moscow have now become ''strategic and long-term'', while another writes that the US has ''struck Russia off its priority list''.  The cooling of Russian-US relations will set back the solution of important issues until a new ''window of opportunity'' opens, which will not happen for at least one or two years.In any complex and unstable system there are special phases known as ''bifurcation points''. When they pass through them, systems can no longer return to their previous state. The ''Snowden case'', or rather the decision by the Kremlin to grant the ''fugitive from the Matrix'' temporary one-year asylum, became such a ""bifurcation point"" for Russian-US relations.After President Obama publicly said that the issue of Snowden's extradition was extremely important and fundamental, it became impossible to reduce the scale of this problem between Russia and the USA. Figuratively speaking, the head of the White House has climbed up a high fence from which he can no longer jump down. This is an asymmetrical reaction on the part of Obama that casts doubt on the ''reset'' (of US-Russian relations). Apparently, hawks in the Congress have yet again put pressure on the president… So, are we in for another cooling period? The meeting of US and Russian foreign and defence ministers, that will take place at the end of this week, will show whether this is the case.The White House decision was prompted not only by ''the Snowden case'', but also by Washington's understanding that it would be impossible to reach a breakthrough on issues considered to be important by the US president - the reduction of nuclear arsenals, and missile defence. According to experts, this is not only an indication of a new cooling of relations between the two countries, but also shows that guiding lines in US foreign policy have changed. The country has in fact struck Russia off its priority list. The meeting (with Russian President Vladimir Putin) would have been meaningless anyway, as no progress has been achieved on any issue (in bilateral relations). Moreover, Obama coming to Moscow would make him appear weak in the eyes of opposition Republicans who have heavily criticised him over Snowden.Even in 2008, during the war with Georgia, there were problems in (US-Russian) relations. Now these problems have become strategic and of a long-term character. Small conflicts should not prevent political decisions from being taken and the US president understands this very well… Both sides are interested in holding a separate meeting of their presidents and the situation with Snowden is not an obstacle but yet another topic for discussion.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Afghan officials dispute Taliban claims he was acting for them. The male soldier's next of kin have been informed of Monday's attack. Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman described it as a ""tragic incident"", adding: ""The PM's thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the soldier who was killed.""The spokesman said the military had stepped up counter-intelligence efforts and the vetting and screening of new Afghan National Army recruits. The attack comes as President Hamid Karzai is due in the US for a visit seen as key to the future of the American presence in Afghanistan.Spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Major Laurence Roche, said: ""This is an extremely sad day for the Corps of Royal Engineers and everyone serving with Task Force Helmand. Our thoughts are with the soldier's family and friends at this time.""The BBC's Quentin Sommerville said the attack is thought to have been triggered by an argument between Afghan National Army soldiers.Shortly after details of the incident emerged, the Taliban said they were behind the shooting, but they often wrongly claim such attacks, he said.Afghan defence officials told the BBC that initial assessment suggested the gunman was a soldier from the eastern province of Laghman.An official said: ""Currently there is an investigation into the attack. Initial assessment and information shows the attacker was not linked to the Taliban.""After he killed the British soldier, he tried to escape but members of the Afghan national security forces opened fire, killing him.''There has been a sharp rise in so-called insider attacks against local forces and Nato troops in Afghanistan. In 2012, more than 60 Nato service personnel, and a quarter of the British troops who died in Helmand, were killed in such attacks.All six of the British troops killed during the latest six-month tour of duty have died this way. A total of 439 UK service members have lost their lives in Afghanistan since operations began there in October 2001.President Karzai is arriving in the US for a three-day visit, which will include a meeting with President Barack Obama on Friday.It will be their first face-to-face talks since the US presidential elections. Correspondents say relations between the two countries have been more fractious than usual in recent months.Mr Karzai wants US troops out of Afghan towns and villages. Some 30,000 foreign soldiers left Afghanistan last year, and most of the remainder are expected to pull out by the end of 2014.Our correspondent says the US president is likely to discuss the size of the force that remains, and whether they are there to fight the Taliban or shift their primary focus to tackling al-Qaeda.Mr Karzai's visit comes days after a drone attack that killed Pakistan militant leader Mullah Nazir, who was accused of sending fighters to Afghanistan to support the Taliban.Ahead of the trip, the White House issued a statement saying Mr Obama ""looks forward to... discussing our continued transition in Afghanistan, and our shared vision of an enduring partnership"" between the two countries.Mr Karzai is expected to provide a request for future requirements for the Afghan military such as heavy weaponry, an improved air force and medical support.Our correspondent says the US spent almost $120bn (£74bn; 91bn euros) in Afghanistan in 2011, a figure that diplomats in Kabul say will be increasingly difficult to justify because of economic problems at home and extensive corruption within Afghanistan.Meanwhile Mr Karzai has held back from signing a long-term binding security agreement with the US, amid fears that Afghan sovereignty is being undermined.He is unwilling to grant US soldiers immunity from prosecution and is unhappy that Afghans are still being held in US-run military prisons on Afghan soil, our correspondent adds.Nato forces are committed to training Afghan security forces before foreign combat troops pull out."

Although the campaign does not officially start until March, there has already been much speculation about who will be competing in the race to succeed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.After a year dominated by infighting between supporters and opponents of Mr Ahmadinejad, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has warned politicians not to engage in early electioneering. Despite this, names are beginning to emerge, and parties and factions have quietly started lobbying for their preferred candidate.Intriguingly, many of the potential contenders so far have one thing in common - they have been involved in the international negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme. Hassan Rohani, who was the country's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005, is the latest politician to tacitly acknowledge that he is intending to stand.He hit the headlines last year when he published an outspoken memoir about his time as nuclear negotiator, which detailed clashes with President Ahmadinejad and eventually forced Mr Rohani to resign.Claiming to appeal to both conservative and reform-minded voters, Mr Rohani told reporters in early January that it was time for a ""new tone"" in Iranian nuclear policy and that President Ahmadinejad had been too ""confrontational"". Ali Larijani, the current speaker of parliament, is another possible candidate with a nuclear past.In 2005, he succeeded Mr Rohani as Iran's nuclear negotiator, but his moderate and pragmatic stand also put him at odds with the president and he resigned after two years. Now the conservative faction in the Iranian parliament - which controls almost two-thirds of the seats - has given him its backing. Another name in the hat is Saeed Jalili, Iran's current chief nuclear envoy. A tough negotiator who lost a leg during the Iran-Iraq war, Mr Jalili is keeping silent about his intentions. But there has already been a high-profile and well-organised campaign running in the Iranian blogosphere to support his candidacy, and some members of the influential conservative Islamic Stability Front have gone public to back him.And lastly there is Ali Akbar Salehi, the current foreign minister and former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI).Mr Salehi has so far declined to confirm whether he will be standing for the presidency, but his elusive answers when questioned at news conferences have fuelled speculation that his name will also be in the running. So why is there such a buzz around these ""nuclear candidates""?Clearly one issue is their relationship with the man who has the final say on Iran's nuclear policy, Ayatollah Khamenei. Observers say that being a member of the nuclear policy-makers' club is seen as a badge of honour in Iranian politics because the supreme leader only lets the most trusted people into this inner circle.For all of the names currently in the running, involvement in the nuclear talks has resulted in a high-speed train ride to the very top of Iranian politics. For Mr Salehi, a stint as Iran's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was a fast-track to being appointed foreign minister in 2011.Mr Larijani went from head of the state broadcaster, Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran (VVIRI), to speaker of parliament after his two years as nuclear negotiator. But while they may have Ayatollah Khamenei to thank for their current high-profile roles, it is not clear how popular any of these men really are with ordinary voters. Mr Larijani, who has the most solid profile among them all, tried his luck in the presidential election in 2005, but only won 4% of the vote.Iran watchers say that the emergence of the ""nuclear candidates"" also indicates just how crucial the nuclear issue has now become at all levels of Iranian political life.   For the conservative politicians who came to power after the last presidential election in 2009, the ongoing confrontation with the West over Iran's nuclear ambitions is becoming so serious they fear it could threaten the very existence of the Islamic Republic. For the Revolutionary Guards and the business world, while sanctions may have offered the chance to monopolise the economy in the short term, there is a growing awareness that as the economy shrinks, so will their share of the profits.Earlier this month, one MP confirmed what many had suspected when he announced that Iran's oil sales had fallen 40% and its income has dropped 45% over the last nine months.But most important of all is the stance of the supreme leader. US President Barack Obama has warned that the window of diplomacy is ""shrinking"" and Ayatollah Khamenei knows that if he does not negotiate him, there is no guarantee the next interlocutor will be someone with the same degree of patience and persistence.  Ayatollah Khamenei has made no secret of his growing impatience with the tensions between President Ahmadinejad and other officials over the nuclear issue.  It is clear he would welcome a new president who could try to build consensus on the issue and get everyone working in the same direction. Given the complexities of Iranian politics, observers caution that even if one of the ""nuclear candidates"" is elected president, there are unlikely to be big changes in the short term.But it would send an important message to people inside Iran and in the West that solving the nuclear issue is now a top priority for the supreme leader and that Iran is keen to solve the deadlock while there is still time."

A transfer ceremony took place at Bagram jail, now renamed the Afghan National Detention Facility at Parwan. The handover came as US Secretary of State John Kerry made an unannounced visit for talks with President Karzai.Mr Kerry told a press conference they were both ""on the same page"" regarding peace talks with the Taliban.President Hamid Karzai recently angered Washington by accusing the US and the Taliban of colluding to prolong the conflict.But Mr Kerry told reporters: ""I am confident (Mr Karzai) does not believe the US has any interest except to see the Taliban come to the table to make peace.''""So we're on the same page. I don't think there is any disagreement between us.''Referring to the handover of Bagram prison, Mr Karzai said: ""Today was a very good day.''The handover had been delayed while the two sides finalised a deal over the fate of prisoners considered dangerous.Bagram has a chequered reputation, having been at the centre of a number of prisoner abuse allegations.It was once located in Bagram air base, one of the largest military bases for Nato-led forces in Afghanistan, about 40km (25 miles) north of the capital, Kabul. The new Parwan facility was constructed a few miles away and populated with inmates in 2010.""The transfer of the detention facility is an important part of the overall transition of security lead to Afghan National Security Forces. This ceremony highlights an increasingly confident, capable and sovereign Afghanistan,"" said Gen Dunford, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan.Last March the US agreed to hand over responsibility for the majority of the detainees, thought to number more than 3,000, and actually held a transfer ceremony last September. But the full transfer was held up over a disagreement about the fate of inmates whom the US feared could be released if the prison was handed over. A senior official at the facility told reporters: "" Since March 2012, the Americans have handed over to us 4,000 prisoners. We have freed 1,350 of them. The Americans have given us 26 more prisoners today, and they still have more prisoners which they will hand over to us soon.''According to the latest deal Afghanistan will not release ""dangerous"" inmates without review, and about 50 foreign inmates will remain in US hands. If the US captures fighters, they must be turned over to the Afghan authorities within 96 hours. Earlier this month a ceremony transferring the final prisoners to Afghan custody was called off at the last minute because President Karzai reportedly rejected part of the deal.The Pentagon said over the weekend that an agreement had been reached.  The prison been described as ""Afghanistan's Guantanamo"".In January 2012, Afghan investigators accused the US Army of abusing detainees at Bagram. The investigators said prisoners had reported being tortured, held without evidence and subjected to humiliating body searches.Nato and the US have rejected allegations of abuse as untrue and pointed to the fact that they have given the Afghan Human Rights commission access to check them independently.In February 2012, US soldiers unwittingly burned Korans confiscated from prisoners at Bagram, leading to days of protests and targeted killings across Afghanistan. A US investigation said there was no malicious intent to insult Islam.But the future of the US-run prison had become a thorn in the side of US-Afghan relations ahead of the planned withdrawal of these forces in 2014.Many Nato forces have already begun withdrawing troops from Afghanistan ahead of the complete transfer of power to Afghan security forces.

President Barack Obama has called for military action to be taken against Syria and says he will seek congressional authorisation for intervention.Here, American readers react to Mr Obama's announcement and discuss their views on a potential US-led missile strike on Syria.The US should have done something about the Syrian crisis much sooner than now.The world reacts by talking, while the people of Syria react by crying and burying their family members.I think whatever party or religion you belong to, I don't feel comfortable watching people getting massacred and not doing anything about it.By leaving the decision to Congress, and if it goes against Obama, then he can blame Congress for not going in to Syria. It's the most cowardly move I have ever seen in my life.A lot of countries depend on the US for leadership and for the stand we take on issues. But if we don't do something, no one else will.I do not agree with the president that he ought to take punitive action against Syria.His action to seek authorisation from Congress is a sham. He knows well that punishing Assad is not going to stop the conflict, nor is it going to stop any future chemical weapon attacks.Also, the USA cannot afford to spend money in this manner when our economy is not very sound at this time. Historically, our past military interventions in the Middle East have been extremely costly.Sadly, they have not achieved any good political results either.I expect Congress to veto any US punitive action in Syria.The best solution to stemming the inhumane actions in Syria is for Arab states to discuss the present situation and then advise the UN to take military and/or economic sanctions against that country's leader. Grudgingly, I agree with a brief, muscular action in Syria. But I am quite sure that there will be some reaction and serious consequences from some Arab states.President Obama has no escape route. He placed himself in a corner with the words ""crossing the red line"" [over the use of chemical weapons]. He has already made his mind up and is just going to Congress to pacify the ""doves"", justify the intervention and make it legal.Of course, he is going to get the approval of Congress. When in distress, right or wrong, we Americans agree with our leaders. Look at World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia and 9/11.Syria is the most difficult situation ever encountered by the US and its allies. It is a case of ""damned if you do and damned if you don't"".While an attack on a military installation in Syria might seem like a simple response to a terrible action, I think the United States is already over-involved in expensive Middle East disputes that it cannot easily extricate itself from. We should not add one more that we know in advance will have no practical impact and risks escalation of our involvement in the area.  Instead, I would like to see us embarrass and ""punish"" China and Russia for supporting al-Assad after his regime's brutality on his own people.  Further, I would like to encourage the countries in the Middle East to step up to the plate and clean up their neighbours' mess.It is easy to make the case on moral grounds.  It is far more difficult to find an intervention that will make things better rather than worse.  We all know what happens when we jump in with good intentions.Blowing up Syrian installations that would reduce the pain and suffering in Syria is hard for me to imagine.A delay is good at this point - give the Russians time to deal with the evidence for sarin gas. It's possible that if the UN comes forward with a clear report on the use of sarin gas then the Russians may moderate their stance.The best development at this point would be for Russians to reduce support for Assad, and join the effort to find way to begin to wind the violence down.  If a little time could pass maybe the Russians will come around.I am vehemently opposed to Obama's military threat against Syria with or without the approval of the UN Security Council, Nato, international allies, and/or the US Congress.  Overall, US military force cannot solve the problem of the mass murder of innocents with chemical or other weapons.We do not kill people to save people from being killed. Another debauched USA war against an Arab nation can lead only to chaos. A diplomatic, political solution is the way forward towards peace. The US must lead a multilateral and meaningful peace process that engages leaders of all nations involved directly or indirectly in the Syrian conflict.   "

The move came after a group of Republican senators complained that Mr Obama's pick to lead the defence department had not been sufficiently forthcoming about his finances, specifically whether he had ever received compensation from ""foreign sources""."

Mr Karzai's spokesman has told the BBC the Afghan leader now ""wants to get wheels moving again"". It is not clear if security talks with the US, which he had suspended in protest over the office, will resume.Mr Karzai said the opening of the building contradicted earlier US security guarantees to his government.'Contradictory' The Taliban premises in Qatar opened on Tuesday, on the same day that Nato handed over security for the whole of Afghanistan to the Afghan government for the first time since the Taliban were ousted in 2001.Mr Karzai said in a statement on Wednesday that the office was ""totally contradictory to the guarantees that were made by the USA to Afghanistan"".His officials said he objected to a Taliban flag flying from the building, and also the name given to the building - the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.He said Afghan negotiators would stay away from the Qatar talks until ""foreign powers"" allowed the process to be run by Afghans - and also stay away from the latest round of security talks with the US on the American presence in Afghanistan after Nato leaves in 2014.But Mr Karzai's spokesman now says Mr Kerry has informed the Afghans that the Taliban office is removing the flag, and that the sign designating the building as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will be replaced by one saying Bureau of Peace Talks.The official added that President Karzai told Mr Kerry that once he saw Afghan and international networks showing evidence that these changes had been made, he would ""be ready to keep the wheels rolling"" on the process. A meeting will be held in Kabul on Thursday to discuss the next steps. US-Taliban talksThe first formal meeting between US and Taliban representatives is expected to take place soon in Doha.The US met the Taliban secretly in 2011 in Qatar, but these would be the first open talks between them.The White House has demanded  - and the Taliban accepted - two preconditions for the talks: that the Taliban make a statement supporting a peace process, and that it oppose the use of Afghan soil to threaten other countries. The BBC's Jonathan Beale, in Kabul, says the Afghan government clearly thinks that US preconditions for talks with the Taliban should have included a commitment to talk to the Afghan government and to acknowledge the country's constitution.However, in an interview with the BBC Pashto service, a Taliban spokesman in the Qatar office, Mohammad Naim, said the constitution ""was made during the occupation"" and that ""most Afghans do not accept this constitution"".

Moments later, the line was cut.Later that night Mr Hicks heard from the Libyan prime minister, who informed him the ambassador was dead.During the night, Mr Hicks said he received calls from Libyans using the ambassador's phone. They said they had the envoy with them.But Mr Hicks did not act on the calls, fearing an ambush.Mr Hicks also expressed frustration with the lack of a US military response during the night-time attack, saying a second assault could have been deterred.The Pentagon has said nothing could have been done to assist the Americans in Benghazi.Meanwhile, UN Ambassador Susan Rice has been heavily criticised for inaccurate comments about the attack in the days immediately afterwards.She said on a Sunday chat show on 16 September that the attack had grown out of an anti-US protest, while other officials have said they knew at the time it was an organised, armed assault, possibly by an Islamist militant group.""My jaw dropped and I was embarrassed,"" Mr Hicks said on his reaction to her interview.Ambassador Stevens died of smoke inhalation when he was trapped in the burning consulate building, after armed men stormed the compound. State department employee Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty also died in the attack.Some Republicans accuse the White House of hiding information about the attack, while Democrats say the issue has become politicised."
5603	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24649840	News	1	International News	National Security	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Secret US documents reveal that senior Pakistani government officials have for years known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes, an American newspaper reports.The Washington Post said it had obtained CIA documents and Pakistani diplomatic memos which indicated officials were routinely given classified briefings.Pakistan has responded by repeating its opposition to drone strikes.Analysts have long suspected Pakistan gave tacit consent for such strikes.Pakistan's PM Nawaz Sharif has publicly urged US President Obama to halt such attacks.""I also brought up the issue of drones in our meeting, emphasising the need for an end to such strikes,"" Mr Sharif said after the two met on Wednesday. The attacks by unmanned US aircraft have been a critical source of tension in the relationship between the countries and came up amid wide-ranging talks between the leaders in Washington.They are also deeply unpopular with the Pakistani public, and Pakistan has consistently stated that they violate its sovereignty.  The Pakistani government has responded to the report by repeating its opposition to US drone strikes""Whatever understandings there may or may not have been in the past, the present government has been very clear regarding its policy on the issue,""  the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement.""We regard such strikes as violation of our sovereignty as well as international law,"" it said, adding that they were also counterproductive.The documents obtained by the newspaper focus on at least 65 drone strikes in Pakistan over the last few years and were labelled as ""talking points"" for regular CIA briefings. Although they are marked ""top secret"" they are cleared for release to Pakistan, the paper reports. The Washington Post says the documents provide a detailed timeline of the CIA drone programme ""tracing its evolution from a campaign aimed at a relatively short list of senior al-Qaeda operatives into a broader aerial assault against militant groups with no connection to the 11 September 2001 attacks"".A spokesman for the Pakistani embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper and the CIA also declined to comment.  Correspondents say the files expose the explicit nature of the arrangement between the countries in the period when neither acknowledged that any drone programme even existed.In 2010 the controversial whistleblowing site Wikileaks released numerous documents relating to Pakistan which showed the Pakistani military and other arms of the government had ""quietly acquiesced"" with drone strikes even though they had publicly condemned them. In August 2008 then Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is reported to have said: ""I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people. We'll protest in the National Assembly and then ignore it.""But this latest cache includes documents which appear to refer to a direct Pakistani role in the selection of targets, with the newspaper referring to one 2010 entry describing  hitting a location ""at the request of your government"". There is also a reference to a ""network of locations associated with a joint CIA-ISI targeting effort"".The number of civilian casualties in drone strikes has long been a source of dispute.Local claims of civilian deaths are almost impossible to prove.  One reason is the restricted media access in the region. The other is the militants' tendency to cordon off the targeted sites and conduct quick burials.Earlier this week, Amnesty International released a report which said that CIA drone attacks in Pakistan were responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes. The rights group named several victims who, it says, ""posed no threat to life"".Amnesty said it reviewed nine of 45 recent drone strikes in the volatile tribal region of North Waziristan where many strikes have hit, and found a number of victims had been unarmed.The US has defended its drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere. On Tuesday the White House said it took ""extraordinary care"" to ensure they complied with international law and that they were a ""course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life"". A recent UN report also found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. Estimates by other groups such as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism calculate that between 407 and 926 civilians have been killed in Pakistan. The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says that the general impression one gets from talking to elders and correspondents from the tribal area is that drone strikes are for the most part accurate, causing fewer civilian casualties than some reports suggest.  Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived more than two years ago when US special forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in north-west Pakistan, without giving the Pakistani government advance warning.But in their meeting on Wednesday,  Mr Sharif said the US and Pakistan ""have travelled together as friends and allies in defence of freedom and the pursuit of international peace and security"".

Mr Morsi is due to go on trial on Monday.Mr Kerry will go on to tour countries in the Middle East and North Africa.John Kerry's visit to Cairo was kept under wraps by US officials until he landed - although Egyptian state media did announce his arrival - the first time a US secretary of State has travelled to Egypt on what is known as an unannounced visit for security reasons.The BBC's Kim Ghattas, travelling with Mr Kerry, says it is the kind of precaution that characterises trips by US officials to countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. This is a sign of US concerns about continued instability in the country, but it is also a reaction to the high level of anti-American resentment in Egypt, our correspondent says.Although Washington has not declared the military takeover that deposed the Islamist Mr Morsi a coup, it has de facto suspended military aid to Egypt in compliance with US law.This has angered supporters of the army, while supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood also feel bitter and accuse the US of letting them down.Mr Kerry's visit comes a day before the trial of Mr Morsi who is accused of inciting the killing of protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012.But the State Department said the timing of Mr Kerry's visit was not connected to the trial, our correspondent adds.Mr Kerry was meeting the interim leaders that assumed control following July's ouster - President Adly Mahmud Mansour, Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi, Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy and army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.He is also reported to be meeting, behind closed doors, members of Egyptian civil society alarmed by a crackdown in which hundreds of people have died.Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan and Morocco are among the countries on the next stages of Mr Kerry's itinerary, which spans 3 to 12 November.After his Egyptian visit, Secretary Kerry will go on to the Saudi capital, Riyadh.The Saudi government has recently expressed its disappointment with what it sees as America's hesitant approach in Syria and a lack of support for the new Egyptian government.Mr Kerry is expected to discuss defence and trade issues with officials, with Syria likely to be high on the agenda across the region.The secretary of state will also meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders to discuss the peace process in Jerusalem and Bethlehem.He will then travel to Algeria and Morocco towards the end of the nine-day trip to chair strategic dialogue meetings.Mr Kerry may also have to face difficult questions over allegations of widespread US spying.In the wake of revelations sparked by leaks from ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, Mr Kerry said last week that spying by the US National Security Agency may have gone too far.

The drones are made by an Italian firm, Selex ES, a subsidiary of the Italian giant Finmeccanica.UN officials expect three more to be deployed in the coming months - one by the end of December and two more by the end of March 2014.They will be deployed across North Kivu, which has been one of the areas worst affected by two decades of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DR Congo.They have a range of 250km (155 miles) from their base in Goma. Technicians say other bases could easily be set up, which would allow for a broader surveillance. Congolese Defence Minister Alexandre Luba Ntambo says the drones will help the army against rebel groups.""Once we know exactly where they are hiding, our operations will be much more efficient,"" he said.Despite the defeat of the M23, numerous other armed groups still roam eastern DR Congo, including the FDLR, whose leaders are accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda."
5636	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24887339	News	1	International News	National Security	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	After three days of marathon negotiations - the dramatic and sudden arrival of US Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday, followed by other foreign ministers, and a diplomatic merry-go-round at the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva - there was still no deal. A good beginning or an honourable failure? At the press conference, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif looked exhausted by the marathon talks. Mr Zarif smiled and insisted the talks had been positive. He didn't take the bait when asked whether he was upset with the French for apparently throwing a wrench in the works and thanked all the ministers for coming, saying it was normal to have differences. But the press conference was short and felt somewhat awkward, as though neither one of them wanted to be there. Mr Zarif said he was not disappointed there was no deal. There was a lot of progress, according to him, and something to build on during the next round of talks later this month. Although Mr Kerry had made clear when he arrived on Friday that there was no deal yet in an effort to manage expectations, no-one really expected the talks to hit a snag because of France. All day reports circulated about divisions within the group of six world powers. Western diplomats told reporters camped in the hotel lobby that they were furious with the French for inserting their objections at the last minute. But France's position has always been tough on Iran - perhaps unnoticed, because the focus is mostly on the US stance. French diplomats have told me in recent years they believed the Obama administration was willing to concede too much too soon.  After the talks ended around 01:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov went to the bar. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius pre-empted the Ashton-Zarif press conference by speaking first, just outside the hotel where all the delegations had been meeting.Mr Fabius unilaterally announced that the ministers had failed to reach a deal and said that more work needed to be done.  For the P5+1, which always insists on showing unity when dealing with Iran, this was not its finest moment. The negotiations will now resume on 20 November at the political director level - a sign perhaps of how much work still needs to be done before an interim agreement can be reached. During his press conference, Mr Kerry was keen to emphasise that there was no need to rush and that it was reasonable to return to capitals for consultations to get ready for the next round. The US has some allies to reassure about the deal and rushing to the finish line this early would have caused unmanageable angst in Israel, but also Saudi Arabia.Mr Kerry also pointed out it wasn't easy to overcome 30 years of mistrust between the US and Iran (although it seems even harder to overcome French mistrust of Iran).  But it's important also to remember that this was only the second round of talks with this Iranian government. Mr Kerry and Mr Zarif had only met once before in September at the UN for a brief first encounter. In Geneva they spent almost 10 hours in the same room over the course of two days. Although there have been many rounds of negotiations in the past, all sides agree that this time is different. Although differences remain, more progress was made over the course of the last few days than over the last 10 years.

It opens the way for inspectors to visit a heavy-water plant being built in Arak and the Gachin uranium mine in Bandar Abbas, and for measures requested by the UN watchdog to be implemented.Tehran says the reactor in Arak is intended for the production of radioisotopes for medical purposes, but its spent fuel will contain plutonium suitable for use in nuclear weapons.Some reports said the latest talks failed because France had wanted to place tight restrictions on the facility in Arak.However, US diplomats said the Iranian government's insistence on formal recognition of its ""right"" to enrich uranium had been the major obstacle.The Jerusalem Post quoted a senior US official as saying the P5+1 had approved a working document, but that it had been ""too tough"" for the Iranians.Speaking at a news conference with UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Monday, Mr Kerry said: ""The P5+1 was unified on Saturday when we presented our proposal to the Iranians.""The French signed off on it, we signed off on it, and everybody agreed it was a fair proposal.""Iran couldn't take it at that particular moment; they weren't able to accept.""Mr Kerry also said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's public dismissal of the offer as a ""bad deal"" for the world had been premature.""We are confident that what we are doing can actually protect Israel more effectively and provide greater security,"" he added.Mr Kerry's comments on the prospects of an interim accord were echoed by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who told Europe 1 radio: ""We are not far from an agreement with the Iranians, but we are not there yet.""Responding to the reports that Paris was behind the failure of the talks, he said: ""France is neither isolated nor a country that follows the herd. It is independent and works for peace.""Mr Fabius revealed that there had been several issues that ""still need to be discussed with the Iranians"", including the facility in Arak, which could be operational by the end of 2014. ""We have to make arrangements for this reactor in Arak not to be activated as planned, for it not to lead to an atomic bomb,"" Mr Fabius said.Questions also remain over Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched to a medium level of purity, or 20%. Experts say it could be enriched to 90%, the level required for a nuclear bomb, in a relatively short time.""This stock at 20% must be dismantled and come back to 5%. The Iranian side still needs to make an effort [on this],"" Mr Fabius explained.But he also warned that the failure to agree a deal with Iran ""would be a considerable problem in a few months""."

The deal will last for six months, while a permanent agreement is sought. US President Barack Obama welcomed the deal, saying it would ""help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon"".Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran's right to uranium enrichment had been recognised. Israel, however, said the agreement was a ""historic mistake"".World powers suspect Iran's nuclear programme is secretly aiming at developing a nuclear bomb - a charge Iran has consistently denied.In a nationwide broadcast on Sunday, President Rouhani repeated that his country would never seek a nuclear weapon. He hailed the deal, saying it met one of Iran's fundamental principles.""No matter what interpretations are given, Iran's right to enrichment has been recognised,"" he said.Iran agreed to halt enrichment to medium-grade (20%) purity, which can be further enriched to weapons-grade level relatively easily, and give better access to UN  inspectors.Tehran insists it must be allowed to enrich uranium to use in power stations.The deal comes just months after Iran elected Mr Rouhani - regarded as a relative moderate - as its new president, succeeding the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.It has also been backed by Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in nuclear matters.After four days of negotiations, representatives of the so-called P5+1 group of nations - the US, the UK, Russia, China, France and Germany - reached the agreement with Iran in the early hours of Sunday. Key points of the deal have been released by the White House: Iran will stop enriching uranium beyond 5%, and ""neutralise"" its stockpile of uranium enriched beyond this pointIran will give greater access to inspectors including daily access at Natanz and Fordo nuclear sitesThere will be no further development of the Arak plant which it is believed could produce plutonium In return, there will be no new nuclear-related sanctions for six months if Iran sticks by the accordIran will also receive sanctions relief worth about $7bn (£4.3bn) on sectors including precious metalsUS Secretary of State John Kerry said the agreement would make the region safer for its allies, including Israel.But the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet it was a ""historic mistake"" and that his country reserved the right to defend itself.""Today the world became a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world made a significant step in obtaining the most dangerous weapons in the world,"" he said.At a later news conference, Mr Netanyahu said Israel would not be bound by the agreement.""We cannot and will not allow a regime that calls for the destruction of Israel to obtain the means to achieve this goal. ""Israel has many friends and allies, but when they're mistaken, its my duty to speak out.""The Israeli comments came as it was revealed that the US and Iran had held a series of face-to-face talks in recent months that paved the way for the agreement but were kept secret even from their allies.At least five meetings, involving Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, Vice President Joe Biden's senior foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan and Iranian officials, began in March at undisclosed locations, including the Gulf state of Oman, according to the Associated Press news agency.The final four meetings were held after President Rouhani was elected in August. The talks were personally authorised by President Obama, AP reports quoting senior US administration officials. The officials told AP they were ""convinced that the outreach had the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei"".Oman's Sultan Qaboos played a key role after offering himself as a mediator, according to AP.Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the agreement was an opportunity for the ""removal of any doubts about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme"". But he insisted that Iran had not given up its right to enrich uranium. ""We believe that the current agreement, the current plan of action as we call it, in two distinct places has a very clear reference to the fact that Iranian enrichment programme will continue and will be a part of any agreement, now and in the future,"" he said.The US denied any such right had been conceded, while UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the agreement was ""good news for the whole world"". But Mr Obama warned that if Iran fail to keep its commitments, ""we will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure"". This deal may be the most significant agreement between the world powers and Iran for a decade, says the BBC's James Reynolds in Geneva.In this latest round of talks, negotiators had been working since Wednesday to reach an agreement that was acceptable to both sides. It became clear that a breakthrough had been made in Geneva shortly before 03:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Sunday. In further reaction, President Vladimir Putin of Russia said he looked forward to a more comprehensive agreement.""What is done is a breakthrough but it is merely the first step on a long and difficult road,"" he said in a statement. ""In conjunction with our partners we are ready to continue the patient search for a mutually-acceptable, broader and comprehensive solution that upholds Iran's inalienable right to develop a peaceful nuclear programme.""

An injured Indian soldier was taken to hospital, it said. Earlier reports said three Indian peacekeepers had been killed in the attack.UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said more casualties were feared, and he did not know the fate of more than 30 Dinka civilians sheltering at the base.Security at the compound has since been increased. Sudan suffered a 22-year civil war that left more than a million people dead before the South became independent in 2011.The recent unrest has pitted gangs from the Nuer ethnic group of Mr Machar against Dinkas - the majority group to which Mr Kiir belongs.""South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past,"" President Obama said in a letter to Congress. ""Inflammatory rhetoric and targeted violence must cease. All sides must listen to the wise counsel of their neighbours, commit to dialogue and take immediate steps to urge calm and support reconciliation.""President Kiir has blamed the violence on soldiers who support Mr Machar.  Mr Machar, who was sacked by Mr Kiir in July, has denied trying to stage a coup. Mr Machar's whereabouts are unknown.Despite calls for calm, the rival groups have been fighting fierce gun-battles.African Union spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said on Thursday that the town of Bor, the Jonglei state capital, north of Juba, was in the hands of forces loyal to Mr Machar.""They control the town but government forces are trying to retake it,"" he said.A health official in Juba told the BBC that six doctors in Bor had fled the town after the hospital came under fire from shelling. One of them texted him to say they were still hiding in the bush.Heavy fighting between Nuer and Dinka soldiers has also been reported near Bentiu, capital of oil-producing Unity State.A UN spokesman told Reuters news agency more than 500 civilians - and 27 soldiers loyal to President Kiir - had sought refuge at a UN compound there. A number of countries were preparing to evacuate their nationals. Britain was sending another flight on Friday, a day after a military transport plane evacuated 182 people, including 53 Britons, to Uganda. Uganda has sent a small contingent of troops to help pull out its nationals.A US plane was also due to take Americans out of the country. And China's National Petroleum Company was evacuating oil workers to Juba.Jonglei state has witnessed some of the worst violence since South Sudan became independent, with hundreds killed in clashes between rival heavily-armed ethnic militias sparked by cattle-rustling. Following decades of conflict, weapons such as machineguns are widely available in much of South Sudan.In a statement, the UN mission in the country, Unmiss, said conditions for displaced people in Juba and Bor were ""challenging"". It said in some of the UN bases, some people had been able ""to construct basic shelters with available materials, but many have no or limited access to shelter"".A delegation of East African foreign ministers has travelled to Juba to try to mediate in the crisis.South Sudan's government insists the clashes are over power and politics, not between ethnic groups.The oil-rich country has struggled to achieve a stable government since becoming independent."

But if not, I continue to keep all options on the table.""Asked if an attack on Iran's nuclear sites was a realistic option he said: ""When I say that all options are on the table, all options are on the table and the United States obviously has significant capabilities.""But our goal here is to make sure that Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel or could trigger an arms race in the region. That would be extraordinarily dangerous at a time when obviously there are already a lot of things going on.""On 20 March Mr Obama is due to begin his first trip to Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan since being elected president in 2008.He and Mr Netanyahu are also expected to discuss the war in neighbouring Syria and efforts to revive peace talks with the Palestinians.The UN Security Council has ordered Iran to stop uranium enrichment and imposed four sets of sanctions.Earlier this month the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog called for access to Iran's Parchin military site ""without further delay"" and without waiting for negotiations to make progress.The IAEA has long suspected nuclear weapons research is taking place at the site, just outside Tehran.It has not had access to the military complex since 2005.In the same interview with Channel 2, Mr Obama said he had no plans to ""immediately"" release convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard.Pollard, 57, was jailed for life in 1987 for leaking secret US documents to Israel. Mr Obama said he was guilty of ""a very serious crime"".In another development on Thursday, the Pentagon said a US fighter jet over the Gulf had fired a warning flare to stop an Iranian jet approaching an unmanned US drone.A statement said the Iranian fighter broke off pursuit after the incident on 12 March. It said the drone had been flying over international waters."

Around 100 Conservative backbenchers and ministerial aides are expected to back the amendment or abstain, but the party leadership is hoping to reduce this number by publishing the draft bill.Foreign Secretary William Hague told the BBC that publishing the draft bill was a ""demonstration of our commitment to a referendum"".And Downing Street said: ""The prime minister has set out a very clear route for this country to take and nothing that has happened has changed that path.""The spokesman dismissed any comparisons between Mr Cameron and former Prime Minister Sir John Major, whose government was damaged by ongoing rows about Europe during the 1990s.The draft legislation is being published by the Conservatives so that it can be brought to the Commons for debate by one of the party's backbench MPs in the form of a private member's bill, rather than one sponsored by the government.The ballot to choose who can bring forward private members' bills will be held on Thursday and, although they have little chance of becoming law, there is non-government parliamentary time available for them to be debated.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the Conservatives' strategy was aimed at persuading the public they would only get an EU referendum if they vote for them at the next election and contrast this with Labour and Liberal Democrat opposition.On Monday, Mr Cameron - who is on a trip to the US - said his approach was in the ""national interest"" and holding a referendum now would provide a ""false choice"" between the status quo and an immediate exit.Nevertheless, two senior cabinet ministers - Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Education Secretary Michael Gove - have said they would vote to quit the EU if a poll was held straight away.Conservative chairman Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that the draft bill had been in preparation for several months and the timing of its publication had nothing to do with Wednesday's vote - in which MPs were ""entitled"" to express their views. But Tory MP Philip Hollobone told the same programme that No 10 had been ""in chaos"" over the past week on the issue and it should have published the draft bill at the time of last week's Queen's Speech.And Eurosceptic Tory MP John Baron, one of the key movers behind the Queen's Speech amendment, said the PM should have the ""courage"" to support it and ""force Labour and the Liberals to decide"" their position on the EU.More pro-European Conservatives have said there must be an orderly process leading up to any vote over the UK's future in the EU. Former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke urged his colleagues to ""move on"" from the current wrangling and warned that leaving the EU would be ""catastrophic"" for the UK's economic prospects and global standing. Labour says committing to hold a referendum in four years' time is not the ""right choice"" for the country and internal Tory ""machinations"" are causing uncertainty at a time when securing economic recovery should be the government's priority.""Our agenda is reform and change within Europe, not exit from the European Union,"" said shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander.The Lib Dems said the government had already legislated to seek public approval before any further powers were handed to Brussels, and accused their coalition partners of ""navel-gazing"" over Europe. The UK Independence Party - which campaigns for a UK exit - has raised the possibility of Conservative and Labour candidates who favour withdrawal standing under a joint banner with UKIP at the next election. Leader Nigel Farage described the proposed draft bill as ""nothing more than gesture politics""."

Congress is due to reconvene on 9 September.The Syrian government denies it was behind the attacks and blames rebels.UN inspectors who have been investigating the attacks arrived in the Netherlands on Saturday with samples from site visits, which will be tested in laboratories in Europe. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is overseeing the investigation, said the whole testing process could take up to three weeks, although ""every effort"" would be made to expedite it. Senior White House officials told the BBC's Katty Kay that Mr Obama's decision to seek congressional approval was made by the president on Friday afternoon. It had not been planned until then.The officials added that they believed they would get congressional approval, although they were aware of the risks, our correspondent adds. Later on Saturday, Mr Obama formally asked Congress to authorise military action. The draft legislation seeks approval for the use of force to prevent the Syrian government from carrying out chemical weapons attacks.President Obama said the US was prepared to strike whenever it chose. ""Our capacity to execute this mission is not time-sensitive.""He added: ""We cannot and will not turn a blind eye to what happened in Damascus.""Mr Obama says he has the constitutional authority as commander-in-chief to order military action without the backing of Congress.However, he said it was important to have the debate. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the announcement, saying the president's role as commander-in-chief was ""always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress"".Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have been pushing for US intervention in Syria, also gave their backing to the vote.However, they warned against limited strikes which would not change the balance of the conflict, calling the prospect ""an inadequate response to the crimes against humanity that [Syrian President] Assad and his forces are committing"".The BBC's Katy Watson in Washington says that if Mr Obama is to intervene, he wants the people - and politicians - on his side.But what is unclear is what action he would take if Congress votes against involvement, our correspondent says.On Thursday, British MPs defeated a government motion to take part in any military action in Syria. After the president's address UK Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted:  ""I understand and support Barack Obama's position"".Mr Obama did not speak to Mr Cameron before his statement but did call President Hollande of France, the White House said.France has also backed military action in Syria. The French parliament is due to reconvene next week.France will wait for discussions in the US Congress and French parliament before making a decision on military intervention, a French official told the Associated Press. Earlier on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin challenged the US to present to the UN evidence that Syria had attacked rebels with chemical weapons. Mr Putin said it would be ""utter nonsense"" for Syria's government to provoke opponents with such attacks.Russia - a key ally of Syria - has previously warned that ""any unilateral military action bypassing the UN Security Council"" would be a ""direct violation of international law"".Moscow, along with China, has vetoed two previous draft resolutions on Syria.The BBC's Jeremy Bowen in Damascus says people there are worried and are making preparations.They do not know what Mr Obama meant by a limited attack and what consequences it will have, he adds.The main findings of the unclassified US evidence state that:the attacks killed 1,429 people, including 426 childrenSyrian military chemical weapons personnel were operating in the area in the three days before the attackSatellite evidence shows rockets launched from government-held areas 90 minutes before the first report of chemical attack100 videos attributed to the attack show symptoms consistent with exposure to a nerve agentCommunications were intercepted involving a senior Damascus official who ""confirmed chemical weapons were used"" and was concerned about UN inspectors obtaining evidenceSyrian President Bashar al-Assad has said his country will defend itself against any Western ""aggression"".Forces which could be used against Syria:•Four US destroyers - USS Gravely, USS Ramage, USS Barry and USS Mahan - are in the eastern Mediterranean, equipped with cruise missiles. The missiles can also be fired from submarines, but the US Navy does not reveal their locations•Airbases at Incirlik and Izmir in Turkey, and in Jordan, could be used to carry out strikes•Two aircraft carriers - USS Nimitz and USS Harry S Truman are in the wider region•French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is currently in Toulon in the western Mediterranean•French Rafale and Mirage aircraft can also operate from Al-Dhahra airbase in the UAECorrection 3 September: An earlier version of the story stated that President Obama has the constitutional authority to order military action without the backing of Congress.

Protesters and local politicians have demanded clarification from the US government on the allegations, the BBC's Jennifer Pak reports.""Hong Kong is one of the few places in China where internet freedom is still OK. Now the American government is hacking into us,"" one protester said. ""That is a crime against human rights."" Another man brought a poster containing a picture of US President Barack Obama and the words ""Big Brother is watching you"".Mr Snowden told the South China Morning Post this week that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had led more than 61,000 hacking operations worldwide, including many in Hong Kong and mainland China.He said targets in Hong Kong included the Chinese University, public officials and businesses.Mr Snowden left Hawaii for Hong Kong shortly before the highly sensitive leaks surfaced and has vowed to fight any attempt to extradite him to the US.""I am not here to hide from justice; I am here to reveal criminality,"" Mr Snowden told the Post, which said the interview was carried out in a secret location in Hong Kong.""My intention is to ask the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate.""In a US Senate hearing earlier this week, NSA director Keith Alexander defended the internet and telephone data snooping programmes, saying they had disrupted dozens of terror plots.Intelligence officials have insisted agents do not listen in on Americans' telephone conversations.

5703	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22121348	News	0	International News	National Security	SomewhatPositive	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"As North Korea threatens a new missile launch, US Secretary of State John Kerry will reassure allies in Seoul and Tokyo about American support, but his diplomatic skills will be tested in Beijing.  The four-day tour of Asia is Mr Kerry's first visit to the region and his first diplomatic crisis since starting in his new job.  North Korea has threatened to launch a mid-range missile in the coming days.American officials have speculated that the launch could take place on 15 April, the birthday of the country's founder Kim Il Sung. He is the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un. A US official in Seoul said that they were keeping a close watch on developments and were worried about a miscalculation by the young, inexperienced North Korean leader. But the official was also keen to emphasise that there were no mass troop movements inside North Korea. Other officials indicated the latest tension was part of a cycle that people had to wait out.  ""The launch of a Musadan missile is one of many potential provocations that could happen that could give Kim Jong-un an off-ramp,"" said the US official in Seoul.He explained that the launch would be a way for the North Korean leader to tell his citizens that he had stood up to the world and could now back down from his rhetoric and save face. US diplomatic meetings with North Korea have so far been limited and proven fruitless. In Seoul and Tokyo he will go over preparations to deal with North Korea's expected missile launch and explore ways to move beyond the crisis. But diplomatic prowess will be required in Mr Kerry's conversation with the Chinese in Beijing. Short of engaging North Korea directly itself, the US believes the best way forward is to get China to exert more influence on North Korea.""It's no secret that China has the most leverage, the most influence over North Korea,"" a senior state department official told reporters travelling with Mr Kerry. ""We want to see them use some of that leverage."" Washington has hoped for years that China would rein in its tempestuous, smaller neighbour and client state. American officials regularly convey their impression that the Chinese are getting frustrated with Pyongyang. But the frustration rarely translates into Chinese pressure over North Korea or even a public rebuke. American officials insist that their efforts to engage the Chinese on this issue have come a long way and are paying off.They point to the last round of sanctions imposed on North Korea in February, which China approved. Last week Chinese President Xi Jinping warned that ""no-one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains"", prompting renewed American hope that China's patience with North Korea was running out. Beijing appears increasingly concerned about the consequences of North Korea's behaviour on its own strategic interests in the region. ""We want to see them do what the Japanese do, what the South Koreans do, which is to stick to UN sanctions,"" the senior state department official said, ""and help stem the money trail to Pyongyang."" The secretary of state will also press on the Chinese that any engagement with the North Koreans must be clearly conditioned on de-nuclearisation.  On Thursday, South Korea appeared to soften its tone on North Korea, calling on Pyongyang to come to the dialogue table to resolve problems like the Kaesong industrial complex. There was no mention of de-nuclearisation and South Korea's Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae stopped short of a formal offer of dialogue. American officials were eager to dispel any impression that the US and South Korea were diverging on how to deal with North Korea. ""The South Koreans are prepared to move forward on small things, like some humanitarian assistance, if there are no further provocations,"" the state department official said. Any missile launch or other similar expected provocations seem already to be factored in. US officials praised South Korean President Park Geun-hye's handling of the crisis so far, saying they could not ""imagine how she could have done it better"". Mr Kerry will hold talks with Ms Park in Seoul. His experience and knowledge in this part of Asia is limited. A Vietnam war veteran who was later deeply involved in normalising relations with Hanoi, Mr Kerry did not focus much on North-East Asia during his 29 years as a senator on the foreign relations committee. Since starting his job as secretary of state in February, Mr Kerry has devoted most of his energy to the Middle East and has also indicated climate change is a priority for him - two intractable issues for different reasons. Despite the Korean crisis, Asia is still seen as an area of positive gains and co-operation for the Obama administration. In all three countries he will be visiting, Mr Kerry will find new leaders - Ms Park was inaugurated in February, Xi Jinping came into office in March and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power in December. Senior officials travelling with Mr Kerry said that the exchange with those leaders would not be burdened by perceptions of American decline, unlike during Hillary Clinton's maiden voyage to Asia as secretary of state in February 2009, in the midst of financial crisis. The investment in Asia during Mr Obama's first term and the work done by Ms Clinton over the last four years has bolstered American credibility and influence in Asia and set the stage for Mr Kerry to begin sketching out with allies in the region ""what we want to achieve over the next four years"". China's efforts to assert itself in the region over the last few years has pushed traditional American allies like Japan and South Korea - but also countries like Vietnam - closer to Washington. In a bitter irony for China, the unpredictable behaviour of its own ally, North Korea, means that the US will only continue to strengthen its position in Asia."

Our alliance is eternal. It is forever."" Mr Netanyahu thanked Mr Obama for ""unequivocally affirming Israel's sovereign right to defend itself by itself against any threat"". Mr Obama later visited Mr Peres at his official residence where, in a joint news conference, the Israeli president said the two nations were united by a common vision - to confront dangers and bring peace.Mr Peres said he trusted the US in its policy of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. President Obama said he had reassured Mr Peres ""that in this work Israel will have no greater friend than the United States"".Mr Obama then went on to talks with Mr Netanyahu, with whom he has had a notoriously frosty relationship. The main purpose of this trip is rebuild bridges and improving relationships which could give him more leverage over the new Israeli government, the BBC North America editor Mark Mardell reports.The leaders' initial warm, if scripted, exchanges were a step towards doing that, our correspondent adds.At home, Mr Obama has been criticised for not having visited Israel in his first term as president, with some saying it shows he is not close enough to the country. And one recent Israeli opinion poll suggested a mere 10% of the public had a favourable opinion of the US president. On Thursday, Mr Obama will make a speech to Israeli university students, and travel to the West Bank to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.Security for the visit is tight, with thousands of Israeli and Palestinian security officers on duty in Jerusalem and the Palestinians' de facto capital in the West Bank city of Ramallah.Both Israeli and Palestinian groups have staged protests in the run-up to Mr Obama's visit.Some 200 activists pitched tents in the area known as E1, a stretch of land in East Jerusalem on which Israel controversially plans to build new houses. The Israeli move has been widely criticised, including by the US.Abdullah Abu Rahma, a protest organiser, said they wanted to send a message to Mr Obama: ""Enough with bias and support for Israel.""In the West Bank city of Hebron, protesters wearing masks of Mr Obama and civil rights leader Martin Luther King called for an end to ""apartheid"".There were clashes between the pro-Palestinian protesters and some of the settlers living in the divided city, and a number of Palestinians were arrested.In Gaza City, protesters burned US flags outside UN offices, the Associated Press reports. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the visit was ""ominous"" and unwelcome, and that its consequences would be negative.""It gives legitimacy to the occupation and confirms the political support of the United States [to Israel],"" AP quoted him as saying.Meanwhile, Israelis have been staging protests in Jerusalem demanding Mr Obama free Jonathan Pollard, imprisoned in the US in 1987 for spying for Israel."

Hong Kong's government said Mr Snowden left the city voluntarily.But Albert Ho, his lawyer in Hong Kong, told the BBC that a government official urged Mr Snowden to go over the weekend. Mr Ho said he believed the official was acting on the orders of the Beijing government. He added that his client was given assurances that he would be allowed to leave freely. A flight to Havana, which Mr Snowden had been expected to board on Monday, departed late from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Journalists on the plane said there was no sign of the fugitive former intelligence contractor.An Aeroflot airline worker, who asked not to be named, told Associated Press news agency that Mr Snowden was not on the flight.The US state department has urged countries in the ""Western Hemisphere"" not to let him enter their territory.Washington said it expected the Russian government to ""look at all options available"" to transfer him to the US to face spying charges - but Russia reportedly said it has ""no grounds"" to do so.""We expect the Russian government to look at all options available to expel Mr Snowden back to the US to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged,"" Caitlin Hayden, US National Security Council spokeswoman, said on Sunday.She highlighted ""intensified co-operation"" between the US and Russia after the Boston Marathon bombings in April and their record of working together on law enforcement matters.But Russia's Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed Russian source as saying: ""Snowden has not committed any crimes on Russian territory.""In addition, Russian law-enforcement agencies have received no instructions through Interpol to detain him. So we have no grounds to detain this transit passenger."" The US had been trying to extradite Mr Snowden from Hong Kong, but authorities there said the US request was incomplete and there was no legal basis to stop him from departing. The US justice department said it was ""disappointed"" that Hong Kong did not arrest Mr Snowden and that it ""disagrees"" with its reasons for not doing so.""We find their decision to be particularly troubling,"" an official said.Mr Snowden had been expected to fly first to Cuba and then to Venezuela before heading to Ecuador to avoid any country that might arrest him on behalf of the US. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said on Monday that Mr Snowden's asylum request was being ""analysed"".Ecuador is already giving political asylum to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who has been sheltering in its London embassy for the past year. Wikileaks is now supporting Mr Snowden and said in a statement that he was ""bound for the Republic of Ecuador via a safe route for the purposes of asylum, and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisers from Wikileaks"".Although the US and Ecuador have a joint extradition treaty, it is not applicable to ""crimes or offences of a political character"".Mr Snowden left his home in Hawaii after leaking details of his work as an NSA (National Security Agency) contractor and the extensive US surveillance programme to the UK's Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post.He has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.The Obama administration is desperate to get its hands on Mr Snowden before he reveals any more secrets, says the BBC's Paul Adams in Washington.Mr Snowden's leaks have led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under an NSA programme known as Prism.US officials have defended the practice of gathering telephone and internet data from private users around the world.They say Prism cannot be used to intentionally target any Americans or anyone in the US, and that it is supervised by judges.

The sale of V22 would also mark the first time the planes have been released to any country outside America.Mr Hagel said President Obama had made ""not only maintaining but improving Israel's [military] qualitative edge a top priority"".He told reporters that all options for dealing with Iran remained on the table, while Israeli defence secretary Moshe Yaalon said ""one way or another Iran's nuclear programme will be stopped"".Mr Hagel also said the US would continue to invest in Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile defence system, saying Washington would seek a further $220m for funding, on top of $460m it has spent on the programme already.The defence secretary's trip is the first leg of a tour of Middle East allies, including Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates."

That was about the only good line in a speech by President Barack Obama that may not have won many converts. He stood behind a podium rather than sitting at the desk in the Oval Office, and made a speech that was clear but almost entirely lacking in passion and devoid of new arguments. Indeed, the first two-thirds seemed cut and pasted from earlier speeches. The trouble was that while he made the clinical case for military action against Syria, we knew there was a ""but"" coming.Had he still been calling for a vote in Congress in a few days' time and had he wanted the American people to pressure their politicians, he would have had to make a much stronger speech about the dangers of inaction.As it was, Syria's acceptance of the Russian plan to give up their chemical weapons has changed everything. He didn't express any cynicism about the idea but said it was an ""encouraging sign"". He had asked Congress to delay a vote, and said the US, Britain and France would work through the UN and talk to China and Russia. They would wait for the UN inspectors to report. The military would stand ready to respond if diplomacy failed. All this leaves more questions than answers. We don't know how long Mr Obama will give diplomacy or what its failure would look like. We don't know if the three Western nations will go ahead with a resolution backed up with force or go for something more modest. We have no idea how UN inspectors could do their job in a country ravaged by civil war.The President's speech was for a few days a hugely important date in the diary, but by the time he came to deliver it, events had rendered it almost an irrelevance.  The next key event is likely to be the meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Thursday.

Don't hold your breath for any great new announcements. The UK prime minister is in the US partly for a big meeting at the UN on global development  and partly for an event with Prince Harry, also in New York. So his meeting with the president is something added on, rather than the centrepiece of his trip. That means it will be strictly business - no playing of ping pong or sampling of BBQ. As well as Syria, they will talk about Iran, transatlantic trade (the proposed deal with the EU is now known in the trade as ""tee tip"") and probably North Korea. Doubtless the president will want to know the latest about the prime minister's proposed referendum on membership of the European Union and his troublesome colleagues' willingness to turn a political face-saver into a real choice.  While some in Britain dream of leaving the EU and strengthening the transatlantic relationship it its place, America values what the president calls the ""essential relationship"" in part as a bridge to Europe. If it turns into a bridge to nowhere, it will trouble them. But Syria is the hard case. Both Europe and the US are slowly inching towards arming the rebels. But that commonplace phrase disguises the fact that the ""arms"" will be well short of anything the rebels actually want to finish this protracted business.For months now, the noises from Western capitals have vacillated between the cry ""Something must be done!""  and the forlorn reply ""But what?""One rather lame answer is the idea of a peace conference dangled by Russia. But there's not much diplomatic chatter about the proposal, which seems more like a passing thought than a hard plan. I get the impression that the US and Europe will go along with what they privately regard as a bit of a charade only because they have no better ideas. Which brings us back to  ""arming the rebels"" and allied concepts like a no-fly zone. Enthusiasts insist it isn't that difficult - find the right sort of rebels and give them the weapons they need. But as one insider put it to me: ""What if we give the minority we trust the good stuff and five miles down the road they run into a road block and Islamist nutters take it off them? How does that help?""No-one has any particularly good answers to this conundrum. We'll see today if the two leaders can come up with anything that squares the circle.   "

Ms Rice said in Monday's meeting that waiting to sign the deal ""would not provide the United States and Nato allies the clarity necessary to plan for a potential post-2014 military presence"".

The deal under discussion may see 15,000 foreign troops remain after 2014, although the US says it has not yet taken a decision on any presence.The soldiers who stay beyond 2014, when most foreign combat forces leave, would primarily train and mentor Afghan forces.

The US must give an explanation and apology to the people of Hong Kong and stop invading Hong Kong's computers,"" the Wen Wei Po replies.Another major story in the Hong Kong press, including the Oriental Daily News, the Ming Pao and the Apple Daily, is a probe by the Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog into a whistle-blowing journalist's allegations of corruption and wrongdoing by China Resources Power Holdings (CRP), a state-run conglomerate registered in Hong Kong. The company, however, has rejected Economic Information Daily reporter Wang Wenzhi's allegations that its executives paid inflated sums for overvalued coal mining assets in Shanxi province, The Beijing News adds.Back in the mainland, the Southern Metropolis Daily, The Beijing News and many internet users are repeating calls for an inquiry into the death of a watermelon seller in Linwu county, Hunan province, during a dispute with urban management inspectors or chengguan on Wednesday that has triggered two days of protests.The Beijing News says the chengguan authorities are denying witness accounts that officers beat Deng Zhengjia and his wife while one of them hit his head with an iron measuring weight. They say that the officers tried to fine the Dengs for running a stall without a licence.Violent clashes erupted again after protesters tried to stop riot police taking away Mr Deng's body from the street, note the China Daily and the South China Morning Post.The Global Times says the case has ignited public suspicion that the local government may be shielding the chengguan, but stresses that violence, not the chengguan system, should be blamed for any rough tactics employed by officers.A village petitioner tells the China Youth Daily how she is waging a legal battle against authorities in Zhoukou, Henan province, after she was locked up in a labour camp and then sent to a mental hospital for 132 days for endangering ""social stability"". The Beijing News says the public are questioning inconsistencies in the 2012 expenses accounts of central government departments amid an ongoing crackdown on officials splashing out on the ""three public's"" (san gong) - cars, banquets and foreign travel.Beijing insiders tip off the Ming Pao on how official celebrations on 26 December to mark communist republic founder Mao Zedong's 120th birthday will be toned down amid an ongoing ideological dispute between liberals and ""leftist"" conservatives.The Beijing Morning Post says a ban in Beijing on renting out illegally subdivided flats that often squeeze scores of tenants into bunkbeds has ignited concerns among internet users over having to pay higher rents.Finally, many Chinese internet users have posted icons of candles to mourn the closure of the microblog accounts of the Asahi Shimbun, the South China Morning Post reports. The Tokyo newspaper says social media operators Sina, Tencent, Sohu and Netease deleted its microblog accounts on Wednesday without any explanation.

This is the first hard evidence that the state department did ask for changes to the CIA's original assessment.Specifically, they wanted references to previous warnings deleted and this sentence removed: ""We do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack.""There's little doubt in my mind that this will haunt Hillary Clinton if she decides to run for president, unless she executes some pretty fancy footwork.State department spokesperson Victoria Nuland is directly implicated, and the fingerprints of senior White House aides Ben Rhodes and Jay Carney are there as well.In the interests of full disclosure I have to say I have not in the past been persuaded that allegations of a cover-up were a big deal. It seemed to me a partisan attack based on very little. I remember listening to reports from the BBC and others at the time that did suggest the attack in Benghazi was a spontaneous reaction to a rather puerile anti-Islamic video.I understand President Barack Obama's careful use of the word ""terrorism"" when it actually means something, rather than as a knee-jerk description of any violence by foreigners against Americans, often in order to justify a ""war on terror"".But the evidence is there in black and white, unless we doubt the documents obtained by ABC, which I don't.Mr Obama's critics are often not very clear what is behind their allegations. I presume they think that the White House wanted to avoid claims the murders were the result of terrorism because this would undermine his claim that al-Qaeda was seriously ""degraded"". There's also a vague sense he's ""soft on terror"".The new documents contain two rationales for the changes in language. The first is that it would prejudice the FBI investigation. Perhaps, but I am not at all persuaded.The other reason given, old-fashioned butt-guarding, is more credible. As Ms Nuland puts it, such a report ""could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either?"" However you read the motives, the state department and apparently the White House did get the CIA to change its story. This is now very serious, and I suspect heads will roll. The White House will be on the defensive for a while."

Israel, which halted its dues at the same time, has also had its Unesco voting rights suspended.The US and Israel said admitting the Palestinians was a misguided attempt to bypass the Middle East peace process.Unesco's loss of $80m (£50m) a year in US funding has forced it to pare back American-led initiatives, including Holocaust education and a project to restore water facilities in Iraq.Paris-based Unesco is charged with designating World Heritage sites, promoting education and supporting press freedom, as well as countering extremism.The American ambassador to Unesco, David Killion, told Reuters news agency: ""We intend to continue our engagement with Unesco in every possible way.""The US, however, has said it cannot legally contribute to a UN agency that implies recognition of a Palestinian state.Israel's ambassador to Unesco, Nimrod Barkan, told the Associated Press news agency that his country supported the US decision, ""objecting to the politicisation of Unesco, or any international organisation, with the accession of a non-existing country like Palestine"".The Palestinian ambassador to Unesco, Elias Sanbar, said other countries were beginning to make up for the funding vacuum left by the US.But he added: ""Is this in the interest of the US, to be replaced?""The US suspension comes amid attempts by Washington to broker peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

However, decades of peace-making have also shown that a persistent mediator - most often an American - is necessary, but not sufficient, to reach an historic deal.Still, after six months of meetings and meals at Israeli, Palestinian and Arab tables, Mr Kerry has finally persuaded both sides to come to Washington to sit at an American table to talk. His careful choice of words underlines that this first round of direct negotiations since 2010 is still just talks about talks. Senior negotiators will take their seats, not the leaders.But there is no denying that Mr Kerry's dogged diplomacy has achieved a small important step on this rocky road to peace.In part, the breakthrough is a face-saving device for all sides. Mr Kerry did not want a sixth trip ending with ""we're getting close"".Neither Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas nor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to be blamed for his failure. Both sides have come to appreciate that Mr Kerry has made this his mission, despite all the odds, and has US President Barack Obama's backing. Few details have emerged so far about this ""basis for resuming direct final status negotiations"".Palestinian officials still protest that Israel has not agreed that negotiations on their future state must start with borders that approximate to the boundaries of land Israel captured in the 1967 war.  A stop to settlement building is another highly sensitive issue putting Palestinian pressure on President Abbas not to go back to the table now. But it appears Mr Kerry was able to persuade Israel to move on another major Palestinian concern, the release of prisoners.  Israeli minister Yuval Steinitz said prisoners would be released in phases including ""heavyweights who had been in prison for tens of years"".Demands on Palestinians are certain to include assurances that no unilateral steps will be taken, including a return to the United Nations in September. A senior Palestinian negotiator recently told me, with barely concealed anger, that the ""status quo"" was finished if Israel did not return to substantive talks.Speaking on the BBC's Newshour programme, Uri Savir, Israel's negotiator in secret Oslo talks 20 years ago, said he believed an American framework would provide the basis for talks.Based on their public statements, that includes the 1967 borders with mutually agreed land swapsacceptance that settlement building is not ""constructive""Israel's security concerns and recognition that it is a Jewish state. Everyone knows, roughly, what must be done. But can all sides now do it? "

There are currently about 68,000 US soldiers in the country.Mr Rhodes told reporters that an announcement on post-2014 troop levels was not expected during Mr Karzai's visit.But he added that a bilateral security agreement between the US and Afghanistan is expected by November of this year.White House officials have previously suggested they favour keeping between 3,000 and 9,000 troops in Afghanistan after the combat mission ends.The Afghan leader is due to see President Obama on Friday, their first meeting since the US presidential election. Ahead of the trip, the White House issued a statement saying Mr Obama ""looks forward to... discussing our continued transition in Afghanistan, and our shared vision of an enduring partnership"" between the two countries.The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul says the US president is likely to discuss the size of the force that remains, and whether they are there to fight the Taliban or shift their primary focus to tackling al-Qaeda.The visit comes days after a drone attack that killed Pakistan militant leader Mullah Nazir, who was accused of sending fighters to Afghanistan to support the Taliban.Mr Karzai is expected to provide a request for future requirements for the Afghan military such as heavy weaponry, an improved air force and medical support.Our correspondent says the US spent almost $120bn (£74bn; 91bn Euros) in Afghanistan in 2011, a figure that diplomats in Kabul say will be increasingly difficult to justify because of economic problems at home and extensive corruption within Afghanistan.Meanwhile Mr Karzai has held back from signing a long-term binding security agreement with the US, amid fears that Afghan sovereignty is being undermined.He is unwilling to grant US soldiers immunity from prosecution and is unhappy that Afghans are still being held in US-run military prisons on Afghan soil, our correspondent adds.US and Iraqi authorities reached a similar sticking point in negotiations over the drawdown of US troops from Iraq. Aside from a contingent guarding the embassy, all US soldiers left the country by December 2011.As of December, Nato forces in Afghanistan numbered 102,000, including 68,000 US troops."

A transfer ceremony took place at Bagram jail, now renamed the Afghan National Detention Facility at Parwan. The handover came as US Secretary of State John Kerry made an unannounced visit for talks with President Karzai.Mr Kerry told a press conference they were both ""on the same page"" regarding peace talks with the Taliban.President Hamid Karzai recently angered Washington by accusing the US and the Taliban of colluding to prolong the conflict.But Mr Kerry told reporters: ""I am confident (Mr Karzai) does not believe the US has any interest except to see the Taliban come to the table to make peace.''""So we're on the same page. I don't think there is any disagreement between us.''Referring to the handover of Bagram prison, Mr Karzai said: ""Today was a very good day.''The handover had been delayed while the two sides finalised a deal over the fate of prisoners considered dangerous.Bagram has a chequered reputation, having been at the centre of a number of prisoner abuse allegations.It was once located in Bagram air base, one of the largest military bases for Nato-led forces in Afghanistan, about 40km (25 miles) north of the capital, Kabul. The new Parwan facility was constructed a few miles away and populated with inmates in 2010.""The transfer of the detention facility is an important part of the overall transition of security lead to Afghan National Security Forces. This ceremony highlights an increasingly confident, capable and sovereign Afghanistan,"" said Gen Dunford, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan.Last March the US agreed to hand over responsibility for the majority of the detainees, thought to number more than 3,000, and actually held a transfer ceremony last September. But the full transfer was held up over a disagreement about the fate of inmates whom the US feared could be released if the prison was handed over. A senior official at the facility told reporters: "" Since March 2012, the Americans have handed over to us 4,000 prisoners. We have freed 1,350 of them. The Americans have given us 26 more prisoners today, and they still have more prisoners which they will hand over to us soon.''According to the latest deal Afghanistan will not release ""dangerous"" inmates without review, and about 50 foreign inmates will remain in US hands. If the US captures fighters, they must be turned over to the Afghan authorities within 96 hours. Earlier this month a ceremony transferring the final prisoners to Afghan custody was called off at the last minute because President Karzai reportedly rejected part of the deal.The Pentagon said over the weekend that an agreement had been reached.  The prison been described as ""Afghanistan's Guantanamo"".In January 2012, Afghan investigators accused the US Army of abusing detainees at Bagram. The investigators said prisoners had reported being tortured, held without evidence and subjected to humiliating body searches.Nato and the US have rejected allegations of abuse as untrue and pointed to the fact that they have given the Afghan Human Rights commission access to check them independently.In February 2012, US soldiers unwittingly burned Korans confiscated from prisoners at Bagram, leading to days of protests and targeted killings across Afghanistan. A US investigation said there was no malicious intent to insult Islam.But the future of the US-run prison had become a thorn in the side of US-Afghan relations ahead of the planned withdrawal of these forces in 2014.Many Nato forces have already begun withdrawing troops from Afghanistan ahead of the complete transfer of power to Afghan security forces.

His leaks revealed that US agencies had systematically gathered vast amounts of phone and web data.The criminal complaint was lodged with a federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia,  court documents show, and a provisional arrest warrant had been issued, officials said.On Saturday a senior US administration official said: ""If Hong Kong doesn't act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong's commitment to the rule of law.""Mr Snowden left a hotel in Hong Kong on 10 June after allowing newspapers to name him as the source of the leaks. His current whereabouts are unknown. However, a report in Hong Kong's Sunday Morning Post suggested he was ""in a safe place"" in the city and not in custody, nor under police protection, as reported elsewhere.Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, signed an extradition treaty with the US in 1998.It has a separate legal system from the Chinese mainland, and Mr Snowden's right of appeal could drag out any future extradition proceedings for several years.Some Hong Kong politicians have voiced support for Mr Snowden.Left-wing MP Leung Kwok-hung said Beijing should tell the authorities to protect him from extradition, and the people of the territory should ""take to the streets"" to shelter him. The BBC's Juliana Liu in Hong Kong says Beijing is highly unlikely to interfere in the early stages of what could be a long legal battle. The leaks have led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under an NSA programme known as Prism.Mr Snowden also alleged that US intelligence had been hacking into Chinese computer networks. Further details of his allegations emerged on Sunday in a report by the Sunday Morning Post, which said that as recently as January this year the NSA hacked computers and servers at the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing.He said earlier that he had decided to speak out after observing ""a continuing litany of lies"" from senior officials to Congress.US officials have since defended the practice of gathering telephone and internet data from private users around the world.They say Prism cannot be used to intentionally target any Americans or anyone in the US, and that it is supervised by judges.Mr Snowden is charged with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. The complaint is dated 14 June although it was made public only on Friday.In the US, the charges were welcomed by Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.""I've always thought this was a treasonous act,'' he said in a statement.  ""I hope Hong Kong's government will take him into custody and extradite him to the US.""Julian Assange, founder of the Wikileaks organisation, issued a statement supporting Mr Snowden.""The US government is spying on each and every one of us, but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off,"" said Mr Assange, who has been living in Ecuador's London embassy for the past year, fighting extradition to Sweden for questioning on alleged sex offences."

The deal will also have to be approved by parliament.Mr Karzai's statement on the timing of the signature of the document appears to be a new condition, our correspondent says.The US had wanted the deal to be agreed quickly.Indeed Mr Obama's letter says: ""We look forward to concluding this agreement promptly.""The US state department later said it would be ""neither practical nor possible"" to delay signing beyond the end of the year.The US would have to take into account any amendments that are put forward, and would still have the option of pulling out altogether.Another key sticking point that Mr Karzai appears to have conceded concerns the jurisdiction for the prosecution of US troops.The US insistence on immunity from Afghan prosecution for troops has been central to Washington's demands.The failure to resolve a similar legal issue in Iraq led to a total withdrawal of US forces.The US-Afghan draft says: ""Afghanistan authorises the United States to hold trial in such cases, or take other disciplinary action, as appropriate, in the territory of Afghanistan.""According to the draft, the deal will remain in force ""until the end of 2024 and beyond"".Currently the multinational Nato force is due to pull out of Afghanistan from 2014. Opening the four-day Loya Jirga, President Karzai said the only issue on the table was whether the security agreement would be signed. A woman delegate shouted from the floor that US troops had spilt too much Afghan blood and should be stopped. Mr Karzai acknowledged there were difficult issues involved but advised delegates to accept the agreement.He said that a number of world leaders - including from Russia, China, and India - were backing the deal, and that it would provide the security Afghanistan needed, as well as the foundation for forces from other Nato countries who were assisting Afghan troops. But Mr Karzai also admitted there was a lack of trust between him and the Americans.He said: ""I don't trust them and they don't trust me, the last 10 years has shown this to me. I have had fights with them and they have had propaganda against me.""The Loya Jirga  delegates will now meet in smaller closed-door groups to look at the deal in detail. Security is tight for the meeting after a suicide bombing last weekend near the huge tent where it is being held.The Taliban has branded the meeting a US-designed plot, and has vowed to pursue and punish its delegates as traitors if they approve the deal."

The Snowden affair has caused diplomatic ructions around the world, upsetting close US allies and traditional enemies.Leaks by the former CIA worker have led to revelations that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is collecting Americans' phone records.On Wednesday evening, an attempt to block funding for the programme narrowly failed in a 205-217 vote in the US House of Representatives.The White House had lobbied Congress to support the surveillance.

Meanwhile, Russia and Iran have strongly denounced the attack.In her final press interview as US Secretary of State, Mrs Clinton said one of Iran's ""highest priorities"" was keeping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power.""We believe they have acted on that by sending in more personnel, not only to help Assad, but to support and advise military security forces,"" she told reporters.Mrs Clinton added that Iran had increased the quality of its arms sent to Syria because ""Assad is using up his weaponry"".She expressed similar concerns with regards to Russia's involvement in the conflict.""We have reason to believe that the Russians continue to supply financial and military assistance in the form of equipment,"" she said.Mrs Clinton declined to comment on the alleged Israeli strike but voiced fears that the conflict could worsen or spread. More than 60,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began 22 months ago, the UN said.""I personally have been warning for quite some time of the dangers associated with an increasingly lethal civil war and a potential proxy war,"" she said.""Therefore, I think it's incumbent on those nations that have refused to be constructive players to reconsider their positions because the worst kind of predictions of what could happen internally and spilling over the borders of Syria are certainly within the realm of the possible now.""Earlier, the Syria army said Israeli fighter jets had bombed a scientific research centre in Jamraya, near Damascus, killing two people and wounding five.But a US official told the BBC the target had been a convoy carrying SA-17 surface-to-air missiles bound for the Shia militant movement Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon. Meanwhile, some rebel groups said they had targeted the Jamraya centre.The White House did not confirm details of Israel's raid itself, but issued a warning to Syria.""Syria should not further destabilise the region by transferring weaponry to Hezbollah,"" the White House's deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said.There has been increasing concern in Israel that Syria's chemical weapons could fall into Hezbollah's hands. Correspondents say Israel is also worried the Shia militant group could obtain anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, thus strengthening its ability to respond to Israeli air strikes.Wednesday's reported attack came days after Israel moved its Iron Dome defence system to the north of the country."

Like the six other detainees with me, we were whipped 70 times every day.""""We were mostly accused of setting up 'Sahwa' - Awakening Councils - against the state.""Mohammed's horrific tale of torture from Syria might not sound that unusual if the ""state"" his captors' were referring to was the government of President Bashar al-Assad.But they were from the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), an al-Qaeda affiliate that has become an equally feared force in rebel-held areas.Mohammed, an engineer in his early 50s who is the father of four children, joined the peaceful protest movement against Mr Assad when the uprising in Syria began in 2011.When Raqqa province fell under rebel control, he helped set up a local council to provide basic services in the absence of the state.But little did they know that it would not take long for a new dictatorship to replace the one from which they had freed themselves. On 9 July 2013 - the first day of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan - Mohammed and six other members of the council in the border town of Tal Abyad were detained by members of ISIS, who handcuffed and blindfolded them and took them to the city of Raqqa.Over the next 33 days, Mohammed was tortured on a daily basis by the jihadists.But even after his release, Mohammed was not safe. He soon learned that his life was at risk and so fled north by foot to Turkey.He is now staying in Gaziantep, attempting to ensure safe passage for his wife and children so that they can start a new life together, away from Syria.Sitting in a flat in the city that has become home to many other refugees, Mohammed is filled with bitterness as he describes how he believes the revolution in his country has been hijacked by extremist groups that do not represent Syrians.""They are mostly foreigners coming to impose their ideologies on us,"" he says in a low, calm voice.Mohammed is a non-practising Muslim who believes that Syria should continue to be a secular state, and that religion is a private issue. That stance, however, was enough to prompt ISIS to declare that he was a ""kafir"" - a non-believer - who deserved to be punished. The group has used such designations to force out moderates in areas under its control, whether they are local councillors, opposition activists or even fellow rebels.But Mohammed says the jihadists' extremist ideology is not the only reason for doing that. He claims they are working with the government to undermine the rebellion.""[In Raqqa], they have occupied the governor's house and other former Baath Party buildings. But when the city comes under bombardment, only schools, hospitals and residential areas are hit, and not any ISIS-occupied locations,"" he says.Mohammed says ISIS is led by a mixture of Syrian and foreign ""emirs"", and that 11 of the Syrians were detained at Saydnaya military prison in southern Damascus before the uprising began in March 2011. They were released, along with many other Islamists, the next month when President Assad issued a general amnesty, he adds.""The Syrians were practicing on us the same methods of torture they were subjected to in prison,"" Mohammed says. ""But the power lay with the 'shadow' emirs - Iraqis and Tunisians, mainly. They were the ones beheading people and imposing an extremist interpretation of Islam that is not even accepted by religious people in Syria.""""They never pray nor fast, but they force us to do so and they claim they want an Islamic state,"" he adds.Mohammed recalls how two brothers were detained by ISIS fighters in Raqqa and then killed - one was tortured to death; the other shot in the head - simply because they were members of President Assad's minority Alawite sect.""They had been living in Raqqa for years and were part of the revolution,"" he says. ""When different [rebel] brigades captured the town, they obtained documents from them to prove that they were not spies for the regime.""""But those documents - including one from the [al-Qaeda affiliated] al-Nusra Front - didn't protect them from ISIS.""Mohammed also says a heating oil merchant, Abu Wael, was tortured after refusing to sell any at a discounted rate to members of ISIS. He apparently told them that he had agreed a price with their emir, but they demanded it be halved. One night, he was detained and then tortured for six consecutive days.""His shirt was so embedded in his flesh [from the flogging] that I had to push my finger deep into the wounds to pull out the material,"" Mohammed says.""We managed to convince them later to transfer the remainder of his punishment to us, and we received 70 lashes a day to save him from more torture."" A judge at a Sharia court later ruled that Abu Wael had been wrongly detained and punished, and ordered his release. It is not known if he is still alive.But Mohammed has not lost hope. Though he is trying to bring his family to Gaziantep, he is determined to return to Syria eventually.""I have faith in the people, who revolted against tyranny that lasted for 50 years, to revolt against an al-Qaeda import that is not welcome in Syria."""

At least 80 died in a single incident near Rabaa al-Adawiya on 27 July.Mr McCain and Mr Graham arrived in the Egyptian capital on Monday evening for two days of negotiations.Both senators have made several trips to Egypt since the country's revolution in 2011.Before heading to Cairo, Senator Graham warned that the Egyptian military must back out of politics quickly or risk a cut of the $1.3bn (£860m) in aid that it receives from the US each year. In the meantime the Muslim Brotherhood also navigates a difficult path, the BBC's Caroline Wyatt in Cairo reports.Ending the sit-ins could alienate its own grassroots supporters, our correspondent says, while continuing the protests might further alienate the Egyptian public and increase the prospects of a violent end to the demonstrations.Several prominent Brotherhood figures were arrested in a crackdown on the Islamist movement following Mr Morsi's removal, including Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie and Mr Shater. The US state department said a delegation led by Mr Burns had visited Mr Shater to ""prevent further violence, calm tensions and facilitate an inclusive dialogue to help the transition to a democratically elected civilian government"".However, Mr Shater cut the visit short, saying they should instead meet Mr Morsi.According to Brotherhood spokesman Gehad al-Haddad, Mr Shater told the US delegation that he was in ""no position to speak"" and that they should direct their questions to Mr Morsi.He told the diplomats that Mr Morsi held the key to solving the crisis and that there was no alternative to constitutional legitimacy, according to statements on Mr Haddad's Twitter feed.Separately, Mr Haddad told Reuters news agency that the Brotherhood had rejected the diplomats' pleas to ""swallow the reality"" that Mr Morsi would not return as Egypt's president. There had been reports that the new interim government was prepared to release leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood from custody and offer the group ministerial positions if they called an end to the sit-ins, correspondents say.However, a presidential adviser denied such an offer had been made - and Mr Morsi's supporters repeated that they would accept nothing short of his reinstatement.Meanwhile the EU's envoy, Bernardino Leon, met Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi on Monday.The foreign ministers of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are also involved in the diplomatic push.Over the weekend, the government reiterated its call for Morsi supporters to end their sit-ins peacefully.A government helicopter dropped leaflets over the Rabaa al-Adawiya demonstration which pledged that protesters would face no action if they had not committed a crime. The army removed Mr Morsi following huge protests against him. The new government has outlined its own roadmap leading to fresh elections in 2014."

The Most Reverend Justin Welby said the consequences of military action across the Muslim world were unpredictable with the impact on those not directly involved in fighting ""beyond description and horrible"".The Syrian government has blamed opposition fighters for the alleged chemical attack near Damascus on 21 August, in which hundreds of people are reported to have died.In the latest developments:UN weapons inspectors resumed investigations at the site of the attack after a day's delay over security concerns, while UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said the team needed time to do its jobAsian stock markets fell, extending a global sell-off sparked by growing fears of a military strike against SyriaA YouGov poll of nearly 2,000 people suggested 50% were against a missile strike, while 25% were in favourIn analysis: BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus looks at the military options on offer to the WestBBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman looks at whether foreign intervention would be legalThe phone call between Mr Obama and Mr Cameron was the second since the alleged chemical attack.A Downing Street spokesman said the leaders agreed they were ""in no doubt that the Assad regime was responsible"" for the chemical attack.""Regime forces were carrying out a military operation to regain that area from the opposition at the time; and there is no evidence that the opposition has the capability to deliver such a chemical weapons attack,"" he said.The National Security Council includes Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Home Secretary Theresa May and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg among its members, along with military and intelligence chiefs.Meanwhile, the government is expected to publish the Commons motion for debate later, along with details of intelligence linking the Syrian government to the attack.The motion is expected to stress the need for ""appropriate measures"" in response to the use of chemical weapons by any country. Sources said it would not contain ""a timetable for action"" or specific military options. A number of Conservative backbenchers have raised concerns about military intervention in Syria - but it is understood Tory MPs will be told to support the measures.The US has said its forces are ""ready to go"" but former UK military chiefs warned a one-off missile strike could see the UK dragged into deeper action.Admiral Lord West, a former first sea lord, said he was ""extremely nervous"" about any potential military intervention.  The Labour peer said the UK and US should show any evidence of a chemical attack to Russia and China, who have warned against intervention, to back up their case.""Then we need to try and get a security council resolution. If the Russians and Chinese say 'Yes, it is clear it was done by them [the Syrian government]', then they would be in a very difficult position to vote against such a resolution. The most they could do is abstain,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. He said an attack would be ""extremely dangerous"" as it was hard to predict how the regime might respond. ""You can do a surgical strike but you need to be clear what is your whole campaign plan, where do you go from there?"" he said.BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said it was understood military targets had already been chosen and they would probably focus on command centres believed to be involved in the use of chemical weapons.She said cruise missiles could be launched from US ships in the Gulf or the Mediterranean, or Royal Navy vessels including submarine HMS Tireless.Labour leader Ed Miliband said his party would ""consider supporting international action"", but only if it was legal and ""specifically limited to deterring the future use of chemical weapons"".Opposition frontbencher Diane Abbott said she may resign as shadow health minister if Mr Miliband supported intervention.""It's not clear that any such bombing would be legal. It's not at all clear that it would change Assad's evident determination to fight to the last Syrian. And the danger is that we get dragged into a civil war in the Middle East,"" she said.

""It's the long, dark shadow of Iraq,"" he says. ""They got sold a bill of goods before - and it went real bad.""He says Iraq was a mistake but Syria is different. The intelligence on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government's use of chemical weapons is based on ""multiple sources that paint a very clear picture"", he says. For that reason, he believes, the US should do something.He says Americans should draw lessons not from the war in Iraq, but from the Nato military intervention in the Balkans in the 1990s.""Limited air strikes,"" he says. ""And by the way, it worked.""He believes that condemning the use of chemical weapons but declining to do anything about it will embolden Mr Assad and others. He supports the president's plan to launch a military strike on Syria.Representative Tim Walz of Minnesota opposes a military strike, illustrating that support and opposition for US action do not follow party lines.Mr Walz has an unusual perspective: a retired senior non-commissioned officer in the national guard, he has been to Damascus with a congressional delegation - and met Mr Assad.""He was polished and calm,"" says Mr Walz. Mr Walz says Mr Assad is a difficult man to persuade. And he thinks Mr Obama's plan for a military strike is a mistake, and says the US should exhaust all available options before resorting to a military strike.""How is the security of the US and our allies enhanced by this?"" Mr Walz asks. ""And what happens afterwards?"" Mr Walz said he had told his 12-year-old daughter that Mr Assad's use of chemical weapons had killed and wounded children.""She said, 'Our bombs hurt children, too.' She asked, 'Why don't we have a plan to get the children out?'"" He said he feared US military planners were not taking sufficient care to avoid civilian casualties, especially children.""There was a little bit on collateral damage, but it was all antiseptic military-speak,"" he says about a recent briefing. ""I want a better solution"" than an air strike.Senator Christopher Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said: ""Congress has repeatedly condemned and acted to outlaw the use of chemical weapons, and I believe it is in the national security interest of the US to take decisive action to respond to this attack and attempt to deter the future use of chemical weapons, whether in Syria or elsewhere in the world."" Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma said: ""The Administration owes it to Congress and to the American people to lay out how they will fund their military action.""Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying: ""I support the president's decision. But as far as I'm concerned, we should strike in Syria today.""Representative Peter King, a New York Republican, said: ""The president doesn't need 535 members of Congress to enforce his own red line.""Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement: ""I continue to oppose introducing US troops into this conflict, and I continue to believe that seeking congressional approval of military action is called for.""Representative Trey Radel, a Republican from Florida, issued a statement: ""The administration needs to make its case, putting #AmericaFirst. They will also need to answer questions on the national security threat facing America, how we prevent our troops from getting dragged into a civil war and how we are going to prevent the loss of American lives."" Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican from Michigan, was quoted by the New York Times as saying: ""This is really about the credibility of the United States of America standing up for an anti-proliferation and use of chemical and biological weapons.""  Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican, said: ""The President still has yet to articulate a clear objective, what US national interests are at stake, what our strategy will be, and what our contingency plans are for all possible outcomes. I hope these things become more clear as we debate the appropriate course of action in Syria over the coming days."" "

The former investigator said the suspect was held in the year after the embassy bombings - but he was released without charge because of a lack of ""smoking gun evidence"". Mr Liby is said to have then fled the UK. Mr Vaz said: ""This case raises serious questions about the motives behind asylum and national security decisions in the UK.

What has he done? Did he launch a missile and kill someone? Did he rig a bomb and kill someone? No. He is preventing war,"" he told Reuters news agency.Mr Snowden is wanted by the US on charges of leaking secrets he collected while working as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), America's electronic spying agency.On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director James Clapper apologised for telling Congress in March that the NSA did not have a policy of gathering data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.He said in a letter to Dianne Feinstein, head of the Senate intelligence committee, that his answer had been ""clearly erroneous"".Meanwhile, the leaker's father, Lon Snowden, is trying to arrange for his son's return to the US under circumstances that would guarantee him fair treatment and a fair trial. He has expressed concern at Wikileaks' influence over his son's situation.In a letter to his son, given to the BBC, Lon Snowden, along with his lawyer Bruce Fein, praised him for ""summoning the American people to confront the growing danger of tyranny"".The leaking of thousands of classified intelligence documents has led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data.French President Francois Hollande has called for the European Union to take a common stand over allegations, stemming from the leaks, that Washington is spying on its European allies.Wikileaks said most of the asylum requests - including to Russia itself - were handed to the Russian consulate at Sheremetyevo airport late on Sunday for delivery to the relevant embassies in Moscow.Austria, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Spain and Switzerland said the request was invalid because it was not made from their own territory.Brazil's foreign ministry confirmed it had received a request but said that, for the moment, it did not intend to respond.Mr Hollande said France had not yet received a formal request from Mr Snowden.Mr Snowden withdrew his application to Russia after President Putin said he could stay on condition that he stopped damaging Russia's ""American partners"" with his leaks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Mr Peskov confirmed Mr Snowden had not crossed into Russian territory and was still in the transit area of Sheremetyevo, where he has reportedly stayed since arriving from Hong Kong on 23 June.Mr Snowden had previously submitted an application to Ecuador, whose embassy in London is sheltering Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and to Iceland.Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said Quito would not consider Mr Snowden's asylum request unless he managed to enter an Ecuadorean embassy or arrive in Ecuador itself."

The drones can fly around corners and obstacles to identify potential hidden dangers, the Ministry of Defence said.The Norwegian-designed Black Hornet Nano features a tiny camera and relays video and still images to a handheld control terminal.It measures about 10cm by 2.5cm (4in by 1in) and weighs 16g (0.6oz).The MoD, which also operates more than 300 larger-sized unmanned air vehicles in Afghanistan, said the Black Hornet is carried easily on patrol and works in harsh environments and windy conditions.They have been in use in Afghanistan since 2012, a spokeswoman confirmed.Surrey-based Marlborough Communications has a £20m contract with the military to supply and maintain 160 of the drones, which were originally developed by Prox Dynamics for search and rescue operations.Mini drones can be piloted directly or programmed to follow co-ordinates using GPS.Powered by battery, the Black Hornet is reported to have a range of about half a mile (800m), a top speed of 22mph (35kph) and can fly for up to 30 minutes. They can help soldiers on the ground pinpoint hidden Taliban fighters and explosives.Sgt Christopher Petherbridge, of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force in Afghanistan, said:  ""We used it to look for insurgent firing points and check out exposed areas of the ground before crossing, which is a real asset.

5894	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-22980892	News	1	International News	National Security	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	bbc.co.uk	"After years of secret negotiations, an historic breakthrough in talks with the Afghan Taliban almost came unstuck over a flag and a sign. But by the end of Wednesday, and a personal intervention by US Secretary of State John Kerry, the Taliban flag and their sign reading ""The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"" were removed from their new office in the Gulf state of Qatar.After hours of mounting tension, Afghan President Hamid Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi told me the president now ""wanted to get the wheels moving again.""But as much as symbols matter, the substance of any future talks matters far more. Off the record conversations with a number of people involved in the sensitive dialogue that led to this milestone underline continuing uncertainty over what the Taliban leadership is hoping to achieve. ""It's still not clear whether they are interested in sharing power, or just taking power again,"" reflected one source who has been engaged in this process for many years.Another spoke with more cautious optimism about ""frank and productive talks,"" and ""changes in rhetoric"" that suggested new thinking among the Taliban, who enforced a strict and harsh interpretation of Islam during their rule in the 1990s.The row over symbols served to highlight how a movement that once banned television understood the importance of projecting a certain message. For example, the words on the sign, ""The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,"" were those they used to describe their regime that was eventually toppled in 2001. For President Karzai, long suspicious that the Taliban office would be used as base for a ""government in waiting"" to raise its profile and its fund raising, it only confirmed his worst fears about the Taliban, and his ally, the United States.On Wednesday, he suddenly suspended bilateral security talks with the US, and called off a planned trip to Qatar by his negotiating body, the High Peace Council.""President Obama had given us written assurances this would not happen,"" explained Aimal Faizi. He also pointed out that there had been more than a month of intense discussions, in person and over the telephone, between senior Afghan and American officials to ensure misunderstandings did not arise this time.Not long before the announcement, President Obama himself called the Afghan leader to ensure he was fully informed of the expected breakthrough.On more than one occasion in the past, President Karzai has scuppered imminent deals, accusing the US and other countries of trying to undermine his authority and his country's sovereignty. Some Western officials, with barely concealed frustration, often dismiss what they see as a prickly paranoia. But in this latest upset, the president's anger seemed justified. In recent months, the Afghan leader has also been invited to Doha, as well as the Norwegian capital Oslo, to discuss ongoing negotiations. The ribbon cutting ceremony at the office on Tuesday came after months of renewed effort involving key roles for Norwegian and British envoys, as well as Qatari officials and Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) agency. German diplomats played a vital a role at earlier stages of the protracted process. One source said the ISI, which is known to exercise influence over many Taliban commanders, ""did what it had to do"" to get the talks moving again in Doha.After months of silence that followed the Taliban suspension of negotiations with the US in March 2012, a new push was made at the end of last year to revive an initiative that has been in the making since 2011.Western diplomats also pressured Qatar to make more of an effort to encourage those Taliban who settled in Doha some time ago - at Qatari expense - to return to negotiations about an office. Diplomats also wielded the UN sanctions list to highlight how some of the Taliban travelling freely were actually still on a black list.But the US also held out sweeteners too. After insisting since the start on what one American diplomat conceded was an ""unrealistic demand"" for an explicit statement from the Taliban, Washington dropped its pre-conditions which required a written commitment to renounce terrorism and links to Al Qaeda, accept the Afghan constitution, and agree to talk to the Afghan government. Instead, the Taliban spoke of not allowing their soil to be used to threaten other countries, and expressed a commitment to try to find a ""peaceful solution to the occupation.""One source engaged in talks said the demand for direct talks with the Afghan government ""has been a sticking point all the way through.""  He said: ""We think they will agree on this but it is difficult for them to spell it out.""Another problem for the negotiators has been to establish whether their main interlocutor, Tayeb Agha, still had the authority conferred on him by the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Reports last year spoke of power struggles within the Taliban's political office, and Tayeb Agha was reported to have been sidelined. But sources say he is playing a central role again. Recent talks, which have not included direct American participation, are also said to have involved wide ranging discussions on issues including the constitution, human rights, the role of women. ""We definitely did not agree on everything,"" said one Western official who also highlighted that there are still more hard-line elements outside this process.American officials say they expect the Taliban's first goal, when direct talks resume shortly with the US, will be to obtain the release of five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. In exchange, they are to free the only US soldier believed to be in captivity, Bowe Bergdahl. It is understood he is being held by the group known as the Haqqani network, whose representatives have also been involved in negotiations.But this issue is already stuck in the tangled web of US politics. When talks took place in 2012, headed by the then US Special Representative Marc Grossman, leading Republican senators balked at releasing the Afghans.  The Pentagon is said to be still opposed while President Obama backs a deal.Significant questions and concerns still hang over a tortuous process that will sit alongside continuing bombings and military battles on the ground.  But for the moment, there is a long awaited window to open a channel of negotiations that will, at the least, give departing US-led Nato troops some political cover as they prepare to pull out most of their troops.But that window will only remain open so long as President Karzai, and other key players, do not do everything in their power to shut the door of the office if it seems to be moving in the wrong direction."

Washington wants him extradited for leaking details of surveillance programmes.Mr Peskov did not specify what the nature of the talks between the agencies was.  He did, however, remind reporters that President Vladimir Putin had expressed a strong determination not to allow the case to interfere with US-Russian relations. Mr Putin had not taken part in any discussions with the American authorities over Mr Snowden case, Mr Peskov said.Mr Snowden ""has not made any request that would require examination by the head of state"", Mr Peskov added.The Russian president has refused to hand him to the American authorities, but said he could stay in Russia only if he stopped leaking US secrets.Mr Snowden, whose passport has been cancelled by the US, has been in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since arriving from Hong Kong on 23 June.His father, Lon Snowden, said on Friday he believes his son should stay in Russia and avoid the US, saying he had been vilified by the Obama administration and members of Congress.""If it were me, knowing what I know now, and listening to advice of sage people like [Pentagon Papers leaker] Daniel Ellsberg... I would attempt to find a safe haven,"" the elder Snowden told the Associated Press news agency in a telephone interview.On Thursday Mr Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena denied earlier reports that Edward Snowden had been given Russian travel documents.Mr Snowden has requested temporary asylum in Russia, and said recently his favoured final destination was Latin America.In a letter to Russian Justice Minister Alexander Konovalov, Mr Holder said that the charges against Mr Snowden were not punishable by death.If additional charges were brought which could incur capital punishment, the US would not seek to impose such a penalty, he added. The Snowden affair has caused diplomatic ructions around the world, upsetting close US allies and traditional enemies.Leaks by the former CIA worker have led to revelations that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is collecting Americans' phone records.On Wednesday evening, an attempt to block funding for the programme narrowly failed in a 205-217 vote in the US House of Representatives.The White House had lobbied Congress to support the surveillance. Opponents of the US, including Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua, have all offered Mr Snowden asylum."

Mr Karzai and Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani discussed ""issues of mutual interest"" in Doha, the state-run QNA news agency said. It gave no details.The opening of a Taliban office is seen as a step in formalising a channel for talks between Kabul and the  militants. US-led Western troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014.The Taliban itself has so far refused to talk to Mr Karzai, describing him as an American puppet, although it did hold inconclusive discussions with US officials last year. Last month, President Karzai issued an order banning Afghan security forces from calling in foreign air strikes in residential areas, because of heightened tensions about the extent of civilian casualties.Mr Karzai's office said the talks in Qatar would focus on bilateral co-operation and on Afghanistan's peace process. Before the meeting began, officials had said the possibility of a Taliban political office in Doha was likely to be raised.Mr Karzai and Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said last month that they would work towards a peace deal for Afghanistan within six months.""The opening of the Taliban office in Qatar is not related to Karzai, it is a matter between the Taliban and the Qatar government,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the Agence France-Presse news agency.""Our representatives who are already in Qatar won't see or talk to him.""As the Afghan president's two-day visit began on Saturday, there were reports that two children and nine suspected Taliban militants had been killed in an air strike by international forces close to the south-eastern city of Ghazni.A Nato spokesman quoted by Reuters news agency said an Afghan police patrol had come under attack and had called in a helicopter for support.QNA reported later on Sunday that Mr Karzai had left Qatar."

If the Syrians quickly backed down, that could let President Obama off the hook for a vote that is going to be very tricky for him.But if this is choreography, then there are some startlingly good actors in the White House and at the US Department of State, who appear less than impressed.At State, they sounded very cynical about the Russian plan: ""Picking up this ball and turning it into something it was never intended to be is an example, quite frankly, we think, of yet another stalling tactic.""  The White House say they will ""look hard"" at the idea but note Mr Assad's track record doesn't suggest he can be trusted. They argue that only their threat of force has brought this response, so it makes the case for a ""yes"" vote.They have a point, but I suspect many more in Congress - who don't want action anyway - will feel this glimmer of hope is another reason to vote ""no"".If the White House has based its whole case on common sense, then there is nothing more common sense than putting chemical weapons beyond use. It will make other countries even more keen on the UN route.It is a distraction from the big sell, another question to divert President Obama from making a straight case. If action is delayed, it will annoy those senators who want a grander action aimed at regime change, even if that is now called ""degrading assets"". It raises even more memories of Iraq - the ability of regimes to play games with weapons inspectors and for the US to use that as a reason for action. Mr Kerry was ""thinking aloud"" the other day when he envisaged some circumstances where there could be boots on the ground. This is being called ""a rhetorical statement"" by his staff. I dislike politicians being forced to speak in confined straight lines, but you can see why their communications directors may not feel the same.Many in the world may regard this as a hopeful day. I suspect that is not the mood in the White House. "

""Both sides are going to have to think anew.""About 500,000 Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since the 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.Mr Obama began his third and final day in Israel by travelling to the grave of Theodore Herzl, who died in 1904 before his dream of a Jewish homeland was realised.Accompanied by Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he laid a wreath and placed a small rock on the headstone, a Jewish custom.""It is humbling and inspiring to visit and remember the visionary who began the remarkable establishment of the State of Israel,'' he wrote in the visitors' book. ""May our two countries possess the same vision and will to secure peace and prosperity for future generations.''Mr Obama then walked to the grave of Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a right-wing extremist after a peace rally in support of the Oslo Accords in 1995.He again laid a wreath and placed a rock on the headstone, and reportedly told Rabin's children and grandchildren that he had been ""a great man"", adding: ""Sometimes it is harder to embark on peace than to embark on war.""Mr Obama later visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, which he said illustrated the depravity to which man could sink but also served as a reminder of the ""righteous among nations who refused to be bystanders"".""The state of Israel does not exist because of the Holocaust, but with the survival of a strong Jewish state of Israel, such a holocaust will never happen again,"" he added.A sandstorm later grounded the president's helicopter, forcing him to travel from Jerusalem to Bethlehem by road following a brief lunch meeting with Mr Netanyahu.The motorcade's route took Mr Obama through Israel's controversial West Bank barrier, Israeli security sources said. Israel says the barrier is the only way to defend against militant attacks, but Palestinians view the structure as the prelude to the annexation of occupied land.Mr Obama was accompanied on his visit of the Church of the Nativity by President Abbas. Inside, he examined ornate gold icons as a priest read a blessing, according to the AFP news agency.The church was originally built in 399 above a cave traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus and rebuilt after fire in the 6th Century. It is among the holiest sites in Christianity.Later, Mr Obama travelled by road to Tel Aviv before flying on Air Force One to the Jordanian capital Amman, where he will dine with King Abdullah.The two leaders are expected to discuss Jordan's struggle to cope with the influx of more than 350,000 refugees from Syria, the stalled Middle East peace process, and efforts at political reform in the kingdom.Shortly before his departure from Israel, the White House released a statement saying Mr Netanyahu had spoken by telephone to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in an attempt to repair relations.""I am hopeful that today's exchange between the two leaders will enable them to engage in deeper co-operation on this and a range of other challenges and opportunities,"" Mr Obama said."

They have already been warned to expect ""significant"" time in jail.Five of the six would-be attackers were caught by chance when traffic police stopped their uninsured car  - after they had turned back to head home because the EDL rally in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire had finished early. Police who later searched the car found it contained weapons, an 18in nail bomb and a partially-assembled pipe bomb. The men had also printed a leaflet described in court as ""chilling"" which called the Queen a ""female devil"" and  outlined their motivation for the attack.The message said they planned to kill EDL members in retaliation for their ""blasphemy"", although in pre-sentence statements the men said they intended only to cause minor injuries and frighten them.The Old Bailey heard the planned attack could have had repercussions for community relations that would have been still reverberating today. Had it gone ahead it would have been ""bound to draw a response in revenge from its target and those who sympathise with the EDL"", prosecutor Bobbie Cheema QC told the court, adding it ""would most likely led to a tit-for-tat spiral of violence and terror"". Police and security services had no intelligence about the planned attack, although one of the plotters, Jewel Uddin, was under surveillance in relation to another terror plan.He was an associate of another group of Birmingham-based Islamists who were jailed after planning their own terror attack.Uddin was under partial counter-terrorism surveillance and, five days before the aborted EDL attack, was seen by a surveillance officer with fellow plotter Omar Khan buying some of the knives eventually found in the car boot.A second member of the group, Ahmed, had been separately charged with possession of jihadist magazines that included bomb-making instructions. He was on bail at the time of the failed bombing. Five of the men were from Birmingham - Uddin, 27, Khan, 28, Ahmed, 22, Hasseen, 23 and Hussain, 24. One, Saud, 22, was from nearby Smethwick.Prosecutors said Hasseen, who was not in the car on the day the other men were stopped, was the most ""ideologically committed"" of the group.He was found to have 859 files containing extreme material.The Old Bailey heard that the men met the day before the botched attack at an Islamic fitness centre in Birmingham where Hussain worked and five of the six were members.There was a large police presence outside court as around 40 EDL supporters gathered for the start of the sentencing.EDL leader Tommy Robinson, who claimed he was the target of the attack, briefly appeared in the public gallery with deputy Kevin Carroll before leaving to join other supporters in a nearby pub, BBC correspondent Dominic Casciani said.The sentencing comes as police investigate the destruction of a Somali community centre in north London which was daubed with graffiti saying ""EDL"" and destroyed by fire.Counter-terrorism police are investigating the blaze which follows a reported rise in attacks against Muslims since the killing of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last month.The EDL have held a series of protests since Drummer Rigby's death, including one near his barracks on the night he was killed.

In a speech to a veterans' group in Houston, Mr Biden said that ""those who use chemical weapons against defenceless men, women, and children... must be held accountable"".French President Francois Hollande said France was ""ready to punish"" whoever was behind the attack, and had decided to increase military support for Syria's main opposition. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says the US, UK and France will now have the larger task of building as wide a coalition as possible to support limited military action.Meanwhile the Arab League said it held Syrian President Bashar al-Assad responsible for the attacks and called for UN action.Syrian opposition sources have said they have been told to expect a Western intervention in the conflict imminently.""There is no precise timing... but one can speak of an imminent international intervention against the regime. It's a question of days and not weeks,"" AFP news agency quoted Syrian National Coalition official Ahmad Ramadan as saying.""There have been meetings between the Coalition, the [rebel] Free Syrian Army and allied countries during which possible targets have been discussed.""Russia and China, allies of the Syrian government, have stepped up their warnings against military intervention, with Moscow saying any such action would have ""catastrophic consequences"" for the region.Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has said he rejects ""utterly and completely"" claims that Syrian forces used chemical weapons, and his government has blamed rebel fighters. On Monday, United Nations weapons inspectors were fired on while investigating one of the five alleged chemical weapons attack sites around Damascus.Mr Hagel said the US Department of Defense had provided President Obama with ""all options for all contingencies"".""He has seen them, we are prepared,"" he told the BBC's Jon Sopel, adding: ""We are ready to go.""Mr Hagel said that intelligence currently being gathered by the UN inspectors would confirm that the Syrian government was responsible for the chemical attack last week.""I think it's pretty clear that chemical weapons were used against people in Syria,"" he said. Our correspondent says Mr Hagel left little doubt that he believed the Assad government was responsible, and was ready to execute the orders of his commander-in-chief.White House spokesman Jay Carney later said that a separate report on chemical weapons use being compiled by the US intelligence community would be published this week.Mr Carney said that Mr Obama had a variety of options and was not limited to the use of force, adding that it was not Washington's intention to remove Mr Assad.""The options we are considering are not about regime change,"" he said.Meanwhile, warnings have been issued on sites linked to Islamist militants fighting for the rebels in Syria, saying that their leaders and training camps might also be targeted by a possible US-led attack, says BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher. Several online sites linked to the Nusra Front and similar groups have advised militants not to hold meetings or gather in large numbers, and to change routines and locations, he says. Western powers have made clear their distrust and dislike of groups like the Nusra Front, which have spearheaded rebel victories, although there has been no indication from the US or anyone else that jihadists would be targeted, he adds. The UN says more than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began more than two years ago. The conflict has produced more than 1.7 million registered refugees.Earlier on Tuesday, a Russian transport plane landed in the Syrian city of Latakia with a cargo of humanitarian aid.The aircraft later left with dozens of Russian citizens on board, an official spokeswoman for the Russian Emergencies Ministry, Irina Rossius, told Russian news agencies. The flight was intended to evacuate Russians who wanted to leave Syria, she added."

Secretary of State John Kerry said that by using chemical weapons against his own population, Bashar al-Assad had joined a list including Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein.A few weeks later, Mr Kerry was praising Damascus for co-operating with an ambitious international agreement to rid Syria of its chemical weapons, while still saying Mr Assad had to go.At the same time, reports from across the country started to focus more and more on the violence perpetrated by the Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), hardline Islamic radicals linked to al-Qaeda. As the year draws to a close, and the West's chosen allies in Syria suffer one setback after another, have policymakers started to ponder the unthinkable - that there's more to be gained from working with Mr Assad than against him?It's not a thought being openly voiced by the US State Department or the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but a week ago the highly respected former US diplomat Ryan Crocker told the New York Times that it was time ""to start talking to the Assad regime again"".""As bad as he is,"" Mr Crocker said, ""he is not as bad as the jihadis who would take over in his absence.""The former ambassador to both Iraq and Syria made it clear he was talking about a dialogue over specific issues and said it would have to be done ""very, very quietly"".But other observers go further.""Someone has got to bite the bullet and say Assad stays,"" says Prof Joshua Landis, Director of the Centre of Middle Eastern Studies at Oklahoma University whose views are frequently sought by policy makers in Washington. ""We don't have another game in town.""Prof Landis has consistently opposed arming Syria's rebels, a policy which he says ""blew up in our face."" He doesn't think tentative contacts with the Islamic Front, a recently formed coalition of Islamist groups not aligned with al-Qaeda, are likely to yield better results. Ambassador Crocker may be speaking for himself, Prof Landis says, but he knows what the state department is thinking.US lawmakers are voicing their own concerns.Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has spoken about his anxiety over an unprecedented pooling of al-Qaeda fighters in Syria.""We don't have a good operation to vet rebels on the ground,"" he told a conference at Johns Hopkins University last week. ""This is a recipe for disaster.""Against this backdrop, President Assad starts to look indispensable again. A man who can deliver up his country's chemical weapons and, perhaps, take on and defeat the hardliners of the Nusra Front and ISIS.Progress on the first objective - dealing with Syria's chemical stockpile - has been encouraging but may be stalling. It seems fairly clear that the 31 December deadline for removal of the most toxic material won't be met. The Syrian army claimed to have taken control of the last contested stretch of the key Damascus-Homs highway earlier this week, but says it needs additional heavy equipment to ensure that convoys reach the Mediterranean port of Latakia.Put simply, the success of this critical phase of the deal depends almost entirely on the Syrian government's ability to control events on the ground.In the long run, the second objective - dealing with Islamist hardliners - is likely to prove even more crucial. On the face of it, this also suggests a convergence of interest with the Assad government, which has long talked about this as the real danger. But Syria's leaders have always been disingenuous, sounding alarm bells long before al-Qaeda was a genuine threat in Syria and conspicuously failing to take on al-Nusra and ISIS when they finally appeared on the scene.Critics of the Obama administration say nothing good can come of seeking President Assad's help.""We've made Assad our partner, rather than seeing him as the problem,"" says Kurt Volker, the former US ambassador to Nato.But for all his apparent indispensability, the West is clearly unwilling to rely too heavily on a leader with so much blood on his hands. ""It's very difficult for people to go there,"" says Daniel Levy of the European Council on Foreign Relations, who believes that the limits of the West's reliance on Bashar al-Assad have already been reached. ""The US is already having an uphill struggle with the Saudis over Iran,"" he says, referring to the recent interim deal over Tehran's nuclear programme. ""It's unlikely to want to pick another fight by saying, Assad's the man.""President Assad may never be ""the man"" again, as he briefly was in the wake of the invasion of Iraq. But his recent success on the battlefield, combined with the West's urgent need to secure his chemical weapons and stem the tide of jihadism means we are going to be dealing with him, one way or another, for a while.

What has he done? Did he launch a missile and kill someone? Did he rig a bomb and kill someone? No. He is preventing war,"" he told Reuters news agency.Mr Snowden is wanted by the US on charges of leaking secrets he collected while working as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), America's electronic spying agency.On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director James Clapper apologised for telling Congress in March that the NSA did not have a policy of gathering data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.He said in a letter to Dianne Feinstein, head of the Senate intelligence committee, that his answer had been ""clearly erroneous"".Meanwhile, the leaker's father, Lon Snowden, is trying to arrange for his son's return to the US under circumstances that would guarantee him fair treatment and a fair trial. He has expressed concern at Wikileaks' influence over his son's situation.In a letter to his son, given to the BBC, Lon Snowden, along with his lawyer Bruce Fein, praised him for ""summoning the American people to confront the growing danger of tyranny"".The leaking of thousands of classified intelligence documents has led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data.French President Francois Hollande has called for the European Union to take a common stand over allegations, stemming from the leaks, that Washington is spying on its European allies.Wikileaks said most of the asylum requests - including to Russia itself - were handed to the Russian consulate at Sheremetyevo airport late on Sunday for delivery to the relevant embassies in Moscow.Austria, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Spain and Switzerland said the request was invalid because it was not made from their own territory.Brazil's foreign ministry confirmed it had received a request but said that, for the moment, it did not intend to respond.Mr Hollande said France had not yet received a formal request from Mr Snowden.Mr Snowden withdrew his application to Russia after President Putin said he could stay on condition that he stopped damaging Russia's ""American partners"" with his leaks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Mr Peskov confirmed Mr Snowden had not crossed into Russian territory and was still in the transit area of Sheremetyevo, where he has reportedly stayed since arriving from Hong Kong on 23 June.Mr Snowden had previously submitted an application to Ecuador, whose embassy in London is sheltering Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and to Iceland.Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said Quito would not consider Mr Snowden's asylum request unless he managed to enter an Ecuadorean embassy or arrive in Ecuador itself."

Our alliance is eternal. It is forever."" Mr Netanyahu thanked Mr Obama for ""unequivocally affirming Israel's sovereign right to defend itself by itself against any threat"". Mr Obama later visited Mr Peres at his official residence where, in a joint news conference, the Israeli president said the two nations were united by a common vision - to confront dangers and bring peace.Mr Peres said he trusted the US in its policy of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. President Obama said he had reassured Mr Peres ""that in this work Israel will have no greater friend than the United States"".Mr Obama then went on to talks with Mr Netanyahu, with whom he has had a notoriously frosty relationship. The main purpose of this trip is rebuild bridges and improving relationships which could give him more leverage over the new Israeli government, the BBC North America editor Mark Mardell reports.The leaders' initial warm, if scripted, exchanges were a step towards doing that, our correspondent adds.At home, Mr Obama has been criticised for not having visited Israel in his first term as president, with some saying it shows he is not close enough to the country. And one recent Israeli opinion poll suggested a mere 10% of the public had a favourable opinion of the US president. On Thursday, Mr Obama will make a speech to Israeli university students, and travel to the West Bank to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.Security for the visit is tight, with thousands of Israeli and Palestinian security officers on duty in Jerusalem and the Palestinians' de facto capital in the West Bank city of Ramallah.Both Israeli and Palestinian groups have staged protests in the run-up to Mr Obama's visit.Some 200 activists pitched tents in the area known as E1, a stretch of land in East Jerusalem on which Israel controversially plans to build new houses.

Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the visit was ""ominous"" and unwelcome, and that its consequences would be negative.""It gives legitimacy to the occupation and confirms the political support of the United States [to Israel],"" AP quoted him as saying.Meanwhile, Israelis have been staging protests in Jerusalem demanding Mr Obama free Jonathan Pollard, imprisoned in the US in 1987 for spying for Israel."

We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise,"" he said. On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akhbar Salehi welcomed the offer, saying Iran had no ""red lines"".""But we have to make sure... that the other side comes with authentic intentions with a fair and real intention to resolve the issue,"" he said.The minister said Iran would take the offer into ""serious consideration"", but the US had to desist from the ""threatening rhetoric that everything is on the table"".Iran's supreme leader, however, said negotiations with the US ""would solve nothing"".""You are pointing a gun at Iran saying you want to talk. The Iranian nation will not be frightened by the threats,"" he said.President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has several times announced he was ready for direct talks with the US.But Ayatollah Khamenei's advisers have criticised the president for making such a ""submissive"" offer, says the BBC's Bozorgmehr Sharafedin.The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has repeatedly accused Iran of not co-operating fully.In its last report in November 2012, the agency expressed particular concern about activities at a facility in Parchin, just 20km (13 miles) from Tehran.The agency wanted to investigate claims that Iran had built an explosive-containment vessel to conduct experiments there, saying such experiments ""would be strong indicators of possible nuclear weapon development"".But Iran refused to give inspectors permission to visit the site.Iran's repeated failure to ease international concerns has led to a gradual tightening of economic and political sanctions.  Analysts say Iran's economy is being hobbled. Its currency, the rial, has seen its value plunge, and vital medicines are said to be in short supply."

CIA drone strikes have killed up to 3,460 people in Pakistan since 2004.Most strikes take place in the troubled border region of North Waziristan, which is regarded as an al-Qaeda and Taliban stronghold.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who won elections in May, met Mr Kerry on Thursday. Mr Sharif has consistently demanded an end to such attacks, saying they violate Pakistan's sovereignty.His foreign affairs adviser, Sartaj Aziz, told reporters the US should stop the strikes ""not just curtail them"".Correspondents say the issue is complicated by the fact that some Pakistani officials have been accused of criticising the use of drones in public while co-operating with them in private.""I think the programme will end as we have eliminated most of the threat and continue to eliminate it,"" Mr Kerry said in a television interview.""The president has a very real timeline and we hope it's going to be very, very soon,"" he said when asked whether the US had a schedule for ending the strikes.Analysts say his comments went further than those of President Barack Obama, who said in a 23 May speech that drone strikes would decrease in ""the Afghan war theatre"" as US troops withdraw by the end of 2014.The number of strikes has fallen significantly over the past 30 months - totalling 17 so far this year compared to 48 in all of 2012 and 73 in 2011, according to estimates compiled by the New America Foundation.Speaking after meeting Mr Sharif on Thursday, Mr Kerry said their talks were ""constructive"" and ""positive"".

6008	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22368336	News	1	International News	National Security	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	The roadside bomb killed thousands in Afghanistan last year, stifled the economy and created a climate of fear - yet its capacity to wreak destruction and havoc only seems to be increasing.The exact toll is difficult to calculate but the interior ministry says the majority of 1,800 Afghan national police killed last year, died as a result of roadside bombs.In addition, about 900 Afghan National Army soldiers were killed by roadside bombs - averaging three soldiers a day, according to General Zahir Azimi, spokesman for the defence ministry.Over the last two years, the insurgents' focus on roadside bombs - also known as improvised explosive devices (IEDs) - has gained momentum.They no longer want to take on Afghan and Nato forces face-to-face, says Haji Abdul Mutalib, district governor of Marjah in Helmand province. Instead, they are packing TNT and plastic explosives - as well as metal and ball bearings - into their bombs to make them more powerful and more destructive, he says.Due to increased investment by al-Qaeda, a growing number of Afghan insurgents now have the expertise to make such bombs.But they are also outsourcing the job of bomb-making and planting the devices to young jobless men, according to intelligence sources in the south. And every target has a price - whether a police officer or a district governor.The growth in bomb use has also had the unlikely impact of straining relations with Pakistan. The Afghan government complains the fertiliser used in bomb-making comes from Pakistani factories.The structure of the bombs is basic but very effective, and difficult to detect.Last month in Kandahar province, more than 1,000 roadside bombs were found in the Panjwai district. And, according to the regional police chief Abdul Raziq, there are thousands more.Almost daily, Afghan forces are focused on finding and defusing these bombs. It is not unusual for them to be tipped off by farmers, shopkeepers, butchers or villagers who might find one under a bridge or in a field. By laying bombs where ordinary people live and work, insurgents have ensured roadside bombs remain the biggest killer of civilians in Afghanistan.Over the last year, entire families travelling together in a van, perhaps to a wedding, funeral or picnic, have been blown up, leaving 15 or so men, women and children dead.The devices, often detonated through mobile phones or timers, may be powerful but they are not accurate.The tactical advantages of roadside bombs are many.They allow insurgents to block the country's main arteries, cutting off areas and causing serious food and medicine shortages.One road, on the borders of the remote provinces of Daykundi and Uruzgan, usually used by thousands of people, has been closed for five weeks. Insurgents have lined it with bombs to stop people travelling and supplies being delivered.In other instances, construction projects have been cancelled.And, in rural Afghanistan, these bombs have stopped children attending school, and at worst, killed some.They are also laid on routes that insurgents know will be used by Afghan forces about to carry out operations or make arrests.Stopping the spread of these bombs is proving hard. Without helicopters, the local and national police are the most vulnerable.The Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) use drones to detect insurgents, and security cameras on blimps are an aid, but the Afghan government does not have the same capability.However, together with Nato, the government is targeting the Taliban commanders responsible - a side of the story that often goes unreported.Earlier on Wednesday, in the same district in Helmand where three British soldiers were killed on Tuesday, a roadside bomb killed the head of the High Peace Council for Helmand Province, Raees Malim Shah, and two policemen. They had gone to carry out an assessment of the security situation. Now, it means Afghan officials will no longer be able to go to that area.The roadside bomb has, without doubt, been one of the deadliest weapons in this war, and it remains so.

The country has been the target of four rounds of UN sanctions and numerous UN Security Council resolutions calling on it to cease enrichment work amid fears it aims to develop nuclear weapons.Iran has refused to obey, saying it intends to enrich only for power station fuel or other peaceful purposes.

The material broadcast on Iranian state television purports to show a US base and the Afghan city of Kandahar. It is not clear if the footage is genuine.Last year Iran said it was building a copy of the drone - an RQ-170 Sentinel - after breaking its encryption codes. Iran has repeatedly accused the US of spying activity amid continuing tension over its nuclear programme.  ""By decoding data extracted from the drone, we found out that the aircraft  had conducted many flights in Iran's neighbouring countries,"" Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh of Iran's Revolutionary Guard said in the broadcast. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says that if the Iranians have really managed to break into the systems of the pilotless aircraft, this would suggest a level of sophistication that may worry the US. American officials have previously cast doubt on Iran's ability to extract useful intelligence from the captured spy plane, and have said that reverse-engineering a copy would be beyond Iran's technological capability.The RQ-170 Sentinel is an advanced high-altitude surveillance drone used by both the US Air Force and the CIA. It does not carry weapons. Its capture in 2011 was hailed by Iran as a demonstration of its military and technological prowess. The US confirmed that a drone had gone missing on the border between Iran and Afghanistan and asked for its return, but Iran refused. Iran said it had brought the drone down using electronic warfare after it entered Iranian airspace; Washington said the aircraft malfunctioned. Iran and the US are engaged in a tense confrontation over Iran's nuclear programme, which Washington and its allies say is aimed at developing nuclear weapons. Iran denies this, and accuses the US of hostile intent in cooperation with Israel. Last December Iran said it had captured another, less sophisticated drone, but the US denied any such aircraft was missing. "

Frozen oil sale assets will be transferred in instalments, bringing in some $4.2bn (£2.6bn) of extra revenueIran's negotiators were welcomed at Tehran's Mehrabad airport by hundreds of cheering supporters carrying flowers and flags.The agreement with Iran - the world's fourth-largest oil producer - prompted a fall in oil prices in early Asian trading with Brent crude falling by more than 2%.Although Iran will not be allowed to increase its oil sales for six months, analysts say the deal is perceived by the markets as reducing risk in the Middle East. In a nationwide broadcast on Sunday, President Hassan Rouhani repeated that his country would never seek nuclear weapons.Mr Rouhani - regarded as a relative moderate - took office in August replacing the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.The deal has also been backed by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in nuclear matters."

6078	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23867327	News	1	International News	National Security	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	All the signs point to the US preparing for a military strike against Syria within days. Why else summon our MPs to return tomorrow when they were due to be back on Monday? All the signs are that the UK government will back the strike and British forces will play some limited role in it. Ten years after Iraq, what is remarkable is the apparent degree of consensus between the three main party leaders. When they met yesterday Messrs Cameron, Clegg and Miliband agreed that the use of chemical weapons could not be ignored; that military action could be justified in order to deter a repeat, provided that it was limited, did not trigger wider involvement in Syria's civil war and was legal. This, despite the fact that both Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband owe their position, at least in part, to their opposition to the war in Iraq. However, the public appear to remain deeply affected by what happened a decade ago.The latest YouGov poll shows opposition to military strikes running at two to one. Indeed, there is wide opposition to doing anything at all.*This may be being fuelled by the warnings of senior figures in all parties as well as former military men who are questioning whether there is any such thing as a limited military intervention or one that does not suck the western powers deeper into the Syrian crisis. Even though there is no debate between the party leaders about whether in principle to attack Syria, the questions of when, what and how could still divide them and deny David Cameron the parliamentary majority he needs tomorrow. When the Labour leader spoke on camera yesterday he did not talk about the need to involve the UN.In part, perhaps, because Ed Miliband knows as well as anyone else that Russia has consistently vetoed any resolution that criticises its Syrian allies. However, this morning Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, has been stressing the need, not just for the involvement of the UN Security Council, but for them to see the evidence of the UN weapons inspectors - something which may take a long time. The US government has dismissed the need to wait. They argue that the inspections may be worthless not only because days have elapsed since chemical weapons were used but also because the UN is not expected to report on which side may have used them. Nevertheless, Labour are toying with the possibility of tabling an amendment to the government's resolution which would back action but call for a delay until the UN's processes have been gone through.In the past few minutes they have also called on the government to publish the legal basis on which it is acting before tomorrow's Parliamentary vote. The Lib Dems would be very uncomfortable if Labour were able to position themselves as the more internationalist party. Pressure would grow on Nick Clegg to take the same position.With the potential support of Tory and Lib Dem rebels plus the Scots and Welsh Nationalists, Labour could put the government's majority in peril. Thus, what is said in the next 24 hours in Westminster, in Washington and at the UN in New York will really matter. Many MPs will only decide how to vote once they have heard the evidence of the Assad regime's involvement, the legal basis for an attack, the UN process to be followed and the timing of any military action. A decade on from Iraq, a British prime minister finds himself under pressure thanks to the desire of an American president for swift military action. What an irony that this time around it is a president from the left and a prime minister from the right. MPs on all sides find themselves considering not just the merits of reacting to the use of chemical weapons; not just their view of our interests in the Syrian conflict; not just their trust in the Obama and Cameron governments. They are also wrestling with what they and their parties did or did not do over Iraq.* Admittedly the questions were asked before any leader had made the case for action

""I've long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  ""And that's why... I will seek authorisation for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress,"" he said.Later on Saturday, Mr Obama sent a ""draft legislation"" to the two Congress leaders - the speaker of the House of Representatives and the president of the Senate. The legislation says the objective of a US military response would be to ""deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade'' the Syrian government's ability to use chemical weapons.Senior White House officials told the BBC that Mr Obama's decision to seek congressional approval was made by the president on Friday afternoon. It had not been planned until then.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said the vote on the proposal would take place no later than the week of 9 September.The BBC's Katy Watson in Washington says it is unclear is what action he would take if Congress votes against involvement.The president's decision to turn to Congress was seen as a direct reaction to the UK government's defeat in Parliament on supporting any military action in Syria if it were backed by evidence from UN inspectors.After the White House announcement, UK Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""I understand and support Barack Obama's position"".Mr Obama did not speak to Mr Cameron before his statement but did call President Hollande, the White House said.France has also backed military action, and its parliament is due to reconvene on Wednesday for a debate.Opposition members have urged President Francois Hollande to seek a formal vote before joining Washington in any military operation, but correspondents say this is unlikely.Also on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin challenged the US to present to the UN evidence that Syria had attacked rebels with chemical weapons. Russia - a key ally of Syria - has previously warned that ""unilateral military action bypassing the UN Security Council"" would be a ""direct violation of international law"".Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said his country will defend itself against any Western ""aggression"".Forces which could be used against Syria:•Four US destroyers - USS Gravely, USS Ramage, USS Barry and USS Mahan - are in the eastern Mediterranean, equipped with cruise missiles. The missiles can also be fired from submarines, but the US Navy does not reveal their locations•Airbases at Incirlik and Izmir in Turkey, and in Jordan, could be used to carry out strikes•Two aircraft carriers - USS Nimitz and USS Harry S Truman are in the wider region•French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is currently in Toulon in the western Mediterranean•French Rafale and Mirage aircraft can also operate from Al-Dhahra airbase in the UAE"

They were based on information leaked by former US intelligence analyst Mr Snowden.In written submissions before the judges, Steven Kovats QC, representing Home Secretary Theresa May, said the ""disclosure of all the material stolen by Mr Snowden would be gravely damaging to the national security of the United Kingdom"".He said such disclosure would ""endanger lives"" and added that the home secretary ""pursuant to her duty to protect national security, had a duty to act against that risk"".Mr Kovats said Mrs May's national security duty to find out the nature of Mr Miranda's activity was ""consistent"" with the police's use of Schedule 7.The home secretary submitted that publishing material obtained by Mr Snowden was capable of being an act of terrorism, the QC added.Therefore ""seeking to establish the nature of the claimant's activity"" met her national security duty and discharged the police's Schedule 7 function to seek to determine ""whether the claimant was or appeared to be a person who was or had been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism"".Matthew Ryder QC, for Mr Miranda told the court: ""This claim is about the use of counter-terrorism powers, that can only be used at ports and airports, to seize journalistic material.""He said the case ""illustrates vividly"" why the use of Schedule 7 powers were not compatible with the right to freedom of expression - Article 10 of the Human Rights Act.  Mr Ryder said Mr Greenwald's articles about surveillance, based on source material provided by Mr Snowden, had ""resulted in global public interest at the highest level"".The QC said the powers used in Mr Miranda's case ""were exercised for an improper purpose"".The ""dominant purpose"" of the police officers was not to determine whether he was involved in the commission, instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism but to ""assist the security service in accessing material in the claimant's possession"", Mr Ryder added.He said exercising the powers had been unlawful because it was ""a disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of expression"".Mr Ryder said neither the police nor the security service, MI5, had tried to use the courts process to retrieve the data nor had they launched any investigation to do so before Mr Miranda was detained. High Court judges have ruled previously that material taken from Mr Miranda could be examined only for the purposes of national security and the protection of the public."

CIA drone strikes have killed up to 3,460 people in Pakistan since 2004.Most strikes take place in the troubled border region of North Waziristan, which is regarded as an al-Qaeda and Taliban stronghold.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who won elections in May, met Mr Kerry on Thursday. Mr Sharif has consistently demanded an end to such attacks, saying they violate Pakistan's sovereignty.His foreign affairs adviser, Sartaj Aziz, told reporters the US should stop the strikes ""not just curtail them"".Correspondents say the issue is complicated by the fact that some Pakistani officials have been accused of criticising the use of drones in public while co-operating with them in private.""I think the programme will end as we have eliminated most of the threat and continue to eliminate it,"" Mr Kerry said in a television interview.""The president has a very real timeline and we hope it's going to be very, very soon,"" he said when asked whether the US had a schedule for ending the strikes.Analysts say his comments went further than those of President Barack Obama, who said in a 23 May speech that drone strikes would decrease in ""the Afghan war theatre"" as US troops withdraw by the end of 2014.The number of strikes has fallen significantly over the past 30 months - totalling 17 so far this year compared to 48 in all of 2012 and 73 in 2011, according to estimates compiled by the New America Foundation.Speaking after meeting Mr Sharif on Thursday, Mr Kerry said their talks were ""constructive"" and ""positive"".

The committee, which reports directly to the Prime Minister who also chooses its members, then looked at a number of UK intelligence reports that were produced as a result of this activity.In a statement on the allegations against GCHQ, the ISC said: ""The legal authority for this is contained in the Intelligence Services Act 1994.""The Director of GCHQ, Sir Iain Lobban, was questioned ""in detail"" by the committee, it said. Members of the committee also met the US National Security Agency (NSA) and their Congressional counterparts to discuss Prism on a recent trip to the US.The ISC added that in each case where GCHQ sought information from the US, a warrant for interception - signed by a minister - was ""already in place"". While the committee found that GCHQ had acted within the law, it expressed concern that legal frameworks in some areas were expressed in ""general terms"".""More detailed policies and procedures have, rightly, been put in place around this work by GCHQ"",  in order to comply with the Human Rights Act, it said.The next step for the ISC was to further examine the ""complex interaction"" between the Intelligence Services Act, the Human Rights Act and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, and the policies and procedures that underpin them.Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the committee's findings. He said: ""I see daily evidence of the integrity and high standards of the men and women of GCHQ. The ISC's findings are further testament to their professionalism and values. ""It will continue to have the full co-operation of the government and the security and intelligence agencies."""

Sir Francis Richards said it was ""not a very good idea"" for an ex-Conservative minister to head Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee.But Sir Malcolm Rifkind said he was well placed to do the job as he had ""handled intelligence"" as a minister.It follows questions about intelligence leaked by US whistleblower Ed Snowden. Sir David Omand, a former UK homeland security adviser, has suggested the public disclosure of thousands of top-secret files by former CIA spy Edward Snowden was the most ""catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever"".The episode has raised questions about the oversight of the British security services, with Business Secretary Vince Cable among those urging a review of current arrangements. The Guardian - which published the original revelations about the data-gathering and surveillance activities of the US National Security Agency and its relationship with UK agencies - has suggested that a debate was starting in government about updating the way politicians oversee the security services. The intelligence and security committee has access to classified intelligence material and holds its meetings in private for security reasons.Reporting to Parliament, it publishes an annual review of the UK's intelligence policy as well as the administration and funding of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.Its remit was expanded earlier this year to cover operational matters, as well as the intelligence-related work of other government agencies such as the Joint Intelligence Committee, the National Security Secretariat, the Defence Intelligence department in the Ministry of Defence and the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism.Sir Malcolm, a former foreign and defence secretary under John Major, was appointed to chair the committee by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010.Sir Francis Richards, a career diplomat and former director of the GCHQ listening post, said he did not doubt Sir Malcolm's qualifications or ability to do the job but questioned whether he is ""well-placed to command confidence"".Sir Malcolm told BBC Radio 4's World At One, that the committee was ""completely bipartisan"" and the views he expressed as chairman were those of the whole committee, which has members from all parties. ""I'm perfectly happy to criticise and attack the government if they do something silly or stupid,"" he added.""Quite a number of people on the Intelligence and Security Committee are former ministers because we are people who've actually handled intelligence. We've had to deal with it as users of the product.""We are responsible for deciding whether the security services do something dumb or stupid or illegal and if they do, we are prepared to be very very brutal with them.""Sir Malcolm also said those calling for more scrutiny ""seemed to have forgotten"" that the government had ""dramatically increased"" the powers of the committee.No 10 has insisted there is no government review of oversight of the security services and the prime minister thinks the current system is working effectively.But he said it was open to members of the National Security Council and the Privy Council to ask the security agencies questions, and he said David Cameron was prepared to listen to ideas from others.Mr Clegg told the BBC that the ISC's powers had already been ""significantly strengthened"" but there was an ""ongoing debate"" about whether more needed to be done.""And I think many of these revelations have quite rightly raised questions about how we can increase oversight further where that is clearly justified,"" he said."

He will visit nine countries, including France, Turkey and Egypt.In Berlin, he will meet Syrian opposition members and representatives of nations supporting them. Mr Kerry has said he plans to use the trip to propose ideas on persuading the Syrian president to step aside. While in Berlin, he will also meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, at a time when relations between the US and Russia are cool.The US has sought Russia's backing to convince the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that he is isolated internationally. The former Massachusetts senator and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate is no stranger to foreign affairs, having spent almost three decades in the US senate as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Mr Kerry's schedule includes meetings foreign ministers and leaders in European capitals including Paris, Rome and Ankara before a tour of the Middle Eastern cities including Cairo, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh.Though the Middle East peace process will be on the agenda when he visits Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Mr Kerry will not visit Israel or the Palestinian Territories. President Barack Obama is expected to make the first trip of his presidency to Israel next month.Iran's controversial nuclear programme, which the country insists is for peaceful purposes, will also be on the new secretary of state's agenda. On Tuesday, US officials along with counterparts from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia will meet Iranian officials in Kazakhstan to attempt to persuade Iran to curtail its nuclear ambitions.

Earlier the White House said President Barack Obama had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by telephone, urging him to resume negotiations with the Palestinians ""as soon as possible"".Mr Kerry has not publicly announced details of his plan to revive direct peace talks, which stalled nearly three years ago. Previously the Palestinians had demanded a freeze on Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem before a return to peace talks. They have also asked for negotiations about borders to be based on pre-1967 ceasefire lines.Israel's coalition government, which includes pro-settler parties, has said there should be no preconditions.  The Israeli prime minister's office declined to comment on reports that Mr Kerry had presented a plan that included the resumption of talks on pre-1967 lines with land swaps that took into account the major settlement blocs in the West Bank.  However on his Facebook page, Naftali Bennett, who leads the third biggest party in the Israeli governing coalition, rejected any such terms.""The Jewish Home party under my leadership will not be a partner, not even for one second, in a government that agrees to negotiation based on 1967 lines,"" he said.""Jerusalem, our capital, is not and will never be subject to negotiations.""   The rights of Palestinian refugees, borders, settlements and the status of Jerusalem are all core issues in any final status peace agreement.In recent months, John Kerry has paid six visits to the Middle East in an effort to restart talks between Israel and the Palestinians.He has said that time is running out for a two-state solution to their decades-old conflict.

It is also supplying up to 240 troops to train soldiers in Mali and neighbouring countries in the region.Mr Hague said the UK was committed to ""restoring security"" in Mali. The foreign secretary has held meetings with the country's acting president Dioncounda Traore, its prime minister and foreign minister in the capital Bamako to discuss security and political developments. Troops from France and a number of African countries have driven Islamist groups out of the main cities in the north of the country following a major offensive beginning in January. Although it has not supplied combat troops, the British government has made available two aircraft to assist the operation, which it says is vital for stabilising the country and ensuring it does not become a safe haven for terrorists groups linked to al-Qaeda.On his visit, the first by a British foreign secretary to Mali, Mr Hague also met the commander of the AFISMA international force as well as the deputy commander of the EU mission training Malian soldiers and British troops serving under him. Mr Hague said restoring security and democratic rule to Mali after last year's military coup was important for stability in the wider region.""Mali is at the heart of a range of complex political, security and development challenges that have the potential to affect the wider region and it is vital that we work together to tackle these challenges,"" he said.

This is not a court of law and intelligence does not work that way.""The British parliament has already voted against the UK joining any US-led military intervention in Syria.Mr Obama cleared his schedule this week to focus all his attention on building support for the Syrian intervention.He will also seek public support in a White House address on Tuesday. He has acknowledged he faces a ""heavy lift"" to win congressional backing.While the White House believes an endorsement from the Senate could be within reach, the passage of the Syria resolution in the Republican-led House is likely to be even harder.A Washington Post survey said 224 of the current 433 members of the House were either ""no"" or ""leaning no"" on military action as of Friday, while 184 were undecided and just 25 were backing a strike.The survey suggested that 27 of the 100 senators were ""no"" or ""leaning no"", while 50 were undecided and 23 supportive of military action.Many US politicians remain concerned that military action could draw the nation into a prolonged war and spark broader hostilities in the region.Outside the US, France supports military intervention but it wants to wait for a report by UN weapons experts before taking action.Russia and China, which have refused to agree to a UN Security Council resolution against Syria, insist any military action without the UN would be illegal.In Syria itself, Magne Barth of the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed for increased access to help the wounded and displaced.He complained the authorities had not allowed aid into areas around eastern Damascus even during lulls in the fighting, and in particular in the aftermath of the 21 August attack.""All parties agree there was a chemical attack, it was only a question of [UN] inspectors going in, there was no possibility to bring in humanitarian aid,"" Mr Barth said."

The deal will also have to be approved by parliament.Mr Karzai's statement on the timing of the signature of the document appears to be a new condition, our correspondent says.The US had wanted the deal to be agreed quickly.Indeed Mr Obama's letter says: ""We look forward to concluding this agreement promptly.""The US state department later said it would be ""neither practical nor possible"" to delay signing beyond the end of the year.The US would have to take into account any amendments that are put forward, and would still have the option of pulling out altogether.Another key sticking point that Mr Karzai appears to have conceded concerns the jurisdiction for the prosecution of US troops.The US insistence on immunity from Afghan prosecution for troops has been central to Washington's demands.The failure to resolve a similar legal issue in Iraq led to a total withdrawal of US forces.The US-Afghan draft says: ""Afghanistan authorises the United States to hold trial in such cases, or take other disciplinary action, as appropriate, in the territory of Afghanistan.""According to the draft, the deal will remain in force ""until the end of 2024 and beyond"".Currently the multinational Nato force is due to pull out of Afghanistan from 2014. Opening the four-day Loya Jirga, President Karzai said the only issue on the table was whether the security agreement would be signed. A woman delegate shouted from the floor that US troops had spilt too much Afghan blood and should be stopped. Mr Karzai acknowledged there were difficult issues involved but advised delegates to accept the agreement.He said that a number of world leaders - including from Russia, China, and India - were backing the deal, and that it would provide the security Afghanistan needed, as well as the foundation for forces from other Nato countries who were assisting Afghan troops. But Mr Karzai also admitted there was a lack of trust between him and the Americans.He said: ""I don't trust them and they don't trust me, the last 10 years has shown this to me. I have had fights with them and they have had propaganda against me.""The Loya Jirga  delegates will now meet in smaller closed-door groups to look at the deal in detail. Security is tight for the meeting after a suicide bombing last weekend near the huge tent where it is being held.The Taliban has branded the meeting a US-designed plot, and has vowed to pursue and punish its delegates as traitors if they approve the deal."

While a White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, has said the US is ""appalled"" by ""horrifying"" reports from Syria, it doesn't seem Mr Obama is inclined to pronounce. Mr Earnest called on the Assad government to co-operate with the UN inspectors in full. But asked if reporters would hear from the president while he is on a bus tour about lowering the cost of higher education, he said, ""as we're weighing these domestic policy decisions, and as we're weighing these foreign policy decisions, the president puts the interest of the United States of America first.""And I think the fact that we are doing this bus tour is an indication that the president has his priorities straight"" I think that means no, the president does not want to talk about Syria.We've lost another opportunity to find out more about the administration's approach.The president's main military adviser has cancelled a planned news conference. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Martin Dempsey was due to answer questions at the foreign press centre.Perhaps he's had to call it off because he is busy planning what happens next in Syria.Perhaps not.He seemed pretty clear in a recent letter to a congressman that military action was undesirable.""Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,"" Gen Dempsey said. ""It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favour. Today, they are not.''But President Obama clearly has a problem, and will be accused of inaction and dithering. Senator John McCain says Mr Obama blurred his own red lines earlier in the summer by not responding militarily to reports of attacks and so encouraged this latest incident. Sen McCain has just issued another statement: ""Our friends and enemies alike, both in the Middle East and across the world, are questioning whether America has the will and the capacity to do what it says. ""This dangerous development impacts the national security interests of the United States and our closest allies, and if we continue to sit by passively while Assad continues to use chemical weapons against his own people, we only provide encouragement to other brutal governments in their use of harsh measures against their own people. ""It is time for the United States to come to the assistance of the Syrian people.""Our own Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen is forthright that this is a critical moment and Iran will be watching careful to see if Mr Obama sticks to his threat of military action.But my strong feeling is that Mr Obama will not rush to action. His whole philosophy warns him against intervention in the Middle East. Domestic politics suggest Americans don't want to get involved.Getting embroiled would rather undermine his boast to be the president who brought the troops home.Then there is Gen Dempsey's point -  whom would the West support if it did take action, and would that further its overall interests?There may be a tipping point when moral outrage grows too strong. I would again caution that while that may be the mood in the UK and France, it is not here. The fears on Capitol Hill are not reflecting any sense of fury in America.I am certain there are plans for the discreet use of special forces to secure chemical weapons - but it is not clear what the trigger would be.In either case, Mr Obama is likely to insist on going the full UN route to gather the maximum possible support for any action - and that means waiting for the inspector's report on earlier incidents at the very least.I could be very wrong. The bombers could be in the air by this afternoon. But at the moment all Mr Obama plans for today is a talk about the cost of college education and ""a better deal for the middle classes"". I suspect his red line is very thick indeed. "

He said the Taliban and their backers wanted Afghanistan ""impoverished and underdeveloped forever"". Six people were killed in eastern Paktia province. Six were abducted and shot dead in western Herat province.President Karzai's condemnation was expressed in the harshest of terms, the BBC's Karen Allen in Kabul reports.The Afghan leader's comments came after a two-day visit to Islamabad where he held talks with the Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. The focus of their meeting was to kick-start negotiations with the Taliban - over which Pakistan is understood by its neighbours to have some influence - but there have been no breakthroughs so far. With elections next April and foreign troops due to leave Afghanistan by the end of next year, President Karzai is under pressure to begin negotiations with the Taliban.However, one of Mr Karzai's key demands, the release of a high-value Taliban prisoner from Pakistan, appears not to have yet been honoured following this week's talks. Four engineers and two other workers - who had been working on government contracts - were found in Gulran in western Herat province. They were shot after attempts to negotiate their release failed.Attacks on government contractors have increased as Nato prepares to withdraw its combat troops in 2014.The men had been involved in project run by the National Solidarity Programme - an agency set up by Afghanistan's ministry of rural rehabilitation and development. The NSP is primarily funded by the World Bank.The contractors were kidnapped on Sunday and shot late on Monday despite efforts by the provincial authorities to negotiate their release.""We had gathered some elders to meet the Taliban to tell them that they (contractors)... worked for everyone in the country, but the Taliban killed them before they arrived for negotiations,"" Herat Governor Fazlullah Wahidi told Reuters.Meanwhile, the bodies of six civilians were found in Paktia, local officials said.The victims - all drivers - had been killed by the Taliban because they were working with the government, Paktia's deputy Governor Abdul Wali Sehee told Reuters.The Taliban have so far made no public comments on the attacks.On Tuesday a suicide attacker riding a bicycle detonated his explosives near a government building in Kabul. The attack happened shortly after 19:30 (15:00 GMT) close to the Water and Energy Ministry. According to the police, no-one else was injured or killed.  Earlier this month, nine road building contractors and a policeman were killed by insurgents in Herat.By the end of 2014, all foreign combat troops are due to have left Afghanistan to be replaced - if approved by the government in Kabul - by a smaller force that will only train and advise."

The sacking was not linked to the operation of the nuclear arsenal, which was safe, the officials insisted.On Wednesday the US Navy announced an admiral overseeing nuclear weapons forces had been sacked from the role.That was due to illegal gambling activities, officials said.Michael Carey is a two-star general in the 20th Air Force and was responsible for maintaining intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at three bases across the US - a total of 450 missiles.In a statement, the Air Force said Lt Gen James Kowalski, the commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, had made the decision.It read: ""Kowalski made his decision based on information from an Inspector General investigation into Carey's behaviour during a temporary duty assignment.""The allegations are not related to operational readiness or the inspection results of any 20th AF unit, nor do they involve sexual misconduct.""Gen Kowalski said: ""It's unfortunate that I've had to relieve an officer who's had an otherwise distinctive career spanning 35 years of commendable service.""Gen Kowalski oversees all Air Force nuclear weapons, including aircraft-delivered.The vice commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, Maj Gen Jack Weinstein, is temporarily replacing Gen Carey.The Air Force's biography of Gen Carey says he is in charge of 9,600 people at three operational wings and served in operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. It lists 13 major awards he has received.On Wednesday the Navy announced that Vice-Adm Tim Giardina had been removed as second-in-command of US Strategic Command.His job was to oversee the nation's nuclear weapons forces.He is accused of using counterfeit gambling chips in ""a significant monetary amount"" at an Iowa casino.Adm Giardina was demoted to a two-star admiral and is being reassigned pending outcome of an inquiry.The two sackings follow several other incidents affecting the US military's nuclear establishment.In August, a nuclear missile unit at Malstrom Air Force base in Montana failed a safety and security inspection, after which a senior security officer was relieved of duty. In May, it was reported that 17 officers in charge of maintaining nuclear missiles were sidelined over safety violations at Minot Air Force base in North Dakota."

Speaking after the incident, Mr Hammond said the Army had decided which regiments would be affected by the cuts.""If they'd stayed in the hall a bit longer they would have heard the case that I was building in my speech for why we have to invest in the new capabilities we need to defend Britain,"" he told Sky News.""While we all cherish our military traditions - and we have great regiments with proud histories - we have to reduce the size of our conventional armed forces.""The Army has made the decision about how it needs to restructure to be able to defend Britain in the future with a smaller army than we've had in the past.""These two RRF guys - the campaign's been long running - they know very well the point that we are making.""An Army spokeswoman said: ""We have been clear that the regular Army is becoming smaller and over a year ago we also announced changes to its structure so it is more reflective of the complex global situation.""These changes were led by the Army, who took account of a number of criteria to determine which infantry battalions would be withdrawn, to ensure the Army is more adaptable to future challenges.""To suggest decisions were taken on recruitment performance alone is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Army's process."""

Mr Bae, a Korean-American, was given 15 years' hard labour in May.North Korea said Mr Bae, a Christian missionary and tour operator, used his tourism business to plot sedition.State department spokeswoman Marie Harf said on Friday the US was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the decision to rescind the envoy's invitation.""We have sought clarification from the DPRK [North Korea] about its decision and have made every effort so that Ambassador King's trip could continue as planned or take place at a later date,"" Ms Harf said in a statement.She added that the US was ""gravely concerned"" about 45-year-old Mr Bae's health.Mr King had been expected to travel on Saturday from Tokyo to spend two days in Pyongyang.

He said Mr Bae ""has health problems and we are hopeful that we are going to be able to make progress on that"". Kenneth Bae's family say he is seriously ill and has been moved from a labour camp to a hospital. They say he has diabetes and an enlarged heart. Mr Bae (known in North Korea as Pae Jun-ho) was arrested in November 2012 as he entered the north-eastern port city of Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China.Mr Bae's trial and conviction came at a time of high tension between the US and North Korea, in the wake of the communist state's third nuclear test. It also came as the US and South Korea conducted annual large-scale military exercises, which angered Pyongyang. It had been hoped that Mr King's visit could kick-start new contacts between Washington and Pyongyang, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul.

The Security Council hours earlier called the test a clear threat to international security. Monitors said the test appeared twice as big as the previous one in 2009.The test took place at the Punggye-ri site in the north-east of the country on Tuesday morning. A powerful underground explosion was detected at 11:57 (02:57 GMT), followed three hours later by confirmation from North Korea that a test had taken place. State-run KCNA news agency said the test was ""carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously"".North Korea said it was a response to the ""reckless hostility of the United States"".Nuclear test monitors in Vienna say the underground explosion had double the force of the last test, in 2009, despite the use of a device said by the North to be smaller.If a smaller device was indeed tested, analysts said this could take Pyongyang closer to building a warhead small enough to arm a missile.South Korea is using aircraft and ships to collect air samples to analyse for increased radiation - which could give an indication of details about Tuesday's  blast, the Associated Press news agency reported. North Korea's two previous tests involved plutonium devices, but it is also believed to have a highly enriched uranium programme. Speaking in Washington, Mr Obama said North Korea would only achieve security by meeting its international obligations. ""Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only isolate them further as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defence and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats,"" he said.Earlier the Security Council met in an emergency session at which members unanimously backed a statement calling the North in ""grave violation"" of UN resolutions. ""In line with this commitment and the gravity of this violation, the members of the Security Council will begin work immediately on appropriate measures in a Security Council resolution,'' the council said.Mr Obama and outgoing South Korea President Lee Myung-bak also held telephone talks, as did Mr Lee and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. China - which backed the UN condemnation - summoned North Korea's ambassador in Beijing to express ""firm opposition"" to the test, the foreign ministry said. ""(Foreign Minister) Yang Jiechi demanded that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) side cease talk that further escalates the situation and swiftly return to the correct channel of dialogue and negotiation,'' a statement said.But in a statement issued late on Tuesday, North Korea appeared far from cowed, promising ""second and third tougher measures"" if the US did not ""admit its mistake and correct it"". The BBC's Barbara Plett, at the UN, says that so far isolation and pressure have been met by continued North Korean provocations. There is no sign that another round of sanctions will break that pattern. Analysts say that is because Pyongyang seems ready to push harder than the Security Council is able to push back. North Korea's open defiance of the UN suggests that it sees its nuclear weapons programme as a strategic asset that it will not give up, our correspondent adds.This test - the first under new leader Kim Jong-un - was North Korea's third. It came weeks after Pyongyang successfully used a rocket to put a satellite into space, a move condemned by the UN as a banned test of missile technology. "

The US government accuses Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces of killing 1,429 people in a poison-gas attack in the suburbs of Damascus on 21 August. But Mr Assad has blamed rebels for the attack - and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, says it still is not clear which side used the weapons.While the UK, Canada and Turkey all support Mr Obama's call for action, the only leaders at the G20 meeting to commit to force in Syria are the US and France.Correspondents in St Petersburg say opponents of US military intervention appear to far outnumber supporters within the G20.China and Russia, which have refused to agree to a Security Council resolution against Syria, insist any action without the UN would be illegal.

An injured Indian soldier was taken to hospital, it said. Earlier reports said three Indian peacekeepers had been killed in the attack.UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said more casualties were feared, and he did not know the fate of more than 30 Dinka civilians sheltering at the base.Security at the compound has since been increased. Sudan suffered a 22-year civil war that left more than a million people dead before the South became independent in 2011.The recent unrest has pitted gangs from the Nuer ethnic group of Mr Machar against Dinkas - the majority group to which Mr Kiir belongs.""South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past,"" President Obama said in a letter to Congress. ""Inflammatory rhetoric and targeted violence must cease. All sides must listen to the wise counsel of their neighbours, commit to dialogue and take immediate steps to urge calm and support reconciliation.""President Kiir has blamed the violence on soldiers who support Mr Machar.

Uganda has sent a small contingent of troops to help pull out its nationals.A US plane was also due to take Americans out of the country. And China's National Petroleum Company was evacuating oil workers to Juba.Jonglei state has witnessed some of the worst violence since South Sudan became independent, with hundreds killed in clashes between rival heavily-armed ethnic militias sparked by cattle-rustling. Following decades of conflict, weapons such as machineguns are widely available in much of South Sudan.In a statement, the UN mission in the country, Unmiss, said conditions for displaced people in Juba and Bor were ""challenging"". It said in some of the UN bases, some people had been able ""to construct basic shelters with available materials, but many have no or limited access to shelter"".A delegation of East African foreign ministers has travelled to Juba to try to mediate in the crisis.South Sudan's government insists the clashes are over power and politics, not between ethnic groups.The oil-rich country has struggled to achieve a stable government since becoming independent."

They were shot after attempts to negotiate their release failed.Attacks on government contractors have increased as Nato prepares to withdraw its combat troops in 2014.The men had been involved in project run by the National Solidarity Programme - an agency set up by Afghanistan's ministry of rural rehabilitation and development. The NSP is primarily funded by the World Bank.The contractors were kidnapped on Sunday and shot late on Monday despite efforts by the provincial authorities to negotiate their release.""We had gathered some elders to meet the Taliban to tell them that they (contractors)... worked for everyone in the country, but the Taliban killed them before they arrived for negotiations,"" Herat Governor Fazlullah Wahidi told Reuters.Meanwhile, the bodies of six civilians were found in Paktia, local officials said.The victims - all drivers - had been killed by the Taliban because they were working with the government, Paktia's deputy Governor Abdul Wali Sehee told Reuters.The Taliban have so far made no public comments on the attacks.On Tuesday a suicide attacker riding a bicycle detonated his explosives near a government building in Kabul. The attack happened shortly after 19:30 (15:00 GMT) close to the Water and Energy Ministry. According to the police, no-one else was injured or killed.  Earlier this month, nine road building contractors and a policeman were killed by insurgents in Herat.By the end of 2014, all foreign combat troops are due to have left Afghanistan to be replaced - if approved by the government in Kabul - by a smaller force that will only train and advise."

It opens the way for inspectors to visit a heavy-water plant being built in Arak and the Gachin uranium mine in Bandar Abbas, and for measures requested by the UN watchdog to be implemented.Tehran says the reactor in Arak is intended for the production of radioisotopes for medical purposes, but its spent fuel will contain plutonium suitable for use in nuclear weapons.Some reports said the latest talks failed because France had wanted to place tight restrictions on the facility in Arak.However, US diplomats said the Iranian government's insistence on formal recognition of its ""right"" to enrich uranium had been the major obstacle.The Jerusalem Post quoted a senior US official as saying the P5+1 had approved a working document, but that it had been ""too tough"" for the Iranians.Speaking at a news conference with UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Monday, Mr Kerry said: ""The P5+1 was unified on Saturday when we presented our proposal to the Iranians.""The French signed off on it, we signed off on it, and everybody agreed it was a fair proposal.""Iran couldn't take it at that particular moment; they weren't able to accept.""Mr Kerry also said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's public dismissal of the offer as a ""bad deal"" for the world had been premature.""We are confident that what we are doing can actually protect Israel more effectively and provide greater security,"" he added.Mr Kerry's comments on the prospects of an interim accord were echoed by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who told Europe 1 radio: ""We are not far from an agreement with the Iranians, but we are not there yet.""Responding to the reports that Paris was behind the failure of the talks, he said: ""France is neither isolated nor a country that follows the herd. It is independent and works for peace.""Mr Fabius revealed that there had been several issues that ""still need to be discussed with the Iranians"", including the facility in Arak, which could be operational by the end of 2014. ""We have to make arrangements for this reactor in Arak not to be activated as planned, for it not to lead to an atomic bomb,"" Mr Fabius said.Questions also remain over Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched to a medium level of purity, or 20%. Experts say it could be enriched to 90%, the level required for a nuclear bomb, in a relatively short time.""This stock at 20% must be dismantled and come back to 5%. The Iranian side still needs to make an effort [on this],"" Mr Fabius explained.But he also warned that the failure to agree a deal with Iran ""would be a considerable problem in a few months""."

In a speech to a veterans' group in Houston, Mr Biden said that ""those who use chemical weapons against defenceless men, women, and children... must be held accountable"".French President Francois Hollande said France was ""ready to punish"" whoever was behind the attack, and had decided to increase military support for Syria's main opposition. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says the US, UK and France will now have the larger task of building as wide a coalition as possible to support limited military action.Meanwhile the Arab League said it held Syrian President Bashar al-Assad responsible for the attacks and called for UN action.Syrian opposition sources have said they have been told to expect a Western intervention in the conflict imminently.""There is no precise timing... but one can speak of an imminent international intervention against the regime. It's a question of days and not weeks,"" AFP news agency quoted Syrian National Coalition official Ahmad Ramadan as saying.""There have been meetings between the Coalition, the [rebel] Free Syrian Army and allied countries during which possible targets have been discussed.""Russia and China, allies of the Syrian government, have stepped up their warnings against military intervention, with Moscow saying any such action would have ""catastrophic consequences"" for the region.Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has said he rejects ""utterly and completely"" claims that Syrian forces used chemical weapons, and his government has blamed rebel fighters. On Monday, United Nations weapons inspectors were fired on while investigating one of the five alleged chemical weapons attack sites around Damascus.Mr Hagel said the US Department of Defense had provided President Obama with ""all options for all contingencies"".""He has seen them, we are prepared,"" he told the BBC's Jon Sopel, adding: ""We are ready to go.""Mr Hagel said that intelligence currently being gathered by the UN inspectors would confirm that the Syrian government was responsible for the chemical attack last week.""I think it's pretty clear that chemical weapons were used against people in Syria,"" he said. Our correspondent says Mr Hagel left little doubt that he believed the Assad government was responsible, and was ready to execute the orders of his commander-in-chief.White House spokesman Jay Carney later said that a separate report on chemical weapons use being compiled by the US intelligence community would be published this week.Mr Carney said that Mr Obama had a variety of options and was not limited to the use of force, adding that it was not Washington's intention to remove Mr Assad.""The options we are considering are not about regime change,"" he said.Meanwhile, warnings have been issued on sites linked to Islamist militants fighting for the rebels in Syria, saying that their leaders and training camps might also be targeted by a possible US-led attack, says BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher. Several online sites linked to the Nusra Front and similar groups have advised militants not to hold meetings or gather in large numbers, and to change routines and locations, he says. Western powers have made clear their distrust and dislike of groups like the Nusra Front, which have spearheaded rebel victories, although there has been no indication from the US or anyone else that jihadists would be targeted, he adds. The UN says more than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began more than two years ago. The conflict has produced more than 1.7 million registered refugees.Earlier on Tuesday, a Russian transport plane landed in the Syrian city of Latakia with a cargo of humanitarian aid.The aircraft later left with dozens of Russian citizens on board, an official spokeswoman for the Russian Emergencies Ministry, Irina Rossius, told Russian news agencies. The flight was intended to evacuate Russians who wanted to leave Syria, she added."

Such occasions are traditionally marked with shows of military strength and it is thought this year the date could be used for a missile launch.Some estimates suggest that the Musudan missiles which North Korea has moved to its east coast could travel 4,000km (2,500 miles).That would put US bases on the Pacific island of Guam within range, although the exact threat is unclear as it is not believed that the Musudan has been tested before.Mr Kerry has stressed that it would be a ""huge mistake"" for the North to go ahead with a launch, saying it would further isolate North Korea and that the people of the country are in need of food, not missiles."

The allegations were published on Saturday by O Globo newspaper.They were based on documents disclosed by fugitive American intelligence analyst Edward Snowden. Brazil received the reports ""with deep concern,"" Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota said in a statement.President Dilma Rousseff called several cabinet ministers to a meeting on Sunday to discuss the issue, following the publication of the newspaper articles on Saturday.Mr Patriota was taking part in an international literature meeting in the city of Paraty, near Rio de Janeiro, but called the media in the afternoon to read a statement.""The Brazilian government has asked for clarifications through the US embassy in Brasilia and the Brazilian embassy in Washington,"" he said.Mr Patriota said it was going to request that the United Nations work on regulation ""to impede abuses and protect the privacy"" of internet users.Communications Minister Paulo Bernardo said the Federal Police and the Brazilian Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) would carry out an investigation to find out whether internet providers based in Brazil had been involved in the alleged surveillance scheme.""If that has happened, these companies broke Brazilian law and acted against our Constitution, which safeguards the right to privacy,"" said Mr Bernardo.""But the surveillance was probably done through undersea cables and satellites. Most of the cables for international communications go through the US,"" he added.According to O Globo newspaper, Brazil had one of the highest numbers of electronic messages and phone calls monitored by the US, even though the country has good relations with the US.""It is not known the number of people and companies spied on in Brazil, but there is evidence that there was a large volume of data collected on a regular basis,"" says the report.""Brazil appears on the charts of the American agency (National Security Agency, or NSA) as a prime target for the espionage of phone calls and other data, alongside nations like China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan,"" says O Globo.The allegations come at a difficult time for relations between the United States and Latin American countries.On Tuesday, a Bolivian government plane was denied access to the airspace of France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.President Evo Morales, who was returning from an official visit to Moscow, was forced to wait for 13 hours in Vienna before being allowed to return to La Paz.France apologised for the incident, blaming it on ""conflicting information"" that Edward Snowden was on board. The American whistleblower is believed to be holed up at an airport in Moscow since fleeing from Hong Kong.Mr Morales and other Latin American leaders reacted angrily, denouncing a ""neo-colonialist"" approach from the US and some of its European allies.Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua have since stated that they are willing to give Mr Snowden asylum. A statement by Brazil's President Rousseff said: ""The embarrassment to President Morales hits not only Bolivia, but all of Latin America.""Any flight to Latin America would almost certainly take Mr Snowden through Cuba, which has been relatively quiet on the issue so far.But on Sunday President Raul Castro said he supported ""the sovereign right of Venezuela and all those in the region to grant asylum to those persecuted for their ideals or their struggles for democratic rights"".The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Havana says the comments may signal a change of attitude towards allowing Mr Snowden transit through Cuba."

As at home, he reached over the heads of the politicians to the people. He has made a clever speech invoking passion, morality and Jewish history to argue for a new peace process.But cynics may note no-one doubts he is good with words. Good at painting a big, visionary picture. The cynics - and they abound in this region - may reflect that he is sometimes less adept at turning his moral vision into practical politics. There will also be the suspicion that Mr Obama is ticking a box.Many, including UK Foreign Minister William Hague, have warned that the door is closing for the chance of two states, Palestine and Israel, living side by side in peace.No president wants this idea - the two-state solution - to die on his watch. So a bit of energetic, over-optimistic resuscitation cannot do him any harm, even if the patient does pass away. It is perhaps wrong to be too cynical. I have no doubt Mr Obama means all this. It is more a question of whether he can achieve anything.The speech was well-crafted and audacious. It pressed lavish praise of Israel into service to argue for peace. He spoke of the meaning of the Passover to African Americans, another people once enslaved in a foreign land, yearning for freedom.He lauded Zionism, saying: ""People deserve to be free in a land of their own."" He did not yet say that this applied to the Palestinians too. First, he declared that those who rejected Israel's right to exist might as well deny the sky above them or the earth below, a phrase with something of a Psalmist ring to it. Boldest of all, he said that a Palestinian state would ""permanently secure the Zionist dream"".This may sound a bit woolly and philosophical, but it is a wrapped-up warning. If, because of the growth of settlements, more and more Palestinians abandon the two-state solution, the only place they have to go is a one-state solution.That is, by dominating a larger Israel by demographics and a civil rights movement demanding equality and democracy.That might take a long time but it could happen, and the end result would not be a Jewish state. It can seem that Mr Obama is never happier than when tracing the moral arc of the universe, but he is trying to inject a note of urgency, saying that in a region that is growing ever more unpredictable, peace becomes harder to make as time passes.Most experts on the region are pessimistic about the chance of talks starting up soon.But a senior advisor says that Mr Obama is not - his conversations here have given him ""a lot of confidence"".He is urging the parties build trust and then get down to the tough stuff pretty quickly - dealing with the fundamentals such as borders, refugees and the status of Jerusalem.The new US secretary of state, John Kerry, is key to all this. He will be back in Israel at the weekend, seeing if any of the parties will make good their public commitments.Mr Obama will soon be home and turn his attention to the domestic front. But this speech will be part of his legacy, for good or for ill. Will he be seen as a man who promised so much and delivered so little, or one who inspired people to achieve something not short of a miracle."

The legislation says the objective of a US military response would be to ""deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade'' the Syrian government's ability to use chemical weapons.Senior White House officials told the BBC that Mr Obama's decision to seek congressional approval was made by the president on Friday afternoon. It had not been planned until then.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said the vote on the proposal would take place no later than the week of 9 September.The BBC's Katy Watson in Washington says it is unclear is what action he would take if Congress votes against involvement.The president's decision to turn to Congress was seen as a direct reaction to the UK government's defeat in Parliament on supporting any military action in Syria if it were backed by evidence from UN inspectors.After the White House announcement, UK Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""I understand and support Barack Obama's position"".Mr Obama did not speak to Mr Cameron before his statement but did call President Hollande, the White House said.France has also backed military action, and its parliament is due to reconvene on Wednesday for a debate.Opposition members have urged President Francois Hollande to seek a formal vote before joining Washington in any military operation, but correspondents say this is unlikely.Also on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin challenged the US to present to the UN evidence that Syria had attacked rebels with chemical weapons.

He is the first senior official to step down after the Democrats' heavy losses in the mid-term elections this month. The reason for his resignation is not yet clear.A senior defence official told the Associated Press news agency that it was ""time for new leadership in the Pentagon"".The New York Times said he was the first ""cabinet-level casualty"" of the mid-term loss of the Senate majority, and linked his departure to the rise of Islamic State militants.However, a White House official said the president and his 68-year-old defence secretary had been talking about his post since before the elections.""In October, Secretary Hagel began speaking with the president about departing the administration given the natural post-mid-terms transition time,"" the unnamed official told the BBC.Mr Hagel will remain as defence secretary until his replacement is confirmed by the Senate.Known as a straight-talking maverick, the former Nebraska Republican senator is a decorated war veteran who was appointed to replace Leon Panetta in February of last year after a bitter fight in Congress. He brought military experience to the job, having served as an infantry squad leader in the Vietnam war, where he was awarded two Purple Hearts, one for saving his brother's life.  On Iran sanctions: Isolating nations is risky... It turns them inward, and makes their citizens susceptible to the most demagogic fear mongering.On a nuclear Iran: These governments, however hostile they may be toward us, have some appreciation of the horrific results of a nuclear war and the consequences they would suffer.On the United Nations: [The] only international organization that can help bring the consensus that is indispensable in finding solutions and resolving crisesOn the Pentagon: Bloated budgets and lack of effective oversight and review are symptoms of deeper, structural inadequacy in our military postureFrom Chuck Hagel's 2008 book, America: Our Next Chapter The horrors of war are said to have shaped his view of military action as a last resort, to be used only after all diplomatic options have been exhausted.Born in North Platte, Nebraska, Mr Hagel grew up in a poor family, and began working odd jobs from the age of nine to help put food on the table.Upon returning from Vietnam, he took various jobs, including as a radio reporter, but made his fortune in the fledgling mobile phone industry.He was elected to the Senate in 1996 and again in 2002, where he rose to become chairman of a panel on the foreign relations committee. Mr Hagel's strained relations with the Republican party leadership were seen as a reason for his decision not to pursue a White House run in 2008.Some Republicans had never forgiven him for his strident criticism of George W Bush's administration during the Iraq war.Though he voted for the resolution authorising the conflict, he went on to become a fierce critic.Mr Hagel was appointed as President Barack Obama's defence secretary in February 2013, following a nomination that was stalled in the Senate by an unprecedented filibuster.His 58-41 confirmation was the narrowest ever vote margin for a Pentagon nominee.Lawmakers on the right had voiced concern because Mr Hagel had openly challenged the idea of a US- or Israeli-led military strike against Iran. His support for including Iran in peace talks on Afghanistan had raised eyebrows, too. Mr Hagel was also lambasted for saying in a 2008 book written by a former state department official that the ""Jewish lobby"" intimidated lawmakers in Washington. He apologised for that remark during his Pentagon confirmation hearing.On the left, some had also criticised his remarks about James Hormel, the first openly gay US ambassador, in 1998, in 1998, whom he described as ""aggressively"" gay. He later regretted that comment.According to the New York Times report of his resignation, it was ""recognition that the threat from the Islamic State would require a different kind of skills than those that Mr Hagel was brought on to employ"".  However, Mr Hagel's aides had maintained in recent weeks that he expected to serve his full four years as defence secretary, the paper notes.In the days before his resignation was announced, Mr Hagel wore a sticking-plaster on his cheek.

Of the 166 detainees at Guantanamo, 86 have been cleared for transfer if conditions can be met, including 56 from Yemen. More than 100 detainees have joined a hunger strike which began in early February to protest against the failure to end their detention without charge, many of them for more than a decade.Many of those on hunger strike are force-fed through a nasal tube."

In a statement, US President Barack Obama congratulated the panel.He said the bill was ""largely consistent with the principles of common sense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system"". Mr Obama added he was ""hopeful"" the amendment process would ""lead to further improvements"".Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not block the measure from coming to the floor for a full debate, but did not say how he planned to vote.Three Republicans joined all 10 Democrats on the committee in voting for the bill.Approval came after committee members agreed to a Republican move to ease visa restrictions on hiring skilled workers from countries such as China and India. The Democratic chairman of the committee, Patrick Leahy, also withdrew an amendment that would have allowed people to sponsor foreign same-sex partners for permanent legal status. ""I don't want to be the senator who asks people to choose between the love of their life and the love of their country,"" Sen Leahy said.The bill's supporters had asked him to remove the proposal in order to save the legislation.""I believe in my heart of hearts that what you're doing is the right and just thing,"" Democrat Senator Richard Durbin said. ""But I believe this is the wrong moment, that this is the wrong bill.""At the centre of the legislation is a provision that would allow the estimated 11 million people living in the US illegally to obtain ""registered provisional immigrant status"", six months after the bill's enactment if certain conditions are met.That status is the beginning of a 13-year process that would one day allow immigrants to be eligible to apply for a green card.The bill also includes provisions to strengthen security along the US-Mexican border, using additional agents and drones.The president of the powerful AFL-CIO union group, Rich Trumka, attacked the last-minute deal allowing an increase in the number visas for hi-tech specialists as ""anti-worker"". But he said organised labour would continue to support the larger bill.In the other chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, immigration legislation is due to receive a hearing in the judiciary committee on Wednesday.US lawmakers' last attempt at immigration reform was more recent - a bipartisan bill failed in the Senate in 2007.The latest push for reform follows Mr Obama's announcement last June that the US would allow young undocumented workers who immigrated as children to apply for two-year, renewable visas. Republicans have increasingly embraced the idea of immigration reform after a large majority of Hispanic voters supported Mr Obama in last year's election."

Some experts have also questioned Prism's real power. Digital forensics professor Peter Sommer told the BBC such access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"", with intelligence agencies able to tap into servers only to collect intelligence on a named target.According to leaked documents from GCHQ published by the Guardian, the UK was tapping fibre-optic cables carrying global communications and sharing the data with the NSA, its US counterpart.The documents showed that GCHQ was able to access 200 fibre-optic cables, giving it the ability to monitor up to 600 million communications every day.The information on internet and phone use was allegedly stored for up to 30 days in order for it to be sifted and analysed.GCHQ declined to comment on the claims but said its compliance with the law was ""scrupulous"".In June 2013,  Italian weekly L'Espresso published claims that GCHQ and the NSA had targeted three undersea cables with terminals in Italy, intercepting commercial and military data.The three cables in Sicily were named as SeaMeWe3, SeaMeWe4 and Flag Europe-Asia.Then in October, the Washington Post published claims the  NSA had hacked into fibre-optic cables and other network equipment connecting servers operated by Google and Yahoo.According to the leaks, the agency had obtained and sifted through a wide range of material, including ""metadata"" - which records who sent or received e-mails and when - text, audio and video, in an operation run in conjunction with British counterpart GCHQ.Google, which has a number of US and overseas data centres - consisting of thousands of miles of cables and computers stored in warehouses - has said it is now working to encrypt its cables.In June 2015, documents leaked by WikiLeaks purported to reveal US spying on three successive French presidents, as well as cabinet ministers and the French ambassador to the United States.Recordings of phone conversations by Francois Hollande, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Jacques Chirac were collected by the US National Security Agency (NSA), according to the documents, which date to 2012.The spying was ""unacceptable"", said Mr Hollande. The leak echoed similar revelations October 2013, when German media reported that the US had bugged German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone for more than a decade - and that the surveillance had only ended a few months earlier.Der Spiegel magazine, again quoting documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, claimed a listening unit was based inside the US embassy in Berlin.Investigative journalist Duncan Campbell explained in his blog how windowless areas on the outside of official buildings could be ""radio windows"". These external windows - made of a special material that does not conduct electricity - allow radio signals to pass through and reach collection and analysis equipment inside.According to security experts, standard mobile phone encryption systems can be vulnerable because their scrambling system is, in software terms, separate from the program used to create a message.It is possible for an eavesdropper to position themselves between the message-making software and the encryption system at either end of a conversation and see information before it is scrambled or after it is unscrambled.End-to-end encryption, now adopted by many, closes this gap by having the message-making software apply the scrambling directly. In addition, many of these systems run a closed network so messages never travel over the public internet and are only decrypted when they reach their intended recipient.How encryption systems workAs well as the bugging of the chancellor's phone, there are claims the NSA has monitored millions of telephone calls made by German and French citizens along with the emails and phone calls of the presidents of Mexico and Brazil.The Guardian later reported that the NSA had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by another US government official. Again, Edward Snowden was the source of the report.Der Spiegel magazine published claims in June that the NSA had also spied on European Union offices in the US and Europe.The magazine said it had seen documents leaked by Edward Snowden showing that the US had spied on EU internal computer networks in Washington and at the 27-member bloc's UN office in New York.The files allegedly suggested that the NSA had also conducted an eavesdropping operation in a building in Brussels, where the EU Council of Ministers and the European Council were located.Then, in July, the Guardian published claims in further leaked documents that a total of 38 embassies and missions had been ""targets"" of US spying operations.Countries targeted included France, Italy and Greece, as well as America's non-European allies such as Japan, South Korea and India, the paper said.EU embassies and missions in New York and Washington were also said to be under surveillance.The file is said to have detailed ""an extraordinary range"" of spying methods used to intercept messages. They included bugs, specialised antennae and wire taps.In January 2014, the Guardian newspaper and Channel 4 News reported that the NSA collected and stored almost 200 million text messages per day across the globe.NSA programmes codenamed Dishfire and Prefer extracted location information, contacts and financial data from SMS messages, including automated texts, such as roaming charge alerts, the newspaper said. According to The Guardian, this was an untargeted collection of people's messages, rather than being aimed at known surveillance targets. However, the NSA told the BBC the programme stored ""lawfully collected SMS data"" and any implication that collection was ""arbitrary and unconstrained is false""."

In a similar challenge four years ago, Chief Justice Roberts said the law's past success ""is not adequate justification to retain the preclearance requirements"".But the justices sidestepped the question of its constitutionality at the time. The provision covers Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, as well as certain places in California, Florida, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire, North Carolina and South Dakota."

""I'm just grateful that this body has continued to stand up for the bills that have passed. The eyes of the entire nation were on the Arkansas House of Representatives today,"" said sponsor Senator Jason Rapert after the state House overrode Gov Beebe's veto with a 56-33 vote.The bill would not prosecute women who terminate a pregnancy, but doctors who perform the procedure could have their medical licences revoked.The move comes days after the state legislature voted to override another veto by the governor, this time to push through an immediate ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Arkansas and the Center for Reproductive Rights are preparing to file a federal lawsuit challenging the 12-week ban.""The whole thing has not only been a slap in the face of Arkansas women but a serious bruising for the state of Arkansas and any efforts it has tried to make to present itself as a progressive, forward-thinking state where people might want to live and work,"" ACLU of Arkansas Executive Director Rita Sklar told the Arkansas Times.""It's a giant leap back in time.""Gov Beebe called the law ""blatantly unconstitutional"" and warned the legislature that a legal battle could be expensive, after he vetoed the measure on Monday.The governor said the bill contradicted the landmark 1973 Supreme Court opinion in the case of Roe v Wade, which ruled abortion was legal until the foetus could survive outside the womb.Scientists generally agree a foetus becomes viable at about 22 to 24 weeks.Both the 12-week and 20-week laws include exemptions for rape, incest, and cases when the mother's life is in danger or the foetus is diagnosed with an extremely serious disorder."

6592	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22274770	News	1	Civil Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The Boston Marathon bombings suspects were quickly identified after investigators picked them out on CCTV footage. Does that mean Americans need to depend more on CCTV? Before they were Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, they were Black Hat and White Hat - two young faces in baseball caps, identified in grainy video footage as the prime suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings. From footage totalling hundreds of hours, investigators singled out the two men from a sea of marathon spectators, then followed their movements before and after they allegedly planted the two bombs.Those bombs would kill three people and wound more than 200, and Black Hat and White Hat were identified soon after their images were released. A day later, one was dead and the other in hospital.The crucial role that video footage played in this case has many Americans re-evaluating the role of CCTV and other surveillance tools in public spaces.While the US never embraced state-sponsored CCTV the way the UK has, it has nevertheless used surveillance as a national security and law-enforcement measure for years.""As the Boston bombing demonstrated, we are pretty well surveyed,"" says Ioannis Pavlidis, a professor of computational physiology at the University of Houston. That surveillance comes from a mix of private and public video cameras. Pavlidis, who worked in the private sector before turning to academia, says his projects were funded both ways. ""Part of our funding [into surveillance technology] was coming from a government agency who was interested in developing more of this kind of technology,"" he said. ""There was government interest, but at the same time there was private interest. And they coincided.""  For the most part, surveillance in the US has been led by private citizens. In the 1980s, video technology became cheap enough for individual businesses and citizens to install their own home security systems. By the '90s, that technology improved, leading to more digital footage with better quality.Private video footage has been used in public security, in cases such as the Rodney King beating, where a citizen caught police assaulting King on tape.Then came the attacks on the World Trade Center.""The thing that was really prompted by 9/11, on top of the general trend, is the introduction of the police-run cameras,"" says Jay Stanley, a police analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union.New York City boasts an impressive system designed not just to identify criminals after the fact but catch them in the act. ""All of these cameras feed back into a command centre that has very significant analysis capabilities on the back end, including real-time video analytics on the feed,"" says Dan Verton, editor of Homeland Security Today.""A bag left unattended would be automatically picked up by the system.""Police can then be deployed to troubled areas caught on film, allowing the force to do more with fewer officers. ""The mission is to have just a few officers being able to cover arguably the entire city wherever there's a camera, and redirect resources - police on the street - to areas where they are needed as opposed to having to blanket the street with officers,"" says Verton.New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has been outspoken in his support of surveillance cameras after the Boston bombing.""The people who complain about it, I would say, are a relatively small number of folks, because the genie is out of the bottle,"" Kelly said on MSNBC television. ""People realize that everywhere you go now, your picture is taken.""Indeed, most experts predict more surveillance in the years to come. ""That's the way of the world and where the technology is going,"" says Pavlidis, who cites the introduction of Google Glass. ""That will be one more surveillance mode in everyone's face. Social media, phones with cameras everywhere... there's no escape."" For privacy advocates like Stanley, however, there is a big difference between footage taken by private citizens and collected by the police in an emergency - and footage taken by police as part of a larger blanket campaign.When large-scale surveillance systems like the ones in New York are in place, he says, ""You can track individuals through time and space in a way that you can't when cameras are privately owned.""""You can collect [private] video quickly and easily if you need it, but it doesn't allow for the many abuses we fear if you turn all of our public spaces into centrally monitored ones,"" he says.Americans have proven resistant to such measures in the past. The use of drones as a surveillance measure has been roundly criticised, says Verton, with several planned programmes put on hold due to privacy fears. A recent poll showed that only 40% of Americans supported more cameras in the name of public safety - and only 12% wanted fewer cameras.And yet, more cameras are coming. Police officers in Denver, Phoenix, Chicago and other cities are relying more on surveillance video to help fight crime.For Ioannis Pavlidis, the technology is inevitable. But it is also neutral. ""It's the interpretation that makes the difference,"" he says. ""If democratic institutions work well and it is used judiciously, it can make us safer.""And if not? Privacy advocates are like Stanley are watching the watchers, hoping to stem back the tide. "

Ms Davis' marathon speech, known as a filibuster, prevented Republicans in the legislature from passing the bill during the end of a June legislative session. Governor Rick Perry ordered a new session in July, in which the bill was passed.The subsequent lawsuit was brought by Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers in the state.They argued that the law's requirement for doctors to have an admissions agreement with a local hospital within 30 miles (48km) of their clinic would force the closure of many providers.In a trial before Judge Yeakel's decision, one set of clinics said they had applied for admitting privileges at 32 hospitals, with only 15 accepting the applications and zero announcing a decision.Tuesday's ruling provides an immediate reprieve for those providers expecting to be shut down on Tuesday.In his ruling, Judge Yeakel said the provision ""places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable foetus and is thus an undue burden to her"".A similar law is working its way through the federal court system in Mississippi. A federal judge temporarily blocked the measure as a trial on the law's constitutionality is scheduled to take place in March, and an appeals court declined the Mississippi attorney general's request to lift the injunction."

He and other senior officials testified about four cases in which they said the surveillance programmes had ""contributed"" to stopping an attack, including Najibullah Zazi's alleged plot to bomb the New York subway system and a ""nascent"" plan to bomb the New York Stock Exchange.The programmes ""assist the intelligence community to connect the dots"", Gen Alexander told the panel in a rare open hearing.In an interview with Fox News, Edward Snowden's father said he believed his son was a ""man of principle"".""I know you're your own man and you're going to do what you feel you have to do,"" Lon Snowden said in a statement addressed to his son.""I don't know what you've seen but I just ask that you measure what you're going to do and not release any more information.""Lon Snowden told the US broadcaster he was ""saddened"" by his son's decision to leak the information, but also criticised the US government's alleged surveillance programme.""I don't want them reading my email. If we say, 'We're going to have to sacrifice our freedoms because of the threat of terrorism', well, the terrorists have already won,"" he said.But he added that he would prefer to see his son face time in prison than remain in Hong Kong.""I would like to see Ed come home and face this,"" he said.""I have faith in our justice system: I would rather my son be a prisoner in the US than a free man in a country that [does] not have the kind of freedoms that we have.""Edward Snowden fled to Hong Kong shortly before the scandal broke. His leaks revealed that US agencies had systematically gathered vast amounts of phone and web data.He also alleged that US intelligence had been hacking into Chinese computer networks. The contractor said he had decided to speak out after observing ""a continuing litany of lies"" from senior officials to Congress.""The US government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me,"" he said.Although the leaks have angered the US government, Mr Snowden has so far not been charged or faced an extradition request."

The Human Rights Act incorporates the convention into British law.Meanwhile, the Mail on Sunday reported Home Secretary Theresa May is planning to pull Britain out of the ECHR, stripping the Strasbourg court of its right to be involved in UK cases. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Grayling alluded to the possibility of scrapping the Human Rights Act - which the Lib Dems are committed to defending - saying: ""Well, self-evidently, if we are going to create a new legal framework we are not going to be able to keep the framework we've got at the moment.""We've got a lot of work to do on the detail - [to] look at exactly how we best do that, how we deliver change.""Commenting on the Convention itself, the cabinet minister said: ""If anyone sits down and reads it as a document they would struggle to find a word they disagreed with. It is sensible balance of rights and responsibilities.""But, in the interview with the Pienaar's Politics programme, he added: ""The decision-making in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has moved, I think, that Convention further and further away from the original intentions of its authors.""Asked to respond to critics who have claimed that being a signatory to the Convention is proof that Britain is a modern, compassionate society, Mr Grayling said: ""I was a human rights campaigner. I chaired the Amnesty International Group when I was at university."" He stressed his view that human rights were ""about some of the appalling things happening around the world - people being brutalised for their political views, people being put in jail"".Responding to Mr Grayling's comments, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes told the BBC the ECHR was a ""benchmark of human rights around the world"".He said the justice secretary was clearly taking ""a very right wing position"" which pandered to ""an obvious anti-Europeanism"".Mr Hughes added that while some structural problems had built up within the system, ""the Lib Dems were committed to keeping the Convention"". A Lib Dem source also told the BBC: ""There is absolutely zero prospect of Britain leaving the European Convention on Human Rights while the Liberal Democrats are in government. ""The Tories can posture all that they want about what's in their manifesto next time around, but that is up to them.""Earlier, Mr Grayling was quoted in the Sunday Telegraph as saying he would expect a future majority Conservative government to scrap the Human Rights Act - which was introduced under the last Labour government.The cabinet minister's remarks come after an outcry among some Conservatives that the party is failing to connect with traditional blue-collar members - following its defeat in the Eastleigh by-election on Thursday.The Conservatives finished third in Eastleigh, in Hampshire - behind the Liberal Democrats and the UK Independence Party (UKIP).Conservative party vice chairman Michael Fabricant said the party had struggled to present a distinctive message, while UKIP managed to attract Tory voters on issues such as crime and immigration.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Prime Minister David Cameron responded to the warnings by insisting there would be no ""lurch to the right"" by the Conservatives."

Critics say the provision would force some women to travel hundreds of miles to have an abortion, while supporters say it would protect women's health and the foetus.Among the bill's opponents are the Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Associations and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. On Tuesday, the House state affairs committee heard personal stories from both sides. Some women said they had regretted having an abortion, while others said it had given them a second chance.""In this country, we've forgotten about a big law: 'Thou shall not kill,'"" said bill supporter Dorothy Richardson of the Houston Coalition for Life. Opponent Gay Caldwell told lawmakers women's health is only protected when abortion is legal and safe.""This bill is about women's lives, and I don't think you want to play politics with women's lives,"" she said.The US Supreme Court legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, but about a dozen states have enacted laws in recent years limiting access to the procedure. Some of that state legislation is tied up in court battles."

""He's not just my son, he's all of our son and we have to fight for our children,"" Sabrina Fulton said.Earlier she told the BBC many young African Americans had been left afraid by the acquittal of neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.She called for a change to laws in many American states which allow the use of deadly force if a person feels seriously threatened. Saturday's event comes a few days before the actual anniversary of the original march on 28 August 1963.King, who was assassinated in 1968, led about 250,000 people to the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall and delivered his famous speech from its steps.""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character."" he said, in one of the most celebrated pieces of American oratory.Martin Luther King III, King's eldest son, told the marchers from the same steps on Saturday: ""This is not the time for nostalgic commemoration nor is this the time for self-congratulatory celebration. ""The task is not done. The journey is not complete. We can and we must do more."" In his speech, Mr Holder said of the 1963 demonstrators: ""They marched in spite of animosity, oppression and brutality because they believed in the greatness of what this nation could become and despaired of the founding promises not kept.""The spirit of 1963, he said, now demanded equality for gay people, Latinos, women, the disabled and others. Organisers had hoped to gather some 100,000 people in Washington. The crowd was predominantly African American but included white Americans and others.Mr Obama, the first black US president, is due to commemorate the event on Wednesday with a speech from the same spot where King spoke. He will be joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, while churches and groups have been asked to ring bells at 15:00 (19:00 GMT) to mark the exact time King delivered his speech."

The Constitutional Council rejected their argument that the law infringed their freedom of conscience.President Hollande made legalising gay marriage his flagship social reform, but it sparked mass protests.The issue aroused stronger than expected opposition in France, with opinion polls suggesting nearly half of the population oppose gay marriage.Protests against the bill attracted some of the biggest public demonstrations seen in France in decades.In a five-page ruling, the Constitutional Court said it was not unconstitutional for public officials to be required to officiate at same-sex marriages regardless of any personal objections.The government did not include an opt-out clause within the legislation ""to assure the law is applied by its agents and to guarantee the proper functioning and neutrality of public service,"" the court noted.""Freedom of conscience is not violated by officiating at weddings,"" it said.The group of seven mayors had argued that the lack of an opt-out clause violated the French constitution.A spokesman for the group, Franck Meyer, said they would take their case to the European Court of Human Rights ""because we are local elected representatives and we have a right to express the diversity of opinion in French society"".President Francois Hollande and his ruling Socialist Party vowed to legalise same-sex marriage following their election in 2012.But the bill was dogged by fierce debate in parliament, legal challenges and massive street protests before it became law on 17 May.France became the 14th country worldwide - and the ninth in Europe - to legalise gay marriage.Since the law was passed some 600 gay couples have been married.In the handful of cases where mayors have refused to conduct the ceremonies, their deputies have stepped in.

6824	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21229118	other	0	Civil Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"MPs debate plans, opposed by many religious groups, for same-sex marriage next week. Ahead of that occasion, the government has published its assessment of the possible wider impacts. Here are eight ways it believes the bill might change things: Lavish spending often accompanies a wedding, and so a large increase in the number of marriages taking place each year would create a significant boost to certain parts of the economy. Beneficiaries might include ceremony venues, cake manufacturers, function band agencies, and hoteliers. The government estimates the total economic stimulus could be as much as £14.4m - but thinks it is more likely to be closer to £0. ""As the demand for same-sex marriage is uncertain, and because these economic benefits are not guaranteed to be additional (for example, the spending on a civil partnership or marriage ceremony may not be additional if the couple and guests cut back on spending in other areas), we use zero benefit as our best estimate,"" it explains. Also facing increased demand for its services is the Gender Recognition Panel, which furnishes transgender people with certificates documenting their gender transitions. At present, it is impossible for a member of a married couple to change gender and remain legally married. So the government is anticipating a ""noticeable increase"" in the panel's workload as ""those who may have changed gender some years ago but decided not to apply for legal recognition, since they wished to remain in their existing marriage"", adapt to the change in the law.During its consultation on same-sex marriages, the government received evidence from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which said lesbian, gay, and bisexual people (LGB) people experience more mental health problems and a greater likelihood of drug addiction than heterosexuals. Ministers believe that discrimination against LGB people partially accounts for this phenomenon. The removal of discrimination against same-sex couples in the current legal definition of marriage, the government argues, might therefore improve public health. A number of Whitehall departments will need to tweak their computer systems to enable them to administer services properly to same-sex married couples. The biggest impact will be felt at the Home Office, which oversees the registration of marriages, civil partnerships, births and deaths. The government estimates that necessary changes to its online registration system will cost £2m. Lower costs will fall on the Department for Work and Pensions, which will need to adapt its systems to cope with changes to pension entitlements, and the Ministry of Justice, which will need to alter the courts' ""FamilyMan"" IT system.If the government's plans become law, the UK will join a select group of 12 countries where same-sex marriage is legal. The Lesbian and Gay Lawyers Association told the government in its consultation to prepare for a ""modest boost"" in tourism as a consequence. ""We are aware that same-sex couples from the UK travel to places like Canada to get married because they prefer this to a civil partnership. We expect that if marriage is open to same-sex couples in England and Wales, couples especially from elsewhere in Europe will come here to get married here,"" it said. Those who will be conducting same-sex marriages will need to get to grips with the new system. The government assumes that they will need between two and seven hours' training each - ""time which could have been spent on other tasks"", it notes.  ""Currently, if a person discloses that they are in a civil partnership rather than a marriage, they automatically disclose their sexual orientation,"" the government says. People in same-sex marriages will have greater discretion over how, when, or whether to divulge this information. Recent research suggests that one in five LGB people think they have been harassed at work because of their sexual orientation, the government says. Same-sex marriages might encourage greater acceptance of same-sex couples in society, the government believes. This would be good for society as a whole, ministers have concluded, by helping to create ""a more inclusive society where there is more choice and acceptance"". "

An Alliance Party amendment was also defeated. It would have emphasised the freedom of churches to practise and define marriage as they choose.After the amendment was rejected, the Alliance leader David Ford and two of his party colleagues abstained on the main motion.

He said Sinn Fein were ""guilty of engaging in a very cynical, political exercise which is of no benefit to any section of our community, not least the LGBT.""The amendment and the motion both fell."

But the Supreme Court ruled in June that circumstances had since changed and key elements of the Act were intended to be only temporary. In effect, the ruling brought an end to the requirement for federal ""pre-clearance"" of changes to election laws in 15 mainly Southern states.Gov McCrory, who is a Republican, said in a statement: ""Common practices like boarding an airplane and purchasing Sudafed require photo ID and we should expect nothing less for the protection of our right to vote.""The North Carolina law, as well as requiring voter identification, bans election-day registration and reduces the period allowed for early voting from 17 days to 10. College and university photo IDs will not be considered legitimate identification.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit challenging the changes, due to come into effect in 2016.""Eliminating a huge part of early voting will cut off voting opportunities for hundreds of thousands of citizens,"" ACLU official Dale Ho told North Carolina media.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a speech in San Francisco on Monday, criticised the court's ruling, arguing that ""anyone who says racial discrimination is no longer a problem in American elections must not be paying attention"".Texas passed its own voter ID law in 2011 and US Attorney General Eric Holder said last month he would challenge the legislation, describing the Supreme Court's June ruling ""flawed""."

""We have been working over the past several months to improve our systems to respond to reports of violations, but the guidelines used by these systems have failed to capture all the content that violates our standards.""Facebook has been involved in a number of recent rows over content.At the beginning of May, it reversed a decision not to remove a video which showed a man being beheaded as it did not break the social network's policy.Following this most recent outcry, Ms Levine put forward several changes the social network would be making.She said Facebook would consult lawyers and interest groups to upgrade its guidelines on removing hate speech.Training of staff will be stepped up, again by working with interest groups to ensure coaching is appropriate.Facebook also pledged to work to make sure the posters of such material were made to ""stand behind the content they create"" so that other users could hold them accountable.Commenting on Ms Levine's blog post, many Facebook users expressed annoyance at the length of time it had taken for the issues to be addressed.""It took incredible public pressure for you to look at it... you should have had the guts and morals to do it on your own!"", wrote one user.Facebook's response comes off the back of a large-scale online campaign from a number of prominent women's rights groups. They included the Everyday Sexism Project, a site that uses social media to highlight what it sees as casual sexism in the media and other arenas.In addition to their letter to the social network, the groups also called on advertisers to boycott the site, noting that their advertising appeared alongside user-created pages showing images of violence towards women that were ""shared, boasted and joked about"".One petition calling for action closed with 225,049 signatures.The groups called on Facebook to take three specific actions. They were to:""Recognize speech that trivializes or glorifies violence against girls and women as hate speech and make a commitment that you will not tolerate this content.""Effectively train moderators to recognize and remove gender-based hate speech.""Effectively train moderators to understand how online harassment differently affects women and men, in part due to the real-world pandemic of violence against women.""According to campaigners Women, Action & the Media, one high-profile advertiser, Nissan, suspended its advertising on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the company told the BBC that following Facebook's assurances, it had begun advertising on the platform again.UK building society Nationwide also took action to remove its promotions: ""We welcome the initial commitments made by Facebook yesterday to continue to improve their responses to violations of standards.""As a responsible and trusted consumer brand, we do feel that sites like Facebook should have stringent processes and guidelines in place to ensure that brands are able to protect themselves from appearing alongside inappropriate content.""Others brands such as Dove said they were working ""aggressively"" with Facebook to attempt to solve the problem.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC"
6936	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23051808	Opinion	1	Civil Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The US Supreme Court has struck down a key part of a landmark civil rights-era electoral law designed to protect minority voters.By a margin of 5-4, the justices quashed section 4 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.They ruled that an updated formula was needed to decide which jurisdictions' election laws need monitoring.The law requires all or parts of 15 US states, mostly in the South, to receive federal approval for election changes. The Voting Rights Act was extended for 25 years by Congress in 2006 with broad support.""Congress did not use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula grounded in current conditions,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court's opinion. ""It instead re-enacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day.""The justices did not go so far as to strike down section 5 of the law, known as the pre-clearance provision, which requires certain states to get federal approval before making election-law changes.But since section 4, which sets the test for pre-clearance, has been found unconstitutional, the ruling effectively renders section 5 invalid until a new formula can be agreed by Congress.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was backed by three liberal-leaning colleagues, said in dissent that the court ""errs egregiously by overriding Congress' decision"".Reading aloud her view to a packed courtroom in Washington DC, she said there could be no doubt that voter discrimination still existed.""But the court today terminates the remedy that proved to be best suited to block that discrimination,"" she said.President Barack Obama said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the court's ruling, adding that the Voting Rights Act ""helped secure the right to vote for millions of Americans"".""Today's decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent,"" he said in a statement.Shelby County, in the southern state of Alabama, launched the legal challenge. It argued that the pre-clearance process was out of date and an over-reach of federal power.Critics of the voting law acknowledged that it may have been necessary in the 1960s, but they said times had changed and it was not longer appropriate to hold Southern states accountable for past wrongs.Alabama Governor Robert Bentley told the Birmingham News the decision was ""the most significant ruling"" in his lifetime.""Was there a reason to pass the Voting Rights Act 48 years ago? Yes, there was,"" Mr Bentley said. But he said ""areas of discrimination"" had been ""addressed"".""As governor, I can assure you we're not going to have discrimination in the state of Alabama based on race, especially related to voting,"" he said.The Voting Rights Act was intended to stop practices such as literacy tests, poll taxes or similar measures to keep black people from voting, in states with a history of racial discrimination.Supporters of the provision say recent efforts to change election laws in some parts of the US, including a series of voter identification laws, underline the voting act's continued relevance.Last year, the US justice department blocked changes to voter identification laws in the states of South Carolina and Texas.And a federal court ruled that a plan to change the boundaries of congressional districts in Texas discriminated against the state's large and growing Hispanic population.Activists in favour of preserving the law say that since the Voting Rights Act was renewed seven years ago, as many as 31 proposed changes to election laws have been blocked by Washington.Last week, the US Supreme Court struck down a state law in Arizona that would have required registered voters to provide proof of citizenship at the polls.Democrats say stricter voting laws, mainly championed by Republican legislatures, are designed to make it harder for minorities - who tend to vote Democratic - to cast their ballots."

""He's not just my son, he's all of our son and we have to fight for our children,"" Sabrina Fulton said.Earlier she told the BBC many young African Americans had been left afraid by the acquittal of neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.She called for a change to laws in many American states which allow the use of deadly force if a person feels seriously threatened. Saturday's event comes a few days before the actual anniversary of the original march on 28 August 1963.King, who was assassinated in 1968, led about 250,000 people to the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall and delivered his famous speech from its steps.""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character."" he said, in one of the most celebrated pieces of American oratory.Martin Luther King III, King's eldest son, told the marchers from the same steps on Saturday: ""This is not the time for nostalgic commemoration nor is this the time for self-congratulatory celebration. ""The task is not done. The journey is not complete. We can and we must do more."" In his speech, Mr Holder said of the 1963 demonstrators: ""They marched in spite of animosity, oppression and brutality because they believed in the greatness of what this nation could become and despaired of the founding promises not kept.""The spirit of 1963, he said, now demanded equality for gay people, Latinos, women, the disabled and others. Organisers had hoped to gather some 100,000 people in Washington. The crowd was predominantly African American but included white Americans and others.Mr Obama, the first black US president, is due to commemorate the event on Wednesday with a speech from the same spot where King spoke. He will be joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, while churches and groups have been asked to ring bells at 15:00 (19:00 GMT) to mark the exact time King delivered his speech."

And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,"" Mr Obama said in a statement.He asked Americans to respect the Martin family's call for calm reflection and to ask ""if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities"".  ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis.  ""We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.  As citizens, that's a job for all of us.  That's the way to honour Trayvon Martin."" Prosecutors had argued that Mr Zimmerman, 29, opened fired on 26 February 2012 because he racially profiled Trayvon Martin as he walked through his neighbourhood wearing a hooded sweatshirt in the rain, and assumed he was up to no good. Trayvon Martin was African-American. Mr Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.But the defence said he shot Trayvon Martin in self defence after the teenager had punched their client, slammed his head into the pavement and reached for Mr Zimmerman's gun.Mr Zimmerman was facing possible conviction for second-degree murder or manslaughter. On Saturday he was cleared of all charges by the six-woman jury at Seminole County Criminal Justice Center in Sanford, Florida. Defence lawyer Mark O'Mara said he was ""ecstatic"", and that Mr Zimmerman ""was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self defence"". ""I'm glad that the jury saw it that way,"" he said.Another defence lawyer, Don West, said the prosecution of his client had been ""disgraceful"".""As happy as I am for George Zimmerman, I'm thrilled that this jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty,"" he said.However, following the verdict, protest marches were staged in US cities including San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta.In Oakland, California, some protesters started small fires and smashed windows.Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson told CNN on Sunday: ""I remain stunned at the decision. The Department of Justice must intervene to take this to another level.""In a Facebook posting, he said ""the American legal system has once again failed justice"". But he also appealed for calm, saying anyone seeking to ""compound our pain with street justice"" would do ""damage to the innocent blood and legacy of Trayvon Martin"". Rights activist Al Sharpton also appealed for calm, but said the verdict was ""a slap in the face to the American people"".He compared the case to the beating of African-American man Rodney King by police in 1991, which sparked widespread rioting.A petition launched by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), demanding that the DoJ open a civil rights case against Mr Zimmerman, had received more than 350,000 signatures by midday on Sunday.The petition says that ""the most fundamental of civil rights - the right to life - was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin"".Daryl Parks, lawyer for the Martin family, told BBC News he hoped the case would be a wake-up call for the US.""Many will realise that if there is a law that would allow you to kill an unarmed teenager, then that's a law that we probably should look at and change,"" he said.Florida police had angered many by not arresting Mr Zimmerman for six weeks after the shooting, citing the state's controversial ""stand your ground"" law, which allows a citizen to use lethal force if he or she feels in imminent danger. But Mr Parks said the trial had given the US ""a new perspective on black life - when a young black person gets killed, the approach that it takes to investigate, to arrest the person that did it"".Meanwhile Mr Zimmerman's family and representatives have said they are afraid he could fall victim to revenge attacks.His brother, Robert said he had received frequent threats on social media and there was ""more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him"". ""He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,"" he said."
6992	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21947712	News	1	Civil Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"A US law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman only has been sharply criticised by Supreme Court justices at a landmark hearing.A judge considered the court's swing vote joined four liberal colleagues in questioning the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act (Doma).Legal analysts speculated that the law, which denies various federal benefits to gay couples, may be struck down.A ruling on the case is expected by the end of June.At the same time, America's highest court is expected to issue a decision about California's gay marriage ban, which it debated a day earlier.For nearly two hours on Wednesday, the nine justices in Washington DC grilled lawyers on the constitutionality of Doma, with five of them making sceptical remarks about the 1996 law.Doma denies married gay and lesbian couples the same federal rights, such as tax breaks and welfare benefits, granted to heterosexual couples.Justice Anthony Kennedy, seen as the swing vote between liberal and conservative justices, said he was ""troubled"" by how the law appeared to intrude on states' authority to define marriage as they saw fit.""The question is whether or not the federal government under a federalism system has the authority to regulate marriage,"" he said.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal, suggested the law created a two-tiered system of wedlock.""There are two kinds of marriage: full marriage and the skim-milk marriage,"" she said.Her colleague, Elena Kagan, said Doma was ""infected by animus, fear and dislike"".Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked: ""What gives the federal government the right to be concerned at all about what the definition of marriage is?""The Obama administration refused to defend Doma in court, having deemed it unconstitutional. Instead, a group of House Republicans hired a lawyer to argue in favour of the  law.Chief Justice John Roberts questioned why President Obama did not have ""the courage of his convictions"" to stop enforcing the law.Signed by President Bill Clinton, Doma has already been ruled unconstitutional by several lower courts.The case against Doma was originally brought by New Yorker Edith Windsor, 83, who was required to pay more than $350,000 (£220,000) of federal inheritance taxes after the 2009 death of her wife, Thea Spyer.Outside the court on Wednesday, Ms Windsor said: ""The justices were gentle, I didn't feel any hostility. I think it's going to be good.""On Tuesday the Supreme Court heard arguments in another gay marriage case, on the legality of a California constitutional amendment banning same-sex unions.Proposition 8 was approved by California voters in a referendum in 2008.Supporters of gay marriage are hoping the court could erase bans on same-sex marriages nationwide.But legal analysts say the justices' comments on Tuesday did not seem to promise such a sweeping ruling.Currently, nine US states and Washington DC permit same-sex marriage. Twelve other states allow civil unions or domestic partnerships that provide varying degrees of state marriage benefits.Recent opinion polls have shown a steady rise in support for same-sex marriage in the US, together with declarations in favour of it by political figures such as Hillary Clinton."

Pierre Servan-Schreiber, the Hopis' French lawyer, bought one mask for 13,000 euros and also intended to return it to the tribe.Responding to news of the Annenberg Foundation's purchase, Sam Tenakhongva, a Hopi cultural leader, said: ""This is a great day for not only the Hopi people but for the international community as a whole.""The Annenberg Foundation set an example today of how to do the right thing.

The family started a petition calling for the law ""to make dog owners accountable"". They asked for police to be able to prosecute dog owners if their animal attacks ""somebody on private property.""The government said in a May debate it was planning to extend police powers to deal with attacks on private property.The two met Environment Minister Lord de Mauley in Westminster alongside Bolton West Labour MP Julie Hilling to discuss their concerns.Mr Anderson, 34, said: ""It is about responsible dog ownership, as a dog owner you should be responsible for your dogs.""Something needs to be done about it, we are talking about saving lives and helping people.""The Andersons said there should be more early intervention with owners and more help for councils and police forces to deal with potential problem animals.Police officers investigating Jade's death said there was no evidence to prove a crime has been committed and no prosecutions are being sought ""at this stage"".The dogs involved in the attack, thought to be two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers, are not illegal breeds.The Dangerous Dogs (Amendment) Bill aims to remove the immunity from prosecution of dog owners whose animal attacks someone on private property.Under the plans for England and Wales, announced in February, a dog owner could be prosecuted if they fail to stop their dog attacking someone on their own, or someone else's property.Julie Hilling said: ""The biggest issue we want are preventative measures, so we can actually have dog control notices or similar so there can be early intervention so people are helped to be responsible owners.""She added the bill will be good for ""people who come to the attention of the police and the authorities"", but ""early intervention"" is also needed for dogs which show a potential danger to the community.Speaking last month, Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Minister David Heath said he was confident the proposed Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill would help tackle irresponsible dog ownership.A second reading for the bill in the House of Commons is set for 10 June."

But most benefits had been off-limits until the Supreme Court ruling.""It is now the department's policy to treat all married military personnel equally,"" Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a memo on Wednesday to senior Pentagon officials.The Pentagon also stated it would grant leave for military personnel stationed in a US state that does not permit same-sex marriage to travel to a jurisdiction where they can marry legally.""This will provide accelerated access to the full range of benefits offered to married military couples throughout the department and help level the playing field between opposite-sex and same-sex couples seeking to be married,"" said Navy Lt Commander Nate Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman.The change will enable homosexual troops and their spouses to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery near Washington DC.Defence officials estimate there are almost 18,000 same-sex couples in the US forces and among military retirees, but it is unclear how many are married.Gay marriage is legal in 13 states and the District of Columbia, but many other states have explicit bans on same-sex unions."
7207	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18114406	News	0	Civil Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Ministers are planning laws to tackle dangerous dogs. It's a problem that's worried our leaders since Roman times:Dogs were a feature of Roman life, used as weapons of war and kept as pets. The ancient 'lex Pesolania' could be seen as a forerunner to the Dangerous Dogs Act - making owners culpable for the behaviour of their dog. In the third century BC, unruly dogs were apparently such a problem that a law was passed that ensured owners were responsible for any injuries or damage the animal caused.""If a dog was in a square or public road and not tied up in the daytime and did mischief the owner was liable,"" according to the late Liberal MP and Roman historian Henry John Roby.A nineteenth century study of the British dog seems to suggest attacks on people have been a continuing cause for concern. According to George Jesse, dog-related fines were introduced under Alfred the Great. The law, which could date as far back as 849 AD, said: ""If a dog tear or bite a man, for the first misdeed let six shillings be paid."" Fines increased for repeat offences.  Under the act, Victorian Londoners could be fined up to 40 shillings if they let their dog loose ""in any thoroughfare or public place"".
        Anyone with an ""unmuzzled ferocious dog"" that they allowed ""to attack, worry, or put in fear any person, horse or other animal"" was liable.Dog owners in the rest of England faced the 40 shilling fine - or a new punishment of two weeks in prison - when the  
          
 
          Town Police Clauses Act of 1847
 extended the law to ""every person... in any street"" if their dog was deemed to be dangerous and not on a lead.
        The first piece of legislation giving the authorities power to seize a dog was passed almost a quarter of a century later. Described by the government as ""an act to provide further protection against dogs"", the  
          
 
          1871 Dogs Act
 gave a police chief the power to take a dog from its owner and either put it down or sell it.
        But then as now, the law had its opponents. The Lord Chancellor worried that an owner might still be liable even if they ""had no previous knowledge of any mischievous propensity in the dog"". What if a ""playful dog, intending no mischief, might tear a man's trousers?"" he asked peers. And while the act is still widely used by the authorities against dog owners today, it does not - short of confiscation - allow the courts to punish the owners of dangerous dogs.The government argue that because the act is not part of criminal law, the standard of proof is lower and - unlike the infamous 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act - it can be used to impose controls or confiscation of dangerous dogs where an offence has taken place on private property.  ""It is particularly appropriate for action on behalf of people such as postmen and women who are regularly at risk from dogs in front gardens,"" according to the Department for Food and Rural Affairs.Until 1987 dog owners were required to buy a 37p 'dog licence'. But the licence was widely ignored and when the first Dangerous Dogs Act was introduced, ministers said they would not reintroduce it. The 1989 act increased the 100-year-old powers available to the court - giving magistrates the power to disqualify perpetrators from owning a dog.Twenty-one years ago this week, six-year-old Rucksana Khan was playing in a park near her home in Bradford when she was savaged by a pit bull terrier and taken to hospital with critical head and chest injuries. The case - which followed 10 others in 1991 read out to Parliament by Bradford MP Bob Cryer - prompted the then home secretary to introduce a bill promising ""to rid the country of the menace of these fighting dogs"".Four types of dog were  
          
 
          banned under the act
, which makes it an offence for an owner to allow any dog ""to be dangerously out of control"". 
        But the legislation, which was rushed through following public outcry about the early 1990s attacks, has been criticised as not fit for purpose. Critics say there are no breeds predisposed to violence and that the act does nothing to deal with the root cause of dog attacks - the owners.""It's punitive rather than controlling,"" said Trevor Cooper, a solicitor who specialises in dog law. ""It tries to weed out certain types of dog but you can't prejudge a dog's behaviour. ""It's down to the way the dog has been brought up. There's no point continuously punishing people without dealing with the actual cause.""Mr Cooper, a legal adviser to the Dogs Trust, said the system of dog control notices in place in Scotland and Northern Ireland should be extended to England and Wales. This would be far more effective in preventing dog attacks as it would give the council the power to order owners to leash or muzzle their dogs and to take training courses, he said. Another problem in England and Wales is that the act does not cover attacks on private property.And in the last few years there have been a number of cases of babies, children and adults attacked and often killed in gardens and homes where, legally, the dog had every right to be.There are an estimated 5,000 dog attacks on British Telecom, Royal Mail and Parcel Force staff in England every year. Postal workers union the CWU estimate that 70% of the attacks on their staff happen on private property - so would not have been covered by the act.Conservative Home Office minister Tom Sackville told MPs in early 1997 that the Dangerous Dogs Act had ""achieved its main objectives"". He said the law had reduced the number of pit bulls and raised dog ownership standards. Rules were to be relaxed and courts were given more flexibility to decide whether a dangerous dog had to be put down. Although there was a change of government with Labour winning the 1997 election, they passed into law the measures the Conservatives had earlier proposed. Authorities were also given the power to impose controls on the offending dog - muzzling, leashing or neutering.Local authorities were given the power to issue orders to dog owners to control dog fouling, ensure dogs are kept on a lead and to keep them away from certain areas. The idea was to replace local byelaws to protect children's playgrounds, beaches or picnic areas from unruly dogs and their mess.Breach of a control order can attract a maximum fine of £1,000.Dog attacks appear to be on the rise. The number of people convicted for dangerous dog offences rose almost 40% between 2009 and 2010.And it's not just that the police might be giving the issue more attention. Dog-related hospital admissions have more than doubled from 2,915 in 1997 to 6,118 in 2010. In 2009 alone, dog attacks cost the NHS £3.3 million in treatment costs.

One of the women had been admitted to hospital twice because of pregnancy-related complications.And detainees who had clear human trafficking indicators - such as one woman who had been picked up in a brothel - had not been referred to the national trafficking referral mechanism, as required.Mr Hardwick said: ""Yarl's Wood still holds detainees in the middle of a distressing and difficult experience and more thought needs to be given to meeting their emotional and practical needs.""For the most vulnerable of the women held, the decision to detain itself appears much too casual.""John Tolland, Serco's contract director, said: ""We are really pleased that this inspection report recognises the improvements Serco has made at Yarl's Wood and considers it to be an establishment where residents feel safe and there is little violence.""Our managers and staff have worked hard to establish and maintain good relationships with the residents, who are vulnerable people in the middle of a distressing and difficult experience.""However, we are not complacent. As the HMCIP report says, we need to make further improvements and we are already working closely with the Home Office to implement their recommendations."""

Awaiting the winner is an international profile and a budget of $70bn (£45bn). So how does the job compare with mayors of other big cities?The new occupant of City Hall on Manhattan's Broadway will have more money to spend than a small country - and a population to match.So perhaps it's no surprise that when the identity of New York's next mayor is revealed in November's election, it will make news around the world.He or she will probably be the most powerful mayor on the planet, says Mitchell Moss, professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, because the job comes with unique executive powers - hiring and firing the people heading the city's key agencies like police and schools, while also setting the budget. ""The California governor doesn't even have that power. And the mayor controls the education of one million children. Education around the world is usually a national responsibility and not a city governor responsibility.""It's power that has come incrementally, ever since the British drove the Dutch out and gave the city control of its waterfront in the 17th Century. A recent addition came in 2002 when the vast schools system was reconfigured and made directly accountable to the mayor.The person heading the largest city in the US has often enjoyed an international profile. Ed Koch - who ushered in the city's boom and put the near-bankruptcy of the 1970s behind it - was often photographed riding the subway or walking the streets. And after 9/11, the no-nonsense figure of Rudy Giuliani came to represent the city and the country at its time of need.But these days, it's a job that doesn't hog the international stage on its own. The ever-quotable London Mayor Boris Johnson appears on primetime US television, and his predecessor Ken Livingstone struck a controversial oil deal in Venezuela with Hugo Chavez. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoe, drew praise for a free bike scheme which has been copied elsewhere. And the Olympic spotlight has now moved from Johnson to Rio's mayor, Eduardo Paes.""Mayors without question are very much consistent with the spirit of the age - visible, figurehead urban leaders who are a much better fit in a world of 24-hour news and the need for celebrity visibility,"" says local government expert Tony Travers of the London School of Economics. Bloomberg's forays into public health - the bans on smoking and trans-fats, and attempts to limit fizzy drink sizes - have inspired mayors the world over to intervene in health without fear of being accused of nannying, he says.In the UK, cities like London, Bristol, Liverpool and Leicester have begun to adopt - with varying levels of public interest, admittedly - the American model of a directly elected mayor, and the same has happened in German and Italian cities. Dublin could be next. But who is the most powerful? The New York mayor spends more money than London's, where much of the power is devolved to the 32 London boroughs (plus the City of London), including schools. But Bloomberg has little say over transport.Mayors who act as state governors are more powerful than Bloomberg but none has his influence, says Tann vom Hove, a senior fellow at the City Mayors Foundation, an international think-tank.""The previous mayor of Mexico City [Marcelo Ebrard] legalised abortion and introduced gay marriage, things the mayor of New York can't do. And the Berlin mayor can block federal legislation."" But there's a difference between the job description and the man, says Vom Hove. Bloomberg has probably been the most influential mayor through his personality and wealth, and it's unlikely the person that follows him will match that.Another candidate for ""most powerful"" city leader is Tokyo's governor, Naoki Inose. He is technically not a mayor, he acts as chief executive of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which is responsible for transport, secondary schools, hospitals, economic development, sewage and disaster management. His budget of £41bn ($63bn) is nearly the same as Bloomberg's but his powers are more far-reaching and he governs twice the number of people.Plus, according to the Japan Local Government Centre in London, only 7% of his revenue comes from central government, the smallest proportion compared to any other world city, including New York which receives 31% of its cash from federal sources.Many mayors operating on much smaller budgets have left their mark on history. Teddy Kollek, who served as Jerusalem mayor for nearly 30 years, was described as the most influential Jewish builder of the city since Herod the Great in Biblical times. And Pasqual Maragall was one of a succession of mayors in Barcelona who transformed the city in the post-dictatorship era. Mayors can be more effective than national politicians because there is less posturing, says Travers. If you govern a city of 10 million people, you have to make sure everything is working and the police are on the streets. They're not highly political acts, they're done by Conservatives, Labour, Republicans, Democrats and Socialists in the same way. Political theorist Benjamin Barber takes this argument a step further in his book, If Mayors Ruled The World, in which he says mayors are far better at addressing global issues than heads of nation states.Countries are dysfunctional in global relations, he argues, because they're walled states with borders strengthened by sovereignty and national culture. ""National political figures adhere to great historical norms and political ideologies but mayors have to fix things - they have to pick up the garbage and fix the sewer. They're problem solvers and that's what makes them pragmatic."" Cities already co-operate across borders, he says, either one on one or through global networks like the C40 network to tackle climate change.And now that a majority of the world's population is found in urban areas, perhaps this will be the century of the city - and the mayor.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

Ms Lerner, a career civil servant, declined to testify in Congress on the matter, citing protection under the US constitution against self-incrimination.Two senior IRS officials have already resigned over the affair.The additional IRS scrutiny given to political organisations seeking tax-exempt status under a section of US tax law covering non-profit groups began in 2010.That year, the US Supreme Court loosened restrictions on political spending by organisations unaffiliated with candidates' campaigns, leading to a surge in applications for tax-exempt status by newly created political groups.The practice, which the IRS has since halted, was first revealed in May by Ms Lerner. Investigators with the US treasury department subsequently confirmed civil servants in an IRS office in Ohio had drawn up a list of key words in organisations' names that would trigger extra scrutiny. Republicans suggested the undue attention to conservative groups was directed by the White House but have not produced any evidence to support the allegation.  The treasury department found no evidence of political influence in the matter and put the practice down to overworked civil servants seeking shortcuts. The agency's new chief later said the IRS watch list included a ""broad spectrum"" of political keywords, not just those indicating a conservative orientation.On Monday, the IRS said it had ""taken decisive actions to correct failures in exempt organizations management""."

Mr Carney said last week that the top White House lawyer, Kathy Ruemmler, was informed that the inspector general's investigation was under way in April, but he did not mention that more senior officials such as Mr McDonough knew.In 2010-12, the IRS was inundated with new applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status, after the US Supreme Court loosened restrictions on political spending by organisations unaffiliated with candidates' campaigns.According to IRS officials and the inspector general's report, in 2010-12 staff members at an IRS office in Cincinnati, Ohio used keywords such as ""Tea Party"" and ""patriot"" to select organisations for extra scrutiny.The Tea Party is a loosely organised movement of anti-tax conservatives, and in the American political lexicon, ""patriot"" can indicate a conservative orientation.The treasury department inspector general for tax matters has said he had found no evidence the IRS had acted under political pressure from the White House, and officials have said the practice was an effort to handle the heavy workload.Two top IRS officials have resigned over the matter, which Mr Obama has denounced as an unacceptable intrusion into citizens' political activities.The FBI has launched a criminal inquiry.

Mr Ledgett spoke to US television channel CBS about the possibility of an amnesty deal: ""So my personal view is, yes it's worth having a conversation about. ""I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high, would be more than just an assertion on his part.""

What do you do?""In an earlier interview with the Reuters news agency, Mr Ledgett said he was deeply worried about highly classified documents not yet public that are among the 1.7 million files Mr Snowden is believed to have accessed.Mr Snowden's disclosures have been ""cataclysmic"" for the agency, Mr Ledgett told Reuters.Earlier this month, a UK newspaper editor told UK MPs only 1% of files leaked by Mr Snowden had been published by the newspaper.The state department says its position has not changed and that Mr Snowden must return to the US to face charges, says the BBC's Suzanne Kianpour.The US has charged Mr Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.At the weekend, the NSA allowed a CBS television crew into their headquarters for the first time in its history, in an effort to be more open about what the agency does with the data it collects.

As many have already pointed out, President Obama had to avoid that moment of hubris when George W Bush declared the Iraq war won, before it went horribly wrong. So instead of standing on an aircraft carrier, there was a briefing down a phone line on Sunday morning from an official with lots of geeky detail and references to graphs. The upshot was that a lot of bugs had been fixed but the delicate website was to be treated like a sick but recovering patient, not to be exposed to too many stresses and strains.The focus would be on getting existing customers through the system, not taking on new ones. The real test will be over the next few days as politicians and journalists gleefully attempt to get the system to crash.The glitchy website has become a metaphor as well as a problem in its own right. If it doesn't function properly and get enough people on board, if not enough healthy people sign up, then Obamacare will fail on a very practical level. But beyond that it has become the ugly poster-child for the Republican contention that big government can't work and should have left healthcare alone. It raises concerns about the very complexity of the reforms. I've heard many ordinary Democrats wish that Obama had gone for the hugely more controversial but easy to understand big fix of a single payer system like the British NHS.Many others think he should have gone much smaller bore and fixed the system one problem at a time.

""I will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in any agency, but especially in the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives.""""The IRS has to operate with absolute integrity.""To that end, Mr Obama revealed that the treasury secretary had requested and accepted the resignation of acting commissioner of the IRS.""It's important to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward"".The president said the treasury department would also put in place new safeguards to ""make sure this kind of behaviour cannot happen again"" and that the IRS would begin implementing the TIGTA's recommendations immediately.In a letter to colleagues, Mr Miller said he would leave his role in June.""There is a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation's tax agency,"" he added.Mr Miller took over leadership of the agency in November, when the five-year term of Commissioner Douglas Shulman ended.At the time when conservative groups were targeted, Mr Miller was a deputy commissioner who oversaw the division responsible.On Tuesday, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration's report on the scandal placed the blame on ""ineffective management"".It found IRS managers had allowed ""inappropriate criteria"" to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, resulting in ""substantial delays"" in processing applications for tax-exempt status, and requests for ""unnecessary information"", such as lists of donors.Among the criteria used by the IRS Determinations Unit to flag groups for review, the TIGTA said, were having words like ""Tea Party"", ""Patriots"" and ""9/12"" in their names; or manifestos that focused on the government's fiscal policy and educating the public to ""make America a better place to live"", or criticised how the country was being run.Senior IRS officials told the watchdog that the decision to focus on conservative groups had not been influenced by any individual or organisation outside the agency.Some Republicans, including two high-profile governors, have called for a special prosecutor to investigate.House Speaker John Boehner told reporters earlier on Wednesday: ""My question is, who's going to jail over this scandal?""At least three Congressional panels are planning hearings, and House oversight committee chairman Representative Darrell Issa said he had asked five mid-level IRS employees be made available for questioning."

He is the first senior official to step down after the Democrats' heavy losses in the mid-term elections this month. The reason for his resignation is not yet clear.A senior defence official told the Associated Press news agency that it was ""time for new leadership in the Pentagon"".The New York Times said he was the first ""cabinet-level casualty"" of the mid-term loss of the Senate majority, and linked his departure to the rise of Islamic State militants.However, a White House official said the president and his 68-year-old defence secretary had been talking about his post since before the elections.""In October, Secretary Hagel began speaking with the president about departing the administration given the natural post-mid-terms transition time,"" the unnamed official told the BBC.Mr Hagel will remain as defence secretary until his replacement is confirmed by the Senate.Known as a straight-talking maverick, the former Nebraska Republican senator is a decorated war veteran who was appointed to replace Leon Panetta in February of last year after a bitter fight in Congress. He brought military experience to the job, having served as an infantry squad leader in the Vietnam war, where he was awarded two Purple Hearts, one for saving his brother's life.  On Iran sanctions: Isolating nations is risky... It turns them inward, and makes their citizens susceptible to the most demagogic fear mongering.On a nuclear Iran: These governments, however hostile they may be toward us, have some appreciation of the horrific results of a nuclear war and the consequences they would suffer.On the United Nations: [The] only international organization that can help bring the consensus that is indispensable in finding solutions and resolving crisesOn the Pentagon: Bloated budgets and lack of effective oversight and review are symptoms of deeper, structural inadequacy in our military postureFrom Chuck Hagel's 2008 book, America: Our Next Chapter The horrors of war are said to have shaped his view of military action as a last resort, to be used only after all diplomatic options have been exhausted.Born in North Platte, Nebraska, Mr Hagel grew up in a poor family, and began working odd jobs from the age of nine to help put food on the table.Upon returning from Vietnam, he took various jobs, including as a radio reporter, but made his fortune in the fledgling mobile phone industry.He was elected to the Senate in 1996 and again in 2002, where he rose to become chairman of a panel on the foreign relations committee. Mr Hagel's strained relations with the Republican party leadership were seen as a reason for his decision not to pursue a White House run in 2008.Some Republicans had never forgiven him for his strident criticism of George W Bush's administration during the Iraq war.Though he voted for the resolution authorising the conflict, he went on to become a fierce critic.Mr Hagel was appointed as President Barack Obama's defence secretary in February 2013, following a nomination that was stalled in the Senate by an unprecedented filibuster.His 58-41 confirmation was the narrowest ever vote margin for a Pentagon nominee.Lawmakers on the right had voiced concern because Mr Hagel had openly challenged the idea of a US- or Israeli-led military strike against Iran. His support for including Iran in peace talks on Afghanistan had raised eyebrows, too. Mr Hagel was also lambasted for saying in a 2008 book written by a former state department official that the ""Jewish lobby"" intimidated lawmakers in Washington. He apologised for that remark during his Pentagon confirmation hearing.On the left, some had also criticised his remarks about James Hormel, the first openly gay US ambassador, in 1998, in 1998, whom he described as ""aggressively"" gay. He later regretted that comment.According to the New York Times report of his resignation, it was ""recognition that the threat from the Islamic State would require a different kind of skills than those that Mr Hagel was brought on to employ"".  However, Mr Hagel's aides had maintained in recent weeks that he expected to serve his full four years as defence secretary, the paper notes.In the days before his resignation was announced, Mr Hagel wore a sticking-plaster on his cheek. Asked by reporters why, he said he had had an ""incident"" with his kitchen cabinet door. ""I engaged the corner of a cabinet in my kitchen and it didn't turn out well for me,"" he said, making light of it."

And they called on senators to ask Attorney General Eric Holder, an Obama appointee, why the federal government had not already taken action when he testifies in Congress on Wednesday.Under the US Constitution, federal law trumps state law, and the US is bound by international treaty to keep cannabis illegal, argue the former DEA chiefs, who worked under both Democratic and Republican presidents.In the two states where voters have legalised recreational cannabis use, ""the process of writing regulations is underway and it will become harder to rescind the legislation,"" Peter Bensinger, who ran the DEA under Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, told the BBC.He added the Obama administration should sue Colorado and Washington state as it recently had the state of Arizona over an immigration measure it deemed clashed with federal law.Mr Bensinger warned that full implementation of the legalisation laws would ""cause havoc"" in the communities, schools and roads of Colorado and Washington state.""The highways would be littered with fatalities because you're going to have increased use and marijuana stays in the body much longer than alcohol,"" Mr Bensinger said.But Sanho Tree, a drug policy analyst who supports legalisation, said the former DEA chiefs' warnings were ""scare tactics"".Their letter is an attempt to goad the Obama administration into a show-down with the states in the Supreme Court, said Mr Tree, director of the drug policy project at the Institute for Policy Studies.""Most of these drug policy statements are about turf, which is really about budgets,"" said Mr Tree. He said drug enforcement agencies were attempting to ""maintain a monopoly on doctrine"".He said the federal government must be realistic about changing attitudes towards the drug, and he said that in states with medical marijuana laws in place, critics' worst fears had not come to pass."

They were lifted on Monday after it was agreed those issuing the threat were already aware of the men's identity.Restrictions remain in place regarding the details of future court appearances.Lawyers representing the accused told the court how threats identifying their clients had been posted on a republican website.

The measure is backed by the government of President Jose Mujica, who says it will remove profits from drug dealers and divert users from harder drugs.Under the bill, only the government would be allowed to sell marijuana.The state would assume ""the control and regulation of the importation, exportation, plantation, cultivation, the harvest, the production, the acquisition, the storage, the commercialisation and the distribution of cannabis and its by-products"".Buyers would have to be registered on a database and be over the age of 18. They would be able to buy up to 40g (1.4oz) per month in specially licensed pharmacies or grow up to six plants at home. Foreigners would be excluded from the measure. The bill was approved by 50 of the 96 MPs present in the lower house following a fierce 13-hour debate in the capital, Montevideo.The supporters of the measure argued that the fight against drugs and drug trafficking had failed, and the country needed ""new alternatives"". ""The regulation is not to promote consumption; consumption already exists,"" said Sebastian Sabini of the governing centre-left Frente Amplio (Broad Front) coalition, which has a majority of one in the lower house.Marijuana use has reportedly doubled in Uruguay over the past year. An estimated 22 tonnes of marijuana are being sold in the country annually, according to Uruguay's National Drugs Committee.But Gerardo Amarilla of the opposition National Party said the government was ""playing with fire"" given the health risks he said were linked to marijuana use. All eyes were on Dario Perez, a member of the governing coalition but a strong opponent of the bill, whose vote could have scuppered the bill.During his 20-minute speech, Mr Perez reiterated his belief that the issue should be put to a referendum and not have been ""imposed"" by the government. But to applause by supporters of the bill in the public gallery, he finally concluded that as long as he was a member of the coalition, he would vote with it, despite his personal misgivings.The bill is now expected to be approved by the Senate, where the left-wing government has a bigger majority. But opposition politicians said that even if the law made it through the senate, they would launch a petition to have it overturned. A survey carried out before the vote by polling organisation Cifra suggested 63% of Uruguayans opposed the bill. The progress of the bill is being watched closely across the region, says BBC Mundo correspondent in the region Ignacio de los Reyes.For decades, drug trafficking has caused tens of thousands of deaths throughout Latin America.Uruguay may have not experienced the bloodshed caused by drug trafficking, but the proposal could be seen as a test for violence-torn nations looking for an end to their drug wars, our correspondent adds. The vote also comes just days after Pope Francis criticised drug legalisation plans during a visit to neighbouring Brazil.The pontiff said it was ""necessary to tackle the problems which are at the root of drug abuse, promoting more justice, educating the youth with the values that live in society, standing by those who face hardship and giving them hope for the future""."

A pardon attorney reportedly left out new, key information in the 2008 version of Aaron's bid for clemency to the White HouseBefore this, Mr Obama had commuted only one sentence in the five years of his presidency, also involving another drug case, and had pardoned 39 people.On Thursday, the president also pardoned 13 others for various crimes. All had already served their full prison terms.A pardon forgives a crime and wipes out the conviction, while a commutation leaves the conviction but ends the punishment. In August, US Attorney General Eric Holder announced a major shift in federal sentencing policies, targeting long mandatory terms that he said have flooded the nation's prisons with low-level drug offenders and diverted crime-fighting dollars that could be far better spent.

Le, a project co-ordinator at an executive search firm, had a more intuitive reaction, with an expletive.As strangers started donating to their wedding gift registry, Cassesso and Le directed the funds to The Covenant House, a charity for homeless young people, a group the couple think will be adversely affected by the shutdown.They have found another venue for Saturday's wedding in Washington DC, and he says the ordeal has a silver lining.

The demonstrators included farm labourers, domestic workers, union leaders and immigration activists.""We won't win immigration reform just coming to Washington,"" said Ben Monterroso, of the Service Employees International Union. ""We need to walk the streets all over the country.""Organisers in Washington DC said about 400 coaches brought people into the US capital for the rally in favour of immigration reform.Democratic lawmakers, including New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and Illinois Congressman Luis Gutierrez, spoke while Latino musicians Olga Tanon and La Santa Cecilia performed.In the halls of the US Senate, a bipartisan group of senators is close to a deal on legislation that would require tough border security measures to be in place before undocumented immigrants could gain legal status.It would also enable tens of thousands of legal immigrants to come to the US under a guest worker programme.Groups favouring stricter immigration laws say the reforms under consideration would exacerbate financial problems for state and local governments and would lead to higher levels of illegal immigration.""There ought to be a rally for the 20 million Americans who can't find a full-time job,"" Roy Beck, president of Numbers USA, said in a statement on Wednesday.The bill is expected to be unveiled within days and it could proceed to a vote before the Memorial Day holiday weekend at the end of May.The US has not undertaken a major push to reform the immigration system since 2007, when a bipartisan bill failed in the Senate.In 2010, Congress debated but did not approve the Dream Act, which would have given legal status to some young immigrants who came to the US as children.In June, President Barack Obama unveiled a programme to allow young undocumented workers who immigrated as children to apply for two-year, renewable visas. He has expressed optimism that an immigration bill could be passed in the first half of 2013."

It would still leave the government shut down. It is not certain to succeed. The White House briefing is due soon - but a holding statement doesn't exactly enthusiastically embrace the offer.Once Republicans in Congress act to remove the threat of default and end this harmful government shutdown, President Barack Obama will be willing to negotiate a broader budget agreement to create jobs, grow the economy and put our fiscal house in order. First intelligence from up on the Hill suggests that getting enough Republican votes could be hard. There will be a backlash from some supporters who will feel betrayed. How loudly they shout now could change the calculations. And even if the initial deal is done it will mean at least six weeks of jittery uncertainty hanging over the American economy.

His theme was so important, he said, it was the very reason he wanted to become president, it was ""the defining challenge of our time"". It doesn't mean anything is going to happen. This raises what, to me, is the puzzle at the heart of Mr Obama's presidency. What does he think he is here for? Often he looks like the inspirational in pursuit of the unattainable.The minimum wage is part of a long list, from gun control to immigration reform, of things that he would like to do but can't because of Republicans in Congress.So he makes speeches about them. Now words do matter. They are a politician's ammunition. In theory at least, if he was persuasive enough, he could help sweep away the opposition to his policies by winning back the House in next year's midterm elections. But few think that is really going to happen.In this scathing article, Peggy Noonan, former President Ronald Reagan's speechwriter, argues that Mr Obama has been exposed as a man of words and not action, and that is the result of a style of government. It's harsh but worth considering, not least because Mr Obama should have been aware of the pitfalls of the job. The feeling of powerlessness of the very powerful is well known. A British minister once told me that Mrs Thatcher used to sit in her flat above Number 10 watching some piece of news, complaining that the government really should stop it happening (whatever it was). Her husband would gently point out that she was Prime Minister. Mr Obama must feel the same. He is the most powerful man in the world, according to one cliche, but he can't get anything he wants done. Mr Obama is very good at analysing a problem, expressing it and crusading, exhorting, campaigning on it. But it is increasingly obvious that he hasn't found a way of getting stuff done. "

The state Assembly, which had already passed a separate version, will vote on the Senate's version, a procedure analysts described as a mere formality.Mr Brown, who supports the bill, has said the minimum wage has not kept pace with rising costs in California, which is the largest state by population in the US.""This legislation is overdue and will help families that are struggling in this harsh economy,"" he said on Wednesday.But some business leaders warned the higher wage would hamper their ability to operate and force them to cut back working hours and put off hiring.The California Restaurant Association called the proposal a ""back breaker"".""A 25% increase in labor costs will result in fewer job opportunities for Californians looking to get back on their feet,"" the group said on its website.The bill's approval comes amid a growing strike campaign by fast-food workers in dozens of US cities in demand of higher wages.President Barack Obama and some in Congress have advocated raising the US minimum wage, as the nation's income gap continues to widen.Recent data indicates the top 1% of US earners collected 19.3% of household income in 2012."

This is not an abstraction. People will lose their jobs.""The president added that the effect of the so-called sequester, as the raft of budget cuts are known in Washington DC, was already being felt in some government departments, noting the Navy had delayed the deployment of a carrier to the Gulf.""Changes like this, not well thought through, not phased in properly, changes like this affect our ability to respond to threats in unstable parts of the world,"" Mr Obama said.He also said that while he was open to cutting back on unsuccessful or unnecessary government programmes, he accused Republicans of ""ideological rigidity"" for opposing tax increases.He proposed closing some tax loopholes to increase revenue, and backed a budget plan put together by Senate Democrats last week.Mr Obama said the deep, across-the-board spending cuts had originally been designed to be so unattractive that they would spur politicians to work together.Congressional Republicans have given a frosty reception to the Senate Democrats' proposal. They point out that Mr Obama already won a revenue increase in the new year, when Congress allowed taxes to rise on families making more than $450,000 annually.In response to the president's remarks, House Speaker John Boehner said: ""The American people understand that the revenue debate is now closed.""Tax reform is a once-in-a generation opportunity to boost job creation in America. It should not be squandered to enable more Washington spending. Spending is the problem, spending must be the focus,"" he said in a statement.Congress is in recess this week, leaving little time to negotiate a budget solution ahead of the 1 March deadline.Democrats have suggested increasing revenues by closing some tax loopholes, including tax breaks for the oil and natural gas industry, for businesses that have outsourced labour from the US, and ensuring millionaires pay a tax rate of at least 30%.The Democratic plan does not include any changes to costly federal programmes such as the Medicare healthcare programme for over-65s and the Social Security pension programme.Many Republicans have supported closing some loopholes, but they say the changes should be part of a broader overhaul of the tax code, not a way to plug gaps in the budget.The ""sequester"" was originally due to take effect on 1 January, along with a series of other measures known as the fiscal cliff.But, amid dire warnings that the package of across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases could tip the US back into recession, lawmakers pushed back the spending cuts by two months, saying the delay would give them time to shape a larger budget deal.Little progress on such a plan has been seen in recent weeks.Also on Tuesday, a bipartisan proposal from the co-chairs of a deficit-reduction committee recommended the government find savings of $2.4tn over the next 10 years.The proposal from former Republican Senator Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles, President Bill Clinton's former chief of staff, suggests taking about a quarter of savings from changes to healthcare programmes and another quarter from new revenue from tax changes.They have said the mandatory cuts are too steep and would damage the economy."

Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid told the chamber on Monday evening: ""We've made tremendous progress.""We hope with good fortune... perhaps tomorrow will be a bright day. We're not there yet.""Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also sounded upbeat, hailing ""substantial progress"".Democratic Senator Mark Pryor told CNN he was ""pretty confident"" an agreement would be announced on Tuesday afternoon, but said some Republicans ""almost want a shutdown"".""They almost want to see us break the debt ceiling,"" he said.Republican Senator Richard Shelby called the proposed short-term agreement a ""temporary fix"".""It's punting because no one, Democrats, Republicans, wants to face up... to the tough reality that we're in,"" he told Associated Press news agency.Meanwhile, on Tuesday morning leaders of the Republicans who control the House of Representatives announced they intended to pursue their own debt ceiling and government funding bill.Their bill would alter the Affordable Care Act, Mr Obama's signature healthcare overhaul, delaying a tax on medical devices for two years and requiring income verification before insurance customers were eligible for government subsidies.Under that proposal, the government would be funded through 15 January and the debt ceiling lifted until 7 February.Mr Obama and congressional Democrats have said they are unwilling to negotiate over the Affordable Care Act while the government remains shut and the threat of a debt default looms.By Tuesday morning Democrats appeared to have fended off Republican attempts to force any major changes to President Obama's signature healthcare law.Conservative hardliners were initially vocal in demanding that the White House agree to delay or eliminate funding for the Affordable Care Act.However, Senate Republicans are still reportedly pushing for slight modifications to the law. According to US media, they want stricter measures to verify the incomes of those seeking health insurance subsidies. Other measures include the suspension of a per-employee tax paid by companies and labour unions who participate in the health law, and the establishment of a committee to negotiate a longer-term budget.Even if a deal is reached in the Senate, it is unclear whether Congress could act in time to pass legislation that would avert the 17 October default deadline.Hardline conservatives such as Texas Republican Ted Cruz could use Senate rules to stonewall a vote.In the House of Representatives, a deal could meet fierce resistance from the Tea Party-aligned Republicans.One of those conservative hardliners, Kansas Representative Tim Huelskamp, was quoted by the New York Times as labelling his upper chamber colleagues ""the Senate surrender caucus"".""Anybody who would vote for that [Senate deal] in the House as Republican would virtually guarantee a primary challenger,"" he said.Republicans have taken the brunt of blame for the latest fiscal cliffhanger to cripple Capitol Hill, according to opinion polls. A Washington Post/ABC News survey on Monday found 74% of voters were unhappy with congressional Republicans' handling of the standoff, compared with a 53% disapproval rating for President Obama.Some in the party have voiced concern that the affair could damage its prospects in next year's midterm elections.Economists and bankers have warned for weeks of dire consequences should Congress fail to reach an agreement on raising the nation's debt ceiling.The US Treasury has been using what are known as ""extraordinary measures"" to pay its bills since the nation reached its current debt limit in May.Those methods will be exhausted by 17 October, US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said.Meanwhile, the government remains partially shut down because Congress failed to agree on funding by a 1 October deadline.The impasse has closed a swathe of federal services and left hundreds of thousands of employees out of work.

But he says he will not negotiate until Republicans agree to lift the dual threats of the government shutdown and the fiscal calamity looming if the US breaches the limit at which it is allowed to borrow money to fund its budget and debt obligations.On Tuesday, he said the Republicans were practicing ""extortion"" by demanding significant policy concessions, especially changes to his signature healthcare programme, in exchange for reopening the government and approving a rise in the debt ceiling.Leaders in the Republican Party, meanwhile, have attacked the president for refusing to negotiate.Following a meeting with Mr Obama on Wednesday, House Democrats, a minority in the chamber, reaffirmed their support for the president's demand that Republicans end the shutdown and raise the debt ceiling before negotiations take place.""We can talk while the government is open,"" Steny Hoyer told reporters.

The defence department typically pays $100,000, tax-free, within three days of a soldier's death, but the shutdown left it no authority to pay.White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that Mr Obama was ""disturbed'' to learn a previous bill ensuring military members were paid during the shutdown did not cover the benefit, but that the administration hoped to find a resolution to the problem.Shortly after the House vote, Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel announced the Pentagon had struck a deal with the Fisher House Foundation, a private charity, to fund the benefits until the shutdown ends.""I am offended, outraged, and embarrassed that the government shutdown had prevented the Department of Defense from fulfilling this most sacred responsibility in a timely manner,"" Mr Hagel said."

He speaks with quiet assurance, but you can tell his voice is one degree away from cracking. No wonder.He starts his question to the lawmakers on the platform with the simple statement that his son, a soldier, was killed in Pakistan in 2010.

We are talking here about the can that was kicked down the road at New Year, when Congress did a deal to avoid automatic tax increases.But they put off automatic spending cuts for two months. That deadline is almost up. The whole idea was meant to concentrate minds. Here is the theory: Democrats would hate the savaging of social programmes; Republicans would loathe the harsh reductions of military spending. So they would be forced to come together and find more sensible ways to reduce public spending.Cunning, eh? Only it has not worked. That is partly because some Republicans think bad cuts are better than no cuts at all.There is a sense of complacency on Capitol Hill that is totally lacking in Virginia Beach.

It is expected to come up for a simple majority vote on Wednesday.The Senate's top four Republican leaders - who are in the minority - voted to block consideration of the budget bill, though their opposition was mainly symbolic and they knew the bill would ultimately go forward, analysts say.

Is the state prepared to have this many people with no source of income?""Under a law passed in February by North Carolina's Republican legislature, the state forfeits federal funds that support the long-term unemployed by cutting the dollar amount of weekly benefits offered to shorter-term unemployed residents.While other US states have reduced the length of time unemployment benefits are paid out, most have spared weekly benefit payments, thereby avoiding the loss of federal assistance to the long-term jobless.A handful of states have approved cuts to weekly benefits that took affect after federal benefits expired - only then to see the federal benefits extended, the Associated Press reported.At the heart of the matter is $2.5bn (£1.6bn) in debt North Carolina owes to the US government, which the state accrued to pay for a sharp rise in demand for benefits during the 2009 economic meltdown.Under the February law, the state's budget will see a net increase of $3.6bn over four years. More than two-thirds of that comes from benefit cuts, with the rest made up in tax rises to employers.Much of the savings is being redirected toward the debt owed to the US.North Carolina officials hope the debt will now be paid down by 2015 or 2016, not 2018 as before the February law was passed.The law was signed by Republican Governor Pat McCrory in February. Mr McCrory said it would protect the state's small businesses from ""continued over-taxation"" while securing the unemployment safety net and encouraging businesses to create jobs.State Representative Julia Howard, the Republican who sponsored the bill, suggested the cuts would push out-of-work North Carolinians to find employment faster.""It may not be the job that you want or your career for the rest of your life,"" she said.Critics of the law say the state legislature has favoured businesses over the state's workers.

His theme was so important, he said, it was the very reason he wanted to become president, it was ""the defining challenge of our time"". It doesn't mean anything is going to happen. This raises what, to me, is the puzzle at the heart of Mr Obama's presidency. What does he think he is here for? Often he looks like the inspirational in pursuit of the unattainable.The minimum wage is part of a long list, from gun control to immigration reform, of things that he would like to do but can't because of Republicans in Congress.So he makes speeches about them. Now words do matter. They are a politician's ammunition. In theory at least, if he was persuasive enough, he could help sweep away the opposition to his policies by winning back the House in next year's midterm elections. But few think that is really going to happen.In this scathing article, Peggy Noonan, former President Ronald Reagan's speechwriter, argues that Mr Obama has been exposed as a man of words and not action, and that is the result of a style of government. It's harsh but worth considering, not least because Mr Obama should have been aware of the pitfalls of the job. The feeling of powerlessness of the very powerful is well known. A British minister once told me that Mrs Thatcher used to sit in her flat above Number 10 watching some piece of news, complaining that the government really should stop it happening (whatever it was). Her husband would gently point out that she was Prime Minister. Mr Obama must feel the same. He is the most powerful man in the world, according to one cliche, but he can't get anything he wants done. Mr Obama is very good at analysing a problem, expressing it and crusading, exhorting, campaigning on it. But it is increasingly obvious that he hasn't found a way of getting stuff done. "
8267	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21719946	News	1	Economy	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"This week's big bill is the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill, the measure which is supposed to avert another financial crisis, by enacting the recommendations of the Vickers Report.And to add a bit of spice to the proceedings, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking (the uber-committee investigating the City) will publish a report that very morning entitled Banking Reform: Towards the Right Structure. The Commission's last report on the bill said the government wasn't going far enough on key issues like requiring the banks to keep more capital in relation to their debts, and on enforcing a ring-fence within banks, between utility and ""casino banking"", where they want tougher rules, and a reserve power to allow the Treasury to enforce a split across the whole sector, if it decides that the old habits are reappearing.A lot of the Commission members radiate scepticism about the bill (which is a kind of skeleton measure, empowering Treasury ministers to write the detailed rules on the running of banks, the firewall etc) so expect quite an astringent offering, when the report appears, and no backing down from their previous position. This will matter, because there will doubtless be an attempt to amend the bill in the Commons - and the government might accept some changes - but that will be backed up by a much more serious threat in the Lords, where the Commission's membership can muster formidable support for the changes they want to make. That apart, any excitement in Parliament next week will probably come from the unscheduled business like ministerial statements or urgent questions - because the main agenda is pretty humdrum. Early in the week, watch the amendments put down for the Crime and Courts Bill....this has long been touted as a possible vehicle for introducing Lord Leveson's proposals for press regulation, but the deadline for putting amendments down to achieve that will fall next week. At the moment the Labour peer Lord Puttnam has attached ""Leveson"" amendments to the Defamation Bill, and the prime minister may end up dropping that much campaigned-for measure to liberalise the libel laws, rather than allow the Commons to vote on them. Attaching similar amendments to a different bill might both give the government more time to find a compromise and get the Defamation Bill off that particular hook. There's a bit of a queue of bills amended in the Lords building up, and they all have to be approved or rejected by the Commons... and the Defamation Bill's being held in a kind of parliamentary purgatory while alternative press regulation proposals, based on the Conservatives' preferred idea of a Royal Charter, are negotiated. But agreement seems to be elusive and without it there's a chance Labour and the Lib Dems might be able to push Leveson-style statutory regulation through. The bill has to be passed by the end of the Parliamentary year, early in May. Interestingly, this week's statement of forthcoming Commons business, by the Leader of the House, Andrew Lansley, mentioned that Tuesday 19 March has been set aside for ""proceedings on a bill"", which might signal the deadline for sorting out the issue and bringing the Defamation Bill back.  (And incidentally there's also talk that something similar might be attempted in the Lords, with a last minute attempt to attach Leveson amendments to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill....)Here's my rundown of the week's scheduled events....The Commons meets at 2.30pm on Monday for Work and Pensions questions, then - assuming no ministerial statements or urgent questions - MPs turn to the second reading Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill.In the Lords (from 2.30pm) questions to ministers range across inequality in income in the UK, access to justice for those who will not be able to receive free legal advice on social welfare law (and this is the latest shot in a guerrilla campaign against changes to legal aid rules which come into force from 1 April) and future railway re-openings.Then peers move onto their final scheduled half day of report stage debate on the much-mangled Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill - ministers lost three votes on detailed amendments this week. Expect at least one vote, on an amendment from the Labour peer, Lord Mitchell, on directors' pay. After that there are a series of short debates, and the two which caught my eye are on the recommendations of the Francis Report into the Mid-Staffordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and on a European Union Committee report on Somali piracy.Tuesday starts at 11.30am as the Commons sits for Treasury Questions and then the Conservative backbencher Graham Evans has a ten minute rule bill on National Commonwealth Military Day (one of a number of Commonwealth-related events this week). Then there are two Labour-led debates, on tax fairness and apprenticeships. In the Lords (at 2.30pm) questions cover the effective implementation of the stalking offences added to the Protection of Freedoms Act, last year, and the UK's lack of foreign language skills. Peers then turn to the second report stage day on the Growth and Infrastructure Bill - here watch out for an ambush aimed at the government's City Deals programme, which hands extra powers to city councils. Labour and Lib Dem peers will be pushing for an annual report on how that's working out. There could also be a vote on planning powers for broadband infrastructure in areas of outstanding natural beauty, following some lobbying from countryside groups. On Wednesday, the Commons begins work at 11.30am with International Development questions, followed at noon by prime minister's questions. After that the Labour MP Diana Johnson takes centre stage to move a ten minute rule bill to allow the Consecration of Women Bishops. This is intended to remind the Church of England that Parliament is increasingly impatient with the General Synod's failure to authorise what many MPs see as the next logical step after the decision to allow women priests - and there might be an attempt to ensure there's a vote, simply to emphasise the level of Commons support.Then MPs turn to the report and third reading stages of the Crime and Courts Bill (see above). The Lords (from 3pm) there's a question to ministers on their consultation of early years practitioners on plans to increase the maximum ratio of carers to babies and toddlers - and then peers move onto report stage consideration of the Succession to the Crown Bill, the measure which allows gender equality in the rules of succession, so an older princess will trump a younger prince, in future. This could bring some of the Lords' traditionalists to the fore - Lord Laing of Monckton has tabled an amendment to extend the number of people who still need the Queen's permission to marry, and Lord James of Blackheath has an amendment to require the approval of the Scottish Parliament. And they'll also debate Commons amendments to the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill.There's also a short debate - continuing this week's Commonwealth theme - on the impact of discrimination against gay men and women in Commonwealth countries on efforts to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS.On Thursday, the Commons sits at 9.30am for Energy and Climate Change questions, which will be followed by the weekly Business Statement, by the Leader of the House, Andrew Lansley. And the rest of the day is devoted to subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee: Sir Alan Beith launches of a report on Youth Justice, from the Justice Committee and then MPs discuss Accountability and Transparency in the NHS with MPs Charlotte Leslie, Philip Lee, Stephen Barclay, John Pugh, Sarah Wollaston and Kate Hoey leading the debate. Meanwhile, over in Westminster Hall there's a debate on Commonwealth Day led by Sir Alan Haselhurst, who chairs the UK Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. There was an attempt to get all Commonwealth parliaments to have a Commonwealth-themed debate on on Commonwealth Day, (Monday 11), but alas the UK Parliament didn't manage to arrange one, and this is the nearest they could get.  In the Lords, (from 11am) there are questions on forcing British companies to disclose any tax avoidance schemes that could be detrimental to poorer countries. That's followed by a debate on Afghanistan's regional relationships and their impact on its long-term future, and then peers will be asked to approve a couple of Church of England measures, on the diocese in Europe and clergy discipline.Neither House will sit on Friday"

The unemployment rate fell to 7.7% last month, the lowest since December 2008, from 7.9% in January, figures showed.But the White House's chief economist said more work was needed as Congress remained divided over economic policy.  Employment growth has risen by an average of 195,000 a month in the last three months, figures show. Analysts had forecast a rise of 165,000 jobs for February. Following the release of the jobs figures, stocks on Wall Street opened higher with the Dow Jones index up 62.23 points at 14,391.72. The dollar also gained against the euro and the yen. Professional and business services added 73,000 jobs last month, while the construction industry hired 48,000 employees. The health care industry added 32,000 jobs and the retail sector added 24,000 new staff. Only government lost 10,000 jobs in February, mostly in local education. The public education sector has now lost 340,700 jobs since its 2009 peak.But the number of long-term unemployed - out of a job for at least 27 weeks - was unchanged, accounting for about 40% of the jobless total.""Progress in the labour market is unmistakable. The economy is producing more than twice as many jobs as it did at the low point in the second quarter of last year,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at Worldwidemarkets.But he warned that optimism was ""relative"", because of slow economic growth. The economy in the October-December quarter made modest gains, growing at an annualised rate of just 0.1%.Analysts are now debating whether the labour market is strong enough to weather a series of public spending cuts, known as the sequester, and whether the Federal Reserve will continue with its loose monetary policy.The latest jobs report takes into account the period before the sequester officially began on 1 March.Last week, President Barack Obama signed into effect spending cuts worth $85bn (£56bn), although he warned that the cuts - if fully realised - would slow US economic growth by 0.5% and cost 750,000 jobs.The sequester was drawn up in mid-2011 as Congress and the White House feuded over raising the debt ceiling and how to slash the huge US deficit. Republicans wanted deep cuts in spending, while Democrats insisted on raising taxes as part of any plan to tackle the country's $16.6 trillion debt.Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said: ""While more work remains to be done, today's employment report provides evidence that the recovery that began in mid-2009 is gaining traction.""The White House continued ""to urge Congress to move toward a sustainable Federal budget"", he said, and warned against ""reading too much into any one monthly report"" as payroll estimates were volatile and could be revised substantially.John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, said: ""Any job creation is positive news, but the fact is unemployment in America is still way above the levels the Obama White House projected when the trillion-dollar stimulus spending bill was enacted, and the federal government's ongoing spending binge has resulted in a debt that exceeds the size of our entire economy."" The US Federal Reserve has said it will keep interest rates close to zero and will continue buying $85bn of bonds a month until there is a substantial improvement in the labour market.Jacob Oubina, senior US economist at RBC Capital Markets, said: ""This was a strong number and one of those rare cases where we were firing on all cylinders. Having said that, this will likely not mean much for Fed policy as they will need to see more than one month of strong numbers and if it is sustained."""

As a result, the FAA has reduced the work schedules of nearly all of its 47,000 employees by one day every two weeks.The staff include air traffic controllers and technicians who keep airport towers and radars working. President Barack Obama would now sign the bill, said White House press secretary Jay Carney, even though it fell short of broader action needed to address sequestration.""Ultimately, this is no more than a temporary Band-Aid that fails to address the overarching threat to our economy posed by the sequester's mindless, across-the-board cuts,"" said Mr Carney.President Obama had favoured wider action that would ease the budget cuts for federal agencies.The legislation would end the unpaid leave and allow for enough funding to prevent the closure of towers at small airports around the country.But correspondents say it is not clear how quickly services will be restored to normal.Thursday's Senate vote followed many hours of closed-door negotiations and the departure of several lawmakers - who had apparently given up hope of a deal - for a week-long recess.A small group of senators insisted on reaching an agreement before the holiday, amid warnings of political repercussions from continued airport delays.Airlines and unions representing airport employees have been pushing for a resolution in Congress.Robert Isom, head of operations at US Airways, said the FAA furloughs were like a ""wildcat regulatory action"".""In the airline business, you try to eliminate uncertainty,"" he said.

The US is expected to hit its $16.4tn (£10.2tn) statutory borrowing limit in mid February unless lawmakers act.The Republican move is designed to force the Democratic-controlled Senate to put forward a long-term budget plan.In the ongoing debate over how to rein in the $1.1tn US federal budget deficit, Republicans demand dramatic cuts in federal spending, while Democrats led by President Barack Obama seek what they call a balanced approach that includes new tax revenue.Republicans had previously threatened not to pass an increase in the debt limit unless it was paired with spending cuts. Democratic President Barack Obama, meanwhile, demanded they pass an unconditional debt limit increase and warned them they would not ""collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the economy"".""We are going to pursue strategies that will obligate the Senate to finally join the House in confronting the government's spending problem,"" House Speaker John Boehner told lawmakers at a Republican retreat in Virginia on Friday.""The principle is simple: `no budget, no pay.""'On Friday, the White House appeared cautiously to welcome the move but withheld comment on the ""no pay"" condition.""We are encouraged that there are signs that Congressional Republicans may back off their insistence on holding our economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare, education, and programmes middle class families depend on,"" spokesman Jay Carney said.Congress has not passed a budget since 2009. The US has instead maintained the government's spending through a series of stop-gap bills, the latest of which is set to expire on 27 March.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Senate Democrats had yet to decide how they would respond to the measure, but said it was ""reassuring to see Republicans beginning to back off their threat to hold our economy hostage"". The current fight over the debt limit comes less than three weeks after Congress and the White House struck a last-minute deal to prevent the so-called fiscal cliff of sharp spending cuts and tax increases.The last debt ceiling battle between Congress and Mr Obama ended in July 2011, after bringing the nation close to default on its debt and resulting in a credit rating downgrade as well as financial market turmoil."

""Congress can turn them off any time with just a little bit of compromise.""Unless Congress acts, the automatic cuts are set to take effect on Friday, part of a total $1.2tn in reductions over 10 years.Republicans say they will not agree to a deal that includes a tax rise.The budget cuts, known in Washington DC as the sequester, were devised in 2011 as an intentionally painful cudgel to encourage Democrats and Republicans in Congress to strike a deal to reduce the US budget deficit.Now, House Republicans say reduced spending should be the focus of any deal, while Mr Obama and the Democrats want a package to include new tax revenue by closing tax loopholes for wealthy Americans.With no deal in sight, on Sunday the Obama administration released fact sheets highlighting the threatened economic impact of the automatic cuts on a state-by-state basis.""These impacts will not all be felt on day one,"" Mr Obama told the governors on Monday, ""but the uncertainty is already having an effect.""Companies are preparing layoff notices. Families are preparing to cut back on expenses.

""And remind them in no uncertain terms exactly what is at stake and exactly who is at risk.""The defence department has said it will make redundant up to 46,000 temporary workers and cause employees to lose one day of work per week without pay from April, saving $5bn.In a separate press conference on Monday, homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano said queues at airport security checkpoints and at border crossings would lengthen considerably if the cuts were put into place.Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats are each trying to make sure the public blames the other side, should the automatic cuts take effect.Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, called the looming defence cuts ""unconscionable"" and urged Mr Obama to call lawmakers to the White House to work out a deal.""I won't put all the blame all on the president of the United States,"" Sen McCain told CNN.

She has been his deputy for the last two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve.Ms Yellen and Mr Bernanke are due to appear with the president on Wednesday.She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US.Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a ""dove"", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation.Her nomination has been widely expected since former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature last month amid opposition from liberal Democrats.As Democrats control the 100-seat Senate, Ms Yellen's appointment would only need six Republican votes to overcome potential any procedural hurdles.Some conservatives are scrutinising her views on monetary policy and her support for previous federal stimulus efforts.On Wednesday, the second-most powerful Republican in the Senate questioned whether she was the right choice.""Ms Yellen subscribes to the liberal school of thought that the best way to handle our nation's fiscal challenges is to throw more money at them,"" John Cornyn of Texas, the party's whip in the Senate, said in a statement.""This stimulus obsession is the reason the nation finds itself in the fiscal calamity it does today, and the last thing we need is a leader at the helm of the Federal Reserve who is intent on more quantitative easing that harms our economy.""Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement: ""I voted against Vice-Chairman Yellen's original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy.""  ""We will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed.""But Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said Ms Yellen would win Senate confirmation ""by a wide margin"".The chairman of the US Senate banking committee, Tim Johnson, said she had ""a depth of experience that is second to none"".""I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman,"" he added.The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be ""seamless"" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together.""I don't think there's going to be a radical change,"" she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus.Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC Ms Yellen's nomination was ""terrific news"". ""We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important,"" she said. ""Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate.""A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was ""battle tested"" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.

The budget predicts it will contract less than expected in 2013.But the OECD says the Greek economy will shrink for another year in 2014.Greece's 2014 budget forecasts 0.6% growth in 2014. Mr  Samaras said his government had exceeded four of five major targets it had set for 2013 - failing to bring down unemployment, which is around 27%.The OECD group of developed economies forecasts a 0.4% contraction next year and says Greece's debt would not fall below 160% of GDP before 2020.Since 2010, Greece has received rescue loans and in return, it has pledged to cut its debt and implement economic reforms.Those reforms, especially to the public sector, have been slow and met with often-violent street protests, leading to exasperation from its creditors. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup, said recently that ""many finance ministers of the eurozone are starting to lose patience"".  The bailout lenders - the eurozone, the IMF and the European Central Bank - have disputed some of the Greek government's figures, arguing that further spending cuts are needed.

In a statement, the White House said the Republican bill ""lifts the immediate threat of default and indicates that congressional Republicans have backed off an insistence on holding the nation's economy hostage to extract drastic cuts"" in social programmes.But it said passing a short-term measure added ""unnecessary complications"" and ""needlessly"" perpetuated fiscal uncertainty.The Republican proposal would suspend the current borrowing limit until 18 May, the House Ways and Means Committee said on Monday.It would also withhold pay from members of Congress from 15 April until a budget is passed.Republicans had previously threatened not to pass an increase in the debt limit unless it was paired with spending cuts.But President Obama refused to negotiate, demanding that lawmakers pass an unconditional debt limit increase.The current fight over the debt limit comes less than a month after Congress and the White House struck a last-minute deal to prevent the so-called fiscal cliff - a combination of sharp spending cuts and tax increases.The last debt ceiling battle between Congress and Mr Obama ended in July 2011, after bringing the nation close to default on its debt and resulting in a credit rating downgrade as well as financial market turmoil."

The trial to determine whether a city of Detroit's size can stop paying its bills will have huge potential repercussions for cities and states across the country. Perhaps no-one is awaiting the trial's outcome as much as Erma and Gordon MacDonald, who have been married for 63 years.""I'm smarter than her,"" jokes Mr MacDonald, 87. ""Only a stupid person would agree to marry me.""A jester at heart, Mr MacDonald says people always ask him why he laughs so much.Mrs MacDonald, 82, has an easy answer: ""It's so we don't cry.""In their tiny one-bedroom flat decorated with photos of their children and grandchildren, the MacDonalds grow silent.They contemplate a future in which the pension that Mr MacDonald earned over 39 years with the Detroit Police disappears - a potential casualty of Detroit's bankruptcy filing.""I don't know what else to say - we're up in the air,"" Mr MacDonald says. He worries more about his wife, who is in poor health, than about himself.""I take 15 prescriptions,"" says Mrs MacDonald, ""and I kind of jokingly said if they take [my healthcare] away, which pills do I stop without dying?""While it might seem unfathomable that the MacDonalds could face such a choice, the reality is that if Detroit's bankruptcy filing is allowed to proceed, the city will face extremely difficult decisions.Kevyn Orr, the emergency manager brought in to run the city by the state of Michigan, argues there is no way forward for Detroit other than through the fresh financial start that bankruptcy brings.The city is anywhere from $18bn (£11bn) to $20bn in debt - with $9bn a result of ballooning pension and healthcare costs.It has already cut basic services to the bone, pushing more residents to flee. The city's population now stands at 700,000, down from two million at Detroit's peak.Wait times for emergency calls now top one hour, and less than a third of the streetlights function. More than 80,000 properties have been abandoned. Nature, it seems, moves faster than federal court.Despite all the hardship, those representing the city's pension schemes say a bankruptcy filing would allow the city to renege on promises made long ago.They dispute Mr Orr's calculations, and say it's unfair that the 23,500 retirees who spent their lives working to keep Detroit safe and clean could be left with nothing.""They're taking away the American dream and turning it into the American nightmare,"" says Donald Hall, who spent 29 years as a detention centre officer and now depends on the $850 he receives from the city every month.There's no question that Detroit is unique among US cities, to fly so high and fall so far, to build landmarks like the majestic Michigan Central Station that less than a hundred years later have the aura of Roman ruins.So then what impact, if any, could a successful bankruptcy filing have on other cities?""On the one hand, Detroit is in an unusual position because it has had massive depopulation coupled with a collapse of the industrial sector,"" says University of Michigan law professor John Pottow, an expert in bankruptcy law.""On the other hand, Detroit was not alone in making legal commitments to people which it had no funding for.""According to a study by economists at Northwestern University, cities and counties across the US have a total of $574bn in unfunded pension obligations.Already, cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, and San Diego, California, have shown signs they are crumbling under the weight of the financial promises made to retirees.""If Detroit is able to file for bankruptcy, then every other big city is going to be watching this,"" says Prof Pottow.James Canty is a lifelong Detroit resident and manager of the city's parking department. I followed him on his daily rounds as he tried to rid the city of some of the thousands of abandoned cars that line its streets.The job was once done by the police. Now, Mr Canty's team has taken on the role of enforcer in an attempt to free up overworked officers.In neighbourhoods where it's hard to tell which, if any, of the houses are occupied, Mr Canty points to a white Chevrolet sedan with shattered windows here, a pick-up truck missing a wheel there.Frequently, as soon as a tow truck arrives to remove the offending vehicle, the vehicle's owner suddenly appears, as if by magic.The excuses are often similar - what looks like a derelict car is in fact in the process of being mended.It's not hard to see Detroit's financial position in the same way as these dented and decrepit cars - they may or may not be broken, depending on who is looking at them.Is it better to clear the way for something new - or to be forced to fix what only appears beyond repair?"

The announcement followed a two-day meeting in Washington DC.The Fed's decision to begin to ease its extraordinary stimulus efforts also indicates that the central bank believes that the US economy has finally strengthened enough that it no longer needs as much support.The $10bn reduction comes from two areas: the Fed will reduce its US Treasury purchases from $45bn to $40bn per month as well as its buying of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) from $40bn to $35bn per month.In its forecast for the coming years, the Fed said the employment situation will improve faster than previously expected.It said the unemployment rate will fall to 6.3% in 2014 from its current level of 7%.This could set the pace for further reductions in the Fed's stimulus efforts in the coming year.In a press conference to discuss the Fed's announcement, Chairman Ben Bernanke said: ""If incoming data broadly support the committee's support for employment we will likely reduce the pace of committee's purchases in further steps at future meetings.""However, he also cautioned: ""Continued progress is by no means certain. Adjustments will be deliberate and dependent on incoming information.""US markets cheered the news.The Dow Jones surged to close up 292.71 points, or 1.84%. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes were up over 1% as well.That is partially because, while significant, the amount of the pullback in bond-buying was slightly less than expected.""Ultimately this a very small amount - it's symbolic rather than more substantive,"" Steve Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments, told the BBC.""The takeaway from this is that while the Federal Reserve might be reducing the dosage of the antibiotic, they're not going to be discharging the patient anytime soon.""The Fed also said it remained committed to seeing prices rise before it would completely withdraw its stimulus.The central bank sets a target of a 2% rise in prices annually. Currently, inflation levels are below that threshold, with the most recent consumer price index data showing a 1.2% rise in prices overall and a 1.7% rise in core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs.""Nothing that we did today was intended to reduce accommodation,"" Mr Bernanke said during the news conference. ""We are committed to doing what is necessary to getting inflation back to target.""Mr Bernanke insisted that the changing leadership at the Fed had no impact in the committee's decision.Mr Bernanke is scheduled to step down on 31 January 2014 and it is expected that the current vice-chair, Janet Yellen, will be confirmed to take the helm later this week.""I have always consulted closely with Janet, even well before she was named by the President and I consulted closely with her on these decisions as well. And she fully supports what we did today,"" said Mr Bernanke.When asked how he hoped future historians would view his legacy, he remained coy.""I hope I live long enough to read the textbooks,"" he said."

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell called the talks ""unproductive"".""All we're asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare,'' Mr Boehner told reporters.House Minority Leader, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who also attended the meeting, accused the Republicans of ""moving the goalposts"" on the budget deal.Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said his party were ""locked in tight on Obamacare'' and neither the president nor Democrats in Congress would accept changes to the law as the price for a deal on reopening the government.The Republicans who control the House of Representatives have demanded concessions from Mr Obama and his fellow Democrats in return for funding the government's continued operation and for raising the debt ceiling.Chiefly, the Republicans demand the repeal, delay or defunding of a healthcare reform law - dubbed Obamacare - passed by the Democrats in 2010.Major portions of that law, which was subsequently validated by the US Supreme Court and was a major issue in the 2012 presidential election, took effect on Tuesday.Analysts say Mr Boehner could end the current government showdown by allowing the House to vote on a ""clean"" budget bill that does not alter the health law, because that could pass with a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans.But doing so would risk his standing with the most conservative elements of his caucus.Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Obama met the heads of some of Wall Street's biggest banks - including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America - to discuss the debt ceiling and other economic issues.The bankers are members of the Financial Services Forum, a lobby group which has, along with 250 other businesses, sent a letter to Congress urging it to raise the debt limit by 17 October.Following the meeting, Mr Obama told CNBC ""it's important for them to recognise that this is going to have a profound impact on our economy and their bottom lines"".He said he was ""exasperated"" by events ""because this is entirely unnecessary"".But he said bowing to the demands of any one faction set a dangerous precedent.""If we get in the habit where a few folks, an extremist wing of one party... are allowed to extort concessions based on a threat of undermining the full faith and credit of the United States, then any president that comes after me... will find themselves unable to govern effectively,"" he said. ""And that is not something that I'm going to allow to happen."""
8542	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24109717	Opinion	0	Economy	None	Negative	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"It was always going to be peculiarly challenging to get a majority of US Senators to confirm Larry Summers as the next head of the US Federal Reserve. I am in Washington this week, and what is most surprising to people here is that the Summers' candidacy lasted as long as it did. One lesson is that President Obama really, really, wants ""one of his guys"" to run the Fed (and yes, the people who fit this description are all guys). We don't yet know  whether he has given up on that goal. Another conclusion you could draw is that when it comes to the financial system, many Senate Democrats are happier fighting the last war than worrying about the next one. Janet Yellen was quicker to see the seeds of the 2008-9 financial crisis being planted than Larry Summers was. But today, the financial imbalances that worry people most are the ones coming from the super-loose policies of the Federal Reserve. When it comes to those policies, it is Yellen - not Summers - who seems to be the true believer. True, Summers' enemies on Capitol Hill are a broad church. Some Democrats have hated him ever since a politically incorrect memo about the environment was written in his name while he was chief economist at the World Bank. But what seems to have damaged him most in his bid for the Fed is his association with the liberalisation of US financial markets when he was working for President Clinton, including the moves to free up investment banking and the trade in derivatives. (Full information: I was working for him at the US Treasury when this was happening.) Summers' enemies say these reforms helped pave the way for the financial crisis, by allowing enormous imbalances to build up in the under-regulated parts of the system, including the market for credit derivatives. The then Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, had argued strongly that the investors in these parts of the market could be trusted to look after their own interests. He was wrong, and the Clinton Treasury is fully implicated in that mistake. By contrast, Janet Yellen has a record as someone who sounded the financial alarm relatively early. That makes her a much more popular choice in the president's party. She is also very well qualified for the job. Even the academic heavyweights who came down on Summers' side have said that she would also be a strong choice. President Obama knows all that. He also knows if he doesn't appoint Yellen, he will seem to have gone out of his way not to appoint the first woman in this crucial job. Even fans of Summers might be uncomfortable with that. So, global investors might be right to think that Janet Yellen as chairman is now a sure thing. They are probably also right to consider her the more ""dove-ish"" choice. Though Summers has been tight-lipped about monetary policy since the start of the crisis, Yellen seems to have fewer reservations about the Fed continuing to have a super-loose policy stance - with or without ""tapering"". She is also more of a true believer when it comes to the value of forward guidance.As I mentioned at the start, that does not necessarily make her the safe choice right now, at a time when many worry about the distortions building up in the financial system as a result of all this cheap liquidity. But, President Obama may be less worried about that side to Janet Yellen than the simple fact that he does not know her. Whatever the truth, he cannot be entirely comfortable with her as Fed chair or he would have have nominated her already. The word is that Mr Obama tried quite hard to persuade Mr Bernanke to stay in the job. He also tried to get former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to put his hat in the ring. It is probably too late, now, for the president to revisit these options. It may also be too late for him to appoint his ""own man"". But having lost Summers, I can't help thinking Mr Obama will spend some time looking for a Plan C."

""Congress can turn them off any time with just a little bit of compromise.""Unless Congress acts, the automatic cuts are set to take effect on Friday, part of a total $1.2tn in reductions over 10 years.Republicans say they will not agree to a deal that includes a tax rise.The budget cuts, known in Washington DC as the sequester, were devised in 2011 as an intentionally painful cudgel to encourage Democrats and Republicans in Congress to strike a deal to reduce the US budget deficit.Now, House Republicans say reduced spending should be the focus of any deal, while Mr Obama and the Democrats want a package to include new tax revenue by closing tax loopholes for wealthy Americans.With no deal in sight, on Sunday the Obama administration released fact sheets highlighting the threatened economic impact of the automatic cuts on a state-by-state basis.""These impacts will not all be felt on day one,"" Mr Obama told the governors on Monday, ""but the uncertainty is already having an effect.""Companies are preparing layoff notices. Families are preparing to cut back on expenses.

""And remind them in no uncertain terms exactly what is at stake and exactly who is at risk.""The defence department has said it will make redundant up to 46,000 temporary workers and cause employees to lose one day of work per week without pay from April, saving $5bn.In a separate press conference on Monday, homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano said queues at airport security checkpoints and at border crossings would lengthen considerably if the cuts were put into place.Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats are each trying to make sure the public blames the other side, should the automatic cuts take effect.Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, called the looming defence cuts ""unconscionable"" and urged Mr Obama to call lawmakers to the White House to work out a deal.""I won't put all the blame all on the president of the United States,"" Sen McCain told CNN. ""But the president leads.""Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, said the cuts were ""senseless"".""This really threatens to hurt a lot of families in our state and kind of flat-line our job growth for the next several months,"" he said."

She has been his deputy for the last two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve.Ms Yellen and Mr Bernanke are due to appear with the president on Wednesday.She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US.Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a ""dove"", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation.Her nomination has been widely expected since former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature last month amid opposition from liberal Democrats.As Democrats control the 100-seat Senate, Ms Yellen's appointment would only need six Republican votes to overcome potential any procedural hurdles.Some conservatives are scrutinising her views on monetary policy and her support for previous federal stimulus efforts.On Wednesday, the second-most powerful Republican in the Senate questioned whether she was the right choice.""Ms Yellen subscribes to the liberal school of thought that the best way to handle our nation's fiscal challenges is to throw more money at them,"" John Cornyn of Texas, the party's whip in the Senate, said in a statement.""This stimulus obsession is the reason the nation finds itself in the fiscal calamity it does today, and the last thing we need is a leader at the helm of the Federal Reserve who is intent on more quantitative easing that harms our economy.""Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement: ""I voted against Vice-Chairman Yellen's original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy.""  ""We will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed.""But Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said Ms Yellen would win Senate confirmation ""by a wide margin"".The chairman of the US Senate banking committee, Tim Johnson, said she had ""a depth of experience that is second to none"".""I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman,"" he added.The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be ""seamless"" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together.""I don't think there's going to be a radical change,"" she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus.Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC Ms Yellen's nomination was ""terrific news"". ""We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important,"" she said. ""Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate.""A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was ""battle tested"" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.

Residents of Virginia Beach, Virginia, are used to a sense of mortality - it has the highest concentration of serving and retired military in the US.During a packed public meeting at a hotel ballroom in this coastal resort, many warned of the damage from the automatic cuts to local businesses, to their families and to America's prestige.But retired naval Chief Petty Officer Stets says much more is at stake. He speaks with quiet assurance, but you can tell his voice is one degree away from cracking. No wonder.He starts his question to the lawmakers on the platform with the simple statement that his son, a soldier, was killed in Pakistan in 2010. ""My worry is there is another family that is going to suffer the loss that I did because their son didn't have the proper training, the proper armament, the proper munitions to do his job,"" he later tells me.""Sequestration is going to take 10% off our military budget and, as I look at it, out of a group of 10 soldiers, one doesn't have a helmet, one doesn't have body armour, one doesn't have a radio. Each man in that platoon doesn't have something to do his job.""I have no idea if he is right or wrong. The Pentagon has warned automatic cuts of 10% would be ""devastating"", without spelling out what would happen. But there are already plans for defence workers to take one day off a week without pay. Part of the problem with the automatic cuts, known by the ugly term ""the sequester"" is that no-one can say exactly what they would mean in practice, even though they are only days away. The White House has set out the threatened impact on Virginia, as well as the other 49 states, ahead of President Barack Obama's visit to a Virginia shipyard.Mr Obama is out campaigning against the cuts, warning that Congress must avoid wounding the recovery.  We are talking here about the can that was kicked down the road at New Year, when Congress did a deal to avoid automatic tax increases.But they put off automatic spending cuts for two months. That deadline is almost up. The whole idea was meant to concentrate minds. Here is the theory: Democrats would hate the savaging of social programmes; Republicans would loathe the harsh reductions of military spending. So they would be forced to come together and find more sensible ways to reduce public spending.Cunning, eh? Only it has not worked. That is partly because some Republicans think bad cuts are better than no cuts at all.There is a sense of complacency on Capitol Hill that is totally lacking in Virginia Beach. Most people in Washington think Friday's deadline will come and go, but a deal will be done in a week or two.CPO Stets says that is unacceptable.""To me the next soldier that dies, if sequestration goes into effect, lies on every member of Congress - and the president.""""There is no way they'll get past me.

President Obama is soon to make one of the big set piece speeches of the year - the State of the Union. The White House has already told us it is part of a twin pack with his controversial inauguration address. Now, they are telling major media outlets like ABC and the Washington Post that, on Tuesday night, the focus will be on the economy. It's not surprising. Two things were striking about Mr Obama's inauguration address. Firstly, that there was little attempt to play the part of a healing president, stretching out to soothe the fears of those who didn't vote for him. It was a forthright, even aggressive, promotion of a liberal agenda for his second term. He argued that progressive values are, fundamentally, the expression of America's deepest values and follow the arc of American history.  Republicans hated that. Secondly, that main concern of many Americans - the economy - was scarcely mentioned. The passion was reserved for the issues of gun control, climate change, gay rights and immigration. It is true he talked about ""new jobs"" twice, once in the context of green energy and once when talking about re-building America's infrastructure.  Republicans have made much play of this, suggesting he was ignoring the country's most fundamental problems. The White House may be acknowledging that the inauguration address was a little lopsided. Maybe Mr Obama simply wanted to say something different. He has, after all, spoken about his economic vision many times before. It was the centrepiece of the election and, indeed, of last year's State of the Union. Then, he talked about restoring ""an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules"".Now, the White House spin doctors want to condition journalists to look out for the economic content of the next speech, rather than the social issues that may dominate business in Congress. The last thing they want is for Americans to think he is merely pleasing his base, concentrating on what some see as side issues rather than the fundamentals.  But, if there is a different accent on content, I very much doubt there will be any change to the approach. I expect to see another iteration of the newly confrontational president, determined to use his bully pulpit to demand change and give notice to his enemies that they had better get out of his way.

Congress will now have until 15 January to pass a $1.012tn (£617bn) fiscal spending bill for 2014.But any hopes that a new era of cross-party unity between Democrats and Republicans could be dawning in Washington DC may be premature, analysts say.""This is a budget,"" Democratic Senator Carl Levin told reporters last week. ""A budget could be amended next year. Nothing is written in stone around here.""The Senate's top four Republicans - who are in the minority in the upper chamber - voted earlier this month to block consideration of the budget bill. However, their opposition was seen as mainly symbolic and it is thought they knew the bill would ultimately go forward.But the chamber's Republican leader hinted a separate brawl could lie ahead over the government's borrowing limit, which is due to be raised next spring.""I doubt if the House, or for that matter the Senate, is willing to give the president a clean debt ceiling increase,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters.""We'll have to see what the House insists on adding to it as a condition for passing it.""The bill aims to shave up to $23bn from the nation's $642bn annual budget deficit.It also rolls back $63bn in military and domestic spending cuts automatically imposed in January when Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a budget compromise.Democrats supported the measure even though they were unhappy that it did not extend long-term unemployment benefits for nearly 1.3 million Americans.And members of both parties voiced disapproval of the bill's provision to cut inflation increases to pensions for military retirees under the age of 62.

The announcement followed a two-day meeting in Washington DC.The Fed's decision to begin to ease its extraordinary stimulus efforts also indicates that the central bank believes that the US economy has finally strengthened enough that it no longer needs as much support.The $10bn reduction comes from two areas: the Fed will reduce its US Treasury purchases from $45bn to $40bn per month as well as its buying of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) from $40bn to $35bn per month.In its forecast for the coming years, the Fed said the employment situation will improve faster than previously expected.It said the unemployment rate will fall to 6.3% in 2014 from its current level of 7%.This could set the pace for further reductions in the Fed's stimulus efforts in the coming year.In a press conference to discuss the Fed's announcement, Chairman Ben Bernanke said: ""If incoming data broadly support the committee's support for employment we will likely reduce the pace of committee's purchases in further steps at future meetings.""However, he also cautioned: ""Continued progress is by no means certain. Adjustments will be deliberate and dependent on incoming information.""US markets cheered the news.The Dow Jones surged to close up 292.71 points, or 1.84%. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes were up over 1% as well.That is partially because, while significant, the amount of the pullback in bond-buying was slightly less than expected.""Ultimately this a very small amount - it's symbolic rather than more substantive,"" Steve Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments, told the BBC.""The takeaway from this is that while the Federal Reserve might be reducing the dosage of the antibiotic, they're not going to be discharging the patient anytime soon.""The Fed also said it remained committed to seeing prices rise before it would completely withdraw its stimulus.The central bank sets a target of a 2% rise in prices annually. Currently, inflation levels are below that threshold, with the most recent consumer price index data showing a 1.2% rise in prices overall and a 1.7% rise in core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs.""Nothing that we did today was intended to reduce accommodation,"" Mr Bernanke said during the news conference. ""We are committed to doing what is necessary to getting inflation back to target.""Mr Bernanke insisted that the changing leadership at the Fed had no impact in the committee's decision.Mr Bernanke is scheduled to step down on 31 January 2014 and it is expected that the current vice-chair, Janet Yellen, will be confirmed to take the helm later this week.""I have always consulted closely with Janet, even well before she was named by the President and I consulted closely with her on these decisions as well. And she fully supports what we did today,"" said Mr Bernanke.When asked how he hoped future historians would view his legacy, he remained coy.""I hope I live long enough to read the textbooks,"" he said."

A group of shareholders has demanded an independent chairman to help protect the bank from future trading fiascos.The fallout from the so-called London Whale trades, which cost the US bank $6.2bn (£4bn), has sparked the furore.Support for the proposal is running at just over 40%, according to Dow Jones. Although the result of the vote is non-binding, meaning Mr Dimon could continue as before, reports have suggested that he may resign if the votes are not in his favour.Both Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, influential firms that give advice to large shareholders, are recommending that the jobs be split. ""An independent chairman is better able to oversee the executives of a company and set a pro-shareholder agenda,"" Glass Lewis argues in its proxy report.Last year's annual meeting, which came just after the London Whale losses were first revealed, saw 40% of shareholders vote for a similar proposal. On previous occasions in 2007 and 2008 when shareholders were asked about separating the roles, just 15% voted in favour. ""Even a Master of the Universe can be swallowed by a London whale,"" said Lee Saunders, president of public employees' union AFSCME, which is also voting for the roles to be split.In April last year, JP Morgan reported a loss in a London-based division responsible for using trades to hedge the bank's overall risk in markets.At the time, Mr Dimon dismissed the incident as a ""tempest in a teapot"". But just a month later, he admitted the bank had lost about $2bn on the erroneous trades and was forced to acknowledge that the bank had shown ""bad judgement"".Bruno Iksil, the trader at the heart of the incident, was dubbed the London Whale because the huge positions he had taken on JP Morgan's behalf were big enough to move markets. Despite the incident, the bank insists that the joint role is the ""most effective leadership model."" Last week, it sent a letter to shareholders, urging them to reject the proposal to split the top two roles. ""We believe that a vote against our current directors or a vote to permanently separate the chairman and chief executive officer positions could be disruptive to the company and is not in shareholders' best interests,"" it wrote.The vote comes just after JP Morgan reported record first-quarter profits of $6.5bn (£4.2bn) for the first three months of the year. Retail banking deposits rose 10%, new mortgage orders rose 37% and the company said it had kept the top spot for earnings from investment banking.Mr Dimon has said the results indicate that no changes are necessary to either the bank's board or its financial structure.""The board should be applauded,"" Mr Dimon is reported to have said at a conference last week in Boston.

This is not an abstraction. People will lose their jobs.""The president added that the effect of the so-called sequester, as the raft of budget cuts are known in Washington DC, was already being felt in some government departments, noting the Navy had delayed the deployment of a carrier to the Gulf.""Changes like this, not well thought through, not phased in properly, changes like this affect our ability to respond to threats in unstable parts of the world,"" Mr Obama said.He also said that while he was open to cutting back on unsuccessful or unnecessary government programmes, he accused Republicans of ""ideological rigidity"" for opposing tax increases.He proposed closing some tax loopholes to increase revenue, and backed a budget plan put together by Senate Democrats last week.Mr Obama said the deep, across-the-board spending cuts had originally been designed to be so unattractive that they would spur politicians to work together.Congressional Republicans have given a frosty reception to the Senate Democrats' proposal. They point out that Mr Obama already won a revenue increase in the new year, when Congress allowed taxes to rise on families making more than $450,000 annually.In response to the president's remarks, House Speaker John Boehner said: ""The American people understand that the revenue debate is now closed.""Tax reform is a once-in-a generation opportunity to boost job creation in America. It should not be squandered to enable more Washington spending. Spending is the problem, spending must be the focus,"" he said in a statement.Congress is in recess this week, leaving little time to negotiate a budget solution ahead of the 1 March deadline.Democrats have suggested increasing revenues by closing some tax loopholes, including tax breaks for the oil and natural gas industry, for businesses that have outsourced labour from the US, and ensuring millionaires pay a tax rate of at least 30%.The Democratic plan does not include any changes to costly federal programmes such as the Medicare healthcare programme for over-65s and the Social Security pension programme.Many Republicans have supported closing some loopholes, but they say the changes should be part of a broader overhaul of the tax code, not a way to plug gaps in the budget.The ""sequester"" was originally due to take effect on 1 January, along with a series of other measures known as the fiscal cliff.But, amid dire warnings that the package of across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases could tip the US back into recession, lawmakers pushed back the spending cuts by two months, saying the delay would give them time to shape a larger budget deal.Little progress on such a plan has been seen in recent weeks.Also on Tuesday, a bipartisan proposal from the co-chairs of a deficit-reduction committee recommended the government find savings of $2.4tn over the next 10 years.The proposal from former Republican Senator Alan Simpson and Democrat Erskine Bowles, President Bill Clinton's former chief of staff, suggests taking about a quarter of savings from changes to healthcare programmes and another quarter from new revenue from tax changes.They have said the mandatory cuts are too steep and would damage the economy."

Leisure and hospitality was the only sector to see a fall with 13,000 jobs lost.Carl Leahey, senior adviser at Decision Economics, said the report was ""so-so"", and meant the US central bank was likely to continue its massive $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme. ""This report will soften people's assessments of current conditions. With the possibility of a replay of the budget showdown as early as mid-January, why would the Fed want to pull any levers now?,"" he said. Following the figures, stock markets turned higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,688 and both the Dow futures and broader S&P index futures up 0.3%, as investors bet on the Fed continuing its stimulus programme at the same pace. The dollar fell, under pressure from the expectation that the stimulus programme, which effectively creates more dollars, will continue at the same rate.The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, maintained its economic stimulus programme last month, suggesting it was still uncertain about the strength of the economic recovery. ""Today's underperforming jobs number fully justifies September's cautious FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee),"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldwideMarkets. The Labor Department said the next US unemployment data would be released on 8 November, a week later than scheduled due to the partial shutdown of the US government.Its workers were placed on unpaid leave during the shutdown raising fears the department will struggle to collect accurate data for October.

If Steven Rhodes, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, agrees with them, the city would have to go back to the drawing board.Protesters outside the court in particular singled out Mr Orr, chanting, ""Down with Orr"" and ""Orr no more"". The appointment of Mr Orr, who is scheduled to testify on Monday, was controversial as it was done without voter support.Unions and pension funds won a small victory when it was ruled that Michigan governor Rick Snyder would have to testify on Friday.Furthermore, lawyers for the city admitted that plans to sell some works from the Detroit Institute of Arts might have to be shelved unless there is a leadership change at the museum. Current director Graham Beal has said the plan is ""abhorrent"" and has vowed to fight any efforts to sell the museum's artworks, which include major works by Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh.However, many experts still believe that the judge will eventually rule in Detroit's favour.City managers say bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's debts and liabilities.Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations.In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation.It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012.Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers - once the city's main source of employment - shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas.The city is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950.There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report."

One of the key points of contention in the political stalemate has been President Barack Obama's healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare.Republicans in the House of Representatives - and their allies in the Senate - have demanded the law be repealed or stripped of funding as a condition for continuing to fund the government.Major portions of the law, which passed in 2010 and has been validated by the US Supreme Court, are due to take effect on Tuesday.After the Senate vote on Monday afternoon, the chamber's Democratic majority leader blamed Republicans for the imminent halt to all non-essential government operations.""It will be a Republican government shutdown, pure and simple,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, referring to the Republicans as ""bullies"".""We are not going to negotiate on this. We have done everything we can to be fair and reasonable.""Following Mr Reid's pledge, Republican House Speaker John Boehner told reporters the House would not pass a budget bill that did not include concessions from the Democrats regarding Mr Obama's healthcare law.In addition to the threat of a shutdown, a second fiscal deadline is approaching in the coming weeks. About 17 October, the US government will reach the limit at which it can borrow money to pay its bills, the so-called debt ceiling.House Republicans have demanded a series of policy concessions - notably on the president's health law and on financial and environmental regulations - in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.Although there were no reports that negotiations over either the budget or the debt ceiling were underway on Monday, Mr Obama said he was ""not at all resigned"" to a government shutdown.But he warned there could not be ""any kind of meaningful negotiations under the cloud of potential default"" on the government's debt.""Our currency is the reserve currency of the world,"" Mr Obama said after an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.""We don't mess with that. And we certainly don't allow domestic policy differences on issues that are unrelated to the budget to endanger not only our economy but the world economy."" The bill the Senate rejected on Monday was passed the day before by the House of Representatives. That bill would have delayed the implementation of the healthcare law and repealed a $29bn (£17.9bn) medical device tax. Mr Obama and his fellow Democrats in the US Senate have vowed to reject any House bill that touches the health law.Some Democrats, including Mr Reid and Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have called on Mr Boehner to put the Senate bill up for a vote in the House.They say a budget bill unencumbered with a delay of the health law could pass the House with Democrats joining a small number of Republicans. If the government does shut down on 1 October, national parks and Washington's Smithsonian museums would close, pension and veterans' benefit cheques would be delayed, and visa and passport applications would go unprocessed.Programmes deemed essential, such as air traffic control and food inspections, would continue.The defence department has advised employees that uniformed members of the military will continue on normal duty, but that large numbers of civilian workers will be told to stay home.As lawmakers grapple with the impending shutdown, the 17 October deadline for extending the government's borrowing limit looms even larger.Earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said that unless the US were allowed to extend its borrowing limit, the country would be left with about $30bn (£18.5bn) to meet its commitments, which on certain days can be as high as $60bn.A failure to raise the limit could also result in the US government defaulting on its debt payments. Washington faced a similar impasse over its debt ceiling in 2011. Republicans and the Democrats only reached a compromise on the day the government's ability to borrow money was due to run out.That fight was resolved just hours before the country could have defaulted on its debt, but nevertheless it led to ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgrading the US for the first time ever.The 2011 compromise included a series of automatic budget cuts known as the ""sequester"", which came into effect earlier this year. The US government has not undergone a shutdown since 1995-96, when services were suspended for a record 21 days. Republicans demanded then-President Bill Clinton agree to their version of a balanced budget. After weeks of negotiation, they reached a compromise similar to what they discussed prior to the shutdown."

""The IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity. This report shows that some of its employees failed that test.""He spoke as a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report found that senior IRS officials had told inspectors the decision to focus on Tea Party and other groups based upon their names or policy positions was not influenced by any individual or organisation outside the agency.But it found managers had allowed ""inappropriate criteria"" to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, resulting in ""substantial delays"" in processing applications for tax-exempt status, and requests for ""unnecessary information"", such as lists of past and future donors.Of the 296 total applications reviewed by TIGTA, 108 were approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicants, and 160 were still open, the report said. In response, the acting IRS Commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities, Joseph Grant, said: ""We believe the front line career employees that made the decisions acted out of a desire for efficiency and not out of any political or partisan view point.""Mr Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, said earlier that no-one at the White House had known about the matter until lawyers were told several weeks ago TIGTA would publish a report.At least three Congressional committees are planning hearings into the matter.The House Ways and Means committee will hold a hearing on Friday. The Senate finance and investigations committees have also said they will hold hearings. ""This was a targeting of the president's political enemies, effectively, and lies about it during the election year so that it wasn't discovered until afterwards,"" senior Republican Congressman Darrell Issa told CBS on Tuesday.Two high-profile Republican governors called on President Obama to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether any laws were broken.""This is big brother come to life and a witch hunt to prevent Americans from exercising their first amendment [free speech] rights,"" Governors Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Scott Walker of Wisconsin wrote.Ahead of the 2012 presidential election, conservative groups complained to the IRS and to members of Congress that their applications for tax-exempt status were being held up. Some groups have said they were asked to provide lists of donors and volunteers, statements of their activities, and lists of legislators they had contacted."

The White House briefing is due soon - but a holding statement doesn't exactly enthusiastically embrace the offer.Once Republicans in Congress act to remove the threat of default and end this harmful government shutdown, President Barack Obama will be willing to negotiate a broader budget agreement to create jobs, grow the economy and put our fiscal house in order. First intelligence from up on the Hill suggests that getting enough Republican votes could be hard. There will be a backlash from some supporters who will feel betrayed. How loudly they shout now could change the calculations. And even if the initial deal is done it will mean at least six weeks of jittery uncertainty hanging over the American economy. Still a deal to avert what some describe as a catastrophe next week is now possible, even likely - but wrestling on the edge of a cliff is an unpredictable business."

But of course, rates did go lower, because of the Fed's extraordinary efforts to lower longer-term mortgage rates by buying mortgage-backed securities as part of quantitative easing. Once more, the couple did the maths - and figured out that another refinancing effort could help them.This time around, the rate on their 30-year mortgage was lowered to 3.785%, which allowed them to save more than $300 a month on mortgage payments. Additionally, they could pay off credit card debt that had accumulated during the recession.""We just wanted to get back on our feet, feel good about our money situation and start saving,"" says Julianne.Now, they can repaint their home, go out to dinner and begin saving for the future college tuition of their two daughters, aged nine and 12.""This was our first summer in a long time when were able to not worry,"" says Julianne.The US economy was also relatively worry free this summer, with job growth holding relatively constant at 160,000 a month and good, if not great, GDP figures.The Fed's efforts to boost consumer spending by keeping mortgage rates low and then lower seems to have worked, as the Philps and others like them recover from the wounds of the recession and begin to find themselves with extra cash on hand.But the question remains: is the US economy strong enough to continue to grow without the Fed's extraordinary efforts?Wendy Nastasi, the mortgage broker who helped the Philps with their refinancing, worries that the tap might be prematurely turned off.""We've seen a dramatic increase in mortgage rates, almost overnight,"" says Ms Nastasi.Over the summer, the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose one percentage point, and already the number of US homeowners looking to refinance has plunged from 17% in early 2013 to just 2% today.""You're going to see what improvements we're seeing in the housing market stall,"" cautions Ms Nastasi.This stall could have a knock-on impact.""If you have fewer mortgage refinancings, that suggests that households will have less cash than otherwise to spend on a variety of goods and services,"" says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets. Mr Lonski says that since consumer spending makes up two-thirds of US economic activity, a slowdown in refinancing could have profound effects.So this is the tightrope walk that the Fed must negotiate.On the one hand, Mr Bernanke and his fellow central bankers worry about keeping their foot on the accelerator for too long, potentially leading to higher inflation. But take their foot off too soon and they risk prematurely slamming on the brakes of a fragile US recovery.""Personally, I think it is too soon to taper, because the economic data have been disappointing and inflation is below target,"" says Mr Gagnon, who is now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank in Washington DC.""But I think several members of the committee are nervous about buying so many bonds.""At the Park Wayne Diner, just a few minutes away from the Philps' house, the difficulties of the situation are on full display.Owner John Stoupakis says that business has been good, but not great.""I think the economy is going to be better, but it's not where it's supposed to be - here, business has been off,"" he says as he surveys his busy, if not bustling, dining room.Diner patron Jerry Eisenberg says he's impatient for the Fed to stop its stimulus efforts.As a retiree, he says low interest rates have hurt his savings.""We could feel a little more freer to spend [if rates were higher],"" he says. ""To make money on savings, you have to take risks now.""But for others, the situation remains grim.""I haven't worked in nine months, I'm looking for anything that will pay me,"" says 30-year-old Travis Nonn.""If the economy's improving, you can't prove it by me."""

But what exactly has the economic impact been?Standard & Poor's says the shutdown has cost the US economy $24bn (£15bn), shaving 0.6% off of economic growth this quarter.And investors have not been happy - particularly foreign nations, like China, which own US debt.The yield on short term US Treasury bonds - the amount the US government most pay to investors to hold US debt - has risen, increasing US borrowing costs and indicating that global investors have become unhappy with Washington wrangling.However, markets have not reacted as sharply as they did during prior budget negotiations, particularly during the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations that saw yet another last-minute deal.Overall, US stocks are up 18% for the year.The business community remains focused on other concerns, like when the Federal Reserve will begin to ease off its extraordinary efforts to prop up the US economy - something the central bank says will not happen any time soon, partially due to Washington dysfunction.""They're going to eventually get to a compromise and then we'll move on,"" O'Neil Securities trader Kenny Polcari told the BBC from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.A veteran trader, Mr Polcari was also at the NYSE during the last government shutdown, from 1995-96. Back then, he remembers, markets sold off but then actually rebounded. ""A government shutdown is not necessarily a comment on the state of the US economy,"" says Mr Polcari.""All indications are that the US economy is starting to turn a corner.""Benedict Willis, another trader at the NYSE, said that in fact, companies might start to use the shutdown as a way to justify less than stellar third-quarter results.""Every company will look for an excuse if they're weak,"" says Mr Willis, a managing director at Albert Fried & Company.""The government has certainly given them one.""For many businesses, another debt squabble in Washington is just background noise during a time of good, if not great, economic growth. ""The difference between now and a couple years ago was that a couple years ago we were coming out the depths of a recession,"" says David Zarin, who owns a fabric store on Manhattan's Lower East Side.During the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011, he says he saw his business decline in the wake of so much uncertainty at a fragile time of the US economic recovery.Now, while business isn't as a robust as it was before the crisis, he's no longer as sensitive to what he calls ""Washington posturing.""""Frankly, I'm a little numb,"" he says.One place, however, was significantly impacted by the shutdown.According to George Mason University professor George Fuller, the Washington DC area lost an estimated $220m a day while federal workers and contractors were furloughed.Overall, the federal government accounts for one-third of the region's economy.Furthermore, uncertainty is never good for hiring.One-half of bosses surveyed by the Business Roundtable ""indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months"".Consumer confidence measures plunged as a result of the shutdown - not a good sign for the US economy, because consumers account for 70% of all spending.Furthermore, the shutdown impacted the release of economic data, particularly important measures of job creation and prices.So the full impact of the shutdown may not be understood for many months, until the various agencies responsible for collecting and releasing the data can get restarted."

You know it has few redeeming merits beyond the entertainment value of witnessing humanity at its worst. The characters fling themselves from one gratuitous hysterical crisis to the next, barely pausing to reflect on the folly of their ways. No remorse, is one of the rules.Some will blame the Tea Party, some the president, others the system. There'll be plenty of time to reflect on whose fault it is over the next few days, and I will certainly do so.But for now it seems likely that the latest plot line of DC dramas may be nearing a conclusion. The leaders of the Republicans and Democrats seem to have almost struck a deal.It would raise the debt ceiling and reopen the Government until the new year. Before Christmas there would be a big conference on the budget.  There may be a few, very minor, changes to Obamacare.  The leaders of the two parties wouldn't agree to something they didn't think they could sell. The president has said little, but one can assume he approves of what is on the table. But that doesn't mean it will have an easy passage in the Senate. The House is likely to be even rougher. They are more than capable of squeezing another cliffhanger or two out of it. They could miscalculate and go over the edge into the unknown by mistake. But if they don't and a deal is done, some will celebrate this as American democracy doing its job - raw and messy but vibrant, forcing compromise where there was none to be had. Perhaps. The American public don't seem that impressed.  The world scratches its head in bewilderment. But it has consequences that go beyond the United States. Lurching from crisis imperils the world's economy on an annual basis. That's bad enough. But it gives democracy itself a bad name, making it look like a system that is not fit for purpose in a modern world. That is truly dangerous.

He faulted tax cuts for wealthy Americans, declining investment in schools and infrastructure, and laws that have weakened labour unions, compounded by broad structural changes in the global economy.""The combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream, our way of life, and what we stand for around the globe,"" he said.""The idea that so many children are born into poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth is heartbreaking enough. The idea that a child may never be able to escape that poverty because she lacks a decent education or healthcare, or a community that views her future as their own, that should offend all of us and it should compel us to action.""The US president argued rising inequality was eroding trust in institutions and reducing civic and community involvement. And he said the ""growing gap"" was as much about class as it was about race.To remedy the growing income inequality, Mr Obama called for a rise in the national minimum wage, currently $7.25 (£4.43) - as low as it was during the administration of President Harry Truman in the 1950s in terms of spending power, Mr Obama said.Several states and cities have raised their own minimum wages, most recently New Jersey and Washington DC.A proposal is currently being floated in the Senate to increase the national minimum wage to $10.10 in three steps and tie further increases to changes in the cost of living, but its path even through the Democratic-controlled Senate is unclear.He also suggested targeted programmes for cities and regions hardest hit by the 2008 recession and other sea changes in the US economy, universal preschool education for young children, a shoring-up of the US pension and social safety net schemes, and laws to make it easier for workers to organise into labour unions.Mr Obama also pressed Congress to extend unemployment benefits to 1.3 million people who have been unemployed long-term, set to expire toward the end of December.Additional weeks of benefits have been approved since 2009, but on Tuesday, a senior Republican congressman, Representative Tom Cole, said his party opposed an extension.Also, Mr Obama said US government policy must remain relentlessly focused on strengthening the economy.""It may be true that in today's economy, growth alone does not guarantee higher wages and incomes,"" he said. ""But what's also true is we can't tackle inequality if the economic pie is shrinking or stagnant."""

In his news conference he repeatedly accused Republicans in the House of Representatives of ""demanding ransom"", ""extortion"" and ""hostage-taking"".He also kept saying that he would talk to anyone about anything - but not until the shutdown was lifted and there was agreement on the debt ceiling.""Stop the excuses - take the vote - end the shutdown today,"" he said.He also said he understood why it was difficult for Republicans to vote to lift the debt ceiling - it's a lousy name that suggested the debt itself was being increased.There are no more rabbits in the hat, Mr Obama said. If it didn't happen there would be economic chaos.But the barest glimmer of a suggestion came when he said that the Republicans could vote to lift the threat for the period that it took to negotiate. That was pretty much a throwaway line, but it could be a way forward for some.But not others. One conservative strategist I spoke to told me his side thought that breaching the debt ceiling would not be a disaster and they would be trying hard to get that line out.While Mr Obama noted ""the usual messy process of American democracy"", he said twice he was taking a stand now for future presidents who could not be expected to choose between ""world-wide catastrophe and making concessions to one faction of one party of one House"".Very near the end he said: ""I'm not budging.""The president has been so clear, so often, that he cannot blink. But he has offered a way out if the Republicans step back from the brink.Within the hour, Republican House Speaker John Boehner had rejected the president's suggestion, calling it a demand for unconditional surrender. He said they needed something in return. I know that sounds like a pretty firm rejection, but I wonder. He didn't mention Obamacare, and only talked about the cost of government.

Mr Greenspan, the most powerful figure in economic policy when he ran the Fed between 1987 to 2006, spoke to the BBC's Evan Davis ahead of publication of his new book, The Map and the Territory.In a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on Radio 4's Today programme and the World Service's Business Daily, the former Fed chief had strong words for those who thought the eurozone crisis was over.The crisis is likely to continue until the eurozone sees ""consolidation politically. I think that's where we are going"".He said: ""The culture of Greece is not the same as the culture of Germany, and to fuse them into a single unit is extremely difficult. ""The only way you can do it is by political union, like with East and West Germany, and even that is not working as well as it should be.""But he was optimistic about the UK's attempt to revive its economy.""What Britain has done with its austerity programme has worked much better than I thought it would,"" Mr Greenspan said.""As far as I can judge, it [the economy] is coming out pretty much the way they [the coalition government] had expected.""Mr Greenspan also defended his record at the Fed against criticism that easy-credit policies and light-touch regulation had contributed substantially to the 2008 financial crash. He also declined to criticise the financial derivatives market.He said: ""One thing that shocked me is that not only did the Federal Reserve's very sophisticated model completely miss (the crash on) September 15th, 2008, but so did the IMF, so did JP Morgan, which was forecasting American economic growth three days before the crisis hit, going up all through 2009 and 2010.""There is a difference between predicting economic bubbles, and predicting when they might burst, he said.He rejected suggestions that he was not clear enough in warning that the financial markets might be teetering on the edge of collapse. However, his words of warning had to be couched very carefully in order not to unsettle the markets, he said. ""I was very worried about what the impact would be.""Mr Greenspan, 87, who now runs his own consultancy business, also criticised a growing ""crony capitalism"" in the US.He said: ""Crony capitalism is essentially a condition in which… public officials are giving favours to people in the private sector in payment of political favours.""He said it was prevalent in China and Russia, but had not been common in the US or the UK. But he added: ""I am beginning to worry that we are starting in that direction.""On China, he said that growth rates would begin to slow unless the country could be more innovative.""One of the major problems with China is that its innovation is largely borrowed technology. ""There was a recent Reuters study where they listed the top 100 most innovative companies. Forty were American, none were Chinese. ""Chinese productivity is the highest in the world but the way they do it is by borrowing the technology from abroad, either by joint ventures or other means.""What they are going to find, I suspect sooner rather than later, is that… unless they pick up innovation very specifically, their growth is going to slow down,"" Mr Greenspan said.Part of the problem was that China remained a single-party state which was too conformist, and innovators there still did not ""think outside of the box"" enough."

In a statement, the White House said the Republican bill ""lifts the immediate threat of default and indicates that congressional Republicans have backed off an insistence on holding the nation's economy hostage to extract drastic cuts"" in social programmes.But it said passing a short-term measure added ""unnecessary complications"" and ""needlessly"" perpetuated fiscal uncertainty.The Republican proposal would suspend the current borrowing limit until 18 May, the House Ways and Means Committee said on Monday.It would also withhold pay from members of Congress from 15 April until a budget is passed.Republicans had previously threatened not to pass an increase in the debt limit unless it was paired with spending cuts.But President Obama refused to negotiate, demanding that lawmakers pass an unconditional debt limit increase.The current fight over the debt limit comes less than a month after Congress and the White House struck a last-minute deal to prevent the so-called fiscal cliff - a combination of sharp spending cuts and tax increases.The last debt ceiling battle between Congress and Mr Obama ended in July 2011, after bringing the nation close to default on its debt and resulting in a credit rating downgrade as well as financial market turmoil."

9453	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17159966	Opinion	1	Economy	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"As far back as the 1800s, single mothers were receiving benefits. At that time, they would be paid up front and in cash, but were they better off than today?It's a perennial issue every government has to grapple with, whatever its political persuasion. Is the welfare system too generous?The Welfare Reform Bill, currently going through parliament, is this government's attempt to introduce what it says is ""a simpler and fairer"" system. But proposed cuts will hit the poor hardest, argue opponents.New research shows that the amount of benefits given to those in need is a debate that has raged for hundreds of years. It also challenges commonly held beliefs that the poor in centuries past were universally left to flounder, often in crushing poverty.Cambridge historian Dr Samantha Williams has examined an early form of welfare in England and Wales called the Old English Poor Law. Under it, poor relief - as it was then called - was given out by the local parish.Looking at the plight of poor families in two Bedfordshire communities between 1760 and the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, her research reveals that a generous benefits system existed in parts of England.Payments were worked out according to the average household income of neighbouring working families. Lone mothers were the recipients of some of the biggest handouts, so were the elderly. Others did not fare so well.Under today's welfare system, such single mothers receive welfare includingincome support, child benefit, housing benefit and council tax benefit. The elderly get pensions, plus other help. But how did that compare with today?If a single pregnant mother wanted to claim poor relief before 1834, she had to go before two judicial officers and swear on the paternity of her child's father under oath. No other proof was needed. She would then receive benefits up front and the officials would try to reclaim money back from the father.The ""bastardy examinations"" - as they were called - required the father to pay back all the childbirth expenses, the legal expenses it cost to pursue him and regular maintenance payments for the child, similar to child maintenance payments today.If the father couldn't be found, the parish would support the woman. It was quite a financial undertaking as the birth of illegitimate children to errant fathers was massively widespread during this period in history, says Williams.Lone mothers could receive up to 37% of the income of neighbouring working households, according to the study, which does not cover lone fathers. Extras such as fuel, clothing and rent payments contributed another 8%.But wages and average living standards were extremely low and 45% would actually amount to very little, say historians. According to Williams, in 1834 the weekly wage of an average agricultural worker was nine shillings. It's the equivalent of 45p and would be worth just under £48 today, according to the Bank of England's inflation calculator. A lone mother would get just over four shillings a week, roughly the equivalent of 20p, which would be worth an estimated £19 today.So, while single mothers were well provided for, it is only relative to other welfare claimants of the time, says Dr Tim Leunig, an economics historian from the London School of Economics. In real terms they were not better off than today.""By today's standards these women would have been utterly impoverished,"" he says.Just like modern times, welfare expenditure was a topic of fierce debate in the early 19th Century. After the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 it became much harder for a single mother to claim money for her child. Identifying the father under oath was no longer enough.""Women had to provide corroborative evidence. She had to be seen courting the father in order to claim child support costs,"" says Dr Williams.It was pensioners who received the most generous benefits. Each case was separately judged and, if needed, they would also receive clothes, fuel, food, medical care and their burials would be paid for.With all the extra handouts they effectively got up to 70% of the average working household income in their area, but again in the 1800s it would not have amounted to much because wages were so low. It would work out at roughly £35 a week today.If today's pensioners got 70% of the average working household wage, it would total £451 per week. This is using theDWP's current average weekly income for a working couple, which is £644. The current basic state pension is £102, but the elderly do get other benefits on top.There was no set age to receiving a pension back then, it was given once deemed necessary. The term pension as we know it today did not come into place until the 1908 Pensions Act.""Pension in that era meant money to live on for the rest of your life. That's where the phrase 'pensioned off' comes from, you could be pensioned off at any age,"" says Dr Leunig.But again, things weren't quite as generous as they appear. If able, people were expected to work for as long as they could - however old they were.Some were pushed into poor relief because there was no work available, says Dr David Turner, a historian at Swansea University.""There were growing concerns about rising levels of poverty. The poor relief system was finding it difficult to cope with the demands of claimants, which is parallel to the welfare system today.""Poverty rapidly increased after 1790, as many men returned from the Revolutionary andNapoleonic Wars. Combined with harvest failures and rapid price inflation, this gave rise to a severe lack of jobs and increased reliance on poor relief.Men were the worst off when it came to benefits as they were expected to stay in work. Income support as we know it, which currently pays £67.50 a week to over 25s, and other benefits would have been very welcome. Instead vagrants, who wandered from job to job, were frequently whipped and sent to prison for short periods if they weren't working.""Access to poor relief was heavily gendered,"" says Williams. Elderly women were more than twice as likely to receive support than elderly men.Leunig agrees there was no support for single men in this era ""unless they were 'imbeciles' as they would have been called at the time - that is, unable to work.""""This era was a phenomenally sexist, patriarchal society where men were expected to work and support their families and women were not seen to be able to support their children alone. But it was also an era where strength was much more important in the labour market.""Fathers who did not pay child support were pursued by local officials for payments. In some cases they were sent to prison if they did not pay. Some of the parishes would work hard to recover child support payments, while others were more lax, says Williams. There was no universal system in place as there is today.However, it was often very difficult for the father to be traced as men went to war, went to sea or simply did not want to be found, adds Williams. It was very easy for a man to become invisible in large cities like London.Benefits were only given to those in dire need and it was largely expected that families would take care of their dependents.""You had to claim you were poor and that nobody else could look after you,"" says Leunig.Vocal members of society would name and shame those receiving relief. Each parish had special overseers of the poor. They would display public lists of those receiving poor relief, says Joanna Innes, modern history lecturer at Oxford University.""This was an anti-welfare measure and allowed the community to scrutinise those receiving relief.""The maximum of 70% relief given to those out of work under the old Poor Law is more than benefit claimants would get under the government's proposed £26,000 per-household cap on benefits, planned for 2013.But again it must be remembered that society is much wealthier today than it was in the early 19th Century, says Leunig.""Incomes were very low then. The benefits given were generous considering how poor society was, but by today's standards the pensions provided would not be enough to live off.""Although poor relief was given out locally, unemployment and the increasing cost of welfare in the late 18th and early 19th Century was a national problem, says Turner.""There were similar calls as there are today to restrict people's access to benefits. Many paupers, especially the young, were seen as capable of finding work so were stigmatised as being lazy."""

I am in Washington this week, and what is most surprising to people here is that the Summers' candidacy lasted as long as it did. One lesson is that President Obama really, really, wants ""one of his guys"" to run the Fed (and yes, the people who fit this description are all guys). We don't yet know  whether he has given up on that goal. Another conclusion you could draw is that when it comes to the financial system, many Senate Democrats are happier fighting the last war than worrying about the next one. Janet Yellen was quicker to see the seeds of the 2008-9 financial crisis being planted than Larry Summers was. But today, the financial imbalances that worry people most are the ones coming from the super-loose policies of the Federal Reserve. When it comes to those policies, it is Yellen - not Summers - who seems to be the true believer. True, Summers' enemies on Capitol Hill are a broad church. Some Democrats have hated him ever since a politically incorrect memo about the environment was written in his name while he was chief economist at the World Bank. But what seems to have damaged him most in his bid for the Fed is his association with the liberalisation of US financial markets when he was working for President Clinton, including the moves to free up investment banking and the trade in derivatives. (Full information: I was working for him at the US Treasury when this was happening.) Summers' enemies say these reforms helped pave the way for the financial crisis, by allowing enormous imbalances to build up in the under-regulated parts of the system, including the market for credit derivatives. The then Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, had argued strongly that the investors in these parts of the market could be trusted to look after their own interests. He was wrong, and the Clinton Treasury is fully implicated in that mistake. By contrast, Janet Yellen has a record as someone who sounded the financial alarm relatively early. That makes her a much more popular choice in the president's party. She is also very well qualified for the job. Even the academic heavyweights who came down on Summers' side have said that she would also be a strong choice. President Obama knows all that. He also knows if he doesn't appoint Yellen, he will seem to have gone out of his way not to appoint the first woman in this crucial job. Even fans of Summers might be uncomfortable with that. So, global investors might be right to think that Janet Yellen as chairman is now a sure thing. They are probably also right to consider her the more ""dove-ish"" choice. Though Summers has been tight-lipped about monetary policy since the start of the crisis, Yellen seems to have fewer reservations about the Fed continuing to have a super-loose policy stance - with or without ""tapering"". She is also more of a true believer when it comes to the value of forward guidance.As I mentioned at the start, that does not necessarily make her the safe choice right now, at a time when many worry about the distortions building up in the financial system as a result of all this cheap liquidity. But, President Obama may be less worried about that side to Janet Yellen than the simple fact that he does not know her. Whatever the truth, he cannot be entirely comfortable with her as Fed chair or he would have have nominated her already. The word is that Mr Obama tried quite hard to persuade Mr Bernanke to stay in the job. He also tried to get former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to put his hat in the ring. It is probably too late, now, for the president to revisit these options. It may also be too late for him to appoint his ""own man"". But having lost Summers, I can't help thinking Mr Obama will spend some time looking for a Plan C."

The White House and Congress are expected to clash again over the ultimate outcome of those cuts, delayed for two months.The previous debt-ceiling debate between between Congress and President Barack Obama ended in July 2011, after bringing the nation close to default, resulting in a credit-rating downgrade and financial market turmoil."

The former business secretary said arguments about the depth and speed of cuts were outdated and Labour should focus on how to rebuild the economy.To maximise its appeal, Labour must talk about extending prosperity as well as social justice, he added. Mr Balls declined to comment but Conservative MPs seized on the remarks.They have long argued that Labour have failed to put forward an alternative to the government's deficit reduction plan and would simply borrow more to pay for a short-term stimulus. In the wake of Wednesday's Budget - where growth forecasts were again slashed - Labour leader Ed Miliband and his shadow chancellor Ed Balls reiterated their call for the government to change direction, saying its measures were blunting growth and stalling efforts to cut borrowing. Lord Mandelson, a close ally of Tony Blair who backed Ed's brother David in the contest for the Labour leadership, has avoided personal criticism of the two men but has repeatedly attacked their strategy.He argues Labour needs to spell out its economic plans in more detail and say what it would do in power rather than just criticise the government. Speaking at a CBI dinner on Thursday, he said the ""whole argument about whether we are cutting too far and too fast"" was ""in the past"".""It is rather predictable party political stuff from over the dispatch box and it is a bit tiring to the public,"" he said.Instead, he said Labour must concentrate on the future shape of the economy after a prolonged squeeze on public spending and other austerity measures and how a long-term recovery could be sustained. And he added: ""If the Labour Party is going to go into the next election and fight it on social justice rather than economic transformation and prosperity, it will be limited in its appeal"". At the end of a week in which George Osborne's stewardship of the economy has been under fire, Conservative MPs took to Twitter to highlight Lord Mandelson's comments. ""Even Labour's former business secretary - a man who knows how to win elections - thinks Ed Balls is living in the past,"" said Dover MP Charlie Elphicke.""Labour have opposed every single saving this government is making to deal with the deficit, and are simply offering more of the same spending, borrowing and debt that got us into this mess in the first place.""Last month, Mr Miliband called for the restoration of the 10p tax band scrapped by Gordon Brown and a tax on properties worth more than £2m, his first significant tax pledges since being elected in 2010.

But it has little chance in the Democratic-held Senate.The bill would save $39bn (£24bn) over a decade, but affect four million people on the programme.It comes a day after census data showed 15% of Americans live in poverty.An estimated one in seven Americans - most of them children, elderly or disabled - receive food stamps.The bill aims to cut $4bn a year, representing about 5% of the current programme.The budget savings would be achieved by allowing states to use work requirements for recipients and test applicants for drugs. It would also end waivers to allow able-bodied adults without dependents to receive food stamps indefinitely.According to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), the food programme bill has tripled since 2004 and cost about $78bn last year.On Wednesday, the White House threatened to veto the legislation, claiming the ""cuts would affect a broad array of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet, including working families with children, senior citizens, veterans, and adults who are still looking for work"".The Congressional Budget Office says that if the bill were enacted, up to 3.8 million people could lose their benefits next year.But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who led the legislative push, said it was ""wrong for working, middle-class people to pay"" for abuse of the programme.Every Democrat voting on Thursday opposed the bill. Fifteen Republicans voted against the measure. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called it a ""full assault on the health and economic security of millions of families"". Another Democratic congressman, Texas Representative Lloyd Doggett, called it the ""let them starve"" bill.  The measure is likely to go nowhere in the Senate - Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow labelled it ""a monumental waste of time"". A bill passed in the Senate in June cut food stamps by $400m a year, one tenth of the House cuts.

If Steven Rhodes, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, agrees with them, the city would have to go back to the drawing board.Protesters outside the court in particular singled out Mr Orr, chanting, ""Down with Orr"" and ""Orr no more"". The appointment of Mr Orr, who is scheduled to testify on Monday, was controversial as it was done without voter support.Unions and pension funds won a small victory when it was ruled that Michigan governor Rick Snyder would have to testify on Friday.Furthermore, lawyers for the city admitted that plans to sell some works from the Detroit Institute of Arts might have to be shelved unless there is a leadership change at the museum. Current director Graham Beal has said the plan is ""abhorrent"" and has vowed to fight any efforts to sell the museum's artworks, which include major works by Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh.However, many experts still believe that the judge will eventually rule in Detroit's favour.City managers say bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's debts and liabilities.Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations.In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation.It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012.Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers - once the city's main source of employment - shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas.The city is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950.There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report."

""We have broken through the partisanship and gridlock,"" Ms Murray said of the new deal.Mr Ryan said he was optimistic the new budget agreement could pass both sides of the highly politically divided Congress.The measure is expected to come to a vote before the House recesses for several weeks beginning on Friday.According to the Congressional budget chairs, the new deal does not raise taxes but requires newly hired federal workers to make larger contributions to their pensions.A federal airport security fee adding $5 to the cost of a typical return flight is also included.Following the announcement on Tuesday, Republican House Speaker John Boehner called the ""modest"" cross-party deal a ""positive step forward"".US President Barack Obama issued a written statement labelling the agreement ""balanced"" and ""designed in a way that doesn't hurt our economy"".""This agreement doesn't include everything I'd like - and I know many Republicans feel the same way.

They include FedEx chief executive Frederick Smith.Money for the trust would come out of revenues from federal leases on current offshore drilling. The US government collects more than $6bn a year from production on federal lands and waters.Unlike the business group's proposal, the White House says it will not require the expansion of drilling.The fund would be used to sponsor research for technologies such as electric-car batteries, bio-fuels, natural gas or other non-oil fuel sources.In a bid to make it attractive to both parties, Mr Obama has argued that such a trust would not only be good environmental policy, but also a job-creation programme that would keep the US a technology leader.But a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said Mr Obama needs to expand drilling to get the support of the House's top Republican.""For this proposal to even be plausible, oil and gas leasing on federal land would need to increase dramatically,"" said the spokesman, Brendan Buck. On his way to Argonne, Mr Obama's motorcade passed protesters demonstrating against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport oil from Canada's tar sands to US Gulf Coast refineries. Republicans have pilloried Mr Obama's administration for delaying approval of the Keystone pipeline.White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters new investments in green energy technology were more important for easing the effects of climate change than whether or not the controversial pipeline gets built.During his first term, Mr Obama's administration invested $90bn of stimulus money into green energy projects.But the high-profile failure of California solar panel maker Solyndra, which had received $527m of government money, became a political cudgel for Republicans to bash the White House."

He worries more about his wife, who is in poor health, than about himself.""I take 15 prescriptions,"" says Mrs MacDonald, ""and I kind of jokingly said if they take [my healthcare] away, which pills do I stop without dying?""While it might seem unfathomable that the MacDonalds could face such a choice, the reality is that if Detroit's bankruptcy filing is allowed to proceed, the city will face extremely difficult decisions.Kevyn Orr, the emergency manager brought in to run the city by the state of Michigan, argues there is no way forward for Detroit other than through the fresh financial start that bankruptcy brings.The city is anywhere from $18bn (£11bn) to $20bn in debt - with $9bn a result of ballooning pension and healthcare costs.It has already cut basic services to the bone, pushing more residents to flee. The city's population now stands at 700,000, down from two million at Detroit's peak.Wait times for emergency calls now top one hour, and less than a third of the streetlights function. More than 80,000 properties have been abandoned. Nature, it seems, moves faster than federal court.Despite all the hardship, those representing the city's pension schemes say a bankruptcy filing would allow the city to renege on promises made long ago.They dispute Mr Orr's calculations, and say it's unfair that the 23,500 retirees who spent their lives working to keep Detroit safe and clean could be left with nothing.""They're taking away the American dream and turning it into the American nightmare,"" says Donald Hall, who spent 29 years as a detention centre officer and now depends on the $850 he receives from the city every month.There's no question that Detroit is unique among US cities, to fly so high and fall so far, to build landmarks like the majestic Michigan Central Station that less than a hundred years later have the aura of Roman ruins.So then what impact, if any, could a successful bankruptcy filing have on other cities?""On the one hand, Detroit is in an unusual position because it has had massive depopulation coupled with a collapse of the industrial sector,"" says University of Michigan law professor John Pottow, an expert in bankruptcy law.""On the other hand, Detroit was not alone in making legal commitments to people which it had no funding for.""According to a study by economists at Northwestern University, cities and counties across the US have a total of $574bn in unfunded pension obligations.Already, cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, and San Diego, California, have shown signs they are crumbling under the weight of the financial promises made to retirees.""If Detroit is able to file for bankruptcy, then every other big city is going to be watching this,"" says Prof Pottow.James Canty is a lifelong Detroit resident and manager of the city's parking department. I followed him on his daily rounds as he tried to rid the city of some of the thousands of abandoned cars that line its streets.The job was once done by the police. Now, Mr Canty's team has taken on the role of enforcer in an attempt to free up overworked officers.In neighbourhoods where it's hard to tell which, if any, of the houses are occupied, Mr Canty points to a white Chevrolet sedan with shattered windows here, a pick-up truck missing a wheel there.Frequently, as soon as a tow truck arrives to remove the offending vehicle, the vehicle's owner suddenly appears, as if by magic.The excuses are often similar - what looks like a derelict car is in fact in the process of being mended.It's not hard to see Detroit's financial position in the same way as these dented and decrepit cars - they may or may not be broken, depending on who is looking at them.Is it better to clear the way for something new - or to be forced to fix what only appears beyond repair?"

Although the result of the vote is non-binding, meaning Mr Dimon could continue as before, reports have suggested that he may resign if the votes are not in his favour.Both Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, influential firms that give advice to large shareholders, are recommending that the jobs be split. ""An independent chairman is better able to oversee the executives of a company and set a pro-shareholder agenda,"" Glass Lewis argues in its proxy report.Last year's annual meeting, which came just after the London Whale losses were first revealed, saw 40% of shareholders vote for a similar proposal. On previous occasions in 2007 and 2008 when shareholders were asked about separating the roles, just 15% voted in favour. ""Even a Master of the Universe can be swallowed by a London whale,"" said Lee Saunders, president of public employees' union AFSCME, which is also voting for the roles to be split.In April last year, JP Morgan reported a loss in a London-based division responsible for using trades to hedge the bank's overall risk in markets.At the time, Mr Dimon dismissed the incident as a ""tempest in a teapot"". But just a month later, he admitted the bank had lost about $2bn on the erroneous trades and was forced to acknowledge that the bank had shown ""bad judgement"".Bruno Iksil, the trader at the heart of the incident, was dubbed the London Whale because the huge positions he had taken on JP Morgan's behalf were big enough to move markets. Despite the incident, the bank insists that the joint role is the ""most effective leadership model."" Last week, it sent a letter to shareholders, urging them to reject the proposal to split the top two roles. ""We believe that a vote against our current directors or a vote to permanently separate the chairman and chief executive officer positions could be disruptive to the company and is not in shareholders' best interests,"" it wrote.The vote comes just after JP Morgan reported record first-quarter profits of $6.5bn (£4.2bn) for the first three months of the year. Retail banking deposits rose 10%, new mortgage orders rose 37% and the company said it had kept the top spot for earnings from investment banking.Mr Dimon has said the results indicate that no changes are necessary to either the bank's board or its financial structure.""The board should be applauded,"" Mr Dimon is reported to have said at a conference last week in Boston.

""There are few more important things we can do to create jobs right now and strengthen our economy over the long haul than rebuilding the infrastructure that powers our businesses and our economy,"" Mr Obama said in Miami.The upgrades at Port Miami - including a tunnel under the bay designed to link a highway with the port - are being funded by taxpayers as well as private investors.Mr Obama noted that the involvement of several jurisdictions, as well as private companies whose payments were tied to performance, meant ""construction workers are on the job digging this tunnel, doing great jobs, getting good pay"".""What are we waiting for?"" Mr Obama said, turning his attention to the wider US. ""There's work to be done, there are workers who are ready to do it.""All of Mr Obama's proposals require Congressional action, including the ""infrastructure bank"", a proposal he introduced in his first term that was never acted upon.But the turn toward private funding is driven in part by Republican opposition to increased government spending, analysts say.Republicans have been reluctant to support additional projects since Mr Obama and the Democrats passed a $787bn stimulus plan in 2009 that included infrastructure funding.And Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott has criticised Mr Obama for being ""late to the party"", arguing Florida taxpayers have had to pick up too much of the tab for the Miami and other port projects because the president was slow to support them.In a conference call with reporters on Friday, a senior Obama administration official said the proposals would not add to the federal budget deficit, saying details would be spelled out in the president's budget, expected to be released on 10 April.After touring the tunnel project at the port, Mr Obama said that such projects should draw support from both Republicans and his fellow Democrats, noting that both union groups and the pro-business US Chamber of Commerce agreed on the need for increased infrastructure spending.""I know that members of Congress are happy to welcome projects like this in their districts,"" he said. ""I know because I've seen them at the ribbon-cuttings.""If you think it's good for your district, then it's probably good for other districts, too."""

It is expected to come up for a simple majority vote on Wednesday.The Senate's top four Republican leaders - who are in the minority - voted to block consideration of the budget bill, though their opposition was mainly symbolic and they knew the bill would ultimately go forward, analysts say. If approved, it will go to Mr Obama for his signature.The proposal was drafted by a cross-party budget committee convened after a 16-day government shutdown in October.""This bipartisan bill takes the first steps toward rebuilding our broken budget process,"" Democratic Senator Patty Murray, co-writer of the bill, said.""We've spent far too long here scrambling to fix artificial crises instead of working together to solve the big problems we all know we need to address.""But the Senate's top Republican hinted a separate brawl was ahead, indicating the party would demand budget cuts in exchange for raising the US government's borrowing limit next year.""I doubt if the House, or for that matter the Senate, is willing to give the president a clean debt ceiling increase,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters.""We'll have to see what the House insists on adding to it as a condition for passing it.""The budget deal, which sets discretionary defence and domestic spending at $1 trillion (£610bn) for the current fiscal year, aims to shave up to $23bn from the nation's $642bn annual budget deficit.It also rolls back $63bn in military and domestic spending cuts automatically imposed in January when Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a budget compromise.The new deal does not raise taxes but requires newly hired federal workers to make larger contributions to their pensions.A federal airport security fee adding $5 to the cost of a typical return flight is also included.Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, chairman of the House budget committee, said last week the budget deal ""cuts spending in a smarter way"".It also helps avoid another government shutdown on 15 January when government funding would otherwise run out.The October partial government shutdown - which halted many federal services across the country - cost the US economy $24bn, as projected by financial services company Standard & Poor's."

For most of the world, a government shutdown is very bad news - the result of revolution, invasion or disaster. Even in the middle of its ongoing civil war, the Syrian government has continued to pay its bills and workers' wages. That leaders of one of the most powerful nations on earth willingly provoked a crisis that suspends public services and decreases economic growth is astonishing to many. American policymakers ""are facing the unthinkable prospect of shutting down the government as they squabble over the inconsequential accomplishment of a 10-week funding extension"", Mexico's The News wrote in an editorial. In the United States, however, government shutdowns - or the threat thereof - have become an accepted negotiating tactic, thanks to the quirks of the American federal system, which allows different branches of government to be controlled by different parties. It was a structure devised by the nation's founders to encourage compromise and deliberation, but lately has had just the opposite effect. Elsewhere in the world, such shutdowns are practically impossible. The parliamentary system used by most European democracies ensures that the executive and legislature are controlled by the same party or coalition. Conceivably, a parliament could refuse to pass a budget proposed by the prime minister, but such an action would likely trigger a failure of the government and a new election - witness the current situation in the Netherlands, where Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government faced a no-confidence vote at the start of debate over his 2014 budget proposal. And even when there is a gap prior to a new government taking office, national services continue to operate. In non-parliamentary democracies, such as Brazil, a strong executive branch has the ability to keep the lights on during a budget impasse. Such was the case in the United States as well, until a 1980 Carter administration interpretation of the 1884 Anti-Deficiency Act strictly limited the powers of federal agencies in the absence of congressional funding authorisations.Now, as the latest shutdown crisis plays out, policymakers in other nations are left to ponder the worldwide impact of the impasse.""Globalisation … means every country is in it together,"" writes David Blanchflower in the Independent in the UK. ""Americans sneeze and Brits catch the flu."" ""Canadians can only pray their economy won't be collateral damage,"" writes John Ibbitson in Canada's Globe and Mail. ""Anything that drags down the American economy drags the Canadian economy down with it."" And this could be another reason why the United States has shutdown crises and other countries don't - because the United States can afford to. At least up until now, the American economy has been able to continue to grind along despite shutdown disruptions that would stagger other nations. ""Constant-shutdown, permanent-emergency governance is so destructive that no other serious country engages in or could tolerate it,"" James Fallows writes in the Atlantic. ""The United States can afford it only because we are - still - so rich, with so much margin for waste and error."" "

At that time, they would be paid up front and in cash, but were they better off than today?It's a perennial issue every government has to grapple with, whatever its political persuasion. Is the welfare system too generous?The Welfare Reform Bill, currently going through parliament, is this government's attempt to introduce what it says is ""a simpler and fairer"" system. But proposed cuts will hit the poor hardest, argue opponents.New research shows that the amount of benefits given to those in need is a debate that has raged for hundreds of years. It also challenges commonly held beliefs that the poor in centuries past were universally left to flounder, often in crushing poverty.Cambridge historian Dr Samantha Williams has examined an early form of welfare in England and Wales called the Old English Poor Law. Under it, poor relief - as it was then called - was given out by the local parish.Looking at the plight of poor families in two Bedfordshire communities between 1760 and the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, her research reveals that a generous benefits system existed in parts of England.Payments were worked out according to the average household income of neighbouring working families. Lone mothers were the recipients of some of the biggest handouts, so were the elderly. Others did not fare so well.Under today's welfare system, such single mothers receive welfare includingincome support, child benefit, housing benefit and council tax benefit. The elderly get pensions, plus other help. But how did that compare with today?If a single pregnant mother wanted to claim poor relief before 1834, she had to go before two judicial officers and swear on the paternity of her child's father under oath. No other proof was needed. She would then receive benefits up front and the officials would try to reclaim money back from the father.The ""bastardy examinations"" - as they were called - required the father to pay back all the childbirth expenses, the legal expenses it cost to pursue him and regular maintenance payments for the child, similar to child maintenance payments today.If the father couldn't be found, the parish would support the woman. It was quite a financial undertaking as the birth of illegitimate children to errant fathers was massively widespread during this period in history, says Williams.Lone mothers could receive up to 37% of the income of neighbouring working households, according to the study, which does not cover lone fathers. Extras such as fuel, clothing and rent payments contributed another 8%.But wages and average living standards were extremely low and 45% would actually amount to very little, say historians. According to Williams, in 1834 the weekly wage of an average agricultural worker was nine shillings. It's the equivalent of 45p and would be worth just under £48 today, according to the Bank of England's inflation calculator. A lone mother would get just over four shillings a week, roughly the equivalent of 20p, which would be worth an estimated £19 today.So, while single mothers were well provided for, it is only relative to other welfare claimants of the time, says Dr Tim Leunig, an economics historian from the London School of Economics. In real terms they were not better off than today.""By today's standards these women would have been utterly impoverished,"" he says.Just like modern times, welfare expenditure was a topic of fierce debate in the early 19th Century. After the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 it became much harder for a single mother to claim money for her child. Identifying the father under oath was no longer enough.""Women had to provide corroborative evidence. She had to be seen courting the father in order to claim child support costs,"" says Dr Williams.It was pensioners who received the most generous benefits. Each case was separately judged and, if needed, they would also receive clothes, fuel, food, medical care and their burials would be paid for.With all the extra handouts they effectively got up to 70% of the average working household income in their area, but again in the 1800s it would not have amounted to much because wages were so low. It would work out at roughly £35 a week today.If today's pensioners got 70% of the average working household wage, it would total £451 per week. This is using theDWP's current average weekly income for a working couple, which is £644. The current basic state pension is £102, but the elderly do get other benefits on top.There was no set age to receiving a pension back then, it was given once deemed necessary. The term pension as we know it today did not come into place until the 1908 Pensions Act.""Pension in that era meant money to live on for the rest of your life. That's where the phrase 'pensioned off' comes from, you could be pensioned off at any age,"" says Dr Leunig.But again, things weren't quite as generous as they appear. If able, people were expected to work for as long as they could - however old they were.Some were pushed into poor relief because there was no work available, says Dr David Turner, a historian at Swansea University.""There were growing concerns about rising levels of poverty. The poor relief system was finding it difficult to cope with the demands of claimants, which is parallel to the welfare system today.""Poverty rapidly increased after 1790, as many men returned from the Revolutionary andNapoleonic Wars. Combined with harvest failures and rapid price inflation, this gave rise to a severe lack of jobs and increased reliance on poor relief.Men were the worst off when it came to benefits as they were expected to stay in work. Income support as we know it, which currently pays £67.50 a week to over 25s, and other benefits would have been very welcome. Instead vagrants, who wandered from job to job, were frequently whipped and sent to prison for short periods if they weren't working.""Access to poor relief was heavily gendered,"" says Williams. Elderly women were more than twice as likely to receive support than elderly men.Leunig agrees there was no support for single men in this era ""unless they were 'imbeciles' as they would have been called at the time - that is, unable to work.""""This era was a phenomenally sexist, patriarchal society where men were expected to work and support their families and women were not seen to be able to support their children alone. But it was also an era where strength was much more important in the labour market.""Fathers who did not pay child support were pursued by local officials for payments. In some cases they were sent to prison if they did not pay. Some of the parishes would work hard to recover child support payments, while others were more lax, says Williams. There was no universal system in place as there is today.However, it was often very difficult for the father to be traced as men went to war, went to sea or simply did not want to be found, adds Williams. It was very easy for a man to become invisible in large cities like London.Benefits were only given to those in dire need and it was largely expected that families would take care of their dependents.""You had to claim you were poor and that nobody else could look after you,"" says Leunig.Vocal members of society would name and shame those receiving relief. Each parish had special overseers of the poor. They would display public lists of those receiving poor relief, says Joanna Innes, modern history lecturer at Oxford University.""This was an anti-welfare measure and allowed the community to scrutinise those receiving relief.""The maximum of 70% relief given to those out of work under the old Poor Law is more than benefit claimants would get under the government's proposed £26,000 per-household cap on benefits, planned for 2013.But again it must be remembered that society is much wealthier today than it was in the early 19th Century, says Leunig.""Incomes were very low then. The benefits given were generous considering how poor society was, but by today's standards the pensions provided would not be enough to live off.""Although poor relief was given out locally, unemployment and the increasing cost of welfare in the late 18th and early 19th Century was a national problem, says Turner.""There were similar calls as there are today to restrict people's access to benefits. Many paupers, especially the young, were seen as capable of finding work so were stigmatised as being lazy."""

The men he once sat next to treated him as an ideological enemy with views that are repugnant. Some were also trying to settle personal scores with a man they regard as a turncoat.  In attacking him, they are also seeking to define Mr Obama - portraying his policies as defeatist and disloyal.Mr Hagel had been under attack for claiming ""the Jewish lobby"" had too much influence on America's politicians. So he went out of his way to stress that he had always been a ""strong friend"" of Israel - underscoring the fact for some Republicans, any criticism of Israel's government is unacceptable. A fellow Vietnam veteran, Senator John McCain, said he had fundamental questions about his one-time friend, who broke ranks with his party over Iraq. He said he questioned Mr Hagel's judgment and his world view. He tore into the nominee for suggesting, at the time, that the Iraq surge was a potentially disastrous policy. Sen McCain wanted only ""yes"" or ""no"" answers, not explanations. It is interesting that both men assumed the surge was beyond criticism. While it is unarguable that it was a military success, it is at least possible to contend it has had little long-term impact. 'Gotcha'Repeatedly the senators insisted he gave a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" to complex questions. These are old men who hold themselves in high regard, but seem to see serious examination of difficult problems as a personal affront. They desperately want to play ""gotcha"", but haven't the self-restraint to design effective questions. They love the sound of their own voices too much to trap their opponent. Mr Hagel was equally unimpressive, almost unprepared, for a level of hostility that had been signalled long in advance. Neither smart, nor humble, his tactic seemed to be a kind of bumbling blandness. The exception, in style if not ideology, was Ted Cruz, a new senator from Texas. Razor sharp, he ripped into the nominee with all the skill honed as a Texas solicitor general, playing sequences from al-Jazeera where Mr Hagel appeared to agree America behaved like a bully in the world and that Israel was guilty of war crimes.Rather than defend the views he expressed, the former senator suggested he hadn't understood the questions on the TV show. ""Highly troubling,"" was Sen Cruz's verdict. That could be a verdict on the whole process, which has been used not to examine a candidate's fitness for high office, but to underline the rather obvious fact that the Obama administration does not share the world view of Republican senators, and they don't like their former colleague joining it."

The unemployment rate fell to 7.7% last month, the lowest since December 2008, from 7.9% in January, figures showed.But the White House's chief economist said more work was needed as Congress remained divided over economic policy.  Employment growth has risen by an average of 195,000 a month in the last three months, figures show. Analysts had forecast a rise of 165,000 jobs for February. Following the release of the jobs figures, stocks on Wall Street opened higher with the Dow Jones index up 62.23 points at 14,391.72. The dollar also gained against the euro and the yen. Professional and business services added 73,000 jobs last month, while the construction industry hired 48,000 employees. The health care industry added 32,000 jobs and the retail sector added 24,000 new staff. Only government lost 10,000 jobs in February, mostly in local education. The public education sector has now lost 340,700 jobs since its 2009 peak.But the number of long-term unemployed - out of a job for at least 27 weeks - was unchanged, accounting for about 40% of the jobless total.""Progress in the labour market is unmistakable. The economy is producing more than twice as many jobs as it did at the low point in the second quarter of last year,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at Worldwidemarkets.But he warned that optimism was ""relative"", because of slow economic growth. The economy in the October-December quarter made modest gains, growing at an annualised rate of just 0.1%.Analysts are now debating whether the labour market is strong enough to weather a series of public spending cuts, known as the sequester, and whether the Federal Reserve will continue with its loose monetary policy.The latest jobs report takes into account the period before the sequester officially began on 1 March.Last week, President Barack Obama signed into effect spending cuts worth $85bn (£56bn), although he warned that the cuts - if fully realised - would slow US economic growth by 0.5% and cost 750,000 jobs.The sequester was drawn up in mid-2011 as Congress and the White House feuded over raising the debt ceiling and how to slash the huge US deficit. Republicans wanted deep cuts in spending, while Democrats insisted on raising taxes as part of any plan to tackle the country's $16.6 trillion debt.Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said: ""While more work remains to be done, today's employment report provides evidence that the recovery that began in mid-2009 is gaining traction.""The White House continued ""to urge Congress to move toward a sustainable Federal budget"", he said, and warned against ""reading too much into any one monthly report"" as payroll estimates were volatile and could be revised substantially.John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House, said: ""Any job creation is positive news, but the fact is unemployment in America is still way above the levels the Obama White House projected when the trillion-dollar stimulus spending bill was enacted, and the federal government's ongoing spending binge has resulted in a debt that exceeds the size of our entire economy."" The US Federal Reserve has said it will keep interest rates close to zero and will continue buying $85bn of bonds a month until there is a substantial improvement in the labour market.Jacob Oubina, senior US economist at RBC Capital Markets, said: ""This was a strong number and one of those rare cases where we were firing on all cylinders. Having said that, this will likely not mean much for Fed policy as they will need to see more than one month of strong numbers and if it is sustained."""

My guess is in the end that the president will have to accept it - but he'll play hard ball and make it clear he's got his way.The president's spokesman, Jay Carney, says that Mr Obama is happy cooler heads seem to have prevailed and there is a recognition that default is not an option. But the White House is still using very tough language saying the American people should not be punished so the Republicans can save face.He says the president would probably sign a no-strings-attached, short-term deal to lift the debt ceiling. But he suggested he wouldn't ""pay ransom"" for that deal.In other words there's unlikely to be a formal promise to negotiate. There may be an informal agreement, but this is of course all part of the negotiations. Earlier this morning, one Democratic senator compared this crisis to a blindfolded man walking towards the edge of the cliff.The Republican leadership has taken the blindfold off and taken a sudden leap backwards.Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner sounded tough, even as he backed down.""What we want to do is to offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, an agreement to go to conference on the budget for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government and to start to deal with America's pressing problems.""Notice there's no mention of the original demand that ""Obamacare"" must be delayed or otherwise damaged.But the offer still leaves the government shutdown.The White House will want to see the formal wording of any bill before it bites and that won't be the end of it.  First, intelligence from up on the Hill suggests that getting enough Republican votes could be hard, although influential conservative blogs are not being too critical. However, there probably will be a backlash from some supporters who will feel betrayed. How loudly they shout now could change the calculations.  And even if the initial deal is done it will mean at least six weeks of jittery uncertainty hanging over the American economy - at the end of which we could be back where we started.The White House describes that as ""spite"" - towards the American people.Still a deal to avert what some describe as a catastrophe next week is now possible, even likely.But wrestling on the edge of a cliff is an unpredictable business."

The average increase for a low income family under the new scheme will be nearly £140 a year, the report found. Some families will be forced to pay for the first time.Mr Blackburn said passing on the cost to recipients was the only fair way to balance the books and prevent further budget cuts, as so many residents were in receipt of council tax benefits.He said: ""There's a calculation about how much of this government cut you are prepared to pass on to the general taxpayer and how much of it do we unfortunately have to pass on to the victims of this and that's people on benefits.""The council said the new level of support will be calculated in the same way as the current benefit, and then a further 27.11% reduction will be made.The news comes a month after a 0.01% drop in council tax was announced."

But it has little chance in the Democratic-held Senate.The bill would save $39bn (£24bn) over a decade, but affect four million people on the programme.It comes a day after census data showed 15% of Americans live in poverty.An estimated one in seven Americans - most of them children, elderly or disabled - receive food stamps.The bill aims to cut $4bn a year, representing about 5% of the current programme.The budget savings would be achieved by allowing states to use work requirements for recipients and test applicants for drugs. It would also end waivers to allow able-bodied adults without dependents to receive food stamps indefinitely.According to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), the food programme bill has tripled since 2004 and cost about $78bn last year.On Wednesday, the White House threatened to veto the legislation, claiming the ""cuts would affect a broad array of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet, including working families with children, senior citizens, veterans, and adults who are still looking for work"".The Congressional Budget Office says that if the bill were enacted, up to 3.8 million people could lose their benefits next year.But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who led the legislative push, said it was ""wrong for working, middle-class people to pay"" for abuse of the programme.Every Democrat voting on Thursday opposed the bill. Fifteen Republicans voted against the measure. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called it a ""full assault on the health and economic security of millions of families"".

""There are few more important things we can do to create jobs right now and strengthen our economy over the long haul than rebuilding the infrastructure that powers our businesses and our economy,"" Mr Obama said in Miami.The upgrades at Port Miami - including a tunnel under the bay designed to link a highway with the port - are being funded by taxpayers as well as private investors.Mr Obama noted that the involvement of several jurisdictions, as well as private companies whose payments were tied to performance, meant ""construction workers are on the job digging this tunnel, doing great jobs, getting good pay"".""What are we waiting for?"" Mr Obama said, turning his attention to the wider US. ""There's work to be done, there are workers who are ready to do it.""All of Mr Obama's proposals require Congressional action, including the ""infrastructure bank"", a proposal he introduced in his first term that was never acted upon.But the turn toward private funding is driven in part by Republican opposition to increased government spending, analysts say.Republicans have been reluctant to support additional projects since Mr Obama and the Democrats passed a $787bn stimulus plan in 2009 that included infrastructure funding.And Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott has criticised Mr Obama for being ""late to the party"", arguing Florida taxpayers have had to pick up too much of the tab for the Miami and other port projects because the president was slow to support them.In a conference call with reporters on Friday, a senior Obama administration official said the proposals would not add to the federal budget deficit, saying details would be spelled out in the president's budget, expected to be released on 10 April.After touring the tunnel project at the port, Mr Obama said that such projects should draw support from both Republicans and his fellow Democrats, noting that both union groups and the pro-business US Chamber of Commerce agreed on the need for increased infrastructure spending.""I know that members of Congress are happy to welcome projects like this in their districts,"" he said.

But of course, rates did go lower, because of the Fed's extraordinary efforts to lower longer-term mortgage rates by buying mortgage-backed securities as part of quantitative easing. Once more, the couple did the maths - and figured out that another refinancing effort could help them.This time around, the rate on their 30-year mortgage was lowered to 3.785%, which allowed them to save more than $300 a month on mortgage payments. Additionally, they could pay off credit card debt that had accumulated during the recession.""We just wanted to get back on our feet, feel good about our money situation and start saving,"" says Julianne.Now, they can repaint their home, go out to dinner and begin saving for the future college tuition of their two daughters, aged nine and 12.""This was our first summer in a long time when were able to not worry,"" says Julianne.The US economy was also relatively worry free this summer, with job growth holding relatively constant at 160,000 a month and good, if not great, GDP figures.The Fed's efforts to boost consumer spending by keeping mortgage rates low and then lower seems to have worked, as the Philps and others like them recover from the wounds of the recession and begin to find themselves with extra cash on hand.But the question remains: is the US economy strong enough to continue to grow without the Fed's extraordinary efforts?Wendy Nastasi, the mortgage broker who helped the Philps with their refinancing, worries that the tap might be prematurely turned off.""We've seen a dramatic increase in mortgage rates, almost overnight,"" says Ms Nastasi.Over the summer, the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose one percentage point, and already the number of US homeowners looking to refinance has plunged from 17% in early 2013 to just 2% today.""You're going to see what improvements we're seeing in the housing market stall,"" cautions Ms Nastasi.This stall could have a knock-on impact.""If you have fewer mortgage refinancings, that suggests that households will have less cash than otherwise to spend on a variety of goods and services,"" says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets. Mr Lonski says that since consumer spending makes up two-thirds of US economic activity, a slowdown in refinancing could have profound effects.So this is the tightrope walk that the Fed must negotiate.On the one hand, Mr Bernanke and his fellow central bankers worry about keeping their foot on the accelerator for too long, potentially leading to higher inflation. But take their foot off too soon and they risk prematurely slamming on the brakes of a fragile US recovery.""Personally, I think it is too soon to taper, because the economic data have been disappointing and inflation is below target,"" says Mr Gagnon, who is now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank in Washington DC.""But I think several members of the committee are nervous about buying so many bonds.""At the Park Wayne Diner, just a few minutes away from the Philps' house, the difficulties of the situation are on full display.Owner John Stoupakis says that business has been good, but not great.""I think the economy is going to be better, but it's not where it's supposed to be - here, business has been off,"" he says as he surveys his busy, if not bustling, dining room.Diner patron Jerry Eisenberg says he's impatient for the Fed to stop its stimulus efforts.As a retiree, he says low interest rates have hurt his savings.""We could feel a little more freer to spend [if rates were higher],"" he says. ""To make money on savings, you have to take risks now.""But for others, the situation remains grim.""I haven't worked in nine months, I'm looking for anything that will pay me,"" says 30-year-old Travis Nonn.""If the economy's improving, you can't prove it by me."""

Ms Lerner, a career civil servant, declined to testify in Congress on the matter, citing protection under the US constitution against self-incrimination.Two senior IRS officials have already resigned over the affair.The additional IRS scrutiny given to political organisations seeking tax-exempt status under a section of US tax law covering non-profit groups began in 2010.That year, the US Supreme Court loosened restrictions on political spending by organisations unaffiliated with candidates' campaigns, leading to a surge in applications for tax-exempt status by newly created political groups.The practice, which the IRS has since halted, was first revealed in May by Ms Lerner. Investigators with the US treasury department subsequently confirmed civil servants in an IRS office in Ohio had drawn up a list of key words in organisations' names that would trigger extra scrutiny. Republicans suggested the undue attention to conservative groups was directed by the White House but have not produced any evidence to support the allegation.  The treasury department found no evidence of political influence in the matter and put the practice down to overworked civil servants seeking shortcuts. The agency's new chief later said the IRS watch list included a ""broad spectrum"" of political keywords, not just those indicating a conservative orientation.On Monday, the IRS said it had ""taken decisive actions to correct failures in exempt organizations management""."

Is the state prepared to have this many people with no source of income?""Under a law passed in February by North Carolina's Republican legislature, the state forfeits federal funds that support the long-term unemployed by cutting the dollar amount of weekly benefits offered to shorter-term unemployed residents.While other US states have reduced the length of time unemployment benefits are paid out, most have spared weekly benefit payments, thereby avoiding the loss of federal assistance to the long-term jobless.A handful of states have approved cuts to weekly benefits that took affect after federal benefits expired - only then to see the federal benefits extended, the Associated Press reported.At the heart of the matter is $2.5bn (£1.6bn) in debt North Carolina owes to the US government, which the state accrued to pay for a sharp rise in demand for benefits during the 2009 economic meltdown.Under the February law, the state's budget will see a net increase of $3.6bn over four years. More than two-thirds of that comes from benefit cuts, with the rest made up in tax rises to employers.Much of the savings is being redirected toward the debt owed to the US.North Carolina officials hope the debt will now be paid down by 2015 or 2016, not 2018 as before the February law was passed.The law was signed by Republican Governor Pat McCrory in February. Mr McCrory said it would protect the state's small businesses from ""continued over-taxation"" while securing the unemployment safety net and encouraging businesses to create jobs.State Representative Julia Howard, the Republican who sponsored the bill, suggested the cuts would push out-of-work North Carolinians to find employment faster.""It may not be the job that you want or your career for the rest of your life,"" she said.Critics of the law say the state legislature has favoured businesses over the state's workers. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other groups have staged Monday protests at the state assembly for seven weeks against the legislature's more conservative policies.Democratic State Representative Paul Luebke told the Raleigh News and Observer he and others would continue to fight for the restoration of the programme.""This is critical income,"" Mr Luebke said.

""Unless he is instructing all Tory councils and Tory councillors not to take an increase in allowances, then his words are just meaningless posturing."" Elsewhere in the report it said other issues facing local councillors included an increasing workload and difficulties in getting the time needed off work.Mr Betts said: ""Few councillors will vote themselves higher allowances, even if there is a legitimate reason for doing so, because it provokes so much public controversy.""Councils should be given the power to transfer decisions about allowances to independent local bodies.""It would be inconsistent for Parliament to deny councils the option it has chosen for the determination of its own pay and conditions."""

But the White House is still using very tough language saying the American people should not be punished so the Republicans can save face.He says the president would probably sign a no-strings-attached, short-term deal to lift the debt ceiling. But he suggested he wouldn't ""pay ransom"" for that deal.In other words there's unlikely to be a formal promise to negotiate. There may be an informal agreement, but this is of course all part of the negotiations. Earlier this morning, one Democratic senator compared this crisis to a blindfolded man walking towards the edge of the cliff.The Republican leadership has taken the blindfold off and taken a sudden leap backwards.Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner sounded tough, even as he backed down.""What we want to do is to offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, an agreement to go to conference on the budget for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government and to start to deal with America's pressing problems.""Notice there's no mention of the original demand that ""Obamacare"" must be delayed or otherwise damaged.But the offer still leaves the government shutdown.The White House will want to see the formal wording of any bill before it bites and that won't be the end of it.  First, intelligence from up on the Hill suggests that getting enough Republican votes could be hard, although influential conservative blogs are not being too critical. However, there probably will be a backlash from some supporters who will feel betrayed. How loudly they shout now could change the calculations.  And even if the initial deal is done it will mean at least six weeks of jittery uncertainty hanging over the American economy - at the end of which we could be back where we started.The White House describes that as ""spite"" - towards the American people.Still a deal to avert what some describe as a catastrophe next week is now possible, even likely.But wrestling on the edge of a cliff is an unpredictable business."

One conservative strategist I spoke to told me his side thought that breaching the debt ceiling would not be a disaster and they would be trying hard to get that line out.While Mr Obama noted ""the usual messy process of American democracy"", he said twice he was taking a stand now for future presidents who could not be expected to choose between ""world-wide catastrophe and making concessions to one faction of one party of one House"".Very near the end he said: ""I'm not budging.""The president has been so clear, so often, that he cannot blink.

This ends much of the drama on Capitol Hill - but not for House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, whose political future is up in the air. Most Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown of the government. Many focus their ire on Mr Boehner. Some people are now calling for his removal. Others say he did as well as anyone could and should remain in office. Here is a look at what his future holds.It's now clear that he cannot control his caucus. In every episode of this comedy, he's had to do the same thing: look like he's in charge of his caucus, wait for the last minute and then fold his hand. What's next for him? When you're not in charge, and you want to look like you're in charge, then you race to the front of the crowd and find the exit.I don't know what's going to happen to him. But I would like him to pack up, go home and keep his mouth shut - and I would like us to get a conservative constitutional Republican to be speaker of the House, someone with backbone.Nobody's particularly graceful trying to juggle knives while roller skating - though I don't feel pity for him. He asked for the role. We shouldn't be surprised when people who run for powerful offices get damaged by the power they have. It's as old as the ages.I don't think he should be ashamed of anything that he has done. I'm more upset with my Republican conference to be honest with you… If anybody should be kicked out, it's probably those Republicans and not Speaker Boehner.  (presentation, Heritage Foundation, 16 October) Boehner did not lead the charge, and therefore the Tea Party movement is not impressed with the quality of his backbone. It remains to be seen whether or not he will now cave, as established Republicans have done for decades.I think he'll continue as speaker of the House. There's not an easy mechanism to remove a speaker of the House, and I'd be very surprised if that were to occur.He is speaker of the House, and if anybody wanted to move against him, that would have to be voted on by the entire House. I don't think it's going to come to that. I think he has enough support among the party caucus, and he's not a loser. He's one who's followed the wishes of his caucus.

""If we did that we might again see a Wales where excellence is championed in a dual education system.""Prime Minister David Cameron is not in favour of increasing selective education in England, a policy that has caused disquiet in the Conservative party and led to the resignation of front-bencher Graham Brady in 2007.Under devolution, the Welsh Tories are free to set their own policy independent of Mr Cameron's party in London.A Conservative Central Office spokesman said: ""We don't have an opinion on Welsh education policy because it is a devolved matter.""If they were in power, the Welsh Conservatives would not adopt the old system of academic testing at 11, which Ms Burns concedes was divisive.But she insists the dual education system would raise standards and help brighter pupils from poorer backgrounds.Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said too many pupils were coming out of education with the wrong type of qualification for employers and it was about making the right choices - academic and vocational - at the age of 14.Pupils would remain in the same schools where appropriate but some would carry on with academic subjects, while others would take vocational options.Mr Davies told BBC Radio Wales they wanted to ""bring the best elements of the grammar school system"" and that the current system was failing in Wales.""Ultimately you are good at vocational courses that would qualify you for the workplace in a vocational manner - or academia,"" he said.""What we have at the moment is a system that actually constrains academic achievement and this homogenised blob that says everyone is the same.""That's no good for the 21st Century. We have got to be pushing academics and we have got to be pushing vocational courses and have parity between the two.""He added: ""If we're going to develop an economy that's fit for the 21st Century we have to have learners coming out of education with the qualifications that are robust and appropriate.""Ms Burns cited research from London University's Institute of Education which she said shows that the abolition of grammar schools has blocked disadvantaged pupils' ""escape routes"" to top universities and high-paid professional careers. She added: ""Instead of separating academic children from their more vocational counterparts, we could see the benefit of creating two equitable streams of education, one alongside the other, a dualling that begins at 14 - giving children the chance to develop important core subject skills before embarking on their chosen path.""Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis said he ""thought someone was pulling my leg"" when he was told of the Welsh Conservatives' proposal.Mr Lewis wrote a series of messages on Twitter criticising the policy, saying the Labour-run Welsh government was ""committed to excellent schools for all, not encouraging a parental scramble for advantage"".There were numerous unanswered questions about the Tory plan, he said, including whether pupils would remain in the same school after the age of 14 and whether all would take the GCSE qualification.The head teachers' union called it an ""intriguing development"" for Wales, where grammar schools were a ""distant memory for most.""Anna Brychan, director of NAHT Cymru said the proposals currently raised more questions than they answered.""The grammar school system is remembered positively by those who benefited from it,"" she said.

""This is only possible if Virginia is the model for bipartisan co-operation.""During the campaign, Mr McAuliffe had emphasised his opponent's tea party support. The hardline wing of the Republican party was widely blamed for last month's government shutdown, which temporarily laid off many of the federal workers who populate Virginia's suburbs.Mr Cuccinelli, the state's outgoing attorney general, had stressed his Democratic rival's championing of the Obama healthcare law, whose troubled rollout has been a White House public relations disaster.A Libertarian candidate who won nearly 7% of Virginia's vote may have cost the Republican the race, say analysts. Mr Cuccinelli was also vastly outspent by his Democratic opponent. Mr McAuliffe is a veteran Democratic party fundraiser who was chairman of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.His capture of the governor's mansion in a crucial presidential swing-voting state could help plot a road map to victory for her should she run again for the White House, say analysts.Meanwhile, Mr de Blasio will succeed New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to become the first Democratic mayor of America's largest city since 1993.He secured a whopping 73% of the vote, compared with 24% for his Republican rival, Joe Lhota.In his victory speech, Mr de Blasio said the result showed that America's largest city had chosen ""a progressive path"", and he promised to make fighting income inequality his top priority.

He won 54% to 45%, and Ms Colbert Busch called to concede early in the evening.""The people have spoken, and I respect their decision,"" she said in a brief statement on Tuesday evening. Meanwhile, Mr Sanford was cheered by supporters as he said voters had sent ""a messenger to Washington DC on the importance of changing things in that fair city"".The race was competitive, though the district is seen as firmly Republican. No Democrat has represented the district since the early 1980s.The seat was left vacant when its previous occupant, Tim Scott, was appointed to a vacant Senate seat.Mr Sanford said ahead of the results he would retire from politics if defeated.""You can go back in and you can ask for a second chance in a political sense once,"" he said on Tuesday after voting. ""I've done that, and we'll see what the voters say.""The former governor, once considered a rising star in the Republican party, saw his political fortunes fall in 2009 when he acknowledged an extramarital affair.After telling his staff he was hiking the famed Appalachian Trail and disappearing for several days, the then-married governor returned to the state to admit that he had been in Argentina with a mistress.He was censured by the state legislature and fined $70,000 (£45,000) for the travel expenses - the largest ethics fine in state history. But Mr Sanford defied numerous calls to step down before his term ended in January 2011.He divorced his wife, Jenny, and is now engaged to the Argentine woman, ex-TV reporter Maria Belen Chapur. Ms Colbert Busch, 58, is a businesswoman and the sister of television political satirist Stephen Colbert, who raised money for her campaign.She gained the endorsement of The Post and Courier, a major newspaper in the area, which said she offered ""responsible leadership"" and was ""a welcome tonic"" for ""Sanford fatigue"".Ms Colbert Busch focused on her business experience during the race, initially refusing to make Mr Sanford's past an issue.But last week, she reminded voters during a televised debate that Mr Sanford had used taxpayer money to leave the state for personal reasons.The former governor's attempt at a political comeback was not entirely smooth.Three weeks before the special election, it was revealed that his ex-wife had filed a court complaint alleging he had entered her house in February without permission, a violation of their divorce agreement.Mr Sanford said he had been unable to get in touch with her and had been in the house to watch the Super Bowl championship football game with his youngest son. He is due in court on Thursday.The national Republican party pulled its support from the campaign after the complaint became public."

""I hadn't prepared for anything, it was a case of winging it and making it up as I went along.""Mr Drummond, a father-of-three, said he had an ""extended honeymoon period"" with those outside the civic centre, but not some of the councillors he was working alongside. ""The public saw me as one of them and almost put a protective arm around me to support me through those early years. ""Getting the respect and credibility from councillors?  I probably haven't even got it from some of them now, but that was always going to be a challenge."" There was a ""huge shift"" in attitudes, Mr Drummond said, when he was re-elected in 2005 with a majority of more than 10,000.He looks back over his tenure with pride.""I've been quite overwhelmed by the support I've been given from people and the amount of people who have expressed their disappointment at what's happened,"" he said.""If all those people had voted in the referendum we might have had a different result.""The mayor insisted the result of the poll does not rankle with him personally as he would not have stood for a fourth term.""It's a shame that nobody else will get the opportunity to step into my shoes and bring a fresh pair of eyes to it and take it to the next stage,"" he said.""It's not really the system of governance that's important, it's about how the town fares and the decisions that are made.""Having one directly-accountable figurehead for the town has helped Hartlepool punch above its weight, Mr Drummond believes.""Hartlepool is like one of the biggest villages in the country. There's a strong community spirit and a lot of local pride here. ""To have somebody to be able to promote that on a regional, national and international basis is a big benefit.""Hosting the Tall Ships in 2010 gave the town a huge boost in confidence, the mayor said.""For us to bring the world to Hartlepool and see so many people smiling and enjoying themselves, that doesn't really happen that often.  ""Every day in this role you're always trying to improve things and make people feel better in their own lives. The Tall Ships did it perfectly.""Mr Drummond took a deep breath before describing the ""most challenging"" role of his life.Soon after joining Cleveland Police Authority, he found himself elevated to chair. ""Little did I realise the 12 months that lay ahead,"" he said.""I didn't realise the state the authority was in.  It was on the verge of government intervention because it was so poorly governed.""Operation Sacristy, a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption at the authority, began in May 2011, six months before Mr Drummond took over.The investigation continues and the former chief constable and deputy chief constable have been sacked for gross misconduct in recent months following separate misconduct hearings.""If it was a TV drama it would be quite hard to believe,"" Mr Drummond said.""In the fullness of time everything will be made available and people will make their own conclusions. All I can say is I wouldn't want to go through that again.""If Mr Drummond breathed a sigh of relief on leaving his police role, his wife Rebecca will be even happier when he leaves his current job.""She cannot wait for 6 May when I won't be elected mayor anymore.  She doesn't like the attention it brings and some of the publicity. She's really looking forward to it.""So what does the future hold? There are, Mr Drummond said, ""a couple of irons in the fire"".""I've had some interviews recently and I've been telling some of these tales and people have been flabbergasted.""From day one the whole thing has been unconventional. It's not a bad thing to have on your CV I don't suppose.  ""Whatever I do next I will always be banging the drum for Hartlepool.""That's in my blood now."""

Total turnout in the election was higher than expected at nearly 40%.The Seanad has existed for more than 90 years.The current Irish government had argued it cost too much to run and that its abolition could have saved Irish taxpayers as much as 20m euros (£16.92m) a year.Opponents wanted it retained and reformed, saying it played an essential role in holding governments to account.More than three million people were eligible to vote on whether or not to abolish the Seanad.Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny had claimed the abolition of the Seanad would create a leaner, more effective and more accountable system of government.After the result, he said:  ""Sometimes in politics you get a wallop in the electoral process. ""I accept the verdict of the people. But I also say in humility in accepting that verdict, that there is a virtue in actually being able to stand before the people and say: 'I did say four years ago I would ask you this question. We've honoured that commitment in full and so have you'. ""You've given your verdict and decision and I accept it fully.""Opponents, led by the largest opposition party Fianna Fáil, said the Seanad was necessary to serve as a government watchdog and to hold cabinet ministers to account.BBC Dublin correspondent Shane Harrison said the result would be a disappointment for Enda Kenny.""Abolition was very much the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny's idea and he has been criticised by Sinn Féin - his temporary ally during the campaign - for his failure to debate the issue with opponents on radio and television,"" he said.""Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams and his colleagues will not be happy that voters in party strongholds in Dublin, rejected their recommendation.""The vote was much better news for Fianna Fáil, the only major party to oppose abolition and suggest the Seanad should be reformed.""Independent senator Katherine Zappone said it was important that senators now held a meeting with the prime minister to come up with a way of ensuring that the upper house was reformed.Meanwhile, the referendum to establish a Court of Appeal has been passed by a majority of almost two to one.The official result shows just over 65% of voters were in favour of establishing the court.The new court is expected to be operating by this time next year"

The Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Times both claim that Tory MP for Windsor, Adam Afriyie, is being tipped to be the next Tory leader. More than 100 Conservative MPs have been approached about whether or not they would support Mr Afriyie in a future leadership battle, says the Times. It quotes a friend as saying they are well organised.Mr Afriyie has spoken to the Mail on Sunday. And when asked about a plot, he said it was a very naughty conversation - even mischievous - especially as he supported Mr Cameron's leadership bid.The paper claims 40 MPs have already signed a letter saying they would support him if the moment came, due to dissatisfaction with the status quo.  But the Sun on Sunday says Mr Cameron's European speech has put the brakes on any plot to replace him with a ""Tory Obama"", because his in/out referendum pledge has garnered huge support. Meanwhile, the Sunday Mirror publishes its first poll since the prime minister's speech on plans for a referendum on the EU. It shows the Tories up five points, UKIP down four points and Labour unchanged.A ComRes poll for the Independent on Sunday suggests public opinion is on Mr Cameron's side and he has gained an immediate surge in support.But in an interview with the Sunday Times, Labour leader Ed Miliband says UKIP has Mr Cameron on the run.The Observer turns to the incoming Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, suggesting he will order a policy revolution to jump-start the economy.But there is even more anticipation over Andy Murray's Australian Open final match against long-time rival and friend, Novak Djokovic. ""Come on Andy"", says the Sunday Express.The paper is already declaring Murray the ""Wizard of Oz"", while the Independent on Sunday's front page reads, ""we salute you"", beside a picture of Murray in action. Today is ""Murray's day of destiny"" adds the Mail on Sunday. Win today and you can call yourself the best tennis player in the world, it claims.A picture of his beaming mother Judy, graces the front page of the Observer, which assesses his transformation. Sushi, protein shakes, ice baths, beach running and endless weight-training have helped get him to another grand slam final, according to the paper.Or perhaps it is down to bananas, says the Sunday Times."

He was joined at his victory speech by the Argentine woman - now his fiancee - with whom he was having an extramarital affair in 2009.

10864	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24831236	News	1	Elections	None	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	bbc.co.uk	"For the Republican Party, this night is not only the tale of two elections, but of two possible paths. I am at the rally of the defeated candidate in Virginia, watching the victorious Republican in New Jersey on the big screen in the hotel ball room. The loser in this race, Ken Cuccinelli, comes into the hotel ballroom to country music, cheers and waves.  Some think Republicans lost here because of him and his hard line. He's a social conservative accused by his opponents of wanting to bring back anti-sodomy laws and trying to make divorce more difficult. Backed by the radical right-wing Tea Party movement,  he fought this campaign against the background of a government shut down forced by his allies. And he's not apologising.In his speech, he promises that the battle is not over. After him, another Republican comes on promising that they will block everything their opponents want to do, and saying the elected governor has no mandate to act. Earlier, the head of the Virginia Republican Party makes a bitter little speech accusing the Democrats of running the dirtiest campaign he's ever seen, demonising decent men, who love their families, their country and their God. It is not exactly a sign of profound self-reflection. Another warns the country is in economic and spiritual decline. ""We can fix it by repealing Obamacare,""  he says. This is the Republican mood in this vital state, a state that is slipping through their grasp. For decades it voted solidly Republican in the presidential election. But in 2008  it voted for Obama. It voted for him again in 2012 in slightly bigger numbers. It is changing, becoming less white, less rural, with an important Hispanic population. In those respects, it is like much of the United States. You might think that when Chris Christie, victor in the traditionally Democratic state of New Jersey, where he crushed the opposition, appeared on the twin screens, thumping home a message of working together, of one America, of buckling down and getting the job done, they would have fallen silent and listened. They carried on chatting.But one group I spoke to afterwards said that it was what their party needed - a dose of moderation and compromise. But they were in a minority. More typical was the man who told me: ""Reach across the aisle and they'll bite your arm off.""Earlier at a farmers' market just outside Richmond, I spoke to voters, many wearing a badge proclaiming that they had been to the polls. On display were robust carrots, chocolate-coloured peppers, fresh young ginger and chicken fingers - the last for pets to chew on. The views were as varied as the produce, and Ken Cuccinelli divides opinions. ""I don't like him, he's a Tea Party plant and one scary dude,"" a man munching a kebab told me. A woman selling handmade soap said that ""Cuccinelli did stand up to the powers that be, saying he didn't believe in Obamacare, I applaud him for his opinion and standing up"".But this is a state where a quarter of the economy is linked to the federal government and last month's government shutdown was not popular.. One woman told me: ""I didn't vote Republican this time, I wanted to make a point. We have to work together and they just want to block things. I vote both ways but I'm shifting, I have to.""Another said: ""I don't believe in someone who has to tell a woman what she has to do, we are past all that, it is the 21st Century. Sometimes I've been a Republican but they've got all these Tea Party candidates, and the moderates are realising they are not all that great.""But there is a reason hardline Republicans stand firm. Many of their supporters want them to hang tough. One man, selling bread and vegetables, told me: ""I hope he wins, I don't want a Democrat in, the people in power now are extreme lefties, our country was founded on conservatism.""He does think the party needs to alter course, but not in the way most might mean. ""The Republicans need to change - but they've been going left for ages, with McCain and all that. They've left their base behind.""In the offices of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the big question is whether the Republicans will learn lessons from this defeat. Jeff Shapiro's been the newspaper's political commentator for 30 years.""They're going to have to take a very long and hard look at this changing electorate,"" he says. ""This is a state where for a long time the tensions tended to be black and white. Now it is a multi-hued electorate.""He says that is not easy. ""Some Republicans are going to have to make some unpopular and very risky choices, in which they will put their personal ambition on the line in the interests of advancing their party.""Are they prepared to tell the grassroots what they probably don't want to hear?""This is an interesting moment. The Republican party is not fighting about ideology or policy. The vast majority are conservative, pro-life, extremely worried by what they see as a growth of government and high taxation. But there is a big divide about strategy and mood. Many in the Tea Party furiously want to block everything the other side attempts, worried their country is changing beyond repair. Some in the leadership and the business community are concerned about this way of doing politics. But they also are the sort who prize loyalty and are hesitant about provoking civil war.  One of those who is not prepared to stay silent is former congressman Steve Latourette who runs the super-PAC (campaign group) Republican Mainstreet Partnership, which is close to the party's leadership,""You can't just go after angry 57-year-old white men below the Mason-Dixon line and build a national majority, you have to rely on Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, gay Americans, African-Americans, and God forbid women should want to vote for Republicans,"" he says.""That's the tension within the party and the Cuccinelli race will be sort of determinative, at least on our side, and people will say, 'Well I guess the more conservative thing didn't work so good today'. This is just the beginning of a long drawn-out battle.""He's right that that battle will take place eventually but I am not sure there will be much more than sporadic skirmishes for the moment. The leadership hasn't the stomach for it. What happened tonight in New Jersey could be a lesson about how to win in a state that may not look like natural territory, but they may not be ready to put victory above purity. This is a good night for Hillary Clinton - Virginia's new governor is a close ally in a key state that she probably needs to win to become president in 2016. You would think Republicans should start worrying about how they will stop that happening. They probably won't. "

But he was born in Canada. Is that a problem, asks Tom Geoghegan?According to the birth certificate he released to the Dallas Morning News, Cruz was born in Calgary to a father from Cuba and a mother from Delaware, US. He moved to the US aged four and has both US and Canadian citizenship.Article 2, Section 1, Clause 5 of the US Constitution says ""no person except a natural born citizen"" is eligible to be president. But what does this mean?""The truth is that there's no authoritative legal understanding of what it means,"" says Rogers Smith, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. ""But the dominant legal interpretation is that a person acquires citizenship by birth, either by being born on American soil or to an American parent."" This would effectively bar immigrants from the White House, even if they become US citizens, but not people like Cruz with at least one US citizen for a parent. Smith says the writers of the constitution were principally concerned about European aristocrats being able to claim eligibility to the highest office in the US. But he believes the clause should now be removed from the constitution because it is at odds with the American spirit. It's also a more restrictive policy than exists in many other countries, including the UK and France.The natural-born requirement has been put to the test several times. Democrats were quick to point out that Mitt Romney's father, George, was born in Mexico when he ran for the Republican nomination in 1967 - although his eligibility had not been seriously questioned by the time he handed the crown to Richard Nixon the following year. When John McCain did win the nomination, the Senate passed a resolution stating that he was a natural-born citizen, having been born on a US military base in the Panama Canal Zone.There was talk of amending the constitution when Austrian-born Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the peak of his popularity, but it didn't last long.If Cruz does run and win his party's presidential nomination, he probably won't provide the country with its first Canadian candidate. He has announced he will give up his Canadian citizenship - for political rather than legal reasons."

An officer of the party will carry out an investigation to ensure the integrity of the process.""Questions have also been raised about Labour's selection of candidates for the 2014 European elections after Anne Fairweather, a favourite candidate of the Labour right, failed to make the shortlist.Former Labour General Secretary Peter Watt said: ""The feeling is that as she has a pro-business background she was blocked by the trade unions.""Since Labour lost power in 2010 Mr McCluskey and others on the left of the Labour Party have been vying for influence with ""Blairite"" factions on the right, associated with the think tank Progress, which is mostly funded by Lord Sainsbury.Mr McCluskey said: ""Mandelson also appears untroubled that Lord Sainsbury's vast wealth, channelled through the Progress organisation, has been used to give particular candidates, invariably on the right, an advantage in Labour selections.""Unite, which backed Ed Miliband for the Labour leadership in 2010, is currently one of the party's biggest financial backer. Lord Sainsbury has halted donations to the party, reportedly because he views Mr Miliband a ""mediocre"" leader.Speaking at the Progress conference on 11 May, Lord Mandelson said ""too many"" selections for European or Westminster parliament candidates were being put in the hands of ""one union at worst, a couple of unions at best, orchestrated by a cabal of NEC members.""He warned the party that efforts to recruit more working class candidates should not be confused with recruiting trade union officials.His comments echoed those made by former Home Secretary Alan Johnson, who told Progress in February that increasing the number of working class MPs could not be ""left to a small clique in the affiliated unions who want to get the people who mirror their views into parliament"".At the time Mr McCluskey responded: ""The stale prescriptions offered by the likes of Alan Johnson are the road to defeat and working class disappointment.""

The Houphouet-Boigny prize, created in 1989, is intended to honour people that have made a significant contribution to peace and stability.Other winners include former Irish president Mary Robinson, South Africa's former leader Nelson Mandela and the first president of East Timor, Xanana Gusmao. President Hollande was presented with a diploma, a gold medal and a cash prize of $150,000 (£98,000, 115,000 euros), which he will reportedly donate to two relief organisations working in Mali.Joaquim Chissano, president of the deciding jury, said: ""Having assessed the dangers and the repercussions of the situation on Africa and on Mali in particular, as well as on the rest of the world, the jury appreciated the solidarity shown by France to the peoples of Africa.""Mali's President, Dioncounda Traore, thanked Mr Hollande and referred to the ""humiliation"" suffered by people living in the north of of the country before the French troops arrived.Benin President Thomas Boni Yayi meanwhile told the news agency AFP: ""If France had not intervened, where would we be? God alone knows.""France has begun to withdraw some of its 4,000 troops from Mali after driving Islamist groups from the main towns and cities of the north.It plans to gradually hand over to the Malian army and a UN peacekeeping force before presidential and parliamentary elections are held.But tensions remain between the Malian authorities and the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which is fighting mostly for the rights of the minority Tuareg community. There have also been attacks from Islamist militants hiding in the mountains and desert of the north.Mireille Fanon-Mendes-France, president of human rights organisation Fondation Frantz Fanon, told the BBC that the decision to award Mr Hollande the Houphouet-Boigny prize was ""cynical"", pointing to unresolved issues in Mali.The choice of recipient was perceived by some to be both cultural and political, reports the BBC's Catherine Zemmouri in Paris.The prize is named after Felix Houphouet-Boigny, a politician who served in the French government before becoming the first president of the Ivory Coast and playing a leading role in the decolonisation of Africa."

10989	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24751202	News	0	Elections	None	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	bbc.co.uk	"Voters in the US state of Virginia go to the polls on Tuesday for a new governor. So why does it matter to anyone else?Only one in three people voted when Republican Bob McDonnell became Virginia's 71st governor in 2009. That's fewer than two million people.So the contest to become his successor might not seem like a battle of national, even international, importance. But the result of Tuesday's election - between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Ken Cuccinelli - will have implications far beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains and Chesapeake Bay.It's a key swing state, closely contested in presidential elections, but it's a different electorate who make the effort to vote in these kinds of elections. In fact, for 36 years, whichever political party holds the White House has lost the governor's seat a year later. There's a theory that presidential candidates are at an advantage when campaigning in a state with a friendly governor, but it didn't help Mitt Romney win the state in 2012. So why is this election important?1. It could shape Republican identityIn Virginia, the Republicans have put forward a candidate closely allied to the Tea Party, the group that other members of the party have blamed for the recent government shutdown.National Republicans should be really worried if McAuliffe wins, says Craig Brians, professor of political science at Virginia Tech. ""They could be thinking: 'This is perhaps the second time in a month that people associated with the Tea Party have really hurt us and we need to rethink things.' ""At some point, the national Republican party needs to decide: 'Are we going to be a majority party or go to the right, stake out that ground and maybe never hold national office again.'""The emergence of a third-party candidate polling at double-figures, libertarian Robert Sarvis, reflects the fissures within the Republican party, says John Avlon, author of Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe is Hijacking America. Libertarians traditionally vote Republican, he says, but many have been put off by Cuccinelli's extreme social conservatism. 2. There's a Hillary factorBoth Clintons have helped McAuliffe, who was co-chairman of the former president's re-election campaign and chairman of his wife's 2008 presidential campaign.""Terry McAuliffe is a really old friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton so the fact that they would come and help him campaign is not surprising. But they are not super popular in Virginia so the fact he brought them here is interesting, in the sense that Hillary is keeping her hand in, simply by being part of it and keeping her face in it,"" says Brians.With Hillary braced to run in 2016, a McAuliffe win would be interpreted as a boost for her, he adds, because such a divisive figure inflicted no fundamental damage to his campaign.Writing in the National Review, conservative blogger Jim Geraghty goes even further and suggests it's been a dry run for the Hillary campaign machine.3. It's what the US is going to look likeThe demographics in Virginia are changing in the same way as they are across the country - a growing Hispanic and Asian population, and more people in urban areas.""It's a microcosm of what's happening nationally,"" says Dustin Cable of the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, especially in southern cities like Atlanta and Raleigh. The northern Virginia suburbs are a Mecca for young college-educated professionals, he says, many of them federal employees working in Washington DC.These groups have helped Obama win two elections but it's not yet clear how these shifts will play out in elections that historically have older, white voters, says Cable. 4. Effects on ObamacareSupporters and opponents of the highly controversial Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature law that aims to extend health insurance coverage, will be watching Virginia.Cuccinelli has led the battle against Obamacare in the state, says Brians. If he fails, people could infer that voters in Virginia are in favour of Obamacare. The present governor, Republican Bob McDonnell, has said no to expanding Medicaid and no to running a state insurance exchange. McAuliffe has said he will reverse both those if he wins.""That will make a huge difference in one of the biggest issues of the campaign,"" says Brians.5. It's provided comedy fodderWhen Ken Cuccinelli proposed outlawing sodomy and oral sex, he immediately earned national coverage on The View and The Daily Show, as the likes of Whoopi Goldberg and Jon Stewart ripped into him.His opponent, Terry McAuliffe, was not spared either. At a debate, he was asked by the Daily Show if he thought his image had improved from debilitating to moderate revulsion.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

The military has rejected the allegations. Polling for the north's semi-autonomous council came after years of ethnic war. The opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) won 30 seats in the 38-member Northern Provincial Council, which took place four years after the army defeated Tamil Tiger rebels.However, the run-up to the election was marred by allegations of army intimidation that were firmly denied by the authorities.""We learned that opposition candidates and their supporters, as well as voters at large, faced instances of intimidation and harassment,"" the Commonwealth Observer Mission to the elections wrote in its preliminary findings on Tuesday.""The freedom to hold campaign meetings and openly interact with the electorate was restricted,"" the report said, adding that the ""heavy presence and influence of the military"" also compromised the electoral environment.However, it applauded the ""determination and resilience of voters"" who nonetheless turned out to vote, and praised the electoral commission's organisation of the poll as ""impressive"".Meanwhile, the head of a team of South Asian poll monitors, N Gopalaswami, told the BBC that he was ""101% sure that military personnel were involved"" in an attack on the house of a female Tamil opposition candidate a day before the polls.In an email to the BBC, military spokesman Brig Ruwan Wanigasooriya rejected the claims.He said the allegation of military involvement in the attack was made ""by politically inclined people"".""The military was not involved in any of the electoral processes,"" he said. ""The allegation that the military was a 'significant obstacle to a credible electoral process' is baseless.""He added that the 68% voter turnout in the elections showed that the military had not acted as an obstacle to voters."

Awaiting the winner is an international profile and a budget of $70bn (£45bn). So how does the job compare with mayors of other big cities?The new occupant of City Hall on Manhattan's Broadway will have more money to spend than a small country - and a population to match.So perhaps it's no surprise that when the identity of New York's next mayor is revealed in November's election, it will make news around the world.He or she will probably be the most powerful mayor on the planet, says Mitchell Moss, professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, because the job comes with unique executive powers - hiring and firing the people heading the city's key agencies like police and schools, while also setting the budget. ""The California governor doesn't even have that power. And the mayor controls the education of one million children. Education around the world is usually a national responsibility and not a city governor responsibility.""It's power that has come incrementally, ever since the British drove the Dutch out and gave the city control of its waterfront in the 17th Century. A recent addition came in 2002 when the vast schools system was reconfigured and made directly accountable to the mayor.The person heading the largest city in the US has often enjoyed an international profile. Ed Koch - who ushered in the city's boom and put the near-bankruptcy of the 1970s behind it - was often photographed riding the subway or walking the streets. And after 9/11, the no-nonsense figure of Rudy Giuliani came to represent the city and the country at its time of need.But these days, it's a job that doesn't hog the international stage on its own. The ever-quotable London Mayor Boris Johnson appears on primetime US television, and his predecessor Ken Livingstone struck a controversial oil deal in Venezuela with Hugo Chavez. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoe, drew praise for a free bike scheme which has been copied elsewhere. And the Olympic spotlight has now moved from Johnson to Rio's mayor, Eduardo Paes.""Mayors without question are very much consistent with the spirit of the age - visible, figurehead urban leaders who are a much better fit in a world of 24-hour news and the need for celebrity visibility,"" says local government expert Tony Travers of the London School of Economics. Bloomberg's forays into public health - the bans on smoking and trans-fats, and attempts to limit fizzy drink sizes - have inspired mayors the world over to intervene in health without fear of being accused of nannying, he says.In the UK, cities like London, Bristol, Liverpool and Leicester have begun to adopt - with varying levels of public interest, admittedly - the American model of a directly elected mayor, and the same has happened in German and Italian cities. Dublin could be next. But who is the most powerful? The New York mayor spends more money than London's, where much of the power is devolved to the 32 London boroughs (plus the City of London), including schools. But Bloomberg has little say over transport.Mayors who act as state governors are more powerful than Bloomberg but none has his influence, says Tann vom Hove, a senior fellow at the City Mayors Foundation, an international think-tank.""The previous mayor of Mexico City [Marcelo Ebrard] legalised abortion and introduced gay marriage, things the mayor of New York can't do. And the Berlin mayor can block federal legislation."" But there's a difference between the job description and the man, says Vom Hove. Bloomberg has probably been the most influential mayor through his personality and wealth, and it's unlikely the person that follows him will match that.Another candidate for ""most powerful"" city leader is Tokyo's governor, Naoki Inose. He is technically not a mayor, he acts as chief executive of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which is responsible for transport, secondary schools, hospitals, economic development, sewage and disaster management. His budget of £41bn ($63bn) is nearly the same as Bloomberg's but his powers are more far-reaching and he governs twice the number of people.Plus, according to the Japan Local Government Centre in London, only 7% of his revenue comes from central government, the smallest proportion compared to any other world city, including New York which receives 31% of its cash from federal sources.Many mayors operating on much smaller budgets have left their mark on history. Teddy Kollek, who served as Jerusalem mayor for nearly 30 years, was described as the most influential Jewish builder of the city since Herod the Great in Biblical times. And Pasqual Maragall was one of a succession of mayors in Barcelona who transformed the city in the post-dictatorship era. Mayors can be more effective than national politicians because there is less posturing, says Travers. If you govern a city of 10 million people, you have to make sure everything is working and the police are on the streets. They're not highly political acts, they're done by Conservatives, Labour, Republicans, Democrats and Socialists in the same way. Political theorist Benjamin Barber takes this argument a step further in his book, If Mayors Ruled The World, in which he says mayors are far better at addressing global issues than heads of nation states.Countries are dysfunctional in global relations, he argues, because they're walled states with borders strengthened by sovereignty and national culture. ""National political figures adhere to great historical norms and political ideologies but mayors have to fix things - they have to pick up the garbage and fix the sewer. They're problem solvers and that's what makes them pragmatic."" Cities already co-operate across borders, he says, either one on one or through global networks like the C40 network to tackle climate change.And now that a majority of the world's population is found in urban areas, perhaps this will be the century of the city - and the mayor.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

He retired from Congress in 2000, but was recruited to run for his former seat in 2002. In February, Lautenberg announced he would not seek a sixth term in 2014.During his time in the Senate, he was a defender of Amtrak, which operated a regional train service through his home state, as well as Superfund, a programme that paid for the cleanup of environmentally hazardous sites.Lautenberg was also an agitator against tobacco companies and the gun industry, writing several pieces of firearms legislation, some of which passed.""Until the very end of his life, Frank made the trip from New Jersey to DC to fight for the issues he believed in and the people he represented,"" Patty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington, said in a statement. ""He gave everything he had to public service.""New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to name a fellow Republican to replace Lautenberg until a new senator is elected by the state's voters. Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, had already raised $2m (£1.3m) to run for the seat in 2014. A special election may be called earlier than next November.Lautenberg, who was the son of Polish and Russian Jewish immigrants, had served in World War II with the Army Signal Corps.With the help of the GI bill, he received an undergraduate degree in economics from Columbia University.Lautenberg is survived by his wife Bonnie, and four children from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1988."

He asks the editor: ""What's the script saying?""""Our shared future.""The shots roll on through tired, huddled masses to the Statue of Liberty, former President Ronald Reagan, the Stars and Stripes.They are cutting a commercial in San Antonio, Texas, which should be on TV screens by the end of the week.Financed by a loose grouping of Republicans, this campaign is designed to convince conservatives that the time has come to get serious about immigration reform.Some Republicans think time is running out - they have one last chance to woo Hispanic voters.If they miss this opportunity they may never win over a group who may hold the key to winning future elections.Lionel Sosa is an ad man, a Republican and a Latino, who was involved in the presidential campaigns for Ronald Reagan and both George HW and George W Bush.He says that what happened last year must not be repeated.""Republicans did horribly with Latinos in the last election, as bad as we have ever done, and there are reasons for it. Latinos saw Republicans as rich, Anglo, isolated and judgmental."" He says if a candidate is seen as anti-immigrant it matters to Latinos who are American citizens, who then perceive him as unfriendly and intolerant. Latino support was certainly pretty important to President Barack Obama, and the Democrats are determined to keep it. The president is announcing his plans for immigration reform in the state of Nevada later on Tuesday.A bipartisan group of senators has just nipped in ahead of him with their own ideas.The crux of the issue is what to do about the 11 million or so illegal immigrants in the US, many of whom are from Mexico. In the last election many Republicans scoffed at the idea of giving them amnesty, saying that would reward criminal behaviour.The senators' proposals would toughen border controls and then offer illegal immigrants a path to a green card, after paying a fine and back taxes.Mr Sosa says something like this is vital.""This is a very divisive issue, a very difficult issue, but we Republicans know this - we do not want it on the table in 2016 so we better solve it in a year or so.""Of course, there are a lot of Republicans who are not going to like the new bill, but we don't want to be viewed as intolerant and we don't want to  be viewed as nasty. ""We want to be viewed as people who welcome people, who open the doors and say: 'You are part of what makes this country great'.""President Obama knows this is an issue that could split Republicans - and they may be unwilling to agree to any package with his name on it, but it is one area where it is just possible Congress may, eventually, act."

He told ABC: ""If I'm bothered by jokes about my weight, it's time for me to curl up into the foetal position and go home, OK?""""So let's get the fat jokes out of the way first. Christie is a big figure, a heavy hitter and a weighty presence,"" his campaign manager and friend of 20 years Bill Palatucci tells me.""It certainly doesn't bother anyone in New Jersey, we all have our struggles. He's got a bit of a weight problem, but it doesn't hold him down whatsoever.""What is important is the big guy's next trick, which requires all the poise of a tightrope walker, balancing on the taut wire stretching between popular appeal and conservative distaste. Make no mistake - he could be, puns aside, a huge player. He could be the Republicans' best stab at the White House in 2016, potentially transforming his party in the process. He has, as far as I can see, a unique appeal in American politics, reaching parts that Hillary Clinton can't. Rush Limbaugh, the hyper-conservative, Tea Party-adored doyen of right-wing talk show hosts, says it tells you all you need to know that Democrats love Christie, that he is a creation of the liberal media. He has a point, although not the one he thinks he is making.Christie's importance is precisely because a third of self-identified Democrats who voted in New Jersey vote for him. It is because liberals in the Washington media establishment can vaguely imagine holding their ideological noses and voting for him.Hurricane Sandy defined Chris Christie - he toured his smashed-up state, throwing his big arms around the newly homeless. He also gripped the hand of President Obama, praising him for helping the rescue operation with government money - this, just days before last year's election. It disgusted some conservatives. He looked like a man more concerned about helping people than remaining pure to a cause.He talks of getting the job done and working together at a time Washington can do neither, mainly because of the shenanigans of his own party. But a lot of Americans like this sort of talk - you might even remember the senator who said there was not a liberal America, or a conservative America but the United States of America. It can be the key to the White House. There are two main ways to win elections (they are not mutually exclusive). One, you can motivate and organise and drag out all the people who, in theory, like your party and should be voting for you. This is what Obama did in 2008 and 2012.Second, you can hoover up the swing voters, the people in the centre and some of those who often vote for the other party. It is a typical mistake of both politicians and journalists to talk in shorthand implying everyone is born with a party label around their necks.It is not true. Even in the extraordinarily partisan world of US politics there are plenty of people who change from one election to another or split the ticket, voting say one way for the Senate, the other for the president. Here's the thing - although the Democrat nomination is Hillary Clinton's for the taking, she can't necessarily pull off this trick. Many Republicans heartily dislike the Clintons, and her appeal to the centre is uncertain. New Jersey exit polls indicated voters preferred Hillary Clinton by 49% to Christie's 43%. That's not bad in a long-time Democrat state.But to get a shot at the general election, Christie has to win his own party's nomination first. That will be really hard - in 2012, the Republican candidates tried to outdo each other by appealing to the right, and as a result Mitt Romney found himself trapped inside an ideological bubble of his own design, unable to appeal to his natural constituency of business-minded moderates. Christie may be pugnacious on low taxation and the unions, but he has already evoked conservatives' ire. He will have trouble convincing them he's the real deal. On the Sunday shows, he tried a combination of ""Let's work together"" and ""I'm just the governor of New Jersey"", but I'd expect him now to trim to the right to an extent.I asked his old friend Bill Palatucci what he made of the Tea Party criticisms. He said: ""There are lots of elements of the Tea Party. The governor has great, great support in New Jersey for cutting taxes and making government smaller. Our spending in New Jersey in 2014 is less than in 2008. ""I think the Tea Party is about freedom and smaller government and the governor is about the same things."" So he can appeal to conservatives? I ask.""Absolutely. The governor is very much a conservative, very much pro-life, against gay marriage, worked very hard to get Mitt Romney elected. ""His accomplishments on fiscal issues when the state was on the brink of bankruptcy, turning that around - that's a record many conservatives like.""But Christie has ducked and weaved along the centre line. He's long been anti-abortion, but hasn't made a big deal of it; he's opposed gay marriage but recently ordered New Jersey courts to drop an appeal against it; and he's banned conversion therapy for gay kids in New Jersey. So I ask - will he stand for president? Bill Palatucci laughs long and hard. ""We'll wait and see,"" he says. ""He's just got re-elected so it's important to get to the job of the second term, a good second term.""That indeed may be critical - New Jersey's economy is not in a great way. But for the next three years, Christie will be on the tightrope - how he sways and if he falls will be vitally important for his party and the country. "

But conventional wisdom says the Republican caucus would swiftly dethrone Mr Boehner. And, interestingly, conventional wisdom and punditry, in Washington at least, don't blame Mr Boehner one bit for holding the government hostage to his career aspirations. Thus is the cynicism of this town today.Why he is so attached to sticking with such a bruising job is another question. His caucus is balkanised and unruly. This Congress is held in the lowest public esteem since the invention of public opinion polls. And the Republicans are more disliked than the Democrats.  Once seen as a skilled dealmaker, Mr Boehner isn't able to make deals. Never seen as an ideologue, he has now relinquished control of the Republican policy agenda to the party's most ideological faction. Where's the fun? To put the question another way: Why can't the leader of the party in Congress control the party on the most important issues and votes?The answers apply equally to Democrats and Republicans. A series of self-inflicted errors by the two political parties over the past 40 years have left party leaders with no whip and little power.After Vietnam and Watergate, there was a reform spirit that wanted to open and democratise the process of selecting party candidates for office, as well as get special-interest money out of politics.The first part worked too well. Party candidates all came to be picked through open primary elections. In the process, the parties lost the ability to select loyal candidates in smoke-filled back rooms - they lost a source of power and persuasion.The campaign finance reforms, however, backfired entirely. The post-Richard Nixon idea was to stop party bosses from doling out money from local moguls, unions and corporations. Instead, the reforms deformed and opened the spigots for money to flow directly to candidates from all the old sources, bypassing the party machines. The quantities of money have grown to gargantuan proportions.By the 1980s, politicians were essentially free agents. They didn't need the parties to get nominated or to fund campaigns. Pollsters, advertising wizards and fundraisers replaced the party bosses. And the party leaders in Congress lost their leverage.At the same time, computers and marketing data gave political professionals new precision in drawing the map of congressional districts. Individual districts have become much more homogenous - overwhelmingly Democratic or Republican. It has never been easy to unseat an incumbent. But now, once candidates of the dominant party in these gerrymandered districts get the nomination, they are home free.So members of the Congress, especially in the House, mostly have safe seats and are immune from challenges by the other party. Their bigger challenges come from within their own parties and that tends to drive them further right or left. Voting patterns are as partisan now as at any time since after the Civil War.All that means the House is filled with increasingly ideological members who aren't especially worried about re-election and are impervious to the party whip and discipline. It is legislative chaos. John Boehner carries an extra burden as a Republican. From 1949 to 1995, the Democrats controlled the House except for two years in the 1950s. That is a long time to be in the political wilderness, with the Republicans effectively shut out of governing and legislative power. They developed a sort of frustrated minority party mentality, locked out of power and able only to toss bombs, make mischief and obstruct.Since the 1920s, Republicans have controlled the White House, Senate and House of Representatives at the same time only during parts of George W Bush's two terms. So modern House Republicans have had virtually no experience actually sharing the responsibility of governing. Their minority mentality lingers. And it shows.Republicans were led back to power in the House in 1995 by one of the most mischievous, incendiary party leaders ever, Newt Gingrich. He led the way to a government shutdown that year that was considered disastrous to Republicans.  But the Gingrich confrontation now seems far more rational than the Boehner shutdown. First off, back then Republicans also controlled the Senate and so had more leverage with the Democratic White House.And Mr Gingrich's Republicans were pushing for a broad set of coherent conservative changes to the budget. There were realistic grounds for negotiation. Mr Boehner's Republicans are pushing to repeal a sitting president's hallmark achievement a year after he was re-elected. There is no room for negotiation and no chance of success. It is purely a stunt, an act of guerrilla theatre.Mr Boehner was part of the House Republican leadership under Mr Gingrich. He was ousted in 1998, survived and was resurrected as party leader years later. One might have thought he had learned some strategic lessons from all that.It would have been great sport to watch if Mr Boehner had decided to gamble this time and take on so-called ""wacko bird"" conservatives. If he put together a coalition of more mainstream Republicans and Democrats, there would have been a classic intra-party feud, but there would not have been a shutdown.  It isn't written in stone that Mr Boehner would have lost his speakership after that battle. Perhaps a victory could have shifted the paralytic partisanship in the House today.  Ironically, chances are high Mr Boehner will have to cave eventually and team up with Democrats to avoid an economically irresponsible - and politically lethal - default on government debt obligations.  That will probably save his job, but it certainly won't make his job any more fun."

On the federal form, applicants are asked to state under oath that they are US citizens, on penalty of perjury.But Arizona argued such assurances were not enough in their state, which borders Mexico. The state's 2004 law added a requirement that applicants provide a US birth certificate, passport or other proof of citizenship.Justice Scalia said the federal law ""precludes Arizona from requiring a federal form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself"".Immigrant rights groups, who said the law put an undue burden on naturalised citizens, hailed the decision.The ruling ""sends a strong message that states cannot block their citizens from registering to vote by superimposing burdensome paperwork requirements on top of federal law,"" said Nina Perales of the Mexican American Legal Defence and Education Fund.Part of the concern was that while the regular form can be mailed in, federal law prohibits copying naturalisation documents for proof of citizenship, forcing those citizens to apply in person.Two of the court's more conservative members, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented.The US constitution ""authorises states to determine the qualifications of voters in federal elections"", Justice Thomas wrote in his dissent.Kathy McKee, who led the push to have the requirement enacted into law, said the ruling would make it harder to combat voter fraud.""To even suggest that the honour system works, really?"" Ms McKee said. ""You have to prove who you are just to use your charge card now."""

He asks the editor: ""What's the script saying?""""Our shared future.""The shots roll on through tired, huddled masses to the Statue of Liberty, former President Ronald Reagan, the Stars and Stripes.They are cutting a commercial in San Antonio, Texas, which should be on TV screens by the end of the week.Financed by a loose grouping of Republicans, this campaign is designed to convince conservatives that the time has come to get serious about immigration reform.Some Republicans think time is running out - they have one last chance to woo Hispanic voters.If they miss this opportunity they may never win over a group who may hold the key to winning future elections.Lionel Sosa is an ad man, a Republican and a Latino, who was involved in the presidential campaigns for Ronald Reagan and both George HW and George W Bush.He says that what happened last year must not be repeated.""Republicans did horribly with Latinos in the last election, as bad as we have ever done, and there are reasons for it. Latinos saw Republicans as rich, Anglo, isolated and judgmental."" He says if a candidate is seen as anti-immigrant it matters to Latinos who are American citizens, who then perceive him as unfriendly and intolerant. Latino support was certainly pretty important to President Barack Obama, and the Democrats are determined to keep it. The president is announcing his plans for immigration reform in the state of Nevada later on Tuesday.A bipartisan group of senators has just nipped in ahead of him with their own ideas.The crux of the issue is what to do about the 11 million or so illegal immigrants in the US, many of whom are from Mexico. In the last election many Republicans scoffed at the idea of giving them amnesty, saying that would reward criminal behaviour.The senators' proposals would toughen border controls and then offer illegal immigrants a path to a green card, after paying a fine and back taxes.Mr Sosa says something like this is vital.""This is a very divisive issue, a very difficult issue, but we Republicans know this - we do not want it on the table in 2016 so we better solve it in a year or so.""Of course, there are a lot of Republicans who are not going to like the new bill, but we don't want to be viewed as intolerant and we don't want to  be viewed as nasty. ""We want to be viewed as people who welcome people, who open the doors and say: 'You are part of what makes this country great'.""President Obama knows this is an issue that could split Republicans - and they may be unwilling to agree to any package with his name on it, but it is one area where it is just possible Congress may, eventually, act."

A group of Conservative backbenchers have been campaigning for him to firm up this commitment by legislating in the current Parliament for a referendum. In their amendment, the MPs state that they ""respectfully regret that an EU referendum bill was not included"" in last week's the Queen's Speech, which lays out the government's legislative plans for the year ahead.The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has yet to decide whether to select the amendment for debate.But if the debate and vote go ahead on Wednesday, ministers will be ""guided"" to abstain, a senior source told the BBC.Other MPs, including ministers' parliamentary aides, will be free to vote with their consciences. One of them - Gavin Barwell, parliamentary private secretary to Education Secretary Michael Gove - has already said that he intends to support the amendment. The amendment has been signed by nearly 30 Tory backbenchers, including former Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan and former leadership contender David Davis, as well as two Labour MPs, and it is thought about 100 backbench MPs could back it in a vote.But the amendment would stand little chance of being passed because Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs would vote against it - as would many Conservatives. Conservative unrest over Europe has gained fresh momentum following the recent election success of the UK Independence Party and comments by Tory grandees such as Lord Lawson suggesting EU withdrawal.Mr Cameron has promised a referendum if the Tories win the next general election, due in 2015. The prime minister has said a pledge to hold an in/out vote by 2017, once he has negotiated the return of some powers from Brussels, will be in the next Conservative manifesto.Mr Cameron will not vote himself on the amendment as he will be out of the country on a trip to the US. He has told the rebels he cannot introduce a bill paving the way for this because of opposition from his Liberal Democrat coalition partners.Speaking to the Labour group Progress on Saturday, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister was ""hiding behind the sofa"", too scared to confront his party.Mr Miliband said: ""It is wrong now to commit to an in/out referendum and have four years of uncertainty and a 'closed for business' sign above our country.""Labour aides stressed that Mr Miliband was opposing the decision to signal a referendum now but not ruling out the possibility of a referendum in the future. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: ""David Cameron will give the British people their say on our future in Europe in an in-out referendum in the next parliament.""But Ed Miliband has once again made clear he will never trust the British people to have their say - he opposes a referendum. He is too weak to stand up for the British people at home and too weak to stand up for our country's interests abroad.""But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg criticised his coalition partners about their ""endless navel-gazing over Europe,"" which he said was in danger of distracting the government from its priorities.In his weekly email to Lib Dem members, he said: ""Our job is to anchor the government in the centre ground, stopping others from lurching this way and that, and making sure the government delivers our core objectives: a stronger economy in a fairer society.""

In a similar challenge four years ago, Chief Justice Roberts said the law's past success ""is not adequate justification to retain the preclearance requirements"".But the justices sidestepped the question of its constitutionality at the time. The provision covers Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, as well as certain places in California, Florida, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire, North Carolina and South Dakota."

11690	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24347663	Opinion	0	Elections	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Labour Party leader Ed Miliband is locked in a row with the Daily Mail over his father's views. But to what extent do our mothers and fathers shape our political opinions? Many people's first exposure to political debate wasn't watching Question Time or reading newspaper reports about the House of Commons or the US Congress.It was at the dinner table or in the family front room, with a parent cursing conservatives or muttering darkly about socialists.  Labour leader Ed Miliband's upbringing fitted this pattern better than most. His father Ralph was a left-wing academic, his mother Marion a campaigner for progressive causes.Now this family history has become the focus of a bitter media spat. On Saturday, the Daily Mail ran a profile of Ralph Miliband under the headline: ""The man who hated Britain"". After offering his son the right of reply, the paper repeated the original article and ran a leader describing the deceased lecturer's legacy as ""evil"".For its part, the paper justified the attack by arguing that Ralph Miliband's political views had been passed down the generations.""We do not maintain, like the jealous God of Deuteronomy, that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons,"" its leader says. ""But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father's teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different.""The Labour leader has reacted furiously.He insisted his politics were markedly different from those of his Marxist father: ""I have pursued a different path and I have a different vision."" He also said he was ""appalled"" by the Mail's ""character assassination"" of a man who had served in the Royal Navy during World War II after escaping Nazi persecution. The dispute raises the question of the extent to which people's politics are shaped by the influence of their families.Many of those who have backed Miliband in the row have followed the Mail's logic by pointing out that the first Viscount Rothermere, great-grandfather of its present owner, met Hitler and wrote an article titled Hurrah For The Blackshirts in 1934 which praised Oswald Mosley's fascists. There are plenty of political dynasties, even in countries that have long shaken off the shackles of aristocracy - the Bush family, for instance, who have accounted for two of the last four US presidents, or the Gandhis in India. In the UK, the Cecil family have been involved in Conservative parliamentary politics for more than two centuries, while four generations of Benns have sat for Labour or the Liberals in the House of Commons. But there is no shortage of examples of politicians who have rejected the views of their forefathers. Famously, the father of former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo was a left-wing Spanish Republican who escaped his homeland during the civil war. Labour Prime Ministers Clement Attlee and Tony Blair both grew up in Tory households (Attlee's grandson, Earl Attlee, now takes the Conservative whip in the House of Lords).If nothing else, the process of youthful rebellion requires adopting contrary views - teenagers in the Tory shires long having irritated their mums and dads by joining the Socialist Workers Party or announcing their sympathy for the anarchist cause.It's a process the comedian Alexei Sayle understands well. He grew up in a Communist Party household in Liverpool where the only way to appear more radical than his parents was to declare himself a Maoist.Over time, however, Sayle, while retaining left-wing principles, lost his illusions about the brutality of the regimes his family supported. As a result, he feels ambivalent about the environment in which he acquired his values and moral code.""My parents had a genuine hatred of injustice - they were really decent people. On the other hand, that wish for a better world led them to turn a blind eye to the two greatest mass murderers of the 20th Century, namely Stalin and Mao,"" he says.""But I'll always value the fact that they taught me to look sceptically at the news, to question society and people's motives.""It's not just among the left that parents can be crucial in shaping opinions. Margaret Thatcher often spoke of the formative influence of her father, a grocer and Methodist lay preacher, who instilled her faith in the virtues of hard work and thrift.  Of course, plenty of children of politicians and the politically engaged grow up to have no interest whatsoever in parties and ideologies.Others say they became active despite, not because, of their parents' interests.Rachel Johnson belongs to one of the most notable political families in the UK - her father Stanley was a Conservative MEP while her brothers Boris and Jo serve as Mayor of London and head of the Number 10 Policy Unit respectively.But she insists that politics was rarely discussed while she grew up, not least because her parents' affiliations were split - her mother Charlotte was a Labour voter. ""We didn't have a politicised household,"" Johnson, herself a Conservative party member until recently, says. ""The only thing I remember was canvassing for my father for the European Parliament. But we did that not because he was a Tory but because he was my father.""Arguably the political success of the Miliband family is proof that politics aren't simply handed down from father to son.It's difficult to reconcile the Marxist dialectics of Ralph with the views of his Blairite son David, who served as foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010 and was defeated by his brother for Labour's leadership.Though Ed has often spoken warmly of ""the values I grew up with"", he rose to the top of the party in defiance of his father's long-standing belief that Labour could never achieve socialist transformation. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey once joked that Ralph Miliband ""spent his life trying to convince our movement that there was no possibility of a parliamentary road to socialism, while his sons have been loyally putting theory into practice, and proving Ralph right"".Still, when children depart from their parents' political paths delicate situations can arise.In 1994, Sir Nicholas Scott, the Conservative disability minister, left office after coming under severe criticism after the government scuppered a bill that would have banned discrimination against disabled people. One of his sternest critics was his daughter Victoria, a Labour party member who at the time worked for a disability pressure group. Memorably, on one occasion she took to the Today programme to sternly criticise him.Now Victoria says the affair did create tensions, even in a family where she had been encouraged to think independently (Sir Nicholas later told interviewers he was proud she had stood up for herself). ""My dad loved arguments and had a good sense of humour - he'd rather I was left-wing and had different political opinions than that I was totally uninterested,"" she says.""But we weren't prepared for the emotional and personal fallout, which was quite phenomenal. People in my family really felt I had betrayed my father, even if he didn't feel that himself.""Her experience may be far from uncommon, according to Elias Dinas, lecturer in politics at the University of Nottingham, who has researched the impact of parental influence on opinion-forming.""There's a volume of literature that says the more politicised your parents are, the more likely you are to become a politically engaged adult - but you're also more likely to abandon your parents' views,"" he adds.

""This is only possible if Virginia is the model for bipartisan co-operation.""During the campaign, Mr McAuliffe had emphasised his opponent's tea party support. The hardline wing of the Republican party was widely blamed for last month's government shutdown, which temporarily laid off many of the federal workers who populate Virginia's suburbs.Mr Cuccinelli, the state's outgoing attorney general, had stressed his Democratic rival's championing of the Obama healthcare law, whose troubled rollout has been a White House public relations disaster.A Libertarian candidate who won nearly 7% of Virginia's vote may have cost the Republican the race, say analysts. Mr Cuccinelli was also vastly outspent by his Democratic opponent. Mr McAuliffe is a veteran Democratic party fundraiser who was chairman of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.His capture of the governor's mansion in a crucial presidential swing-voting state could help plot a road map to victory for her should she run again for the White House, say analysts.Meanwhile, Mr de Blasio will succeed New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to become the first Democratic mayor of America's largest city since 1993.He secured a whopping 73% of the vote, compared with 24% for his Republican rival, Joe Lhota.In his victory speech, Mr de Blasio said the result showed that America's largest city had chosen ""a progressive path"", and he promised to make fighting income inequality his top priority.

At the White House on Thursday, Mr Obama conceded that neither party had been blameless in filibusters.But he said it was unacceptable that nearly 30 of his nominees had been blocked from confirmation since he took office.The US leader called it an ""unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress"" to block qualified candidates.""A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the results of an election, is not normal,"" he said.Under the rule change, the party in control of the upper chamber of the US Congress now requires just 51 votes, instead of 60, to overcome a filibuster of White House judicial or executive nominations.Democrats currently have 55 seats in the Senate; Republicans 45.The motion does not affect Supreme Court nominations or regular legislation.It is viewed as the most significant rule change since 1975, when the requirement to end any filibuster on the Senate floor was decreased from two-thirds of all senators to the current 60.""This is a power grab,"" argued Senator Lamar Alexander. ""It's another raw exercise of political power to permit the majority to do anything it wants whenever it wants to do it.""Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his fellow Democrats - who control the chamber for now - had repeatedly warned they might ram through the motion.In July, Democrats set aside a threat to do so only after Republicans dropped their long-standing objections to several White House nominees.Earlier this week, Senate Republicans filibustered the nomination of a judge to a key appeals court, the third such move since October. Democrats could not muster enough votes to overcome the manoeuvre.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Democrats had themselves used the filibuster during the two terms of President George W Bush.Democrats used the filibuster tactic 38 times during Mr Bush's two terms, while Republicans used it 54 times in Mr Obama's first term, according to a June report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.""You may regret this a lot sooner than you think,"" Mr McConnell, the Senate's top Republican, said on the chamber floor.Republican Senator Chuck Grassley told the Washington Post earlier that if the motion passed, his party would retaliate if it regained control of the chamber.He said they would change the rules again to block any Democratic filibusters of Republican Supreme Court nominees."

Mr Davies told the BBC last year that he had not been mayor very long before he ""realised that being an English Democrat was a total irrelevance"" and the job was ""about doing what's best for everybody in the town"".Speaking on Tuesday, he said ""all seemed to be well until about 18 months ago when it became clear more members of the BNP were being hoovered up by the party leadership"" and, he claimed, one new member was still working for the BNP.""It seemed odd to say the least and, to me personally, unacceptable,"" he said. ""I realised things were heading in a direction I didn't want them to go in.""Mr Tilbrook claimed that it was not certain that the English Democrats would have selected Mr Davies to stand again as he had not followed party policy during his term of office in promoting its main aim to create an English Parliament. He strongly denied that his party had been infiltrated by far-right elements and pointed out that any new member has to sign a pledge confirming their opposition to racism. Mr Davies campaigned on behalf of the UK Independence Party in the 1990s before joining the English Democrats in 2005. The English Democrats, whose only electoral success has been in Doncaster's mayoral elections, say they will choose another candidate at a selection meeting later this month. The party secured 0.2% of the total vote in the 2010 general election. Residents of Doncaster voted to keep the mayoral post in a referendum last year, having originally approved it in another public vote in 2001. The British National Party lost all six of the seats it was defending in last year's English local elections and one of its two MEPs, Andrew Brons, has said he has been ""expelled in all but name"" from the party.

But he was born in Canada. Is that a problem, asks Tom Geoghegan?According to the birth certificate he released to the Dallas Morning News, Cruz was born in Calgary to a father from Cuba and a mother from Delaware, US. He moved to the US aged four and has both US and Canadian citizenship.Article 2, Section 1, Clause 5 of the US Constitution says ""no person except a natural born citizen"" is eligible to be president. But what does this mean?""The truth is that there's no authoritative legal understanding of what it means,"" says Rogers Smith, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. ""But the dominant legal interpretation is that a person acquires citizenship by birth, either by being born on American soil or to an American parent."" This would effectively bar immigrants from the White House, even if they become US citizens, but not people like Cruz with at least one US citizen for a parent. Smith says the writers of the constitution were principally concerned about European aristocrats being able to claim eligibility to the highest office in the US. But he believes the clause should now be removed from the constitution because it is at odds with the American spirit. It's also a more restrictive policy than exists in many other countries, including the UK and France.The natural-born requirement has been put to the test several times. Democrats were quick to point out that Mitt Romney's father, George, was born in Mexico when he ran for the Republican nomination in 1967 - although his eligibility had not been seriously questioned by the time he handed the crown to Richard Nixon the following year. When John McCain did win the nomination, the Senate passed a resolution stating that he was a natural-born citizen, having been born on a US military base in the Panama Canal Zone.There was talk of amending the constitution when Austrian-born Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the peak of his popularity, but it didn't last long.If Cruz does run and win his party's presidential nomination, he probably won't provide the country with its first Canadian candidate. He has announced he will give up his Canadian citizenship - for political rather than legal reasons."

America, on the other hand, is still mired in a months-long process that only brings the country down.Republicans are gathered near Washington for the 40th annual running of the bulls known as the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).  This year, CPAC marks the unofficial beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign. Sadly.American campaigns have evolved, or devolved, into ultra-marathons far longer than in any other democracy in the world.  Few Americans would disagree with the propositions that elections are too expensive, that they impede sensible governance, that they devour the time and energy of officials on the taxpayers' payroll and that they have become more obnoxious. Measured by polling, trust and confidence in politicians, government institutions and the news media have declined steadily since the 1970s when campaigns began their relentless growth. Reformers have tried to repair the election process with equal relentlessness. Since Watergate, efforts to curb the costs of campaigns have been tried and failed. Indeed, the flow of money in and out of campaign and special-interest war chests is less transparent than ever. Projects to make debates more enlightening, ads more honest, journalism more highbrow and politics more civil have been tried and tried. Yet the simplest fix of all, shortening the campaign season, has never been put on the table. Long elections are an anomaly in US history and internationally. Most democracies seem to have learned that campaigns bring out the worst in politicians so best to keep them short. In parliamentary systems, campaigns generally take four to six weeks. The last campaigns in the France and the UK took one month. Israel's last election began on 9 October, 2012 and the voting was held on 22 January. Canada's longest campaign ever lasted 74 days.It took the Catholic Church and its 1.2 billion followers just a month to elect a new pope. The official American presidential campaign season lasts 10 months, from the New Hampshire primary in early January to the voting on the first Tuesday in November.But the overt, semi-official campaign is now between 23-24 months. The new custom is for candidates to officially declare themselves in the months after the congressional mid-term elections, two years before the next presidential vote.And the unofficial campaign? Well, the 2016 cycle has started.  A few weeks after the inaugural tents were cleared from the Capitol, Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, published a new book and appeared on every major political news show. Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio gave ""big"" speeches at CPAC that were slathered in news coverage and punditry.  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the potential candidate the press corps seems to like most for now, wasn't invited to CPAC and that, of course, is an enormous story. The ills of the Permanent Campaign are obvious.  There is a legitimate argument about whether the cost of campaigns is as malevolent as the press assumes. The last presidential race cost something north of $5bn (£3.3bn) by most estimates.  Some see the ads, emails and tweets this money funds as important expressions of free speech, signs of an engaged and argumentative democracy. They might add that $5bn is peanuts compared with the money spent advertising snack food, soda pop, beer or cars. What is not debatable is that campaigning is now a big business.  The $5bn spent this cycle doesn't include state and local elections, referenda and mid-term races. There is a campaign industry, and it has become a vested interest, an industry that wants to grow, not shrink - an industry that doesn't just influence officeholders, it creates them.My experience is that about nine in 10 members of Congress hate the long campaigns - the perpetual fundraising, the distraction, the triviality, the nasty ads, the indignities.  But there is a professional class of political consultants who love expensive campaigns.Television stations love campaigns that buy and buy ad time. Reporters love campaigns because they are easier to cover than government, which can be boring and technical. Perhaps these are some of the reasons why the rather obvious idea of trying to shorten the campaigns we all complain about isn't on the menu of good government reforms. Legally, it wouldn't be hard to adjust the duration of election races, but the nuts and bolts are tough.Campaigns are longer because the primary elections where parties choose their candidates come earlier and earlier in election years. Moving primary elections closer to general elections would solve the problem. The dates of primaries are chosen by state legislatures but are heavily influenced by what the national party organisations want.If both parties got together to lobby states to shorten the electoral calendar, it would happen. The two parties, for example, co-operate to organise the presidential debates. Congress could have a role. The uniform general election day - the first Tuesday of November - was established by Congress, not the Constitution.  I imagine there are constitutional challenges to Congress making rules about primary dates, but it is an interesting question.Short of that, the US will need some kind of College of Cardinals to resurrect the older and better way of holding elections. It shouldn't take so long to declare,Habemus Presidentum."

Activists banged drums, held banners and chanted anti-fracking messages. Police guarded the secured site and a helicopter hovered overhead.Campaigners chanted: ""This is what democracy looks like,"" and also shouted: ""There are many, many more of us than you.""After the protesters began to disperse from the Cuadrilla site on Sunday evening, Sussex Police thanked them for their conduct.Supt Lawrence Hobbs said there had been a ""carnival atmosphere"" among the demonstrators during the afternoon.""They have shown that upwards of a thousand people can make their point passionately, but peacefully, and I sincerely hope that it has set the tone for the next few days,"" he said.He said three people had been arrested over the weekend in ""isolated incidents"" that were ""away from the day's events"". Two men were arrested in relation to public order offences allegedly committed last week. One, a 23-year-old, was charged, while the other was bailed until next month. A woman was also arrested, on suspicion of trespassing on the railway at Balcombe station.Speaking about its plans for Monday, the No Dash for Gas group said more than 800 people were forming ""civil disobedience plans"", details of which remained ""top secret"".A spokeswoman said protesters had filled out ""matchmaking"" forms to put people into groups. Campaigners used the forms to indicate to what extent they were willing to risk arrest, how mobile they were, and what activities they were most interested in.Listed activities included climbing things, standing one's ground, getting through or over fences, looking after people, providing entertainment, or documenting action, she said.BBC reporter Roz Upton said: ""Protesters at the camp have been doing tripod training. ""They have got tripods made out of three pieces of metal that allow them to get to a height, and they climb to the top of that.""The campaigners fear the oil drilling could lead to fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - a technique designed to recover gas and oil from shale rock.There are concerns the process contaminates groundwater and causes earth tremors, but supporters say fracking is safe if done properly.Cuadrilla is drilling a 3,000ft (900m) vertical well and a 2,500ft (750m) horizontal bore, at a site south of Balcombe. The firm said fracking for shale gas there would require fresh permission.Camp organisers said about 600 people were at the site on Sunday afternoon, and the camp kitchen had fed about 800 people on Saturday night.Last week, Balcombe Parish Council issued an open letter warning campaigners not to carry out illegal activity. The council said direct action was likely to include an attempt to enter the site.Cuadrilla suspended drilling on Friday but said work would resume at the site as soon as it was safe.On Friday, The BBC's John Moylan said the company had made the well safe, secured the site with a reinforced fence and gone into ""lockdown mode"".Sussex Police has endorsed the energy firm's decision to stop drilling.The force said: ""Given the health and safety risks associated with it being an industrial site if access is gained by trespassers, we believe their decision to be a wise one.""Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said: ""I think the threat is to access the site and to potentially damage equipment on the site.""He said the firm had concerns for the safety of its workers and anyone who went on the site.""We strongly request people not to do that because it's not safe to do it."""

New coal-powered plans would be limited to 1,100lb.Currently, the average coal plant emits about 1,800lb of carbon dioxide per hour.The proposal would eventually affect existing power plants, which account for around a third of all US greenhouse gas emissions.To meet the standard, coal plants would need to install new carbon capture technology, which the industry has said is currently too expensive.'Limitless dumping'Mr Obama has previously said he wants to end what he has called ""the limitless dumping of carbon pollution"" from US power plants.In his second inaugural address in January, he promised a renewed focus on climate change - a signature of his first election campaign that was essentially ignored during his first term as president in favour of healthcare reform.""We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,"" said Mr Obama in his January speech.He said that while ""some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science... none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms"".Although the plan unveiled on Friday has been in the works since April 2012, it faces steep opposition from both industry groups and congressional Republicans, who say efforts to force plants to install expensive carbon cleaning technology could hurt job creation.Currently, coal-powered plants account for around 40% of US electricity consumption, a share which has been shrinking recently.The plan will be subject to a 60-day comment period, and officials hope to implement it by the fall of 2014."

But on Tuesday, he takes a short break to dive into an issue in which he has long been interested - climate change.Mr Kerry arrived in Stockholm and headed to Kiruna, Sweden's northernmost city, in the province of Lapland, for a meeting of the Arctic Council. The council, founded in 1996, brings together eight nations with land above the Arctic Circle - Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the US.Mr Kerry, who held one of the first US Senate hearings on climate change as early as 1988 with then-Senator Al Gore, is hoping to put the spotlight on the issue of climate change again, after efforts to make concrete progress faltered during President Barack Obama's first term.Despite a multitude of international crises, Mr Kerry insisted on attending the meeting of the once-obscure council.Climate change has countries as far away as India also paying attention to the Arctic - and seeking observer status in the council.  Melting polar ice is making mineral and oil resources easier to exploit, setting off a scramble for access. The US Geological Survey estimated in 2008 that some 22% of the world's undiscovered oil and natural gas deposits were located above the Arctic Circle.The warming climate also opens shipping routes that were once mostly inaccessible. The northern sea route would cut the distance between Shanghai and Europe by several thousands of miles, saving time and money.China is courting Nordic countries, signing a trade agreement with Iceland and several commercial agreements with Denmark. Greenland, a self-governing part of Denmark, is considering awarding mine exploration licenses to companies this year for a $2bn (£1.3bn) project north-east of the capital Nuuk. One of those companies is London Mining, which would join a Chinese mining company in the project that could supply China with 15 million tonnes of iron ore a year.China is one of 14 countries that have applied for observer status in the council, along with Japan, South Korea, India and others. Several European countries such as France and the Netherlands are already observers.Observers do not participate in the decision-making process. But the Arctic's growing geopolitical significance allows countries with even a toehold in the small club - like China - to be closer to the action.The council will consider the new applications during the Kiruna meeting and possibly come to a decision, which requires consensus. Canada and Russia are opposed, while the Nordic countries are in favour.""The argument for opening for more observers in the Arctic Council is that they will then be a member of our club,"" said Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide. ""Then the danger of them forming their own club will be smaller.""Countries such as Canada that oppose inviting in more observers fear the voice of indigenous people who live in the Arctic will be diminished.On Friday the White House said the US had not taken a position yet. A senior US official attending the Kiruna meeting said Washington was open to observers and respected the consensus. The official also added that Washington believed China was a responsible applicant.It is unclear whether the eight members will be able to reach a decision by the end of their meeting in Kiruna, which will also mark the transfer of the council chairmanship from Sweden to Canada for the next two years. The US takes over in 2015.Last week, the White House unveiled a new Arctic strategy with three policy aims: advancing national security interests, responsibly managing the Arctic ecosystem, and bolstering international relationships. But the strategy provided little detail about specific issues like drilling or shipping lanes. And with no clear budget, experts said it was a vague wish list.Arctic policy is sensitive issue for President Obama, who must balance pressure from environmentalists opposed to Arctic drilling with the needs of the oil and gas industry and Republicans who are pushing for more aggressive drilling and mine exploitation. The council members will also sign an oil-spill preparedness and response treaty."

New coal-powered plans would be limited to 1,100lb.Currently, the average coal plant emits about 1,800lb of carbon dioxide per hour.The proposal would eventually affect existing power plants, which account for around a third of all US greenhouse gas emissions.To meet the standard, coal plants would need to install new carbon capture technology, which the industry has said is currently too expensive.'Limitless dumping'Mr Obama has previously said he wants to end what he has called ""the limitless dumping of carbon pollution"" from US power plants.In his second inaugural address in January, he promised a renewed focus on climate change - a signature of his first election campaign that was essentially ignored during his first term as president in favour of healthcare reform.""We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,"" said Mr Obama in his January speech.He said that while ""some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science... none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms"".Although the plan unveiled on Friday has been in the works since April 2012, it faces steep opposition from both industry groups and congressional Republicans, who say efforts to force plants to install expensive carbon cleaning technology could hurt job creation.Currently, coal-powered plants account for around 40% of US electricity consumption, a share which has been shrinking recently.The plan will be subject to a 60-day comment period, and officials hope to implement it by the fall of 2014."

The Chancellor insisted that a decision on 2030 should be delayed until 2016 at the earliest  (after the election) but many Lib Dem and Conservative MPs are expected to join Labour in voting for an amendment to introduce the target immediately.Mr Davey claims the bill will still prompt a major change in the way power is generated.His colleagues will suspect that his speech on climate sceptics and the media is a way of bolstering his party’s credibility on the issue.The speech is an explosion of anger from a politician who has long been privately frustrated about the extent to which right-wing newspapers have swung Conservative back-benchers behind the climate sceptic cause.He believes editors are corrupting public understanding of science and making it more difficult to impose measures to tackle the emissions that are disrupting the climate.Last week, for instance, the green-minded Tory MP Tim Yeo, who has laid the amendment calling for 2030 targets, was ""outed"" as a closet climate sceptic after saying there was a chance that climate change could be natural. Mr Yeo insists that he went on to say that the overwhelming consensus is that climate change is man-made, but this crucial fact was drowned out.Meanwhile, a newsletter from Lord Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation trumpeted: ""We are all climate sceptics now.""Mr Davey says climate change is being turned into a political football. In a draft of his speech, he says: ""Of course there will always be uncertainties within climate science and the need for research to continue. ""But some sections of the press are giving an uncritical campaigning platform to individuals and lobby groups.""This is not the serious science of challenging, checking and probing.""This is destructive and loudly clamouring scepticism born of vested interest, nimbyism, publicity seeking contraversialism or sheer blinkered, dogmatic, political bloody-mindedness. ""This tendency will seize upon the normal expression of scientific uncertainty and portray it as proof that all climate change policy is hopelessly misguided. ""By selectively misreading the evidence, they seek to suggest that climate change has stopped so we can all relax and burn all the dirty fuel we want without a care.""Those who argue against all the actions we are taking to reduce emissions, without any serious and viable alternative, are asking us to take a massive gamble with the planet our children will inherit, in the face of all the evidence, against overwhelming odds.""The speech at a Met Office event in London takes place as 55 organisations from green groups to manufacturing bodies issued a joint statement calling on MPs to vote in favour of the 2030 decarbonisation amendment.It says: ""We represent different parts of society but are united in the belief that the Energy Bill represents a major opportunity to put the UK firmly on track to becoming a world leading low-carbon economy, boost employment and show genuine leadership in the fight against dangerous climate change.""The list of signatories includes SSE electricity, the Royal Society of Arts and Commerce; Dong Energy; Renewable UK; the Carbon Capture and Storage Association; the Solar Trade Association, the Renewable Energy Association; Business in the Community; the Church of Scotland; the National Farmers Union and the TUC. An additional 50 organisations have also added their support.The organisations believe that fixing a clean electricity target will drive investment in renewable industries that will create jobs and wealth in the UK. Critics fear that the measure will make UK power prices uncompetitive and divert investment from other industries. They say the UK should not commit itself to a ""green"" economy while there is no comprehensive global climate agreement obliging all nations to follow suit.

But most benefits had been off-limits until the Supreme Court ruling.""It is now the department's policy to treat all married military personnel equally,"" Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a memo on Wednesday to senior Pentagon officials.The Pentagon also stated it would grant leave for military personnel stationed in a US state that does not permit same-sex marriage to travel to a jurisdiction where they can marry legally.""This will provide accelerated access to the full range of benefits offered to married military couples throughout the department and help level the playing field between opposite-sex and same-sex couples seeking to be married,"" said Navy Lt Commander Nate Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman.The change will enable homosexual troops and their spouses to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery near Washington DC.Defence officials estimate there are almost 18,000 same-sex couples in the US forces and among military retirees, but it is unclear how many are married.Gay marriage is legal in 13 states and the District of Columbia, but many other states have explicit bans on same-sex unions."

12263	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22291239	other	1	Gay Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Few things tweak the patriotic nerve of Australians more strongly than being outstripped by their trans-Tasman neighbours, New Zealand. Traditionally, the rivalry plays out on the sports field. Yet this month has seen a kind of legislative equivalent of the Bledisloe Cup, the annual rugby union clash between the All Blacks and the Wallabies. Rather than out-muscle the Australians, the Kiwis have out-reformed them. They did so by becoming the first Asia-Pacific nation to legalise same-sex marriage.In a country famed for its Maori hakas, the moment that the bill became law was celebrated in impromptu song: an Edelweiss moment, where the public gallery, then the well of the chamber itself, joined in a stirring rendition of the New Zealand love song, ""Pokarekare Ana,"" sung in the indigenous tongue. Not only did it became an instant YouTube sensation but it also highlighted the quietness on the issue from Australian parliamentarians. When last September the most recent gay marriage bill was put before the House of Representatives in Canberra, it was defeated 98 votes to 42.As if to emphasise the distance between the two neighbours on this question, the reform came from a conservative government led by Prime Minister John Key, whereas Australia's Labor leader Julia Gillard remains opposed.  Now the embattled Ms Gillard is under heightened pressure to shift her stance, although she has publicly reaffirmed her opposition since the historic vote in Wellington. Still, given most commentators believe she will suffer a landslide defeat in September's election, some supporters of same-sex marriage think she will not want to go down in history as perhaps the last Labor leader to oppose marriage equality. Her party, the ALP, is already officially in favour, though its policy is not binding either on the leader or her MPs.With or without her backing, Australia appears to be experiencing a transitional moment on this issue. Here, as was recently noted of America, the advocates of same-sex marriage have not yet won, but there is a mounting sense that its opponents have lost.""Those who agree with same sex marriage have gone from being in favour to being strongly in favour,"" says Rodney Croome, the national convenor of Australian Marriage Equality. ""Opponents have gone from 'strongly opposed' to 'opposed.'"" In both the pro- and anti-camps, he claims, there is a growing sense that reform is inevitable. Polls suggest that almost two-thirds of Australians support same-sex marriage, compared with just 38% in 2004. Backing is especially high among young people, 81% of whom are thought to agree with marriage equality. ""These are people who take concerns about gay marriage into the voting booth,"" says Mr Croome. ""They don't just support it, they passionately support it.""He predicts that the first of the two major political parties to embrace same-sex marriage could reap a political dividend of 1.3 million votes. ""This is a vote-winner, not a vote-loser,"" he claims. The Australian Greens, led until last year by an openly gay Senator, Bob Brown, are already strongly in favour.Many same-sex marriage advocates have given up already on Julia Gillard and are looking beyond the election, and the strong likelihood of a conservative government.""Like most Australians we are looking at the possibility of an Abbott government, and realise that we need to speak directly to conservatives,"" says Rodney Croome. ""This is a not a left-right issue. There are many conservative arguments for reform: chiefly, it's about individual freedom and the strengthening of relationships and the family.""For reformers, it helps that a number of leading conservatives have either voiced outright support for same-sex marriage or called for a conscience vote in parliament where lawmakers would be allowed to make up their own minds. The most significant backer is Barry O'Farrell, the premier of New South Wales and arguably the country's second most powerful conservative politician, who voiced support earlier this month. Malcolm Turnbull, the former Liberal leader, is also a supporter. Colin Barnett, the influential premier of Western Australian, remains opposed but thinks that MPs should be allowed to vote their conscience. The Liberal leader Tony Abbott, a former seminarian whose Catholicism is an important part of his political make-up, recently signalled a new openness to the idea of a conscience vote should he become prime minister. Recently, two of his daughters spoke out in favour of reform. His sister, Christine Forster, is very open about the fact she is in a same sex relationship.A shift in Republican thinking in America has also created an intellectual milieu among Australian conservatives far more receptive to change. The fact that New Zealand conservatives gave such vocal backing to same-sex marriage is also significant. The now famous parliamentary speech by the 63-year-old conservative National MP Maurice Williamson mocking the notion of some ""gay onslaught"" - which, like the song, also became a viral hit - has reverberated here. It was the precisely the kind of gruff, plain speaking that appeals to Australians.Less instrumental has been David Cameron's support for same-sex marriage. Partly because of his ""greening"" of the Conservative Party, he does not have much bearing over an Australian conservative movement that includes leading climate change sceptics. In this debate, Washington and Wellington have had more of an impact than Westminster.Tim Wilson, the policy director of the right-wing think tank, the Institute of Public Affairs, says there has been a sea-change amongst fellow conservative gays and lesbians. ""Five years ago, the issue didn't matter to gay Liberals,"" he says. ""Now it does. It's gone from a private matter to a public matter.""Practical rather than philosophical concerns have shifted the conservative mood, he reckons. ""When you get so many people coming out of the closet, it affects attitudes among mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, and friends and relatives. It's become a real thing for people, based on personal experience. That comes to be reflected in our politics."" For many conservatives, he says, this is a basic question of fairness, more so than equality. Religiosity, which is nowhere near as central to Australian politics as it is to American politics, is not as big an obstacle. Indeed, an irony of the Canberra debate is that Julia Gillard is an atheist, whereas Barack Obama had to reconcile his newfound support for same-sex marriage with the Biblical teachings he had grown up to believe. Australians overwhelmingly do not have a problem with an unmarried prime minister, who lives with her partner, Tim Matheson, in The Lodge. It is simply not an issue, as it would be, say, in America. The polls suggest that a majority of Australians exhibit the same spirit of tolerance on the question of same marriage. "

Earlier this month Mr Ford stepped aside as an elder at Second Donegore Presbyterian Church over his political support for gay marriage. His position on the issue is to be examined by the church.  Mr Ford said the language of the debate was important.""I think it's not for majorities to tell minorities that feel discriminated against that they're not being discriminated against,"" he told the BBC's Sunday Sequence.""I think you only have to look back at the history of this region in the 1950s and 60s to see the dangers of majorities telling minorities that discrimination isn't real."" Last September, the Alliance Party voted in support of legislation to allow gay civil marriage in Northern Ireland. Mr Ford voluntarily stepped aside as an elder in Second Donegore Presbyterian Church after some members of the congregation expressed concerns about his support for marriage equality laws.""It appeared my political position was a focus for some limited dissent within the congregation,"" he said.""I'm not sure how many members of the congregation did go to the minister. ""I know there were a small number who had a conversation with the minister and I've had conversations both, in the presbytery and in the session, before I voluntarily stepped aside, just to be very clear, currently from the active duties of the office, not from the office. ""I think that is very much an issue which is in the hands of the session of Second Donegore as to whether or when they might wish me to resume those duties.""Mr Ford told the programme it had been a ""difficult time for me and my family given the way the controversy has raged and given to some extent the way it's been handled in the media"".The Alliance Party supports same sex marriage in Northern Ireland, while the Presbyterian church strongly opposes the move. Mr Ford said his personal position on same sex marriage was the same as the party's position. ""I believe the state has a duty to provide services for citizens on an equal basis, and at the same time, the state has a duty to protect the rights of churches to define and practice their own beliefs,"" he said."

But same-sex marriage has been possible in some states since 2004 - and one gay couple even craftily obtained a marriage licence more than 40 years ago.""We're gonna win eventually, not this time but maybe the next time around.""In 1973, gay rights activist Jack Baker told an American talk show it was just a matter of time before same-sex marriage would be legalised.  He was appearing on the influential David Susskind Show, broadcast nationwide, after he and his partner, Michael McConnell, had managed to secure a marriage licence by subterfuge.For Baker, marriage was a civil rights issue.""It goes to the core of discrimination, you cannot let non-gay people treat you differently… you have to say 'I pay taxes to support this government and it is going to recognise me as an equal citizen or by God I'm going to disrupt that government.'""The prevailing image of homosexuality in the early 1970s was a caricature - flamboyant men in gay bars, and a lifestyle of wild promiscuity.Going public about your sexual orientation could cost you your home, your job and your family.  Baker and McConnell didn't fit the stereotype. Both in their late 20s - clean cut and with short, neat hair - Baker was a law student and McConnell a librarian. They'd been together for four years when they first applied for a marriage licence in 1970.This was rejected - on the grounds that they were both men. But the couple decided to fight. They appealed, and kept on appealing until the case reached the US Supreme Court. It was the first time the court had been asked to rule on gay marriage - but it refused to hear the case ""for want of a substantial federal question"".Undeterred, the couple tried again. This time they tried a different tack - Baker changed his name to the gender-neutral ""Pat Lyn"". A very simple manoeuvre, but it did the trick. The licence was issued and they began to plan a wedding. They asked a Methodist minister to perform the ceremony and went through weeks of pre-marital counselling like any heterosexual couple preparing for a Methodist wedding.  But with 24 hours to go, the minister changed his mind.They needed another minister to step forward, says Pastor Roger Lynn, who worked alongside the couple at a drop-in centre offering support and counselling to gay people in Minneapolis.""It wasn't just a marriage… it was a social event in the gay community,"" says Lynn. The couple were planning to film the wedding, in order to get the word out to the national media. Lynn jumped at the chance to conduct the ceremony. At the time, his church had no rules against marrying people of the same sex, he says.""The Methodist church has always taken a strong stand on social issues… I expected that the progressive side of the church would support me.""The ceremony took place in an old Victorian home near a lake in Minneapolis. ""There was a cake and rather than a bride and groom on the top, there were two grooms,"" Lynn says.He remembers pronouncing the couple ""husband and husband"".He says it was an emotional moment, ""particularly when they kissed"".Despite his work at the drop-in centre he'd never seen two men kiss - and he says he had a ""visceral reaction"". ""It was frightening,"" he says. ""It forced me to come to terms with my own homophobia.""  At the end of the ceremony, when many of the congregation came up to the pastor in tears, he says he knew he'd done the right thing.  ""It was very clear that these two people were in love with each other, and they were a good balance,"" he says.  After conducting Baker and McConnell's wedding ceremony, Lynn found his own marriage was in trouble. His wife wasn't happy about what he'd done and was nervous about the attention it would bring. The following Sunday they attended church and the preacher leading the service vilified Lynn for performing the marriage.Lynn was steadfast. ""I thought it was funny,"" he says. ""I knew some in the congregation supported me and I felt a little smug.""But soon afterwards he began to get hate mail from across the country. His notoriety was such that one letter reached him addressed simply to ""gay hippy minister, Minneapolis"".He was fired from his job, but soon reinstated on appeal.His marriage also ended, though not for this reason alone, he says.  For years afterwards fellow ministers tried to get him to change his mind about what he'd done. But despite all these problems, Lynn - now retired and living in Minnesota - says he's never regretted his actions.""It defined who I am and if I had the chance to do it again, I'd do it again,"" he says.Jack Baker and Mike McConnell received many letters of support from across the world - from Brazil to India. One postcard sent from Barbados read simply: ""Congratulations on your courageous step! Hope your dreams come true and that life together will be as beautiful and happy as can be.""The couple still live together in Minneapolis. They consider themselves legally married as their licence has never been revoked. They don't give interviews to the media now, but speaking on the David Susskind show in 1973, Baker described their attitude to same-sex marriage. ""Gay couples will come into the relationship as two equal human beings and so you don't arbitrarily assume that because you have certain genitals you'll do a certain thing… heterosexuals should learn that one.""Roger Lynn was interviewed for the BBC World Service programme WitnessYou can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

Quentin Bryce, 70, made the comments during a speech in Sydney in which she outlined a future vision for Australia.""Perhaps one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation's first head of state,"" she said, reigniting the republic debate.Australians voted against becoming a republic in a 1999 referendum.The country is a parliamentary democracy that retains Britain's monarch as its head of state.In the 1999 vote, Australians opted to preserve the status quo, with Queen Elizabeth II remaining as the head of state - although the republican movement was split between those who wanted an elected president and those who preferred a parliamentary appointee.The issue has largely fallen into the political doldrums in Australia in recent years. Ms Bryce, the country's first female governor-general, was appointed in 2008 when Kevin Rudd was prime minister. Her tenure ends in March next year.Her comments, made at the end of a four-part lecture series, have reignited a debate about the nation's ties to Britain.

""We need an unambiguous, independent national identity that reflects and celebrates our freedom, our unity, our values of the fair go and our place in the world.""

Mr Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a staunch royalist who used to be the executive director of the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, said Ms Bryce was entitled to her opinion.""It's more than appropriate for the governor-general approaching the end of her term to express a personal view on a number of subjects and that's what she was doing, she was expressing a personal view and, as you would expect from Quentin Bryce, she did it with grace and style,"" he said.Ms Bryce also voiced support for same-sex marriage - a position that Mr Abbott, a devout Catholic, also opposes.

Those against the motion included 50 unionist MLAs and three members of the Alliance. Those in favour included all 37 nationalists who voted and three unionists. An Alliance Party amendment was also defeated. It would have emphasised the freedom of churches to practise and define marriage as they choose.After the amendment was rejected, the Alliance leader David Ford and two of his party colleagues abstained on the main motion. Proposing her party's motion, Sinn Fein assembly member Bronwyn McGahan said she respected there were deeply held religious, cultural and personal views surrounding the issue.""MLAs, regardless of religious belief, represent every section of our community, including our LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) members and this motion is about ensuring marriage equality for everyone regardless of their sexual orientation,"" she said.""What churches do is a matter for churches but the state needs to treat everyone with equality.""Finance Minister Sammy Wilson, of the DUP, defended his party's use of the petition of concern saying it was important to stop ""reckless legislation"". He said the motion would not promote safeguards or equality and he did not believe a balance of opinions had been accurately reflected during the debate.""This is not an issue of equality, it is an issue of redefining marriage as it has always been understood, "" he said.""Once there's a change in the legal definition of marriage then those who take up contrary views will find themselves up against the law - their rights will be infringed.""He also said the motion's reference to a vote at the Irish constitutional convention had no bearing on the Northern Ireland Assembly.The Sinn Fein motion had said it welcomed the 79% majority vote at the Irish convention on the constitution in favour of marriage equality.Colum Eastwood of the SDLP said he believed that if two people of the same gender loved each other and wanted to commit their lives together they should be supported.Alliance Party leader David Ford spoke on his party's amendment, which stated its support for the extension of civil marriage provisions in Northern Ireland to same-sex couples provided that faith groups were respected.""Equal marriage is a matter of great importance to many in our community, to many citizens who have a legitimate expectation that they will be treated equally by the state, but I also acknowledge that it's an issue of great sensitivity and of huge significance for a number of religious denominations and other faith groups,"" he said.Mr Ford said the Sinn Fein motion was ""grandstanding and futile"" as it was not balanced in its support for same-sex marriage compared with religious freedom.""The Executive is not going to legislate in this term for equal marriage even if the house had passed the motion,"" he said.Ulster Unionist assembly members spoke in a personal capacity as the party allowed for a vote of conscience on this matter.Newry and Armagh MLA Danny Kennedy said he was opposed to any change in legislation due to his religious beliefs which he said were consistent with the teaching of the Presbyterian Church. He said Sinn Fein were ""guilty of engaging in a very cynical, political exercise which is of no benefit to any section of our community, not least the LGBT.""The amendment and the motion both fell."

Culture Secretary Maria Miller told BBC Radio 4: ""We feel that marriage is a good thing and we should be supporting more couples to marry."" There would be adequate protection for religious freedoms, she said. The bill has divided Conservatives, with former Defence Secretary Liam Fox recently describing it as ""ill thought through and constitutionally wrong"". Conservative MPs will get a free vote on the legislation when it is debated in the Commons on Tuesday 5 February, meaning they will face no repercussions if they decide to defy government policy. More than 100 Tory MPs are thought to be against the idea, but the bill is likely to pass through the Commons with the support of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs.Same-sex couples have been able to enter into civil partnerships since 2005, entitling them to the same legal rights as married couples across a range of matters, such as inheritance, pensions provision, life assurance, child maintenance, next of kin and immigration rights.The new law, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, will enable same-sex couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies - where a religious institution has formally consented. It will also allow couples who have previously entered into civil partnerships to convert their relationship into a marriage. Mrs Miller said the government recognised that ""some churches won't want to participate in same-sex marriages"". ""We are trying to make sure that there are the protections there for churches who feel that this isn't appropriate for their particular beliefs,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, the government also wanted any religious institution that did want to carry out same-sex marriages to be able to do so, she said. The Church of England and Roman Catholics, among other denominations, have voiced opposition to the plans and are expected to oppose the bill, even with its caveats.But some religious groups, including Quakers, Unitarians and Liberal Judaism, are in favour.The culture secretary set out the legal position of the Church of England and the Church in Wales in some detail in a blog post in December. ""The Church of England, as the established church, is a special case. It has a duty in law to marry any person in their local parish church, regardless of their religious affiliation,"" she wrote.The legislation would ensure this duty did not apply to same-sex couples, she said. But she added that it could put forward a change to the law ""of its own accord"" if its governing body, the Synod, changed its policy: ""Put simply, should the Church of England decide to carry out same-sex marriage in the future, it can itself amend legislation to effect this with the approval of Parliament.""Mrs Miller told the Commons in December that no religious organisation ""will ever be forced to conduct marriages for same-sex couples"".Mr Fox has said the proposals will put the established church in an ""anomalous and absurd"" position. In a letter to constituents that was made public earlier this month, Mr Fox said same-sex relationships should be treated ""with tolerance and respect"", but he did not believe there was much demand for them to be recognised as marriages. ""The legislation looks as though it was made on the hoof to deal with the political problem du jour,"" he wrote. The government was in danger of ""further weakening and splintering Britain's traditional religion at a time when many Christians feel that they are under threat"", he said.""To fail to understand this is to risk an affront to a large stabilising and normally acquiescent section of this country which will sow completely unnecessary seeds of dissent.""The Bishop of Leicester, the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, said marriage should continue to be ""a union between one man and one woman. It is a social institution that predates both church and state and has been part of the glue that has bound countless successive societies together.""The ""absence of an overwhelming public consensus for change ought at least to give pause for thought"", he said. But John Wadham, general counsel at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, welcomed the move: ""We agree that couples who wish to marry should be permitted to marry in church if their church also wishes to marry them.""For Labour, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""Marriage as an institution has undergone repeated reform and modernisation over hundreds of years and needs to again now to reflect the equal value we place on long-term loving relationships for same-sex couples too."""

Instead, a group of House Republicans hired a lawyer to argue in favour of the  law.Chief Justice John Roberts questioned why President Obama did not have ""the courage of his convictions"" to stop enforcing the law.Signed by President Bill Clinton, Doma has already been ruled unconstitutional by several lower courts.The case against Doma was originally brought by New Yorker Edith Windsor, 83, who was required to pay more than $350,000 (£220,000) of federal inheritance taxes after the 2009 death of her wife, Thea Spyer.Outside the court on Wednesday, Ms Windsor said: ""The justices were gentle, I didn't feel any hostility. I think it's going to be good.""On Tuesday the Supreme Court heard arguments in another gay marriage case, on the legality of a California constitutional amendment banning same-sex unions.Proposition 8 was approved by California voters in a referendum in 2008.Supporters of gay marriage are hoping the court could erase bans on same-sex marriages nationwide.But legal analysts say the justices' comments on Tuesday did not seem to promise such a sweeping ruling.Currently, nine US states and Washington DC permit same-sex marriage. Twelve other states allow civil unions or domestic partnerships that provide varying degrees of state marriage benefits.Recent opinion polls have shown a steady rise in support for same-sex marriage in the US, together with declarations in favour of it by political figures such as Hillary Clinton."

""As the law stands a public authority would in fact be acting unlawfully if it attempted to rely on the public sector equality duty to treat a religious organisation adversely simply because that organisation did not wish to conduct same sex marriages as explicitly allowed under this Bill.""Peers also discussed Labour peer Lord Harrison's call for humanist weddings, which are legally invalid in England and Wales but legal in Scotland, to be recognised in law for same-sex and heterosexual couples, "

Prosecutors had argued that Mr Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin dead on 26 February 2012 because he had racially profiled him as he walked through his neighbourhood wearing a hooded sweatshirt.Trayvon Martin was African-American. Mr Zimmerman, who was carrying out area patrols after a spate of break-in, identifies himself as Hispanic.The defence said he had killed Trayvon Martin in self-defence after the teenager punched their client, slammed his head into the pavement and reached for Mr Zimmerman's gun.On Sunday, Trayvon Martin was remembered in many church services across the country. Protests also continued, with those taking part saying justice had not been done.In his statement, Mr Obama said the death of Trayvon Martin ""was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America.""He acknowledged the case had elicited ""strong passions"", but said: ""We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.""  He said all Americans should respect the call for calm reflection from the Martin family and should reflect on how to prevent future tragedies. ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis... As citizens, that's a job for all of us.  ""That's the way to honour Trayvon Martin.""Mr Obama had commented on the Zimmerman case in March last year, saying: ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.""On Sunday, the Department of Justice said it was evaluating the evidence to see whether Mr Zimmerman could face prosecution under federal criminal civil rights statutes, and whether such action would be ""appropriate in accordance with the Department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial"".Civil rights groups in the US have also called for calm, though have expressed their dismay at the verdict.Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson told CNN on Sunday: ""I remain stunned at the decision. The department of justice must intervene to take this to another level.""He said ""the American legal system has once again failed justice"". But he also appealed for calm, saying anyone seeking to ""compound our pain with street justice"" would do ""damage to the innocent blood and legacy of Trayvon Martin"". Rights activist Al Sharpton said the verdict was ""a slap in the face to the American people"".He compared the case to the beating of African-American man Rodney King by police in 1991, which sparked widespread rioting.A petition launched by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), demanding that the department of justice open a civil rights case against Mr Zimmerman, had received more than 350,000 signatures by midday on Sunday.Protest marches were staged in US cities including San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta. In Oakland, California, some protesters started small fires and smashed windows.Mr Zimmerman's family and representatives have said they are afraid he could fall victim to revenge attacks.His brother, Robert said he had received frequent threats on social media and there was ""more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him"". ""He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,"" he said.His lawyer, Mark O'Mara, told ABC News on Sunday that Mr Zimmerman had no regrets about having carried a gun on the night of 26 February 2012.He said his client would now be entitled to have his weapon returned to him and to carry it, saying there was ""ever more reason now, isn't there? There are a lot of people out there who actually hate him, though they shouldn't.""Jorge Rodriguez, a friend of Mr Zimmerman's, said he had told him of his relief. He told Reuters he did not understand the anger at the verdict.""Everybody asked for justice, and they got it. Everybody asked for George to be arrested, and they got it. Everybody asked for George to be tried, and they got it. Everybody asked for a fair trial, and they got it.""""It was nothing about racism.

The powerful gun lobby vows to oppose new gun control measures, arguing the US Constitution forbids them.Thursday's procedural vote to begin debate passed 68-31, with a handful of Republicans joining all but two Democrats, who have the majority in the chamber.It is the furthest into the legislative process any gun control bill has moved since 1994, when an assault weapons ban passed.But where the debate goes from here is uncertain, says the BBC's Paul Adams in Washington. Senators could take weeks to thrash out all the likely amendments. And crucially, there's absolutely no guarantee that any of this will actually become law, our correspondent says. Gun control advocates planned several events on Thursday to draw attention to what is described as a national gun violence epidemic.Religious leaders from Newtown, Connecticut began a 24-hour vigil at 11:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on the National Mall near the White House and Capitol building.More than 3,300 grave markers placed there will represent those killed by guns since a gunman killed 26 people at a primary school in Newtown in December.Another group has been reading aloud the names, places and ages of these gun violence victims.The lobbying push by both gun control and gun rights groups comes as a Democratic and a Republican senator have announced an agreement on a bill to expand background checks.On Wednesday, Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania unveiled a deal that would expand criminal background checks to online and gun show sales, establish a commission on mass violence, and ease some restrictions on transporting guns across state lines.Their proposal is being hailed as the best chance for new gun control legislation, though it falls short of the far stricter measures backed by the White House.Currently, so-called private gun sales by dealers who are not licensed, including some at gun shows, are not subject to criminal background checks on the purchaser. Vice-President Joe Biden, a strong supporter of new gun control legislation, told MSNBC's Morning Joe programme on Thursday that gun control was ""one of the cases where the public is so far ahead of the elected officials"".Mr Biden also accused the nation's top gun rights lobbying group, the National Rifle Association (NRA), of spreading disinformation, and promised expanded background checks would not lead to a national gun registry.But the NRA opposes the Manchin-Toomey deal, arguing background checks do nothing to prevent gun violence.In a letter to senators on Wednesday, NRA lobbyist Chris Cox warned that the organisation would score lawmakers based on their votes on the Manchin-Toomey deal and other measures it opposes.President Barack Obama's other proposals, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, have not gained traction in Congress.After Thursday's vote, President Obama spoke to the families of Newtown victims, some of whom have become advocates for gun control, his spokesman said.""The president congratulated the families on this important step forward, noting that the bipartisan progress would not have been possible without their efforts,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters.Senators will soon vote on a series of amendments to the legislation and then once more to close debate, before voting on the bill itself.Prospects for legislation in the House are unclear, with Republican House Speaker John Boehner declining to say whether the lower chamber would hold a floor vote on the issue.""I've made it clear that if the Senate passes a bill, the House will certainly review it,"" Mr Boehner told reporters on Thursday.""The thing that we have to remember is that laws are only as good as our citizens' willingness to obey them. And law-abiding citizens, do, in fact, obey them. Criminals don't obey them. In addition to that, we've got a system of laws that are not in force today."""

But will it work?No single policy can end gun deaths and prevent massacres like that at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where last month a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children.Mr Obama admitted as much when he announced a plan to change America's gun culture on Wednesday.""Reducing gun violence is a complicated challenge,"" he said. ""If there's even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there's even one life that can be saved, we have an obligation to try.""Most public health officials agree on the need for a patchwork approach to the problem - one encompassing gun regulations, mental health initiatives and a hard look at violence in popular culture.""Gun violence is not just an issue of ownership and criminality and not just an issue of mental health,"" says Dariush Mozaffarian, co-director of the programme in cardiovascular epidemiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. ""If we look at it broadly as a public health issue, we will be much more successful than just trying to address one or two specific pathways.""Driving accidents and smoking deaths are two such issues that benefitted from a broad approach, he says. But can Mr Obama's proposals be effective? We take a closer look at some of the provisions in the plan.""The most important thing we need to do is fix our current system of background checks,"" Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said this week at a press conference.  ""It is indefensible that we have a system that allows people to sell guns with no background checks.""According to the US justice department, up to 40% of gun purchases take place without a background check - those from private sellers and some at gun shows.Closing the loophole will weed out those with criminal or psychiatric backgrounds legally barring them from gun ownership, Mr Webster said.But background checks would not have stopped most school shootings, in which the gunmen took legally obtained weapons from parents with spotless backgrounds, says Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University in Boston.Many gunmen have a clean criminal history - they are just having a really bad day, he says.He says most gun deaths are classified as manslaughter, which implies a crime committed without forethought.""In those cases, the criminal may not have a psychiatric record or a criminal history,"" says Mr Levin.""His pathology is situational. He loses his cool, loses his temper, and in the heat of the moment he takes out his knife from the kitchen drawer or gun from his trench coat and shoots.""The proposed assault weapons ban would eliminate the sale of weapons designed, as Mr Obama said, ""to pump out as many bullets as fast as possible"".Mr Webster said these weapons are particularly dangerous - and their ban could reduce deaths.""We believe they pose a unique threat with respect to mass shootings,"" he said. ""The casualty numbers tend to be larger with such weapons.""Limiting magazine size - and thus the number of bullets that can be shot without reloading - could help reduce fatalities, Mr Webster said.Mr Obama noted the gunman at a cinema in Colorado in July shot 70 people in minutes. When gunmen need to reload, victims and first responders have a chance to fight back, says Mr Levin.But Mr Levin also points out that most gun deaths are the result of handguns. ""One bullet, one body,"" he says.Mr Levin says addressing mental health provides the biggest way to prevent shootings - but it is important that the motivation is right.""We wait until someone looks troublesome, but we should get in touch with them and intervene when they're troubled,"" he says.  ""Not to prevent a murder, but to help them.""Mr Obama called for mental-health counsellors, as well as anti-bullying resources for 8,000 schools.National Rifle Association Executive Vice-President Wayne LaPierre last month called violent video games and television programmes part of the problem.That line was widely ridiculed by gun control advocates as an oversimplification, but Mr Obama has since said he wants to study the impact of violence in pop culture.That's progress, says Mr Mozaffarian. ""Even during the day if I'm watching a sporting program... almost every commercial break there's a commercial with people being shot, guns being pulled out,"" he says.He says ubiquitous images of violence create ""a strong unconscious acceptability"".""We have common-sense regulations to minimise obscenity and nudity, and almost nothing for gun violence,"" he says.While he says larger cultural change is possible - and necessary - he admits that it can take a long time.  The question is how long the nation can wait. "

It has been condemned by world leaders since it was mooted in 2009.

However, he had decided not to ""support"" Uganda because of its ""witch hunt"" against gay people. ""I would urge other companies worldwide to follow suit. Uganda must reconsider or find it being ostracised by companies and tourists worldwide,"" Mr Branson said.Mr Branson is the founder of Virgin Group, which has more than 400 companies worldwide, focusing mainly on travel, entertainment and telecommunications. He is also a leading philanthropist who supported charities set up by South Africa's first black President, Nelson Mandela. Mr Branson attended Mr Mandela's funeral last week.""Governments must realise that people should be able to love whoever they want,"" he said.He said it was not for any government ""to ever make any judgements on people's sexuality"". ""They should instead celebrate when people build loving relationships that strengthen society, no matter who they are,"" he added. Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has not yet signed the bill into law while Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi opposed the vote in parliament on the grounds that there was no quorum.However, MPs pushed ahead with the vote. The bill's supporters say it protects traditional family values, which they allege are under attack from Western-inspired gay rights groups.The private member's bill originally proposed the death penalty for some offences, such as if a minor was involved or the perpetrator was HIV-positive, but this has been replaced with life in prison.The bill also makes it a crime punishable by a prison sentence not to report gay people to the police."

""And there's no excuse for the problems, and these problems are getting fixed.""He was joined at Monday's event by people who have successfully enrolled during the first three weeks.Janice Baker, a Delaware business owner who was the first person in her state to enrol for coverage through the exchange website, introduced Mr Obama.She said she had ""a number of frustrating attempts"" to use the site, but kept trying as she had been rejected from insurance plans previously because of a pre-existing condition.Ms Baker said she expected to save $150 (£93) a month with the policy she had signed up for on the exchange. The website is supposed to be a clearinghouse for uninsured Americans searching for medical coverage. The site acts both as a check on whether applications qualify for government subsidies for private insurance, as well as being the first enrolment step for specific plans.The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the exchanges will be the gateway for providing health coverage to an estimated seven million Americans during the first year. The White House has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and state-run exchanges since 1 October.Exchanges run by individual states do not appear to have been plagued to the same extent by malfunctions.White House officials initially blamed the glitches on the heavy volume of visits to the site, but they recently conceded the flaws were larger and involved software and system design issues.The Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the exchanges, said in a blog post it had already begun to make improvements.But the administration has offered few details on who was being brought in from outside the government and the specific causes of the ongoing glitches.Passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has rolled out in multiple steps, including coverage requirements on insurance companies and future tax penalties for those who remain uninsured. Republicans unanimously oppose the law and have worked to undermine it since it was enacted. Republican-led state governments have used their authority to frustrate its implementation. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to repeal the law or eliminate its funding, most recently by refusing to pass a budget in an attempt to force Mr Obama's hand. A subsequent 16-day shutdown of the federal government ended with no major concessions from Mr Obama.""Obamacare costs too much and it's not working the way they promised,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday. ""It's time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort.""Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has also been criticised by Republican lawmakers for declining an invitation to testify about the snags on 24 October. But a spokeswoman for the health department said the secretary would testify at some point.White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday there had been ""for many months and years now a concentrated, concerted effort by critics of Obamacare to undermine it"".""There's clearly some joy being taken in some quarters by the experiences that some Americans have had, frustrating experiences that they've had, in trying to get information about affordable health insurance.""Although the law remains divisive, a recent Gallup poll suggests only 29% of the public favours a complete repeal."

""That's only fair.""House Democratic leaders said they would propose their own plan allowing insurers to renew policies earmarked for cancellation.Meanwhile, Mr Obama met insurance executives on Friday to allay concerns regarding his proposed ""fix"" to the healthcare law.On Thursday, he announced a one-year reprieve for those facing cancellation of their existing coverage.The Republican plan passed on Friday goes one step further - it would allow insurers to sell health coverage to new, as well as existing, customers.Insurers earlier raised doubts over the Obama plan, saying it could ""destabilise the market and result in higher premiums for consumers"".Ahead of Friday's meeting, Mr Obama said he was ""brainstorming"" options and ""soliciting ideas"" from industry leaders on how best to enrol Americans in health plans.The Obama administration is also still working to remedy its malfunctioning healthcare.gov website.It was established by the law to enable consumers who do not get health insurance through their employers or via government benefits to shop for coverage.Glitches have proven so severe that fewer than 27,000 people in 36 US states managed to enrol in healthcare policies in the first month after its October launch.About 79,000 managed to enrol using websites run by the other 14 states and Washington DC."

Some have gone so far as to accuse Mr Obama of lying to the public during his campaign for the law's passage.Even some of Mr Obama's fellow Democrats have suggested the administration delay parts of the law's implementation, including a requirement that people carry health insurance or face a penalty.Mr Obama's remarks on Thursday came after weeks of serious problems with healthcare.gov - a website established under the law - which allows consumers to shop for private health insurance plans.Among other issues, it has been plagued by long wait times to sign up for an insurance plan and serious flaws on the back end where customers' data are processed and sent to insurance companies.Mr Obama has vowed the website will be repaired. The Republican response to Mr Obama's remarks was swift, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saying ""if the president is truly sorry for breaking his promises to the American people, he'll do more than just issue a half-hearted apology on TV"".Thursday's television interview was the latest effort by Mr Obama to win public support for the embattled healthcare law. On Wednesday he travelled into the heart of Republican territory to talk up the measure.""We are going to get this done,"" he told a crowd in Dallas, Texas.The law's new coverage requirements for health insurance plans have been blamed for the policy cancellations. Its other provisions include establishing the healthcare.gov website and others run by the states; mandates that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty; and subsidies to assist in the purchase of the insurance. It also expands eligibility for the Medicaid government health programme for the poor. "

""I'm the first to say that the first month I've not been happy with,"" he said of the website, which launched on 1 October.""Nothing drives me more crazy than the fact that right now, there's great insurance to be had out there, choice and competition, where people can save money for a better product, except too many folks haven't been able to get through the website.""Healthcare.gov - akin to a shopping website for health insurance plans - has been plagued with problems, especially long wait times to sign up for an insurance plan and serious flaws on the back end where customers' data are processed and sent to insurance companies.""This is like having a really good product in a store, and the cash registers don't work and there aren't enough parking spots and nobody can get through the door,"" he said. ""And so we are working overtime to get this fixed.""By the end of November, he said, ""you're going to have families all across this great state of Texas who are going to have the security and the well-being of high-quality, affordable health insurance.""Mr Perry, a hard-line conservative who ran for the Republican Party presidential nomination in 2012, called Mr Obama's trip to Texas ""a desperate attempt to salvage his ill-conceived and unpopular programme"".The governor added that his state needed ""flexibility"" to implement specific reforms rather than a ""one-size-fits-all Washington mandate"".Mr Perry, like many other Republican governors, declined the option under the law of setting up a state insurance website, forcing Texas residents to rely on the federal healthcare.gov site. The 1 October launch of the insurance marketplace websites run by the federal and state governments was the culmination of more than three years of political combat in Washington over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Mr Obama in 2010 and known to both sides as Obamacare.Aside from establishing the healthcare.gov medical insurance marketplace website and others run by the states, the law bolsters coverage requirements for insurance firms, mandates that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and offers subsidies to assist in the purchase of the insurance. It also expands eligibility for the Medicaid government health programme for the poor. However, Texas - like many other states governed by Republicans - has refused to expand its Medicaid programme, rejecting federal funds provided under the law to do so.Ongoing issues with the website have shaken political confidence in the endeavour.Earlier on Wednesday, Senate finance committee chairman Max Baucus, a Democrat, suggested the Obama administration take down the healthcare.gov marketplace until the kinks had been smoothed out.Mr Baucus, a supporter of the health law, suggested that would limit the negative press coverage.But Mr Obama's Health Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, told the panel such an action ""wouldn't delay people's cancer or diabetes or Parkinson's"".Ms Sebelius did acknowledge that the site required hundreds of repairs and that further work was needed before it was fully operational. ""We're not there yet,"" she said.Even as the technical problems have limited Americans' ability to sign up for new health coverage under the law, many other people have been informed that insurance plans they already held were being cancelled because they did not meet the new law's stringent requirements.Mr Obama had long insisted that people would be able to keep insurance plans they liked. Republicans have seized on that, with some going as far as to accuse Mr Obama of lying to the public during his campaign for the law's passage.""President Obama deceived the American people by promising that anyone who liked their health care plan could keep it, but millions of Americans are now discovering that simply isn't true,"" Mr Perry said in a statement.The Obama administration has declined to say how many Americans have actually enrolled in new policies through the websites, rankling Republicans who accuse it of withholding vital information.Republicans view the health law as a costly and inappropriate government intrusion into the healthcare system, and have sought to undo or undermine it at every turn.And they argue the website's problems ongoing reflect broader issues with the healthcare law."

As many have already pointed out, President Obama had to avoid that moment of hubris when George W Bush declared the Iraq war won, before it went horribly wrong. So instead of standing on an aircraft carrier, there was a briefing down a phone line on Sunday morning from an official with lots of geeky detail and references to graphs. The upshot was that a lot of bugs had been fixed but the delicate website was to be treated like a sick but recovering patient, not to be exposed to too many stresses and strains.The focus would be on getting existing customers through the system, not taking on new ones. The real test will be over the next few days as politicians and journalists gleefully attempt to get the system to crash.The glitchy website has become a metaphor as well as a problem in its own right. If it doesn't function properly and get enough people on board, if not enough healthy people sign up, then Obamacare will fail on a very practical level. But beyond that it has become the ugly poster-child for the Republican contention that big government can't work and should have left healthcare alone. It raises concerns about the very complexity of the reforms. I've heard many ordinary Democrats wish that Obama had gone for the hugely more controversial but easy to understand big fix of a single payer system like the British NHS.Many others think he should have gone much smaller bore and fixed the system one problem at a time. The way this unfolded says something about Obama's political and managerial style. The legacy of a president hangs on the next few days and months of Obamacare and its unwell website. "

""We're not repealing it as long as I'm president.""Mr Obama added that the new healthcare website, which sells medical insurance, is now working at acceptable levels after a glitch-plagued 1 October launch,He also sought to remind the American public of the law's most popular provisions: Under the law, young people can remain covered under their parents' health insurance policies until age 26, and beginning next year insurers will no longer be able to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions.The act aims to provide health coverage to some 15% of US citizens who lack it and to slow the growth of medical costs.The White House is also due to hold a youth summit on Wednesday, in the latest attempt to promote the law among the young and healthy, a demographic crucial to the strategy of reducing overall health insurance costs.The rallies are part of a multi-pronged effort by the administration to counter the Republican argument that the law has already failed.The website's problems have sent Mr Obama's job approval ratings plunging and threaten to damage his fellow Democrats in next year's congressional elections.Elsewhere in Washington DC on Tuesday, the White House chief of staff told a public policy forum that more than one million new visitors had logged on to healthcare.gov a day earlier.Denis McDonough said the website's new queuing system, used in times of high traffic, worked ""pretty well"".The administration aims to enrol seven million people in insurance plans before the end of March, when all Americans are required to have coverage or pay a fine.But problems persist. Insurers say they are receiving enrolment forms that have errors or are duplicated, while others go missing altogether. ""So far we've been able to deal with these issues because there's been relatively low volume,"" Daniel Durham, of industry lobby group America's Health Insurance Plans, told Reuters news agency.""But now that the floodgates are open... we're going to see a lot more volume and health plans just don't have the personnel to do all [the technical fixes] manually.""On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor accused the administration of trying to cover up the law's problems.""What else are they hiding?"" he asked at a news conference.

Tomas Young has also written a letter to former President George W Bush and ex-Vice-President Dick Cheney, accusing them of being responsible for what happened to him and others injured and killed in Iraq.When President Bush stood on the rubble of Ground Zero just after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and pledged to go after those responsible, Tomas Young, 22, took up the call and joined the US Army.But instead of being deployed to Afghanistan to fight al-Qaeda and its allies, he ended up in Iraq in 2004 following Saddam Hussein's capture by coalition forces.On the fifth day into his deployment, Mr Young's unit came under fire from insurgents in Baghdad. He was hit and his spine was severed.After his return to the US he campaigned from his wheelchair against the conflict and in 2007 was the subject of a documentary, Body of War.But now his condition has deteriorated to such an extent that he wants to put an end to his suffering.""He felt he's gone as far as his physical shell will take him and he is ready to rest,"" his wife, Claudia Cuellar, tells BBC World Service, speaking on his behalf because he has difficulty talking and tires easily.""We accepted a certain level of suffering,"" she says. But last year his pain and discomfort increased dramatically and he grew weary of repeated hospital visits to treat infections and other ailments.""He didn't want to do any more procedures or surgeries,"" Ms Cuellar says.""I felt like I was losing him emotionally and psychologically. I felt that it was just too hard to get through the course of a single day and we had to have the conversation that people have when..."" she said, not finishing her sentence.""I could sense that he was suffering to a level that just wasn't right for us as a couple. I can keep him around for me, but that isn't fair to his journey.""It's not that he wants to die - he simply doesn't want to suffer any more,"" Ms Cuellar says.But she adds: ""He's the person I love the most in the whole world. I will miss this person.""In 2008 Mr Young suffered a pulmonary embolism and an anoxic brain injury due to a reduced oxygen supply that impaired his speech and arm movement. A colostomy operation last year provided only temporary relief.Unable now to eat solid food, he is fed through a tube in his stomach. The skin on his hips is breaking down, exposing raw flesh and bone.""That's probably the toughest one for me, to see that deterioration,"" she says.Medical marijuana eases his discomfort and gives him peace of mind without the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs, Ms Cuellar says.Mr Young says he wrote to Mr Bush and Mr Cheney on behalf of the wounded veterans and relatives of those killed and injured in Iraq.""On every level - moral, strategic, military and economic - Iraq was a failure. And it was you, Mr Bush and Mr Cheney, who started this war. It is you who should pay the consequences.""My day of reckoning is upon me. Yours will come. I hope you will be put on trial. But mostly I hope, for your sakes, that you find the moral courage to face what you have done to me and to many, many others who deserved to live. I hope that before your time on earth ends, as mine is now ending, you will find the strength of character to stand before the American public and the world, and in particular the Iraqi people, and beg for forgiveness.""Cuellar says of the letter: ""We just want to share the story of our struggle, which is the story of the struggle and suffering of so many, so that we can begin to look at the realities of the consequences of war.""Ms Cuellar moved to Kansas City to be with Mr Young after they met while he was in hospital in her hometown, Chicago, in 2008.She says Mr Young, who is virtually bedridden and in hospice care, cannot legally be helped to commit suicide in Missouri and so will have to starve himself to death.He will continue to take food and liquids until their first wedding anniversary on 20 April.

Flapping around his head are a whole flock of chickens coming home to roost. This is all about his greatest achievement - the law for which he will be remembered - the programme nicknamed for him, Obamacare.It is in trouble. He is in trouble.  The sign-up for Obamacare was pitiful. He was forced into holding a news conference of abject apology while Democrats, most notably Bill Clinton, ran as fast as they could away from the president whose poll ratings had just plunged to a new low.It was capped by a savaging from Jon Stewart. Can it get worse than that?I'm reminded of the doyen of spin doctors, Alistair Campbell, when journalists wrote that some speech or other of Tony Blair's was ""the most important of his career"". He laconically agreed it probably was, since the last most important speech of his career. And until the next one. The same is true of Mr Obama's worst week. That news conference was the full-blown humble-pie-eating act. Here's a selection of quotes:""I understand why folks are frustrated.""""I do make apologies for not having executed better over the last several months.""""We and I did not have enough awareness about the problems in the website.""""That's on me.""""That's something I deeply regret.""""I feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them rather than easier.""""When we don't do a good job on the rollout, we're letting them down. And, you know, I don't - I don't like doing that.""""I said early on when I was running, I am not a perfect man and I will not be a perfect president.""""There have been times where I thought we were - got, you know, slapped around a little bit unjustly. This one's deserved, all right? It's on us.""I haven't seen the president squirm like this since his shell-shocked performance after his shellacking in the 2010 mid-terms. Then he wondered aloud how he'd lost the plot and how he could do better. Then his acute distress must have reflected his understanding of just how bad his plight was. When he lost the House, he lost all hope of pushing through the rest of an ambitious progressive agenda. Now his one historic achievement, the one big law he got through before he lost the House, is in grave danger. With it his whole reputation, his legacy. A colleague pointed out that only last week, we - and the rest of the media - were highlighting the hole the Republicans were in. It is true. They are in a mess, and so is Mr Obama. Their problem is about how to win elections, his is about the limits on what you can do after you've won. At the heart of his problem is a plan that is inherently complex and confusing. He decided at the beginning of his presidency that he would never sell a simple government-run scheme.   It would have been even more controversial than Obamacare, it probably wouldn't have got through Congress, but if it had it would have had the huge advantage of simplicity and clarity. Instead the federal government parts of the plan got whittled away. But then when Republican states refused to set up their own programmes, the federal government came back in. Mr Obama is in a hole now because of the technical failure of an already ideological, controversial plan which bewilders most people with its inherent complexity. He has promised that he will ""chip away"" at the problem, and that everything will be much better by the beginning of next month. Democrats will hope these teething problems will fade and be forgotten. But it may not be a ""chipable"" problem. Mr Obama will be under intense scrutiny as we head into the new year and the mid-term elections. If his worst week turns into his worst month, it will be a pretty dismal 2014 for the president. "

Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to repeal the law or eliminate its funding, most recently by refusing to pass a budget in an attempt to force Mr Obama's hand. A subsequent 16-day shutdown of the federal government ended with no major concessions from Mr Obama.""Obamacare costs too much and it's not working the way they promised,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday. ""It's time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort.""Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has also been criticised by Republican lawmakers for declining an invitation to testify about the snags on 24 October. But a spokeswoman for the health department said the secretary would testify at some point.White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday there had been ""for many months and years now a concentrated, concerted effort by critics of Obamacare to undermine it"".""There's clearly some joy being taken in some quarters by the experiences that some Americans have had, frustrating experiences that they've had, in trying to get information about affordable health insurance.""Although the law remains divisive, a recent Gallup poll suggests only 29% of the public favours a complete repeal."

""That's only fair.""House Democratic leaders said they would propose their own plan allowing insurers to renew policies earmarked for cancellation.Meanwhile, Mr Obama met insurance executives on Friday to allay concerns regarding his proposed ""fix"" to the healthcare law.On Thursday, he announced a one-year reprieve for those facing cancellation of their existing coverage.The Republican plan passed on Friday goes one step further - it would allow insurers to sell health coverage to new, as well as existing, customers.Insurers earlier raised doubts over the Obama plan, saying it could ""destabilise the market and result in higher premiums for consumers"".Ahead of Friday's meeting, Mr Obama said he was ""brainstorming"" options and ""soliciting ideas"" from industry leaders on how best to enrol Americans in health plans.The Obama administration is also still working to remedy its malfunctioning healthcare.gov website.It was established by the law to enable consumers who do not get health insurance through their employers or via government benefits to shop for coverage.Glitches have proven so severe that fewer than 27,000 people in 36 US states managed to enrol in healthcare policies in the first month after its October launch.About 79,000 managed to enrol using websites run by the other 14 states and Washington DC."

The future of the legislation is now uncertain.The proposal, already passed by the Texas House of Representatives, was debated in the state Senate on Tuesday.During her filibuster, Sen Davis read testimony and messages from women and others opposing the legislation.She also recited previously suggested changes to the bill and recounted her own life story.Sen Davis was picked to lead the filibuster because she had her first child as a teenager and went on to graduate from Harvard Law School.""I was a poor, uninsured woman, whose only care was provided through that facility. It was my medical home,"" said Sen Davis, 50.   Rules of the debate stipulated she must remain standing, not lean on her desk or take any breaks, even for meals or to use the bathroom. Republicans watched for any slip-up that would allow them to end the filibuster. Supporters of the bill protested at one point that Sen Davis had received help from another lawmaker in adjusting a supportive back brace.Texas Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst, who is Senate president, eventually suspended the filibuster after ruling that she had meandered off topic.Democrats appealed that ruling, sparking a debate over parliamentary rules.As the clock ticked to midnight, Republicans rushed to hold a vote on the bill, amid jeers from pro-choice protesters in the public gallery.""Get them out!"" Republican Senator Donna Campbell shouted to a security guard. ""Time is running out.""But amid the disruption, Lt Gov Dewhurst said he had been unable to sign the bill within deadline following a 19-10 vote. He blamed an ""unruly mob"" in the gallery.He reportedly hinted that the vote could be held again at a second special session.Supporters of the bill say the measures will improve safety standards. It requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.The new law would mean only five of Texas' 42 abortion clinics would be able to remain in operation.But opponents say this would force women to travel hundreds of miles or resort to dangerous methods to obtain a procedure.The US Supreme Court legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, but about a dozen conservative states have enacted laws in recent years that seek to limit the procedure.In March, North Dakota banned abortions once a foetal heartbeat is detected - as early as six weeks - in the most restrictive law of its kind in the US.Earlier this month, the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives in Washington DC passed a bill banning abortions 20 weeks after fertilisation. But the measure is unlikely to become law because Democrats control the US Senate and the White House."

Critics say the provision would force some women to travel hundreds of miles to have an abortion, while supporters say it would protect women's health and the foetus.Among the bill's opponents are the Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Associations and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. On Tuesday, the House state affairs committee heard personal stories from both sides. Some women said they had regretted having an abortion, while others said it had given them a second chance.""In this country, we've forgotten about a big law: 'Thou shall not kill,'"" said bill supporter Dorothy Richardson of the Houston Coalition for Life. Opponent Gay Caldwell told lawmakers women's health is only protected when abortion is legal and safe.""This bill is about women's lives, and I don't think you want to play politics with women's lives,"" she said.The US Supreme Court legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, but about a dozen states have enacted laws in recent years limiting access to the procedure. Some of that state legislation is tied up in court battles."

""Millions more live with the fear that they'll go broke if they get sick. And today, we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear.""While Mr Obama and his supporters in the Democratic Party portray the law as a historic effort to extend healthcare coverage to the millions of Americans who lack it, the law's opponents say it amounts to an unprecedented intrusion into Americans' private lives.The online health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, struggled to meet higher than expected demand on Tuesday, with many users reporting long waiting times.Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters told the Associated Press news agency the agency was ""prepared to make adjustments as needed [to] improve the consumer experience"".Users also reported errors while trying to create accounts and site crashes on the websites.""The first day of something that you know is going to have a lot of bugs, it's not that frustrating,"" Mike Weaver, a self-employed photographer without insurance told the Associated Press. ""If it was the last day to sign up... then I'd be terribly frustrated.""Mr Obama acknowledged the glitches and delays.""We found out that there have been times this morning where the site has been running more slowly than it normally will,"" Mr Obama said. ""The reason is because more than one million people visited healthcare.gov before 7:00 in the morning.""The exchanges will continue to enrol people through the end of the year for healthcare plans slated to begin next year.The opening of the exchanges was the culmination of more than three years of political combat in Washington over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Mr Obama in 2010 and known to both sides as Obamacare.Republicans in Washington and in state capitals across the country have fought hard to undermine or undo the law since its passage, with the US House of Representatives taking dozens of symbolic votes to repeal it or eliminate its funding.A legal challenge led by the law's Republican opponents ended in June 2012 when the Supreme Court validated the law's keystone provision - a requirement that Americans not receiving health coverage from their employers or the government purchase individual plans or pay a fine.That requirement, known as the individual mandate, takes effect in January.The healthcare law was also a central issue in the 2012 presidential election. Republican candidate Mitt Romney vowed to press for its repeal. Mr Obama handily won re-election. On Tuesday, the US government shut non-essential services, keeping more than 700,000 workers at home, when the Democrats who control the Senate refused to agree to Republican demands to repeal the health law or delay the individual mandate.Both Mr Obama and congressional Democrats have said they will not negotiate on Obamacare, with Mr Obama on Monday evening accusing the Republicans of attempting to refight the last election.In spite of the political turmoil in Washington, on Tuesday Americans were able to enrol in insurance plans offered by private companies and ranging in price and level of coverage through exchanges in every state.Sixteen states and Washington DC have opted to operate their own exchanges, while the exchanges in 34 states will be fully or partially run by the federal government.Exchanges will also inform customers of tax subsidies available to ease the cost of the insurance. An estimated six million US citizens are expected to qualify.Customers enrolling under Obamacare will not be covered by the insurance until 1 January however.That corresponds with the start of the individual mandate, as well as consumer protections including a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions.Several Obamacare provisions had taken effect prior to Tuesday, including prescription drug discounts for pensioners, a rule allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance plans up to age 26, a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to children with pre-existing health conditions, and a ban on lifetime limits on health coverage.Another major provision known as the employer mandate - which requires employers with at least 50 full-time workers to provide insurance or incur a $2,000 (£1,320) per employee penalty - has been delayed until 2015. That delay, announced by the Obama administration in July, has been seen as a concession to retailers and other businesses - and an acknowledgement that the health law was not fully ready for implementation."

The 1 October launch of the federal and state marketplace websites was the culmination of more than three years of political combat in Washington over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Mr Obama in 2010 and known to both sides as Obamacare.Considered the largest overhaul of the US healthcare system since the 1960s, it aims to extend health insurance coverage to the estimated 15% of the US population who lack it. Those people receive no coverage from their employers and are not covered by US health programmes for the poor and the elderly.But Healthcare.gov - akin to a shopping website for health insurance plans - has been plagued by glitches, especially long wait times to sign up and serious flaws on the back end where customers' data are processed and sent to insurance companies.Ms Sebelius, appointed secretary of health and human services by Mr Obama in 2009, told the House committee in prepared remarks that more than 20 million people had visited the website since its launch, but acknowledged the experience was ""frustrating"" for many Americans. The Obama administration has declined to say how many Americans have actually enrolled in new policies through the sites, rankling Republicans who accuse it of withholding vital information.Ms Sebelius said the problems were ""fixable"" and that changes had already been made to improve the site's speed and reliability. She said the federal government was working with the numerous contractors who built the site, and that the Obama administration projected it would be fully up and running by the end of November.The committee's senior Democrat, Henry Waxman, acknowledged ""the launch of the new website has not gone well"" but just as with a prescription drug programme for pensioners enacted under Republican President George Bush, the ""early glitches will soon be forgotten"".""We should keep this issue in perspective - the Affordable Care Act is working,"" he said. ""It has been improving the health security of millions of Americans for the past three years.""Republican committee chairman Fred Upton called the website ""inept"", saying that five weeks into enrolment, ""the news seems to get worse by the day"".He also questioned why hundreds of thousands of Americans had received letters from their insurance companies saying their policies were being cancelled - despite past assurances from Mr Obama that people who liked their insurance plans would be able to keep them under the health law.Ms Sebelius rejected that criticism, saying that people whose plans were dropped would have access under the new law to better insurance coverage at comparable rates.And Democrat Frank Pallone, a supporter of the health law, called Republicans' concerns over the cancellation letters a ""red herring"" and said insurance companies were closing ""lousy policies with high prices because they can't compete"".Some Republicans have called for Ms Sebelius' resignation over the issue. They argue the problems with the website that prevent consumers from signing up reflect broader problems with the healthcare law.Republicans view the health law as a costly and inappropriate government intrusion into the healthcare system, and have sought to undo or undermine it at every turn.""Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible,"" Ms Sebelius told the committee after several members asked which contractors and Obama administration officials were responsible for issues.Aside from establishing the healthcare.gov health insurance marketplace website and others run by the states, the law bolsters coverage requirements for insurance firms, mandates that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and offers subsidies to assist in the purchase of the insurance. It also expands eligibility for the Medicaid government health programme for the poor.Amid the fallout, the White House has said it will grant a six-week extension - until 31 March 2014 - in the healthcare law's requirement for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty.Mr Obama is scheduled to speak about the healthcare rollout in the state of Massachusetts on Wednesday afternoon."

And on Thursday, a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed it, ruling the Texas law could take effect on Friday while an appeal is argued in the coming months.Mr Abbott, a Republican, is expected to run for governor of Texas against Democratic State Senator Wendy Davis, who has been an outspoken opponent of the new abortion restrictions. The legislation also bans abortions at the 20th week of pregnancy and requires doctors to perform abortions at special surgical facilities.After the law passed in July, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers in the state sued, arguing the law would force many to close.In his ruling on Monday, Mr Yeakel found the admitting privileges provision ""places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable foetus and is thus an undue burden to her"".In overturning his decision, the court of appeals found the state had provided ""a rational basis"" for the physician hospital privilege requirement, including offering evidence it ""fosters a woman's ability to seek consultation and treatment for complications directly from her physician, not from an emergency room provider"".""This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women,"" Mr Abbott said.Women's health advocates have argued the law will require women in some areas to travel several hours on two days to obtain abortions.""This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion state-wide,"" Planned Parenthood Foundation President Cecile Richards said.""This fight is far from over.""At one clinic near the Texas-Mexico border on Friday, women who had arrived for an initial consultation for abortions on Saturday were told by an administrator they would not be able to go ahead with the procedure.The Associated Press reported some women stayed in the hope that something would change. The clinic's doctor, Dr Lester Minto, said the law's hospital admitting privilege provision prevented him from performing abortions.He said he feared some of the women might ""do drastic things"" if he was unable to terminate their pregnancies.One woman at the clinic told the Associated Press she had already had several children with her husband and the pregnancy was not planned.

Mr Obama said his priority now was to make sure the website worked.As the deadline approached, the controversial HealthCare.gov site was taken down on Friday night for maintenance and upgrades to the software and hardware systems. It was due to go back online on Saturday morning.In an interview with ABC News, President Obama said he still believed his Affordable Care Act would make good on his manifesto promise to deliver affordable health care to Americans.

""Both sides are going to have to think anew.""About 500,000 Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since the 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.Mr Obama began his third and final day in Israel by travelling to the grave of Theodore Herzl, who died in 1904 before his dream of a Jewish homeland was realised.Accompanied by Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he laid a wreath and placed a small rock on the headstone, a Jewish custom.""It is humbling and inspiring to visit and remember the visionary who began the remarkable establishment of the State of Israel,'' he wrote in the visitors' book. ""May our two countries possess the same vision and will to secure peace and prosperity for future generations.''Mr Obama then walked to the grave of Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a right-wing extremist after a peace rally in support of the Oslo Accords in 1995.He again laid a wreath and placed a rock on the headstone, and reportedly told Rabin's children and grandchildren that he had been ""a great man"", adding: ""Sometimes it is harder to embark on peace than to embark on war.""Mr Obama later visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, which he said illustrated the depravity to which man could sink but also served as a reminder of the ""righteous among nations who refused to be bystanders"".""The state of Israel does not exist because of the Holocaust, but with the survival of a strong Jewish state of Israel, such a holocaust will never happen again,"" he added.A sandstorm later grounded the president's helicopter, forcing him to travel from Jerusalem to Bethlehem by road following a brief lunch meeting with Mr Netanyahu.The motorcade's route took Mr Obama through Israel's controversial West Bank barrier, Israeli security sources said. Israel says the barrier is the only way to defend against militant attacks, but Palestinians view the structure as the prelude to the annexation of occupied land.Mr Obama was accompanied on his visit of the Church of the Nativity by President Abbas. Inside, he examined ornate gold icons as a priest read a blessing, according to the AFP news agency.The church was originally built in 399 above a cave traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus and rebuilt after fire in the 6th Century. It is among the holiest sites in Christianity.Later, Mr Obama travelled by road to Tel Aviv before flying on Air Force One to the Jordanian capital Amman, where he will dine with King Abdullah.The two leaders are expected to discuss Jordan's struggle to cope with the influx of more than 350,000 refugees from Syria, the stalled Middle East peace process, and efforts at political reform in the kingdom.Shortly before his departure from Israel, the White House released a statement saying Mr Netanyahu had spoken by telephone to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in an attempt to repair relations.""I am hopeful that today's exchange between the two leaders will enable them to engage in deeper co-operation on this and a range of other challenges and opportunities,"" Mr Obama said."

Ms Rose QC represented former Guantánamo Bay detainee, Binyam Mohamed in his case against the British intelligence services.In 2011, 16 terror suspects, including Mr Mohamed, received a multimillion-pound pay-out after they claimed they had been mistreated by US and British security and intelligence officials.The Justice and Security Bill would create a mechanism allowing court evidence to be heard in secret where there is a need to keep information from the public on grounds of national security.The government has introduced safeguards to the legislation, currently being scrutinised by Parliament, ensuring judges and not ministers decide when so-called closed material proceedings are used.But this was no enough to satisfy Lib Dem members at the conference.Speaking at the podium, Ms Shaw resigned from the party, describing ""secret courts"" as ""shoddy logic"".She told her leader: ""It's not me Nick; it's you.""Ms Shaw said the leadership had ""abandoned liberal values for the privileges of power"".""The Lib Dem leadership have decided that civil liberties is not a red line issue,"" she said. ""I am today resigning from the Liberal Democrats. I am a liberal and I am a democrat and we are against this sort of thing.""But justice minister Lord McNally warned blocking the legislation, which would allow for courts to sit in secret in some civil cases, would mean there was less scrutiny of the security services.They would continue to pay compensation rather than disclose sensitive information in public, causing serious ""reputational damage"".The vote in favour of the emergency motion came shortly ahead of Mr Clegg's closing speech, which argued the Lib Dems were no longer a ""party of protest"" but one of government.But the courts issue has alienated many members, worried the Justice and Security Bill will undermine the openness of justice.Last week, Lord Neuberger, the UK's most senior judge, warned any lawyer or member of the judiciary ""worth his salt"" would be ""troubled"" by the changes.The bill was given its third reading in the Commons, but is expected to face strong opposition in the Lords."

14725	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22543325	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Tougher laws to tackle the threat of dangerous dogs and irresponsible owners do not go far enough, MPs have said.Plans to make it a crime in England and Wales to allow a dog to be dangerously out of control on private property were welcomed by the environment committee.But it criticised a lack of action to address threatening behaviour at an early stage and reduce risk of attacks.The government said anti-social behaviour reforms would give police more powers to deal with irresponsible dog owners.More than 200,000 people a year are estimated to be bitten by dogs in England, based on research for the British Medical Journal.Campaigners say legislation dating back to 1991 has been ineffective in dealing with aggressive animals.The law covers only attacks by dogs in public places and private areas where animals are prohibited from being, such as a neighbour's garden. Ministers want to extend the scope of the law to enable a prosecution to be brought against anyone whose dog injures someone or acts aggressively in a private place where they are permitted to be, such as a home. There have been eight fatal attacks in private residences since 2007, most recently in March, when teenager Jade Anderson was mauled to death in Wigan when she visited a friend's house.Police have no plans to prosecute anyone in relation to her death, saying there is no evidence a crime has been committed and that they are bound by the law.The cross-party committee said existing laws had ""comprehensively failed"" to deal with the threat from dangerous dogs and welcomed the proposed extension - which could also see maximum penalties increased from a six-month jail sentence to two years. The government's plans would also criminalise attacks on assistance dogs while exempting homeowners from prosecution in the event of an attack on a trespasser.However, the MPs questioned whether they would apply in cases where someone had trespassed with ""innocent intentions"" - such as a child recovering a ball from a neighbour's garden.The committee also expressed concerns about how incidents on surrounding land, such as gardens or paths, and outside dwellings such as sheds would be treated in law. It said the courts should be allowed to take into account the actions of responsible homeowners who took ""reasonable precautions"" to stop their animals from causing harm, such as putting up warnings outside properties and securing fences, as opposed to those behaving ""negligently"".The committee also said homeowners ""needed assurance"" that they would be protected in the event of attacks on trespassers when they were not at home.It was the police's view, the MPs said, that the public felt a dog left on its own had a role in protecting the property and this should form the basis of a legal defence when attacks occurred during owners' absence.On the issue of preventing future attacks, the committee said there was a lack of action and the proposals would actually limit council powers to stop animals from entering certain areas.It is calling on ministers to reconsider the case for Dog Control Notices - introduced in Scotland in 2011 - which give local authorities powers to tackle all aspects of dog-related crime such as illegal breeding and the ownership and training of so-called ""status dogs"".The committee argues that ministers must ""provide law enforcers with tailored powers to tackle aggressive dogs before they injure people and other animals"".Other recommendations include licensing for dog breeders producing a minimum of two litters - as opposed to five now - and a code of practice covering online sales of animals.The British Veterinary Association echoed the MPs' concerns that the proposals ""did not go far enough"".""Instead of making more mistakes with hastily made legislation we are asking the government to think again and reconsider introducing Dog Control Notices,"" its president Peter Jones said.And Steve Goody, of pet charity the Blue Cross said that without Dog Control Notices ""enforcement officers will remain powerless to tackle irresponsible owners and antisocial behaviour with dogs before attacks take place"". A government spokesman said it was taking ""urgent action"" to protect the public from dangerous dogs. ""We are changing the law so that owners can be prosecuted for dog attacks on private property and our anti-social behaviour reforms will give the police and local agencies more effective powers to deal with owners who fail to take responsibility for their dogs."""
14726	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18114406	News	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Ministers are planning laws to tackle dangerous dogs. It's a problem that's worried our leaders since Roman times:Dogs were a feature of Roman life, used as weapons of war and kept as pets. The ancient 'lex Pesolania' could be seen as a forerunner to the Dangerous Dogs Act - making owners culpable for the behaviour of their dog. In the third century BC, unruly dogs were apparently such a problem that a law was passed that ensured owners were responsible for any injuries or damage the animal caused.""If a dog was in a square or public road and not tied up in the daytime and did mischief the owner was liable,"" according to the late Liberal MP and Roman historian Henry John Roby.A nineteenth century study of the British dog seems to suggest attacks on people have been a continuing cause for concern. According to George Jesse, dog-related fines were introduced under Alfred the Great. The law, which could date as far back as 849 AD, said: ""If a dog tear or bite a man, for the first misdeed let six shillings be paid."" Fines increased for repeat offences.  Under the act, Victorian Londoners could be fined up to 40 shillings if they let their dog loose ""in any thoroughfare or public place"".
        Anyone with an ""unmuzzled ferocious dog"" that they allowed ""to attack, worry, or put in fear any person, horse or other animal"" was liable.Dog owners in the rest of England faced the 40 shilling fine - or a new punishment of two weeks in prison - when the  
          
 
          Town Police Clauses Act of 1847
 extended the law to ""every person... in any street"" if their dog was deemed to be dangerous and not on a lead.
        The first piece of legislation giving the authorities power to seize a dog was passed almost a quarter of a century later. Described by the government as ""an act to provide further protection against dogs"", the  
          
 
          1871 Dogs Act
 gave a police chief the power to take a dog from its owner and either put it down or sell it.
        But then as now, the law had its opponents. The Lord Chancellor worried that an owner might still be liable even if they ""had no previous knowledge of any mischievous propensity in the dog"". What if a ""playful dog, intending no mischief, might tear a man's trousers?"" he asked peers. And while the act is still widely used by the authorities against dog owners today, it does not - short of confiscation - allow the courts to punish the owners of dangerous dogs.The government argue that because the act is not part of criminal law, the standard of proof is lower and - unlike the infamous 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act - it can be used to impose controls or confiscation of dangerous dogs where an offence has taken place on private property.  ""It is particularly appropriate for action on behalf of people such as postmen and women who are regularly at risk from dogs in front gardens,"" according to the Department for Food and Rural Affairs.Until 1987 dog owners were required to buy a 37p 'dog licence'. But the licence was widely ignored and when the first Dangerous Dogs Act was introduced, ministers said they would not reintroduce it. The 1989 act increased the 100-year-old powers available to the court - giving magistrates the power to disqualify perpetrators from owning a dog.Twenty-one years ago this week, six-year-old Rucksana Khan was playing in a park near her home in Bradford when she was savaged by a pit bull terrier and taken to hospital with critical head and chest injuries. The case - which followed 10 others in 1991 read out to Parliament by Bradford MP Bob Cryer - prompted the then home secretary to introduce a bill promising ""to rid the country of the menace of these fighting dogs"".Four types of dog were  
          
 
          banned under the act
, which makes it an offence for an owner to allow any dog ""to be dangerously out of control"". 
        But the legislation, which was rushed through following public outcry about the early 1990s attacks, has been criticised as not fit for purpose. Critics say there are no breeds predisposed to violence and that the act does nothing to deal with the root cause of dog attacks - the owners.""It's punitive rather than controlling,"" said Trevor Cooper, a solicitor who specialises in dog law. ""It tries to weed out certain types of dog but you can't prejudge a dog's behaviour. ""It's down to the way the dog has been brought up. There's no point continuously punishing people without dealing with the actual cause.""Mr Cooper, a legal adviser to the Dogs Trust, said the system of dog control notices in place in Scotland and Northern Ireland should be extended to England and Wales. This would be far more effective in preventing dog attacks as it would give the council the power to order owners to leash or muzzle their dogs and to take training courses, he said. Another problem in England and Wales is that the act does not cover attacks on private property.And in the last few years there have been a number of cases of babies, children and adults attacked and often killed in gardens and homes where, legally, the dog had every right to be.There are an estimated 5,000 dog attacks on British Telecom, Royal Mail and Parcel Force staff in England every year. Postal workers union the CWU estimate that 70% of the attacks on their staff happen on private property - so would not have been covered by the act.Conservative Home Office minister Tom Sackville told MPs in early 1997 that the Dangerous Dogs Act had ""achieved its main objectives"". He said the law had reduced the number of pit bulls and raised dog ownership standards. Rules were to be relaxed and courts were given more flexibility to decide whether a dangerous dog had to be put down. Although there was a change of government with Labour winning the 1997 election, they passed into law the measures the Conservatives had earlier proposed. Authorities were also given the power to impose controls on the offending dog - muzzling, leashing or neutering.Local authorities were given the power to issue orders to dog owners to control dog fouling, ensure dogs are kept on a lead and to keep them away from certain areas. The idea was to replace local byelaws to protect children's playgrounds, beaches or picnic areas from unruly dogs and their mess.Breach of a control order can attract a maximum fine of £1,000.Dog attacks appear to be on the rise. The number of people convicted for dangerous dog offences rose almost 40% between 2009 and 2010.And it's not just that the police might be giving the issue more attention. Dog-related hospital admissions have more than doubled from 2,915 in 1997 to 6,118 in 2010. In 2009 alone, dog attacks cost the NHS £3.3 million in treatment costs. Ministers have suggested four measures in an attempt to tackle the problem:Compulsory microchippingExtending existing laws to cover private propertyIncreasing the fee owners have to pay if they want their dog exempt from the government list of prohibited typesAllow owners to hold on to their dogs until the outcome of court proceedingsTrevor Cooper of the Dogs Trust said: ""The government has the chance to introduce legislation and and think of new ways to deal with a very old problem. This is a missed opportunity."""

Mr Thaksin, who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, was convicted of abuse of power in 2008 and sentenced in absentia to a prison term of two years.He denied the charges, calling them politically motivated, and in the years following the coup remained popular with poor and rural voters, whom he had championed. He has been living in self-imposed exile in Dubai.Up until this month, the government was only considering an amnesty for ordinary people and not the leaders.But a parliamentary committee dominated by Mr Thaksin's party has now widened the scope of the amnesty, apparently opening the way for his conviction for abuses of power to be overturned, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. Thailand's colour-coded political divide has been muted in the past two years, but it looks like the two sides are now lining up for yet another round in a battle that hinges on a single issue: whether the abrasive and charismatic Mr Thaksin should ever be allowed to play a leading role in the country again, our correspondent adds.After the first post-coup polls saw Mr Thaksin's allies elected, anti-Thaksin yellow-shirt protesters subsequently shut down Bangkok's main international airport for several days.The Democratic Party leader, former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, then formed a government, which in 2010 was hit by more than two months of street protests by red-shirt demonstrators in Bangkok that left more than 90 people dead, including protesters, civilians and soldiers.In August, thousands of people also took to the streets as the bill was being debated in parliament.

From mid-2014 the clause becomes invalid, so the quotas can in theory only last for 12 months but Switzerland is due to hold two referendums aimed at limiting immigration.The limits on the eight newer EU member states were first introduced last year. From 1 May, the number of long-term residence permits granted to immigrants from those countries will be capped at at total of 2,180 for 12 months. The states concerned are Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. From the same date, long-term residence permits for the 17 older EU states will be capped at 53,700 for 12 months.Immigration to Switzerland from Bulgaria and Romania - the two newest EU states - is severely restricted, and may remain so for years to come.In a statement from her office, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the new quotas disregarded ""the great benefits that the free movement of persons brings to the citizens of both Switzerland and the EU"".The vast majority of immigrants to Switzerland come from traditional EU members like Germany, Spain, Portugal and Italy, the BBC's Imogen Foulkes reports from Berne.It is thought that Portuguese seeking work will be hardest hit, she adds.The Swiss government has come under pressure from both the right-wing People's Party, and the Green Liberal Party, which say immigration has reached unsustainable levels, our correspondent says.Switzerland has low unemployment, high salaries, and a safe currency. A government statement said the number of people arriving in Switzerland had exceeded the number leaving by up to 80,000 in recent years.Limiting work permits ""can help to make immigration more acceptable to society"", the statement added."

Why else summon our MPs to return tomorrow when they were due to be back on Monday? All the signs are that the UK government will back the strike and British forces will play some limited role in it. Ten years after Iraq, what is remarkable is the apparent degree of consensus between the three main party leaders. When they met yesterday Messrs Cameron, Clegg and Miliband agreed that the use of chemical weapons could not be ignored; that military action could be justified in order to deter a repeat, provided that it was limited, did not trigger wider involvement in Syria's civil war and was legal. This, despite the fact that both Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband owe their position, at least in part, to their opposition to the war in Iraq. However, the public appear to remain deeply affected by what happened a decade ago.The latest YouGov poll shows opposition to military strikes running at two to one. Indeed, there is wide opposition to doing anything at all.*This may be being fuelled by the warnings of senior figures in all parties as well as former military men who are questioning whether there is any such thing as a limited military intervention or one that does not suck the western powers deeper into the Syrian crisis. Even though there is no debate between the party leaders about whether in principle to attack Syria, the questions of when, what and how could still divide them and deny David Cameron the parliamentary majority he needs tomorrow. When the Labour leader spoke on camera yesterday he did not talk about the need to involve the UN.In part, perhaps, because Ed Miliband knows as well as anyone else that Russia has consistently vetoed any resolution that criticises its Syrian allies. However, this morning Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, has been stressing the need, not just for the involvement of the UN Security Council, but for them to see the evidence of the UN weapons inspectors - something which may take a long time. The US government has dismissed the need to wait. They argue that the inspections may be worthless not only because days have elapsed since chemical weapons were used but also because the UN is not expected to report on which side may have used them. Nevertheless, Labour are toying with the possibility of tabling an amendment to the government's resolution which would back action but call for a delay until the UN's processes have been gone through.In the past few minutes they have also called on the government to publish the legal basis on which it is acting before tomorrow's Parliamentary vote. The Lib Dems would be very uncomfortable if Labour were able to position themselves as the more internationalist party. Pressure would grow on Nick Clegg to take the same position.With the potential support of Tory and Lib Dem rebels plus the Scots and Welsh Nationalists, Labour could put the government's majority in peril. Thus, what is said in the next 24 hours in Westminster, in Washington and at the UN in New York will really matter. Many MPs will only decide how to vote once they have heard the evidence of the Assad regime's involvement, the legal basis for an attack, the UN process to be followed and the timing of any military action. A decade on from Iraq, a British prime minister finds himself under pressure thanks to the desire of an American president for swift military action. What an irony that this time around it is a president from the left and a prime minister from the right. MPs on all sides find themselves considering not just the merits of reacting to the use of chemical weapons; not just their view of our interests in the Syrian conflict; not just their trust in the Obama and Cameron governments. They are also wrestling with what they and their parties did or did not do over Iraq.* Admittedly the questions were asked before any leader had made the case for action

The ICC accuses him of using child soldiers and the UN says he controls several mines in the east of the country.The group briefly seized control of the city of Goma last November after carving out an area for themselves in North Kivu province.DR Congo's government and rebels have been holding talks in Uganda aimed at reaching an agreement on a range of issues. In January, the rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire.An earlier attempt to reach a deal collapsed in December after the group accused President Joseph Kabila of failing to honour a deal to integrate rebels into the army.The region's mineral riches have been plundered by numerous groups and countries over the past 15 years and little has been spent on DR Congo's infrastructure.

14778	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23980533	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Every day the possibility of the US and France leading military action against Syria edges closer. If it happens, it will mark another twist in a long and complex relationship.Barack Obama and Francois Hollande were the only two leaders at the G20 meeting in Moscow committed to using force against Syria. They make a pretty unexpected coalition of the willing, when you remember the American anti-French backlash over Iraq a decade ago, when french fries were off the menu and French wine down the plug-hole.But the image of the two presidents with fortunes entwined provides a neat historical symmetry. After all, if it wasn't for France then George Washington might today only be a name known to avid history students.In 1778, a fledgling nation called the United States made its first alliance, an event that many experts believe altered the course of its war of independence with Britain.The treaty signed by Francophile Benjamin Franklin in Paris meant France recognised the United States as a sovereign nation and was committed to the defence of its new ally. In effect, it brought France into the war against its long-standing enemy, Britain.""It was the first formal alliance for the US, this treaty of alliance and friendship and it probably made the difference between victory and defeat,"" says Gregory Urwin, a professor of history at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""They were already providing covert aid, shipping weapons and munitions to Americans through front trading companies, but once they entered the war it changed the entire dynamic because Britain could no longer count on mastery of the sea."" Every American is taught about the famous victory at Yorktown and the heroics of a dashing Frenchman, the Marquis de Lafayette, the young idealist who joined the Americans before his country had even entered the war. But it's another Frenchman, the Count of Rochambeau, who is the real French hero, says Urwin, because as commander of the French forces he had a decisive influence on Washington's triumph at Yorktown.The friendship between the two nations didn't last long. France expected American assistance in the wars that followed the French Revolution but Washington was reluctant to get drawn into a European conflict in the 1790s and chose neutrality, ignoring the terms of the treaty and sparking a quasi-war with France.But the mythology of Lafayette was set in stone in 1824 when the park adjoining the White House on its northern side was renamed Lafayette Square, in a city designed by another Frenchman, Pierre L'Enfant. Lafayette was further immortalised in World War I when, on American Independence Day in 1917, US troops paraded through Paris and stopped at his tomb, where at his request he was buried in soil brought from the US. The shouts of ""Lafayette, we are here!"" symbolised a country repaying its debt 140 years later.By then, the Statue of Liberty was already fast becoming one of New York City's most visible landmarks. It was a gift from ""the French people"" in 1886 that expressed the two countries' shared values.The second world war of the 20th Century offered another chance for American soldiers to be warmly welcomed on French soil. In Normandy, the Stars and Stripes can still be seen fluttering from homes on the anniversary of the D-Day landings. But there persisted a belief among some Americans that the French were too ready to give up without a fight, a sentiment that entered popular culture in a Simpsons episode in 1995 that characterised the French as ""cheese-eating surrender monkeys"".This phrase was further popularised on the eve of the Iraq War, when France refused to support a US-led invasion, sparking a backlash against all things Gallic. The most memorable expression of this came when a restaurant in North Carolina, now closed, changed ""french fries"" to ""freedom fries"" on its menu. Others followed, including the canteen at the House of Representatives. The presidential plane Air Force One served ""stuffed freedom toast topped with strawberries,"" instead of the usual French toast.France was added to a new ""Axis of Weasel"" with Germany, by satirist Scott Ott. After coining the phrase in his blog, it was on the front page of the New York Post two days later. But Ott doesn't believe a joint operation against Syria will mark a new love affair with France. On Iraq and on Syria, the French have been on the wrong side of the argument, he says.""So France will find itself against American public opinion again,"" he says, adding that he loves France but makes a distinction between its government and country.French fries were soon back on the menu but many Americans were embarrassed by the headlines it generated around the world.""Iraq was a ridiculous over-reaction to what could be considered a rational response by the French government and French people,"" says Steve Smith, an American who writes about France for Rick Steves' guidebooks.American tourism to France dropped, he says, either because Americans were angry with the French or embarrassed. Some that did visit pretended they were Canadian. ""There was a huge drop in business. The number of tours to the country and guide books sold fell off the table, although it recovered years later.""He thinks Americans love France but don't really understand the French. ""There's such a fundamental difference in outlook. The French are driven not by how much money you make but what's on the menu for dinner tonight and what you are reading."" Americans will ask early on what do you do for a living but the French won't, he says. And an American suspicion that French people are lazy exists because the French are more appreciative of leisure time.""They also expect more from government. The French are more willing to sacrifice the rights of the individual for the good of the community.""The French played a leading role in Libya but it's the prospect of the two nations standing shoulder to shoulder on Syria that has ministers gushing. US Secretary of State John Kerry has talked fondly of the nation's ""oldest ally"" and spoke French as he made the case for military action while in Paris. One security analyst in Washington said: ""We're all over here learning French, saying 'Vive la France!' That's the new thing.""The rapprochement between the two leaders over Syria will matter to public perceptions, says Smith, because Americans love it when other people are on their side.""I feel it, listening to Hollande's words on the radio. And I think the average American is listening and will pay attention.""The man who took french fries off the menu at the House of Representatives says it's ironic that the French are now leading the charge. ""What a turnaround,"" says former Congressman Bob Ney, who maintains that what he did was a gesture to the troops in response to the heated anti-Americanism coming out of Paris at the time.And then, with a joking reference to the British, he adds: ""Maybe we will have to ban fish and chips now.""You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

Meanwhile, the former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, has begun a protest fast against the state's division.Telangana would comprise 10 districts of the southern state, including the city of Hyderabad.In recent years, there have been protests for and against the creation of India's 29th state.Backers of the new state say the area has been neglected by the government.Opponents are unhappy that Hyderabad, home to many major information technology and pharmaceutical companies, would become a shared state capital.Power generation in Andhra Pradesh has been reduced by 4000MW as several thermal and hydel power generating plants have stopped working. Life in at least 13 districts has been badly hit with power cuts closing cash machines, petrol pumps and cable TV services.Nearly 50 train services have been cancelled or curtailed. Visakhapatnam airport and several major hospitals across the state have also been affected. Unscheduled power cuts have started in the state capital and India's sixth biggest city, Hyderabad.The power supply to the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu has also been affected.Power sector workers say their strike will continue until the decision to divide Andhra Pradesh is withdrawn. India's cabinet approved the setting up of the new state at a meeting on Thursday evening.Soon after the announcement, those against the decision staged rallies, held protests and called a 48-hour strike in parts of the state that shut down schools, colleges, public transport and businesses.Four federal ministers from Andhra Pradesh also offered their resignations - but they were not accepted.Meanwhile, violent protests have been reported from the town of Vijayanagaram, where a curfew was imposed on Saturday.Telangana, with a population of 35 million, comprises 10 of Andhra Pradesh's 23 districts. Hyderabad will be included in the new state, although for the first 10 years it will serve as the joint capital of the two states.The final decision on a new state lies with the Indian parliament. The state assembly must also pass a resolution approving the creation of the new state.Correspondents say the timing of the announcement is linked to general elections due early next year. Recent opinion polls have shown that the Congress party is struggling in the state, which has 42 parliamentary seats.The move to create Telangana has sparked similar demands in the states of West Bengal and Assam.

Then there is the narrative of failure and criticism that any leader can probably expect after four-and-a-half years in power, and which is manifesting itself in South Africa with protests planned by various prominent groups, with a particular focus on American economic and foreign policies. There has been criticism back home too that Mr Obama's three-country trip - heavy on presidential security - is costing too much. And across Africa - while there is an appreciation that America's leader has had plenty on his plate elsewhere, with the financial crisis and the turmoil in the Middle East - there is also a niggling belief that this trip has come a little late in his presidency, and that with Chinese investment flooding in, the US no longer carries quite such clout on the continent.Nonetheless, in a region increasingly willing and able to engage with the world on an equal - and business-orientated - footing, Mr Obama's visit is still generating plenty of interest.""It's good for Africa that President Obama is coming,"" said Jeff Nemeth, the South African head of the US car manufacturing giant Ford. ""He's been on record as saying that Africa is potentially the next economic success story, and his coming here serves to cement that vision."" Ford's output here has almost doubled in three years.""The economic boom in sub-Saharan Africa feels real to me,"" said Mr Nemeth, who is hoping that President Obama can help nudge governments on the continent to ""focus on things that will drive economic growth… education, infrastructure support, good governance and good financial systems"".China's leaders make many more visits to Africa these days than they used to - and the deals they sign generate plenty of headlines here. But there is still something much more intimate about a visit by an American president - particularly one with an African heritage.  ""I'd like to tell him: 'Look at us - there is hope,'"" said Zineb Oulmakki, a Moroccan student at the African Leadership Academy outside Johannesburg.""There are a lot of prospects for this continent.""There will be a lot of growth - I'm certain of that. Soon we will not be reliant on aid. We will be a major leader in the global economic context.""Ethiopian student Eyerusalem Assefa said: ""We worry a bit about China. They don't give good salaries sometimes. It must be a win-win situation with no-one being exploited.""As for the idea that China and the US are battling for control of the continent's resources, Mr Nemeth said he had no sense of that, and stressed instead what he saw as the advantages of US businesses. ""We have a very strong sense of good governance, and that's what American companies bring and it gives us a space in business that is somewhat unique,"" he said.""We can generate returns in a way that we believe is more supportive to the communities and countries in which we work. ""In the long run, people want to work at a place that has integrity, and people want to live in a country that has integrity, and as the middle class grows and becomes more involved in the governance and politics, they'll demand that too - it's just the way it evolves.""For Kenyan student Maimuna Abdi Yussuf, the visit is a good opportunity for the continent.""We're ready to take Africa to the next level,"" he said.""We need collaboration between America's entrepreneurs and ours."""

Philip Gordon, the US assistant secretary for European affairs in the State Department, was asked about the possibility of a UK referendum ahead of a meeting with Europe minister David Lidington in London.Mr Gordon told journalists that the UK would always be a key ally of the US and that ""what is in the UK's interests is up to the UK"".But he added: ""We have a growing relationship with the EU as an institution, which has an increasing voice in the world, and we want to see a strong British voice in that EU. That is in America's interests. We welcome an outward-looking EU with Britain in it.""Discussing the often ""inward-looking"" history of EU negotiations, Mr Gordon said that ""referendums have often turned countries inward"". ""The more the EU reflects on its internal debate, the less it is able to be unified,"" he said.""I'm not going to imagine an EU which ever buried any internal debates... but it is best for everyone, we think, when leaders have the time to be able to focus on common challenges rather than spending their time on internal workings.""BBC chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a ""significant development"" in the debate over Europe ahead of Mr Cameron's speech and showed a measure of disquiet in Washington over the ""direction of travel"" that the UK may be taking.Earlier on Tuesday, 10 of the UK's leading business figures warned Mr Cameron not to put membership of the EU ""at risk"" in negotiations over the country's relationship with Brussels.Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ""On the same day that top British business leaders fired a warning shot across the bows of the prime minister, a senior White House official has also signalled concerns about the possibility of Britain leaving the EU. ""There is today a real risk of Britain sleepwalking towards exit because of a prime minister motivated more by the need for party unity than by the interests of the country.""But, in a message on Twitter, Conservative MP Douglas Carswell cast doubt on the US intervention. ""A US official believes UK should continue to be ruled by EU officials. Hardly surprising - it's how officials think.""Fellow Conservative Richard Ottaway, who is chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said the comments were a ""bit unexpected"" and ""the mood of the nation"" was in favour of holding a referendum at some point in the future.""It is too late to say we are not going to hold a referendum because the US does not want us to have one,"" he told the BBC.While he favoured the UK remaining within the EU, he believed that asking the public to decide would help ""clear the air"" and he trusted the British public to reach a ""sensible"" decision. Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party - which campaigns for the UK to leave the EU - said: ""We said no to America over Vietnam and we'll say no to them over the EU if the people get their say.""And, in an editorial, the Financial Times said a future government should hold an ""in-out"" referendum once the UK had ""codified"" its new relationship with the eurozone.

About a million people were killed in the civil war that raged in Mozambique after it achieved independence from Portugal in 1975.  Mozambique's economy has been booming since the civil war ended. Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga said that government soldiers had bombarded the Sathunjira base in central Sofala province with heavy weapons before occupying it on Monday.""Peace is over in the country... The responsibility lies with the Frelimo government because they didn't want to listen to Renamo's grievances,"" Mr Mazanga told Reuters news agency.The attack was an attempt to assassinate Mr Dhlakama but he managed to escape to an undisclosed location, Mr Mazanga said.In a statement, Renamo blamed President Armando Guebuza for the attack.""This irresponsible attitude of the commander-in-chief of the defence and security forces puts an end to the Rome peace deal,"" it said.The BBC's Jose Tembe in the capital, Maputo, says Renamo's statement suggests that it plans to go back to war, but it has denied this in the past. Defence ministry spokesman Cristovao Chume said government forces had taken control of the base in response to an earlier attack on an army post by Renamo fighters.He confirmed that Mr Dhlakama had fled.Mr Chume and Mr Mazanga did not give any casualty figures. Mozambique's Frelimo government has repeatedly accused Renamo of dragging the country back to war, an allegation it denies. In April, at least five people were killed in central Mozambique after Renamo members attacked a police post.A force of about 300 Renamo men has remained armed since the peace accord, despite efforts to integrate them into the army or police force.Mr Dhlakama has said he needs his own personal bodyguards, and the men usually stay in his bush camp in the Gorongosa mountains.After the civil war ended, Mr Dhlakama moved out of the camp to live in Maputo and later in the northern Nampula province  But he returned to the mountains last year, saying he needed to be close to his men who were feeling ignored. Mozambique is due to hold local elections in November, and presidential and parliamentary elections next year.Mr Guebuza's Frelimo party has governed Mozambique since independence in 1975.Renamo, which was formed around the same time, was backed by the white minority governments in neighbouring South Africa and what is now Zimbabwe.

""The Israeli conquerors, these investors, should look for another country in the world for themselves because Hungary is not for sale,"" party chairman Gabor Vona told the rally, according to Reuters news agency.Marton Gyongyosi said Hungary had ""become subjugated to Zionism, it has become a target of colonisation while we, the indigenous people, can play only the role of extras"".Last year, Mr Gyongyosi had sparked outrage by saying all government officials of Jewish origin should be officially listed, as they might be a ""national security risk"".Some of those taking part in the rally were wearing the black uniform of Jobbik's banned paramilitary wing, the Hungary Guard, which has been accused of vigilante action against Roma (Gypsy) communities.Prime Minister Viktor Orban had ordered police to ban the march, but a Budapest court overruled the ban, saying it had been based on ""unfounded presumptions"".Mr Orban instead instructed the interior ministry to use all lawful means to prevent the event, which goes against the constitution"".Security was tight around the rally, with police blocking several streets, but there were no reports of unrest.The WJC usually hosts its assembly in Jerusalem, but has chosen Hungary this year to highlight what it says is growing anti-Semitism in Europe. The focus of its summit this year will be on the ""alarming rise of neo-Nazi political parties and anti-Semitic incidents in several European countries, including Hungary"", it says on its website.Spokesman Michael Thaidigsmann said the Jobbik rally was a ""worrying sign that these people express their anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli ideology in such a public way""."

""It's the long, dark shadow of Iraq,"" he says. ""They got sold a bill of goods before - and it went real bad.""He says Iraq was a mistake but Syria is different. The intelligence on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government's use of chemical weapons is based on ""multiple sources that paint a very clear picture"", he says. For that reason, he believes, the US should do something.He says Americans should draw lessons not from the war in Iraq, but from the Nato military intervention in the Balkans in the 1990s.""Limited air strikes,"" he says. ""And by the way, it worked.""He believes that condemning the use of chemical weapons but declining to do anything about it will embolden Mr Assad and others. He supports the president's plan to launch a military strike on Syria.Representative Tim Walz of Minnesota opposes a military strike, illustrating that support and opposition for US action do not follow party lines.Mr Walz has an unusual perspective: a retired senior non-commissioned officer in the national guard, he has been to Damascus with a congressional delegation - and met Mr Assad.""He was polished and calm,"" says Mr Walz. Mr Walz says Mr Assad is a difficult man to persuade. And he thinks Mr Obama's plan for a military strike is a mistake, and says the US should exhaust all available options before resorting to a military strike.""How is the security of the US and our allies enhanced by this?"" Mr Walz asks. ""And what happens afterwards?"" Mr Walz said he had told his 12-year-old daughter that Mr Assad's use of chemical weapons had killed and wounded children.""She said, 'Our bombs hurt children, too.' She asked, 'Why don't we have a plan to get the children out?'"" He said he feared US military planners were not taking sufficient care to avoid civilian casualties, especially children.""There was a little bit on collateral damage, but it was all antiseptic military-speak,"" he says about a recent briefing. ""I want a better solution"" than an air strike.Senator Christopher Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said: ""Congress has repeatedly condemned and acted to outlaw the use of chemical weapons, and I believe it is in the national security interest of the US to take decisive action to respond to this attack and attempt to deter the future use of chemical weapons, whether in Syria or elsewhere in the world."" Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma said: ""The Administration owes it to Congress and to the American people to lay out how they will fund their military action.""Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying: ""I support the president's decision. But as far as I'm concerned, we should strike in Syria today.""Representative Peter King, a New York Republican, said: ""The president doesn't need 535 members of Congress to enforce his own red line.""Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement: ""I continue to oppose introducing US troops into this conflict, and I continue to believe that seeking congressional approval of military action is called for.""Representative Trey Radel, a Republican from Florida, issued a statement: ""The administration needs to make its case, putting #AmericaFirst. They will also need to answer questions on the national security threat facing America, how we prevent our troops from getting dragged into a civil war and how we are going to prevent the loss of American lives."" Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican from Michigan, was quoted by the New York Times as saying: ""This is really about the credibility of the United States of America standing up for an anti-proliferation and use of chemical and biological weapons.""  Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican, said: ""The President still has yet to articulate a clear objective, what US national interests are at stake, what our strategy will be, and what our contingency plans are for all possible outcomes. I hope these things become more clear as we debate the appropriate course of action in Syria over the coming days."" "

Tuesday's vote is the first in a series of stages the proposed bill must pass.It will allow for a termination where three medics unanimously agree that a suicidal woman is at risk of taking her life because of her continuing pregnancy.If passed it will be the first legislation allowing limited abortion in Ireland.One hundred and thirty eight members of the Irish Parliament voted to give the controversial bill a second reading and move the legislation to the committee stage, while 24 voted against.Four members of Fine Gael, the main government party, defied the party whip by voting against the bill.As a result, Billy Timmins, Peter Mathews, Brian Walsh and Terence Flanagan have been expelled from the parliamentary party.Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín also voted against the government's proposal, in defiance of his party.A Sinn Féin spokesman said his decision to do so was regarded as a serious breach of party rules and he would face disciplinary action, which has yet to be decided.In a statement, Mr Tóibín said: ""Its is with great sadness that I have had to separate from my party on this, but I cannot vote for a medical evidence free bill that will result in the death and disablement of children.""I am committed fully to the republican project of unity, equality and prosperity and I hope that I get an opportunity to put my energies into the republican project again.""Anti-abortion campaigners believe the bill will lead to more widespread abortion, while many on the pro-choice side say the legislation is too restrictive in only allowing a termination where there is a credible threat of suicide."

Johann Lamont said the current council tax freeze was not working. It comes as an academic advising Labour on how to reduce public spending branded the council tax freeze a ""major problem"" for councils. Professor Arthur Midwinter said it was an ""inefficient use of public money"". The academic told the Scotland on Sunday newspaper by failing to ring-fence some anti-poverty funds, the Scottish government had allowed money to be swallowed up elsewhere as councils tried to patch over cuts.""The result is that about £1bn of targeted spend on poverty has disappeared,"" he warned.Some policies, such as the council tax freeze and fee-free prescriptions, benefited middle and upper income households, he argued.On the BBC's Sunday Politics, Ms Lamont said she would need to look at Prof Midwinter's report in detail. However, she called for a discussion on how to fund local authorities in Scotland, saying the council tax was ""discredited"".Ms Lamont said the freeze in the cost of the council tax, which has been in place since 2007 and looks set to continue until 2017, was underfunded by government and had hit local services.She said: ""I want a discussion not where the parties get dividing lines between each other but come together and address the challenge of how do you properly build a confidence in the way you raise taxes locally?""A spokesman for First Minister Alex Salmond said: ""This is a massive own goal by Johann Lamont.""Voters will be shocked by her announcement that Labour would scrap the council tax freeze.""A poll published on Sunday showed the SNP government's council tax freeze is backed by 82% of voters, with only 9% opposed.""75% of Labour's own voters back the freeze.""This proves how out of touch with ordinary people Ms Lamont is.""The SNP also accused Ms Lamont of trying to rewrite history by claiming she had not used the expression ""something for nothing"" in relation to people in Scotland benefiting from universal services.In a speech in September last year Ms Lamont questioned universal benefits which could see wealthy people receiving tuition fees and prescriptions for free.She told party members in Edinburgh it was time to end a ""something for nothing"" culture.She said that taxes would have to rise or services would be cut in order to maintain popular but expensive SNP pledges on areas such as the council-tax freeze and personal care for the elderly.On Sunday, Ms Lamont told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""It is a reflection of the cartoon politics that the SNP misrepresent and scaremonger about what Labour has said.""I have never said that some people get something for nothing.""What I have said is that you have to look at both what you spend money on and what are the consequences of that.""It is not acceptable to say we have free personal care when people are living with the experience of less than 15 minute visits."" SNP MSP Linda Fabiani said: ""She appeared to deny that she had ever used the expression 'something for nothing' - and the entire 'something for nothing' speech has been airbrushed from the Labour Party's website.""But Ms Lamont did say it. It was the central part of what was described as a major speech made in September last year. ""At the time it was suggested this could become a disastrous approach for her, as Labour adopted the Westminster agenda of cuts, cuts and more cuts - hitting the vulnerable and abandoning hard fought for universal benefits. ""So it is no surprise that Johann Lamont seems to want to forget and distance herself from that disastrous speech."""

It prevents the use of US troops on the ground. President Barack Obama is battling to build support at home and abroad for military action.Despite Wednesday's vote, the bill's ultimate fate in the wider Senate is unclear. And the US House of Representatives must also approve the measure.So far, only 23 senators have said they support or are likely to back the resolution, according to a tally by ABC/BBC News.Sixteen have said they oppose or are likely to oppose the resolution, while 61 votes are undecided or unknown.However, those numbers are expected to shift as the language in the resolution changes, the White House and its congressional allies apply pressure, and lawmakers hear from their constituents.Earlier in the day, France - whose government has strongly advocated intervention - held an extraordinary debate in the National Assembly, though MPs will not vote on the matter as the country's president can mobilise the military without their backing.The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is accused of using chemical weapons against civilians on several occasions during the 30-month conflict, most recently on a large scale in an attack on 21 August on the outskirts of Damascus.The US has put the death toll from that incident at 1,429 - though other countries and organisations have given lower figures - and says all the evidence implicates government forces.At a press conference on Wednesday in Stockholm, Sweden, President Obama said: ""My credibility is not on the line. The international community's credibility is on the line.""America and Congress's credibility is on the line, because we give lip-service to the notion that these international norms are important.""Mr Obama said he believed the US Congress would approve intervention, but stressed that as commander-in-chief, he had the right to act in his country's national interest regardless.The Senate foreign relations committee approved the resolution, with one abstention, after accepting an amendment by Republican Senator John McCain that advocated increasing support for rebel forces. The measure pledges support for ""decisive changes to the present military balance of power"" in Syria.  It also states US policy is to ""change the momentum on the battlefield in Syria so as to create favorable conditions for a negotiated settlement that ends the conflict and leads to a democratic government"".Senator Dick Durbin, a senior Democrat on the panel, said he had voted against the war in Iraq, but that ""this is different"".""What we've done today is a step in the right direction,"" he said. ""I hope it makes a safer world.""But another Democrat, Senator Tom Udall, said he had voted no because he believed it would embroil the US in the Syrian civil war. He was joined by five Republicans in voting against the resolution, including Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, both of whom are tipped as potential 2016 presidential candidates.Two top Obama administration officials, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, meanwhile continued to press the case for intervention, this time before a House of Representatives panel.Mr Hagel said any US military strike would not be a mere ""pin prick"", but would reduce the Syrian government's military capability. He said he thought there was a ""very high"" likelihood that Mr Assad would use chemical weapons again if the US did not act.In Syria, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad said Damascus was mobilising its allies, who were ""offering it all sorts of support"". He cited Iran, Russia, South Africa and some Arab countries.Syrian state TV denied reports that a former Defence Minister, General Ali Habib, had defected to Turkey.The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed and two million others have fled the country since the uprising against President Assad began in March 2011."

Al-Qaeda and ""individual jihadists"" were both seen as threats, it added. ""There is a risk of extremist elements in Syria taking advantage of the permissive environment to develop external attack plans, including against Western targets,"" the ISC, which oversees the work of the intelligence agencies, said in its annual report. Protests in Syria, inspired by the Arab Spring which saw changes of government in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, were brutally suppressed by security forces in 2011. The stand-off has since escalated into a civil war which has claimed tens of thousands of lives so far, according to UN estimates. After hearing evidence from senior members of the intelligence agencies and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), the committee highlighted ""serious concern"" among its witnesses that Syria's  weapons stockpiles might be compromised. Assessments of their contents ""vary considerably"", the report said, but suggest they include sarin, ricin, mustard gas and VX, which the committee described as ""the deadliest nerve agent ever created"". ""There has to be a significant risk that some of the country's chemical weapons stockpile could fall into the hands of those with links to terrorism, in Syria or elsewhere in the region,"" the committee concluded. ""If this happens, the consequences could be catastrophic.""The ISC also warned: ""Large numbers of radicalised individuals have been attracted to the country, including significant numbers from the UK and Europe. ""They are likely to acquire expertise and experience which could significantly increase the threat posed when they return home.""The report said there was a growing threat of attacks by ""lone actors"", like the assailant who stabbed Labour MP Stephen Timms while he was holding a surgery in his east London constituency in 2010.By their nature, lone actors are much harder for intelligence agencies to detect, it added.One Home Office official reportedly told the committee: ""There is no doubt that the more sophisticated people in al-Qaeda recognise that groups are, in some ways, a thing of the past; and that encouraging lone acts of terror is exactly the way forward.""The ISC expressed concern that the agencies were struggling to make projected efficiency savings, due to be completed by 2014-15.It highlighted a forecast £59m shortfall in the £220m savings that the agencies - MI5, MI6 and GCHQ - were supposed to have achieved through more collaborative working.While the agencies said they were ""fairly confident"" that the targets set by the Treasury would be met, the committee said it ""does not fully share that confidence"".The committee said: ""It is essential that real and sustainable efficiencies are delivered if frontline capabilities are to be protected. More needs to be done urgently."""

""It was used for different purposes: operational, assistance to injured people,  rental costs and other goals. This was efficient assistance and we appreciate it,""  he said in a statement.He added that the money had been delivered to Afghanistan's National Security Council, which is part of the president's office, during the last 10 years.The New York Times report said: ""Wads of American dollars packed into suitcases, backpacks and, on occasion, plastic shopping bags have been dropped off every month or so at the offices of Afghanistan's president.""It quoted Khalil Roman, who was Mr Karzai's chief of staff from 2002 until 2005, as saying the cash was referred to as ""ghost money"". ""It came in secret, and it left in secret,"" Mr Roman is quoted as saying.The report cited unnamed US officials' assessments that there was little evidence the payment bought the influence the CIA sought, and said that the cash was not subject to the conditions placed on official US aid.It added that much of the money fuelled corruption and went to paying off warlords and politicians with dubious connections. The CIA declined to comment on the New York Times report, as did the US state department. In 2010, Mr Karzai acknowledged that his office has received cash from Iran, but insists this was part of a ""transparent"" process. He said the money was not for an individual, but to help run the president's office.Afghanistan receives billions of dollars in aid, but remains one of the poorest countries in the world."

The Israeli military said the existing shells contained ""minimal amounts"" of white phosphorus, and would be ""removed from active duty soon"".Three years ago, Israel promised to draw up new rules on the use of shells containing white phosphorus, in the wake of the Gaza war.Some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed in the three-week conflict.During the offensive, Israel used white phosphorus rounds in densely populated areas, the UN and Human Rights Watch said.

It can also be used as an incendiary device against enemy positions.Its effects however can be extremely harmful. If burning white phosphorus lands on a person's skin, it can go through to the bone. Toxic phosphoric acid can also be released into wounds, risking phosphorus poisoning.A protocol to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons bans the use of white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon against civilian populations or in air attacks against enemy forces in civilian areas."

Speaking in London, Mr Kerry said he understood Syrians wanted results from the summit and promised it would not just be a talking shop. He has held talks with PM David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague. Syria's opposition has said it will not attend the Rome talks because of ""the world's silence"" over Syrian violence.  After his talks in London Mr Kerry had a telephone discussion with Syrian Opposition Council President Moaz Al-Khatib, encouraging him to attend the Rome talks, but no more details of the conversation were released. Mr Hague said the UK was preparing to ""significantly increase"" its support for Syria's opposition.Mr Kerry, who succeeded Hillary Clinton, is on an 11-day tour of Europe and the Middle East, and will meet Syrian opposition members and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Berlin on Tuesday. ""The Assad regime has rained down rockets on the people of Aleppo"" in the last few days, said Mr Kerry, as he condemned the ""indiscriminate killing of civilians"".He said such attacks were further evidence that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should go.Mr Hague said 70,000 people had been killed and he was ""frustrated"" at the lack of an international political solution, despite efforts at the UN.Earlier, the Syrian foreign minister said his government was ready for talks with its opponents, even armed rebels. Mr Kerry said the US would continue with its policy of not taking a position on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.  Argentina claims the territory - which it calls the Malvinas - and says it will not recognise a forthcoming referendum organised by the islanders on how they want to be governed.  Mr Kerry said he would not comment on the referendum.""The United States recognises de facto UK administration of the islands, but takes no position on the question of party's sovereignty claims thereto,"" he said.  ""And we support co-operation between UK and Argentina on practical matters and we continue to urge a peaceful resolution of that critical issue.""A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron and Mr Kerry ""reiterated their shared determination to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran"" and discussed ""the challenges posed by fragile states around the world"". The top US diplomat said Britain and the US remained implacably opposed to the prospect of Tehran obtaining nuclear weapons, saying an Iran with a nuclear weapon was ""simply unacceptable"". ""The window for a diplomatic solution simply cannot by definition remain open forever,"" he told a news conference. ""But it is open today.""There is still time but there is only time if Iran makes the decision to come to the table and negotiate in good faith. We are prepared to negotiate in good faith, in mutual respect in an effort to avoid whatever terrible consequences could follow failure.""The choice really is in the hands of the Iranians. And we hope they will make the right choice,"" said Mr Kerry. The prime minister's spokesman said Mr Kerry did not ask about Britain's possible future exit from the European Union but he and Mr Cameron did discuss a free-trade agreement between the US and the EU and the possibility of making progress at the next G8 summit in Northern Ireland in June.In all, Mr Kerry will visit nine countries, stopping off in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Ankara, Cairo, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha.The British government is pleased that Mr Kerry made London his initial port of call on his first official trip abroad, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall. His itinerary stands in marked contrast to his predecessor, Hillary Clinton, who rather pointedly went to Asia first, our correspondent says. Though the Middle East peace process will be on the agenda when he visits Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Mr Kerry will not visit Israel or the Palestinian Territories. However, our correspondent says Mr Hague would like to see a renewed effort from the US to engage the different parties in the peace process and is hopeful that Mr Kerry's visit will herald a new enthusiasm. Mr Kerry, former Massachusetts senator and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, has spent almost three decades in the US Senate as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee."

The court said that acid should be sold only to people who show a valid identity card.Buyers will also have explain why they need the chemical and sales will have to be reported to the police. There will also be more compensation for victims. There are an estimated 1,000 acid attacks a year in India. The victims, who have to live with terrible disfigurements, are mainly women and are often targeted by jealous partners, correspondents say. In Thursday's ruling, the Supreme Court ordered that acid should be not be sold to anyone under the age of 18. It also ruled that there should be no bail allowed for the offence. In addition, victims of acid attacks will be entitled to more financial help from state governments - the court said compensation of at least 300,000 rupees (£3,320; $5,000) must be paid to help rehabilitate them after their ordeal. The Indian government has been accused of being too slow to deal with the issue of acid attacks. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court strongly criticised the government for failing to formulate a policy to reduce such attacks.It says it wants to see these new measures enforced within the next three months. Campaigners hope it will lead to a fall in the number of crimes committed, as happened in Bangladesh when it bought in restrictions on acid sales. Acid attacks are a problem throughout South Asia, with cases also reported in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.Campaigners say women who reject boyfriends, husbands or employers are often targeted by men using easily available and cheap chemicals. Earlier this year, India introduced tough new legislation to counter violence against women.The legislation contains harsher penalties for rapists, including the death penalty, and up to 10 years in jail for acid attacks.

It was one of the ""strangest speeches a president has given in my lifetime"", wrote Ross Douthat of the New York Times. ""A prime time presidential address should either announce a policy course or make a specific appeal to Congress; it should not be wasted on a situation where the course is so unclear and the appeal so vague and undirected."" Joan Walsh of Salon.com echoed Douthat's criticism, calling it ""a strangely lackluster address that essentially served as a placeholder for a theoretical future battle"". Many writers said Mr Obama's speech was disjointed, because he spent most of it apparently building a case for military strikes against Syria, only to acknowledge that recent diplomatic developments may make the use of force unnecessary. As the New Republic's John Judis put it: ""The speech did not have the structure of an argument, but of a television drama in which the viewer's anxiety is finally relieved by the promise of peaceful resolution."" ""The overwhelming emphasis was on humanitarian goals, with a brief, secondary, and noticeably weak effort to buttress that case with talk about threats to our interests,"" wrote Stanley Kurtz in National Review Online. The speech was ""a time filler"", wrote Peggy Noonan in The Wall Street Journal. ""The White House had asked for the time and had to fill it."" Others criticised Mr Obama's references in his address to the suffering of the Syrian children. Erick Erickson of RedState wrote: ""When we are doing things 'for the children' as opposed to any other reason, we have no substantive reason for taking an action."" Mr Obama's pleas to remember the children echoed the president's words following last December's mass murder at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, noted Politico columnist Roger Simon. Little has changed since that call to action, Simon wrote, but ""in Syria, because the weaponry was gas instead of bullets, we are supposed to be ultra-shocked"". Even among those who thought Mr Obama did a good job with the speech, many had caveats. Matt Miller of the Washington Post wrote that ""Obama traded in the wobbly mien he displayed in recent appearances for the confident bearing Americans need from their commander in chief"". He cautioned, however, that ""between the long-running box he's now put himself in on Syria, and the prospect of the White House botching another debt ceiling showdown just ahead, the president's authority in his second term is in danger of collapse"". Toward the end of his speech, Mr Obama cited the ""exceptional"" nature of America as a reason the country should not ignore the use of chemical weapons halfway around the world. Conservatives who picked up on Mr Obama's turn of phrase were none too pleased. Scott Johnson of the blog PowerLine wrote: ""This is American exceptionalism filtered through the mind of a man who doesn't believe it."" Despite the negative reaction among commentators, a CNN poll found 61% of those who watched the speech now support the president's Syria policy. ""The poll suggests that he did what presidents rarely do: change people's minds, if only temporarily,"" David Kusnet, former head speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, wrote for CNN. ""With down-to-earth arguments and a lofty conclusion, last night's speech was a model of how to turn an audience around, point by point."" "

""I will not resign because I want to keep defending values I believe in within the [party],"" he said.The BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague says the man leading the party mutiny - regional governor Michal Hasek - is close to the Czech President Milos Zeman, who will appoint the next prime minister.  Czech media are reporting that a plot to remove Mr Sobotka was hatched as early as Saturday evening, when his party rivals allegedly held secret talks with the president at a chateau outside Prague. The politicians declined to comment on the claims. ArduousThe Social Democrats had hoped to win enough votes to run the country with the support of the Communists - but neither had enough to succeed.Analysts say the weekend's result could pave the way for another unstable coalition, with the second-placed Ano party in a powerful bargaining position.Arduous coalition talks are expected in the coming weeks.Our correspondent says the real winner in this election is Ano, a new centrist party which campaigns against corruption and is run by a food and agriculture billionaire.Ano has almost 19% of the vote, and the Communists have just over 15%.The leader of Ano, Andrej Babis, has told reporters he cannot envisage supporting a Social Democrat cabinet.The country's coalition broke down in June amid allegations of corruption, spying and abuse of power.  A close aide of Prime Minister Petr Necas, with whom he was having an affair, was arrested on suspicion of bribery and ordering a military intelligence agency to follow Mr Necas' estranged wife."

It is also a huge test for some of the most important elements of President Barack Obama's foreign policy - the Obama doctrine, if you like. At the heart of that doctrine is Obama's determination to act through alliances of the unwilling, or at least extremely reluctant. He wants to turn rivals and even enemies into partners of a sort, when it comes to policing the world.  No country is more important in this regard than China. He wants to ""pivot to Asia"" - believing America has focused too much on the Middle East at the expense of the region that will be a growing source of an American prosperity in the future. At least that's the given reason. I suspect he also is well aware it will be the crucible of the most important ideological and political battles of the future, between dictatorship and democracy, open markets and closed systems. No country is more important in this regard than China. And of course no country has more influence with North Korea than China. Kerry's visit to Beijing has produced some measure of agreement with the secretary of state claiming that China is ""very serious"" about the denuclearisation on the peninsula. China has good reason to warn North Korea, as its Foreign Minister Wang Yi did last week that ""the situation's development on the peninsula will not necessarily go according to the ideas and expectations of the DPRK [North Korea"".It is often said that China is North Korea's only ally. It is more remarkable that North Korea is just about China's only ally, at least in the immediate region. That doesn't say much about the soft power of this growing superpower. Obama's pivot is sometimes seen by China as America not only turning to face the region, but adopting a more aggressive posture as it does so. It fears being encircled and contained by the US, in alliance with countries hostile to its interests.  Before this latest North Korean escalation America beefed up its deployment of marines in Australia and conducted more exercises with the Philippines. The North Korean crisis not only justifies America moving more hardware into the region, it also pushes fearful allies to welcome America's strong embrace. It has prompted China's old enemy, Japan, to move its missiles around and has given Japan's new prime minister the excuse he was looking for to challenge constitutional constraints of the growth of military power. A long-term resolution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions would strip much of the rationale from the military part of Obama's pivot. That would be a gift for China, as would the moral kudos that would flow from defusing regional tension. This moment is a critical test for the world's most important big power relationship, one which may have repercussions for years to come. "

Following the three-hour long meeting, he said: ""It's fair to say that there is a good feeling among all of us that we made progress in this dialogue.""But he added: ""We have a lot of homework to do. We are not going to raise expectations or make promises that can't be delivered."" The talks come a day after Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen called on Pakistan to combat militants who used the country as a launch-pad for attacks on Afghanistan.Mr Rasmussen said: ""We need a positive engagement of Pakistan if we are to ensure long-term peace and stability not only in Afghanistan, but in the region.""The 100,000 remaining Nato International Security Assistance Force soldiers are due to be withdrawn by the end of 2014, after which Nato says its role in the country will essentially be a training one.A secret Nato report on Islamabad's links to the Afghan Taliban, leaked in February, said the Taliban were being helped by Pakistani security services.The report - based on the interrogations of 27,000 captured Taliban, al-Qaeda and foreign fighters as well as civilians - said Pakistan was aware that Taliban leaders were taking refuge within its borders.Senior Taliban figures such as Nasiruddin Haqqani were housed close to Pakistani intelligence headquarters in Islamabad, added the report, entitled State of the Taliban.Pakistan has denied the claims, saying it has no hidden agenda in Afghanistan.For its part, Pakistan says Afghanistan gives safe haven to militants on its side of the border.Afghanistan wants Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban to bring them to the negotiating table, and stop militants crossing the border."

An officer with a drawn sword marched in front as he walked with President Mahmoud Abbas in front of a row of men. They might be carrying guns, they might be dressed in khaki uniforms with gold-tasselled epaulets but they are an honour guard, not an army, for this is not a state - at least not in the eyes of America and much of the world. Mr Obama has come to the Middle East with the prime purpose of persuading the Israeli public that he understands and cherishes them, whatever his critics say. (Read this article by Jeffery Goldberg for a sophisticated take on this perception.)  The more he succeeds the harder it will be to persuade Palestinians that he cares about them. Many are already disillusioned that nothing much has changed since the grand vision of Mr Obama's Cairo speech. As if to make a point, two rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel this morning. Mr Obama is bound to condemn this in the news conference that will follow talks with President Abbas, but Israeli government sources have told the BBC that they will be  watching to see if the Palestinian leader follows suit. It will also be interesting to see if Mr Obama will be stern rather than laying on the love with a trowel as he did in Jerusalem when he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Within minutes of arriving there, he had said ""our alliance is eternal"". How is that for a special relationship? Mr Obama and Mr Netanyahu have rubbed each other up the wrong way so many times in the past that it is a wonder that the friction has not started any serious fires. But at their joint news conference after a meeting on Wednesday that lasted almost three hours, the warmth radiated was of a different kind, although perhaps summoned by arcane political skills.   Their script could almost have been taken from this very weird video released by the Israeli embassy in Washington, featuring both men as adoring bobble heads. The actual venue for the news conference was no less strange - a cross between a tent and a greenhouse, perhaps like an abandoned aviary - with greenery draped around the white trellis work, miniature orange trees in tubs and two large trees growing up between the TV cameras.In this would-be elegant setting, Mr Netanyahu talked of Mr Obama as ""gracious"" and glowed with approval of Mr Obama's twin messages. For the president has come bearing two  gifts for the prime minister. First, his continual stress on Israel's right to exist, not because of the horrors of the Holocaust - which, it could be argued, justifies only the theoretical existence of a Jewish state - but because of its history in the region dating back 3,000 years, which Israelis argue justifies its existence where it is. The second gift is a wholehearted commitment to Israel's security and its right to defend itself. This comes with the offer of a brand-new 10-year defence deal between the two countries. President Obama said that the US had an ""unprecedented"" ""solemn obligation"", which was ""non-negotiable"", to guarantee Israel's security. In case someone had missed the point, he said (without either putting on a leather jacket, or chewing gum)  that the ""tough neighbourhood has got tougher - we've got your back"".This new friendship has some practical consequences. There is a new openness about where the president and prime minister agree and disagree over Iran's apparent quest for nuclear weapons. Both say Iran must not get nuclear weapons - Bibi said he firmly believed that the president would take action to stop it. They underlined that their intelligence services agreed on how far the Iranians had got with their programme but Mr Netanyahu made it clear his red line was Iran getting enough depleted uranium to be able to build a bomb whereas the president's is Iran actually deciding to build the bomb and getting near to achieving it.That is not new - but being frank about it is. Mr Obama has reduced tensions by saying that Israel has the right to defend itself as it sees fit. It is not the first time he has said it, but he repeated it again and again, so there was no misunderstanding.  The president hinted international action might be needed in  Syria. He said that his government was actively seeking information on reports that chemical weapons had been used, while dismissing suggestions the rebels were to blame. He said if chemical weapons had been used it would be a ""game changer"" and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have made a ""serious and tragic"" mistake. Then there is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Mr Obama said he would talk more about that in his big speech. He admitted that he might have handled things more deftly in his first term but denied he had ever given up trying. He said making peace would be a ""hard slog"" but he wanted to listen to both sides rather than come with any big announcement. As everyone, in theory, wants peace, this is very easy to say. As yet, it does not amount to much. But Mr Obama has gone out of his way to make Israel feel loved, and he may just expect something in return.  "

But with heavy rain, security and transport issues, and the fact that Tuesday was not declared a national holiday, areas of the 95,000-capacity stadium remained empty.Introducing the proceedings, the master of ceremonies, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that Mr Mandela's ""long walk is over... and he can finally rest"".Current South African President Jacob Zuma made the keynote address but was booed in some parts of the ceremony.He said Mr Mandela was ""one of a kind... a fearless freedom fighter who refused to allow the brutality of the apartheid state to stand in way of the struggle for the liberation of his people"".Mr Zuma announced he was renaming the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where Mr Mandela will lie in state, as the Mandela Amphitheatre.Earlier Mr Obama delivered his address, carried on the White House web site, to huge cheers. He said: ""It is hard to eulogise any man... how much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation towards justice.""He said Nelson Mandela had taught the world the power of action and the power of ideas, and that it had taken a man like Mr Mandela to free not only the prisoner but also the jailer. Mr Obama said: ""We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. While I will always fall short of Madiba (Mr Mandela's clan name), he makes me want to be a better man.""On his way to the podium, President Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro, an unprecedented gesture between the leaders of two nations that have been at loggerheads for more than half a century.A White House official later said the two had not planned to meet.""This wasn't a pre-planned encounter,"" the official said, quoted by AFP news agency. ""Above all else, today is about honouring Nelson Mandela, and that was the president's singular focus at the memorial service. We appreciate that people from all over the world are participating in this ceremony.""In his address, Mr Castro paid tribute to Mr Mandela as the ""ultimate symbol of dignity and the revolutionary struggle"".Under his brother, Fidel, Cuba was a staunch critic of apartheid, and Mr Mandela had expressed gratitude for that support.In his speech, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said there was ""sorrow for a mighty loss and celebration of a mighty life"".He said: ""South Africa has lost a hero, it has lost a father... He was one of our greatest teachers. He taught by example. He sacrificed so much and was willing to give up all he had for freedom and democracy.""The first speaker, friend and fellow Robben Island inmate Andrew Mlangeni, said Mr Mandela had ""created hope when there was none"".Many people stood in the rain waiting for several hours to get into the stadium, the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports from the scene. She says the crowds were in high spirits - singing and dancing, stomping their feet - and the stadium had the feel of a political rally. Rather than seeing the rain as a dampener, many in South Africa have welcomed it.Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said: ""It's a blessing from the ancestors welcoming a son of the soil.""One of those attending, Shahida Rowe from Johannesburg, told the BBC: ""The core of Mandela's life was humanity. That is why I am here today and the world is celebrating.""Thanks to him, I was recognised as a human being.""Mr Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, arrived at the stadium to huge cheers as she was shown on the big screen.There were cheers too of ""Winnie! Winnie!"" for ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who hugged and kissed Graca Machel.Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Chinese Vice-President Li Yuanchao, President Hifikepunye Pohamba of Namibia and Indian President Pranab Mukherjee also made speeches.The ceremony was closed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who asked the crowd to rise to their feet for a final tribute.The BBC's Mike Wooldridge in Johannesburg says the line-up of world leaders is a sign of how South Africa has seen its partners and place in the world since Nelson Mandela became president.But, he adds, today is as personal as it is political - a recognition that there are lessons for the wider world in everything Nelson Mandela sought to achieve. British Prime Minister David Cameron attended Tuesday's memorial, along with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Labour leader Ed Miliband and former British Prime Ministers Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major.Three former US presidents, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, were also there, as were Francois Hollande of France, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe.Other mourners in attendance were Oprah Winfrey, Bono, Sir Richard Branson and Peter Gabriel.Mr Mandela's body will lie in state in Pretoria on the following three days.The state funeral takes place on Sunday in his home village of Qunu in Eastern Cape province.

The bill still has the potential to be used as an instrument of secrecy in a democracy that can only thrive in a climate of openness,"" Sanef said in a statement.The revised bill has removed provisions that would have allowed almost any government agency to classify material, Reuters news agency reports.Public interest provisions have also been introduced into the bill, which was first passed by the lower house of parliament in November 2011.But Right2Know says this does not stop whistleblowers, journalists or activists who disclose classified information from being charged with ""espionage"" and ""hostile activity"".The group said there was also a need for a ""public domain defence"" so that once a secret was in the public domain a person could not be prosecuted."

It also includes: Restrictions on political advertisements in the publicly run media during election campaignsA rule that university students can only get state grants if they pledge to work in Hungary after graduationFines or prison terms for homeless people who sleep on the streets.It is the fourth amendment to Hungary's new basic law since it came into force just 14 months ago - a fact which helps underpin criticism that the new constitution was both hurried and flawed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports.Critics at home and abroad say the amendment dismantles the architecture of democracy established since the fall of communism, and allows Fidesz to cement its own ideology at the heart of the state. The measure was passed by 265 votes to 11, with 33 abstentions.Fidesz and its allies the Christian Democrats voted for, along with three independents.The opposition Socialists boycotted the vote, walking out of parliament and hanging black flags from their windows to symbolise a black day for Hungarian democracy. Leader Attila Mesterhazy said Mr Orban's aim was to ""take revenge on the constitutional court, students, opposition parties, and all those who do not do as the government wishes"".Fidesz argues the changes are necessary to make a clean break with the previous constitution, which was adopted in 1989 when Hungary threw off communist rule.Mr Orban had been under pressure at least to postpone Monday's vote until experts from the Council of Europe - Europe's main human rights watchdog - could examine the amendment, our correspondent says.German MEP Alexander Lambsdorff urged the European Commission to investigate a possible ""systematic violation of European values""  by the Hungarian government ahead of the vote, the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reports.In a separate development, the prime minister described as ""scandalous"" a court decision against the government over state-imposed gas price cuts. He said he would not accept the ruling scrapping recent 10% price cuts and would instead submit a new proposal to lower prices even further. The government's measure is popular with many Hungarians who are struggling to pay their bills, but energy companies have complained that they have to foot the bill."

The Security Council hours earlier called the test a clear threat to international security. Monitors said the test appeared twice as big as the previous one in 2009.The test took place at the Punggye-ri site in the north-east of the country on Tuesday morning. A powerful underground explosion was detected at 11:57 (02:57 GMT), followed three hours later by confirmation from North Korea that a test had taken place. State-run KCNA news agency said the test was ""carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously"".North Korea said it was a response to the ""reckless hostility of the United States"".Nuclear test monitors in Vienna say the underground explosion had double the force of the last test, in 2009, despite the use of a device said by the North to be smaller.If a smaller device was indeed tested, analysts said this could take Pyongyang closer to building a warhead small enough to arm a missile.South Korea is using aircraft and ships to collect air samples to analyse for increased radiation - which could give an indication of details about Tuesday's  blast, the Associated Press news agency reported. North Korea's two previous tests involved plutonium devices, but it is also believed to have a highly enriched uranium programme. Speaking in Washington, Mr Obama said North Korea would only achieve security by meeting its international obligations. ""Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only isolate them further as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defence and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats,"" he said.Earlier the Security Council met in an emergency session at which members unanimously backed a statement calling the North in ""grave violation"" of UN resolutions. ""In line with this commitment and the gravity of this violation, the members of the Security Council will begin work immediately on appropriate measures in a Security Council resolution,'' the council said.Mr Obama and outgoing South Korea President Lee Myung-bak also held telephone talks, as did Mr Lee and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. China - which backed the UN condemnation - summoned North Korea's ambassador in Beijing to express ""firm opposition"" to the test, the foreign ministry said. ""(Foreign Minister) Yang Jiechi demanded that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) side cease talk that further escalates the situation and swiftly return to the correct channel of dialogue and negotiation,'' a statement said.But in a statement issued late on Tuesday, North Korea appeared far from cowed, promising ""second and third tougher measures"" if the US did not ""admit its mistake and correct it"". The BBC's Barbara Plett, at the UN, says that so far isolation and pressure have been met by continued North Korean provocations. There is no sign that another round of sanctions will break that pattern. Analysts say that is because Pyongyang seems ready to push harder than the Security Council is able to push back. North Korea's open defiance of the UN suggests that it sees its nuclear weapons programme as a strategic asset that it will not give up, our correspondent adds.This test - the first under new leader Kim Jong-un - was North Korea's third. It came weeks after Pyongyang successfully used a rocket to put a satellite into space, a move condemned by the UN as a banned test of missile technology. "

The material broadcast on Iranian state television purports to show a US base and the Afghan city of Kandahar. It is not clear if the footage is genuine.Last year Iran said it was building a copy of the drone - an RQ-170 Sentinel - after breaking its encryption codes. Iran has repeatedly accused the US of spying activity amid continuing tension over its nuclear programme.  ""By decoding data extracted from the drone, we found out that the aircraft  had conducted many flights in Iran's neighbouring countries,"" Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh of Iran's Revolutionary Guard said in the broadcast. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says that if the Iranians have really managed to break into the systems of the pilotless aircraft, this would suggest a level of sophistication that may worry the US. American officials have previously cast doubt on Iran's ability to extract useful intelligence from the captured spy plane, and have said that reverse-engineering a copy would be beyond Iran's technological capability.The RQ-170 Sentinel is an advanced high-altitude surveillance drone used by both the US Air Force and the CIA. It does not carry weapons. Its capture in 2011 was hailed by Iran as a demonstration of its military and technological prowess. The US confirmed that a drone had gone missing on the border between Iran and Afghanistan and asked for its return, but Iran refused. Iran said it had brought the drone down using electronic warfare after it entered Iranian airspace; Washington said the aircraft malfunctioned. Iran and the US are engaged in a tense confrontation over Iran's nuclear programme, which Washington and its allies say is aimed at developing nuclear weapons. Iran denies this, and accuses the US of hostile intent in cooperation with Israel. Last December Iran said it had captured another, less sophisticated drone, but the US denied any such aircraft was missing. "

Mr Thaksin, who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006, was convicted of abuse of power in 2008 and sentenced in absentia to a prison term of two years.He denied the charges, calling them politically motivated, and in the years following the coup remained popular with poor and rural voters, whom he had championed. He has been living in self-imposed exile in Dubai.Up until this month, the government was only considering an amnesty for ordinary people and not the leaders.But a parliamentary committee dominated by Mr Thaksin's party has now widened the scope of the amnesty, apparently opening the way for his conviction for abuses of power to be overturned, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. Thailand's colour-coded political divide has been muted in the past two years, but it looks like the two sides are now lining up for yet another round in a battle that hinges on a single issue: whether the abrasive and charismatic Mr Thaksin should ever be allowed to play a leading role in the country again, our correspondent adds.After the first post-coup polls saw Mr Thaksin's allies elected, anti-Thaksin yellow-shirt protesters subsequently shut down Bangkok's main international airport for several days.The Democratic Party leader, former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, then formed a government, which in 2010 was hit by more than two months of street protests by red-shirt demonstrators in Bangkok that left more than 90 people dead, including protesters, civilians and soldiers.In August, thousands of people also took to the streets as the bill was being debated in parliament.

Before leaving the US on Friday, Iran's new President, Hassan Rouhani, shared a 15-minute phone call with Mr Obama.Mr Netanyahu, who will meet Mr Obama on Monday then address the UN on Tuesday, said he would ""tell the truth in the face of the sweet talk"".Israel and the West suspect Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb.Tehran denies the claim.  Mr Rouhani, who spoke to President Obama late on Friday, has said he wants to seek a deal with world powers on Iran's nuclear programme within months.The phone conversation was the first top-level conversation between the two countries for more than 30 years. Mr Rouhani, a moderate, was elected in June, replacing hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.On his return to Tehran on Saturday, Mr Rouhani was welcomed by hundreds of supporters hailing his trip, as well as a smaller number of opponents chanting ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"".The Israeli government has not officially reacted to the Iranian president's remarks and his historic phone conversation with Mr Obama. Israeli media reported that ministers had been instructed not to speak publicly about the issue, to avoid gaffes before Monday's White House meeting.But writing on his Facebook page, former Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned that the Iranian president was engaging in a ""deceitful exercise"".Hours after Mr Netanyahu's plane took off for New York, Israel's Shin Bet intelligence service disclosed that a Belgian man of Iranian origin had been arrested on 11 September on suspicion of spying.Ali Mansouri, 50, entered Israel under the name Alex Mans and had been sent by Iran's Revolutionary Guard elite Quds force, a Shin Bet statement said.He was detained at Ben Gurion airport at the end of a five-day trip, during which he had photographed the roof of the US embassy in Tel Aviv, it said.Tehran insists its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes but last month the UN's nuclear agency said Iran had further boosted its capacity for uranium enrichment, installing more than 1,000 advanced centrifuges at the Natanz enrichment plant.Iran is due to take part in substantive negotiations on its nuclear programme in Geneva on 15 October with a group of nations known as the P5+1, which include the US, Russia, China, the UK, France and Germany.Mr Rouhani has said Iran will bring a plan to that meeting, but has not provided details.The P5+1 have called on Tehran to halt production and stockpiling of uranium enriched to 20%.

But on Tuesday, he takes a short break to dive into an issue in which he has long been interested - climate change.Mr Kerry arrived in Stockholm and headed to Kiruna, Sweden's northernmost city, in the province of Lapland, for a meeting of the Arctic Council. The council, founded in 1996, brings together eight nations with land above the Arctic Circle - Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the US.Mr Kerry, who held one of the first US Senate hearings on climate change as early as 1988 with then-Senator Al Gore, is hoping to put the spotlight on the issue of climate change again, after efforts to make concrete progress faltered during President Barack Obama's first term.Despite a multitude of international crises, Mr Kerry insisted on attending the meeting of the once-obscure council.Climate change has countries as far away as India also paying attention to the Arctic - and seeking observer status in the council.  Melting polar ice is making mineral and oil resources easier to exploit, setting off a scramble for access. The US Geological Survey estimated in 2008 that some 22% of the world's undiscovered oil and natural gas deposits were located above the Arctic Circle.The warming climate also opens shipping routes that were once mostly inaccessible. The northern sea route would cut the distance between Shanghai and Europe by several thousands of miles, saving time and money.China is courting Nordic countries, signing a trade agreement with Iceland and several commercial agreements with Denmark. Greenland, a self-governing part of Denmark, is considering awarding mine exploration licenses to companies this year for a $2bn (£1.3bn) project north-east of the capital Nuuk. One of those companies is London Mining, which would join a Chinese mining company in the project that could supply China with 15 million tonnes of iron ore a year.China is one of 14 countries that have applied for observer status in the council, along with Japan, South Korea, India and others. Several European countries such as France and the Netherlands are already observers.Observers do not participate in the decision-making process. But the Arctic's growing geopolitical significance allows countries with even a toehold in the small club - like China - to be closer to the action.The council will consider the new applications during the Kiruna meeting and possibly come to a decision, which requires consensus. Canada and Russia are opposed, while the Nordic countries are in favour.""The argument for opening for more observers in the Arctic Council is that they will then be a member of our club,"" said Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide. ""Then the danger of them forming their own club will be smaller.""Countries such as Canada that oppose inviting in more observers fear the voice of indigenous people who live in the Arctic will be diminished.On Friday the White House said the US had not taken a position yet. A senior US official attending the Kiruna meeting said Washington was open to observers and respected the consensus. The official also added that Washington believed China was a responsible applicant.It is unclear whether the eight members will be able to reach a decision by the end of their meeting in Kiruna, which will also mark the transfer of the council chairmanship from Sweden to Canada for the next two years. The US takes over in 2015.Last week, the White House unveiled a new Arctic strategy with three policy aims: advancing national security interests, responsibly managing the Arctic ecosystem, and bolstering international relationships. But the strategy provided little detail about specific issues like drilling or shipping lanes. And with no clear budget, experts said it was a vague wish list.Arctic policy is sensitive issue for President Obama, who must balance pressure from environmentalists opposed to Arctic drilling with the needs of the oil and gas industry and Republicans who are pushing for more aggressive drilling and mine exploitation. The council members will also sign an oil-spill preparedness and response treaty."

Then there is the narrative of failure and criticism that any leader can probably expect after four-and-a-half years in power, and which is manifesting itself in South Africa with protests planned by various prominent groups, with a particular focus on American economic and foreign policies. There has been criticism back home too that Mr Obama's three-country trip - heavy on presidential security - is costing too much. And across Africa - while there is an appreciation that America's leader has had plenty on his plate elsewhere, with the financial crisis and the turmoil in the Middle East - there is also a niggling belief that this trip has come a little late in his presidency, and that with Chinese investment flooding in, the US no longer carries quite such clout on the continent.Nonetheless, in a region increasingly willing and able to engage with the world on an equal - and business-orientated - footing, Mr Obama's visit is still generating plenty of interest.""It's good for Africa that President Obama is coming,"" said Jeff Nemeth, the South African head of the US car manufacturing giant Ford. ""He's been on record as saying that Africa is potentially the next economic success story, and his coming here serves to cement that vision."" Ford's output here has almost doubled in three years.""The economic boom in sub-Saharan Africa feels real to me,"" said Mr Nemeth, who is hoping that President Obama can help nudge governments on the continent to ""focus on things that will drive economic growth… education, infrastructure support, good governance and good financial systems"".China's leaders make many more visits to Africa these days than they used to - and the deals they sign generate plenty of headlines here. But there is still something much more intimate about a visit by an American president - particularly one with an African heritage.  ""I'd like to tell him: 'Look at us - there is hope,'"" said Zineb Oulmakki, a Moroccan student at the African Leadership Academy outside Johannesburg.""There are a lot of prospects for this continent.""There will be a lot of growth - I'm certain of that. Soon we will not be reliant on aid. We will be a major leader in the global economic context.""Ethiopian student Eyerusalem Assefa said: ""We worry a bit about China. They don't give good salaries sometimes. It must be a win-win situation with no-one being exploited.""As for the idea that China and the US are battling for control of the continent's resources, Mr Nemeth said he had no sense of that, and stressed instead what he saw as the advantages of US businesses. ""We have a very strong sense of good governance, and that's what American companies bring and it gives us a space in business that is somewhat unique,"" he said.""We can generate returns in a way that we believe is more supportive to the communities and countries in which we work. ""In the long run, people want to work at a place that has integrity, and people want to live in a country that has integrity, and as the middle class grows and becomes more involved in the governance and politics, they'll demand that too - it's just the way it evolves.""For Kenyan student Maimuna Abdi Yussuf, the visit is a good opportunity for the continent.""We're ready to take Africa to the next level,"" he said.""We need collaboration between America's entrepreneurs and ours."""
14983	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21816989	News	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Some Israeli media outlets are calling Barack Obama's first trip to Israel as US president ""operation unbreakable alliance"". It is the sort of overkill that underlines the fact that both sides have something to prove. Just don't hold your breath for history to be made. The main purpose of Obama's visit seems to be to re-make his image with the Israeli people. A recent poll indicated only 10% of them had a favourable view of the president. Obama critics at home have long claimed that he's no friend of Israel and say the proof positive is that he hasn't bothered to go there as president. By making this the first foreign trip of his second term he at least gets that out of the way. He'll be only the fifth US president to go to Israel, but his recent predecessors Bill Clinton and George W Bush invested a lot in the relationship. Obama offended some early on in his presidency by going to Cairo to make a high-profile speech to the Arab world but not continuing on to Israel. The speech also offended some Israelis because of the way he made a case for Israel's existence based on the horrors of the Holocaust rather than Jewish origins in the region. Expect him to correct that on this trip. The White House of course attempts to counter all this criticism, retorting that Israel has no better ally, citing the defence co-operation since he became president. The US and Israel are indeed bound together tightly. But the president's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fraught and dysfunctional. Perhaps the low point was when Mr Netanyahu came to the White House and treated the president to lecture on Israeli history in front of the cameras. The president practised a policy of containment, his face rigid with diplomatically suppressed emotions. One aim of the visit will be to present a chummier image. A sense of unity is important if Iran is going to believe that the two countries are capable of concerted action over its nuclear programme. But it is the speech at a convention centre in Jerusalem, where he will talk directly to the Israeli public and the public watching at home, that is the real centrepiece of this trip. Martin Indyk, former US ambassador to Israel, says: ""He's a rock star. They will welcome him. He's bound to get a bounce. And that is very important. This is a public who will punish a prime minister who mishandles his relationship with a popular president. ""Netanyahu eats [opinion] polls for breakfast. He will know if the balance changes."" Mr Netanyahu is already weakened by recent election results, and any change in opinion polls could make him more pliant both over the question of Iran and issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The downside of a speech that lavishes praise on Israel is that it may worsen Obama's image in the Arab world, where it has crashed from the dizzy heights of 2009.  The 2009 Cairo speech raised expectations so high that when little flowed from it many were gravely disillusioned.Several experts on the region have told me that the Arab world expects little of Obama. People are no longer listening.Syria and Iran are officially top of the trip's agenda. But everyone wants to know what the president will say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  He's told both Jewish and Arab Americans that he won't come with any grand peace plan. No wonder.I keep hearing the same two things. The first is that this is just about the last chance for the two-state solution - the idea of Israel and an independent country called Palestine living side by side.British Foreign Secretary William Hague has said it is ""slipping away"".Many others I've spoken to echo him. This isn't just overblown rhetoric. It is based on a simple equation. The more Jewish settlements there are in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the more difficult it is for both sides to do a deal. Some within Israel maintain that one key aim of the new Israeli government is to build even more such settlements. Certainly the composition of the new Israeli cabinet is interesting. The housing minister used to be a leader of the settlers' movement.Marwan Muasher, who served as Jordan's first ambassador to Israel, says the settlements mean any proposed peace talks are ""like two men arguing about a piece of pizza, while one of them is eating it"".The second common assumption is that that there is no real chance of getting talks going again right now. One party in the new government is explicitly against a two-state solution.  There's no sense of urgency among the Israeli public. Egypt is in too delicate a state to go out on a limb. Jordan is under enough strain with a badly performing economy, Syrian refugees and internal instability. Saudi Arabia shows no enthusiasm. Many ordinary Palestinians are unenthusiastic. One Arab expert told me: ""The public is fed up with what they see as a sham, just theatre. The words 'peace process' are enough to throw some Palestinians into seizures.""  So the only place momentum could come from is the US president. But he would be pushing against a door, tightly shut and triple locked by reality. Mr Muasher says: ""The stars are not going to align. The notion that you can leave it for now and pick it up later is over. So the president has to decide if he is going to do something very difficult. The answer is: 'No, he is not.'""Before the trip Mr Obama held meetings with leaders of both the Jewish and Arab communities in the US. He suggested to them that he would appeal directly to the people on both sides of the conflict, telling them that to want peace is not enough - they must act. Such fine words are easy, and are only to be expected.The new Israeli government is only a few days old, so provides a good excuse for not coming up with anything more concrete. What matters is what happens next. There are a few optimists who think Secretary of State John Kerry, who is accompanying the president, is absolutely determined to make an impact. They suggest after the visit he will put together detailed proposals that might at least get some talks going. Under this scenario the president would keep aloof until the end of the year, when he might give another push. Hope springs eternal, but few have realistic hopes of anything coming of all this.A US presidential visit to Israel is bound to generate headlines. Whether it will give birth to anything more lasting is much more open to question. "

The US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, was killed when gunmen stormed the compound and set it on fire. Some US Republicans accuse the Obama administration of failing to admit the involvement of terrorist groups. But the New York Times (NYT) says a local Islamist militia leader was key.The paper bases its report on months of interviews with local residents who have extensive knowledge of the events of 11 September 2012 and American officials linked to a criminal investigation. Initially, Washington said the attack grew out of violent protests against an anti-Islam video produced in the US. Later findings suggested that it was an organised attack planned by local militias. Some Republicans accused al-Qaeda of launching the assault to mark the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US.The NYT reports that the reality was ""murkier"". The assault was neither ""meticulously planned"", nor ""spontaneous"", though ""fuelled in large part"" by anger at the video. The paper's investigation ""turned up no evidence that al-Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault"".In the aftermath of the attack, Republicans repeatedly criticised the Obama administration for blaming the video protest instead of a deliberate terrorist attack.An investigation commissioned by the US state department found in December 2012 that security at the consulate had been inadequate but that there had been ""no immediate, specific"" intelligence pointing to threats. The NYT says the attack was led by fighters who had benefited from Western support during the uprising against long-time Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. It says a central figure was ""an eccentric, malcontent militia leader, Ahmed Abu Khattala"".Mr Khattala denies involvement, but witnesses describe him ""strolling calmly through the chaos"" at the compound, according to the NYT.He is also alleged to have directed local fighters in the attack. Mr Khattala, whose exact whereabouts are unknown, was charged by US investigators in August. Charges have also been filed against an unknown number of other alleged attackers. Ambassador Chris Stevens was one of four Americans to die. The others killed were another state department worker and two former Navy Seals.  "

Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said the current system ""fits Austria like a glove and is the best guarantee for all future challenges"".Opponents feared the move will not only prove more costly, at a time when Austria is trying to cut spending, but would also push  the country towards membership of Nato and the abandonment of neutrality they have observed since 1955.Army Chief of Staff Gen Edmund Entacher also warned that changes to the current set-up would lead ""irreversibly to a drop in quality, numbers and ability""."

""A state visit is the highest mark of respect and esteem that one country can pay to another in the diplomatic parlance so the fact that the president of Ireland is paying the first state visit by an Irish president to the UK next year is extremely meaningful, it's a very significant thing to do,"" he said.""The fact that is happening only three years after Her Majesty the Queen paid her state visit to Ireland, so two state visits within a very short period of time, I think that also tells you a lot about how interested we all are in investing in this relationship and what a good state of affairs it is in at the moment.""During the Queen's visit to Ireland, she paid her respects to republican dead at Dublin's Garden of Remembrance and visited Croke Park - site of the 1920 Bloody Sunday massacre.She also made a speech on Anglo-Irish history at Dublin Castle.President Higgins' visit to the UK comes ahead of planned commemorations by the Irish government to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016.The 1916 event saw rebels take over a number of buildings in Dublin as part of an uprising against British rule. British troops put down the rebellion and many ringleaders were executed. ""The 1916 Rising is going to be a very important moment in the decade of commemorations that are taking place in the Republic,"" Mr Chilcott said.""It's a commemoration, that we hope the British governments will be able to take part in as well and that although we'll be remembering events that were tumultuous, and indeed divisive between the UK and the people of Ireland at the time, nowadays we can look at them 100 years on, a bit more dispassionately perhaps and able to give those events and those who took part in them the respect that the historical memory deserves. ""Now clearly if the relationship between Britain and Ireland is as good as it can possibly be, that will be easier to do.""The state visit next year will take it on to an even stronger level. It will add momentum to all of this and I think that will be helpful in the context of remembering the Rising.""Mr Higgins, a former Labour government minister, poet and academic, has met members of the Royal Family before.Both he and his wife met the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in June 2012 at Belfast's Lyric Theatre, and he has also met Princess Anne and the Duke of Kent.Though he has visited the UK several times since becoming president, these were not full state visits.The Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, welcomed the news.""This is a further demonstration of the warm and positive relationship that now exists between Ireland and the United Kingdom,"" he said.It is expected that the Queen will host a state banquet for the president, during which both heads of state will make speeches.Although the official programme is yet to be finalised it is expected that Mr and Mrs Higgins will stay at Windsor Castle from 8 April to 10 April.The president is expected to include official visits to the prime minister at Downing Street as well as to the leader of the Opposition.In line with other state visits it is likely the Lord Mayor of the City of London will host a banquet for the president and it is also expected that the Queen will host a state banquet.Recent state visits include the president of South Korea, Her Excellency Park Geun-hye. A state visit is the highest level of diplomatic recognition between two countries in a bilateral relationship. The key difference between an inward state visit to the UK and other routine official visits, is the direct involvement of the Queen and other members of the Royal Family, and the ceremonial elements that are always integral to these programmes."

Alternative for Germany wants the euro abolished, with states returning to their original currencies.Opinion polls suggest the party is unlikely to win widespread support in September's general elections.But analysts say it could skim enough votes from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats to make it harder for her to retain power.About 1,500 members of the Alternative for Germany, established last month, cheered as party founder Bernd Lucke outlined its stance.""Because of the euro, people in southern Europe don't hesitate to express their disgust toward Germany, using old Nazi comparisons,"" he said. ""The euro was a failure and it would be bad if we continue to believe in this fairy tale,"" he said.""If the euro fails, Europe doesn't fail,"" he added, challenging an assertion made frequently by Mrs Merkel.Earlier, Professor Lucke told the BBC he wanted to see a ""gradual dismantling of the euro as a common currency"".""We think that Europe has big problem coping with the euro as a common currency, since there are member countries of the eurozone which have big competitiveness problems, and which actually need a devaluation and can't have it,"" he said, citing Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and France as examples.He argues that bailouts aggravate rather than solve problems in southern European countries, though he says the party is not opposed to European unity.The party has attracted support from a number of academics and disillusioned members of Mrs Merkel's CDU.It also wants to introduce Swiss-style national referendums into EU decision-making, including on issues such as economic rescue packages.Polls suggest, however, that two-thirds of Germans remain in favour of the single currency.One poll earlier this month suggested that 7% of Germans would vote for the new party, and another 17% would consider doing so.But  there is doubt over whether it will garner the 5% of the vote required to enter the German parliament in September's general elections.Correspondents say Mrs Merkel remains comfortably ahead in terms of popularity, but must tread a thin line between those who are frustrated with frequently bailing out poorer eurozone countries, and those who support German efforts to preserve the euro."

The US also announced it would begin formal talks to be followed by the direct Afghan talks.Mr Karzai objected to the office, saying the Taliban flag and sign saying ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"" which were initially erected there showed the Taliban were trying to portray themselves as a government-in-exile.He warned that the High Peace Council, which he has empowered to negotiate for his government, would not take part in any peace talks unless the process was ""Afghan-led"". The president relented after receiving reassurances from US Secretary of State John Kerry, who also persuaded the Qatari government to get the Taliban to take down the flag and sign.Following Tuesday's attack in Kabul, Mr Karzai said the Taliban could not open an office for peace in Qatar and at the same time continue to kill people in Afghanistan.""The enemies of the people of Afghanistan once again proved with their failed attack that they are against peace, stability and progress in Afghanistan,"" he said.US ambassador James Cunningham said the attack had failed to achieve its goals and demonstrated ""the futility of the Taliban's efforts to use violence and terror to achieve their aims"".White House spokesman Jay Carney later said that in their video conference Mr Obama and Mr Karzai had both ""reaffirmed that an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process is the surest way to end violence and ensure lasting stability in Afghanistan and the region"".""And they reiterated their support for an office in Doha for the purpose of negotiations between the High Peace Council and authorized representatives of the Taliban.""The two leaders also discussed the handover of responsibility for security from Nato to Afghan forces last week, the importance of Afghan-led reconciliation efforts, preparations for Afghanistan's 2014 elections, and negotiations on the bilateral security agreement.""The two presidents reaffirmed that free, fair, and credible elections would be critical to Afghanistan's future,"" Mr Carney said.The BBC's Jane Little in Washington says Tuesday's attack highlights just how difficult the bridge-building process will be."

But what is royal protocol and is it necessary?Barack Obama was probably not aware that he was doing anything unusual when making a toast ""to the Queen"" and then continuing with a short speech.  According to protocol, however, he should have stopped after the toast. The band, taking its cue from the word Queen, struck up with the national anthem leaving the president struggling to make himself heard.What happens when the Queen is toasted is all part of protocol, an elaborate set of customs and rules that govern interactions with the British royal family.Some fuss was also made during a previous visit by the Obamas, when Michelle put her arm around the Queen, another protocol breach.Mrs Obama's action echoed similar slip-ups by Australian prime ministers. In 2000, John Howard appeared to have put his arm around the Queen, but that was as nothing compared to the furore caused by Paul Keating when he put his arm around the Queen during her 1992 tour of Australia, and was dubbed ""the Lizard of Oz"".When meeting a royal, there are rules about who can speak first, where to look, what to call them, how you should stand and when you should sit. It is a mysterious business to the uninitiated. But it stems from a time when monarchs were accorded an almost divine status and had to be treated accordingly.""From medieval times, monarchs were divinely appointed to rule by God, so they were kind of seen as gods, so they demanded to be treated as gods,"" says Dr Kate Williams, a historian at London's Royal Holloway university.""They are treated as people set apart from the rest of us, so primarily what it is creating is distance and grandeur.""In short, says Dr Williams, ""you don't kiss them, you don't touch them, you bow - over and over again.""But in an era when a woman with ancestors who worked in the coal mines can become a princess, does royal etiquette really matter?The reaction to Mrs Obama touching the Queen in 2009 would suggest it does to some people. ""Meeting the Queen may never be the same again after an extraordinary show of affection with Michelle Obama,"" wrote Andrew Pierce in the Daily Telegraph in 2009.For David Miller, director of Debrett's, royal etiquette is a helpful set of instructions to show people how to behave in an unfamiliar social setting.""It's a code of conduct in terms of the way in which people behave at occasions and eventualities that they do not encounter on an everyday basis,"" he says.""Yes, it's wrapped up in history and tradition, but it's also practical, universal and there to avoid embarrassment.""Royal protocol can be viewed as an expression of respect for the Queen.William Hanson, a protocol expert who trained staff for the luxury liner Queen Mary II, says the Queen, with all she has been through, her unique perspective and position in the nation's history, deserves the respect she is afforded.""It's because we respect her and what she stands for - she stands for all that is great in British society,"" he says.But there is evidence that things are becoming more relaxed.Jennie Bond spent 14 years negotiating royal protocol as a part of her job as royal correspondent for the BBC.""I don't think that they are as hot on etiquette as most people think they are,"" she says.""They like people to curtsy, but you're always told at royal briefings that it's up to you. As a journalist, I never did.""All this thing about not speaking to the Queen unless you're spoken to, I don't believe that, I always used to tell her jokes.""Dr Williams says royal etiquette has adapted to reflect the shift in what we expect from our royal family.""I think it is changing, I think in the earlier period people wanted their monarch to be set apart from them, that's what they wanted, they wanted someone more powerful [to protect them],"" she says.""We're less and less engaged with the idea of a monarch being distant. For example, Princess Diana gained popularity because she was so much less formal.""But Mr Hanson believes etiquette still has a role to play, beyond royal circles as much as within them.""These things matter, especially when you're doing business with eastern countries such as China, where they take it even more seriously than Britain,"" he says.""The Japanese, the Chinese, the Middle Eastern countries, are more concerned with protocol day-to-day.""Mr Hanson sees a deeper importance behind the principles of etiquette.""If you get the little things right, all the other things fall into place. It's about respect and deference in society, and that is what we're lacking.""As for the recent faux pas by Mr Obama, Mr Hanson says: ""It's not going to spell the end of cordial relations between America and Britain, but it's always nice to get these things right."""
15037	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24202479	News	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"As Iran's President Hassan Rouhani prepares to address the United Nations General Assembly, there are signs that he is ready for substantive negotiations with the US on his country's nuclear programme, says BBC Persian's Bahman Kalbasi.In a month since taking office, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has signalled a sharp departure from the foreign policy and the tone of his predecessor.The eagerness of his administration to break away from eight years of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's bombastic pronouncements was apparent three weeks ago when the new foreign minister wished Jews a ""Happy Rosh Hashanah"" before asserting that Iran had never denied the Holocaust, adding: ""The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone.""Mr Rouhani has also exchanged ""positive"" letters with US President Barack Obama, and told the US broadcaster NBC that Iran wants to engage with the world and not develop nuclear weapons. He has even become the first Iranian president to pen an op-ed in a US newspaper. Writing in the Washington Post last week, he called for ""constructive"" interaction with other countries and declared Iran's readiness to help end the conflict in Syria.The message President Rouhani is trying to convey is clear - that he has ""complete authority"" and ""sufficient political latitude"" to engage with the US and its allies on the substance of their concerns.Gary Sick, a former White House National Security Adviser, told the BBC: ""What we have seen already has been such a dramatic shift. Rouhani and his team are the 'anti-Ahmadinejad'.""The sound of the rhetoric makes it so much easier for an American president to react positively.""The positive tone was evident in Obama's interview with TeleMundo TV. President Rouhani's overtures are of the kind we have not seen before and we should test it.""The talk of an ""accidental"" meeting between the two presidents in the halls of the UN's headquarters this week has gone from wishful thinking to a real possibility.  The mood in New York is also very different from the previous years. Gone are the protests and annual adverts on TV and billboards on Times Square with big pictures of Mr Ahmadinejad, denouncing his anti-Israel rhetoric and warning about Iran's nuclear programme.Instead, diplomats are waiting with anticipation to see how the new president gets Iran out of the international relations mess he has inherited from Mr Ahmadinejad.There is little doubt that Mr Rouhani's talk of co-operation with the world has put sceptics in the US on the defensive.Opponents of US-Iran dialogue cannot keep up with the flurry of interviews, tweets and positive signals thrown out by Mr Rouhani and his media team. But the Iranian charm offensive brings to light two critical questions - can Mr Rouhani turn his words into deeds, and is Washington ready to make a deal with Tehran?Robert Einhorn, a former state department special adviser for non-proliferation and arms control who was part of the US negotiating team at talks between world powers and Iran, says: ""I believe Obama administration is prepared to address Iran's concerns very seriously and flexibly provided that the administration sees real movement on the Iranian side.""""Under Ahmadinejad, the perception in Washington was that Iran wasn't really interested in a deal. That has changed. I think the administration believes there is a real opportunity here.""  Five years into Mr Obama's presidency, have the stars finally aligned for constructive US-Iran talks? Many believe so.The opportunity at hand is largely the result of the Iranian election, in which Mr Rouhani's surprise victory ushered in the same moderate politicians who prior to the Ahmadinejad era had agreed to suspend Iran's uranium enrichment programme and helped the US defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan.The White House, however, tends to view Iran's new openness as a sign that sanctions have worked. However, that assessment may miss the important changes taking place in Iran and tempt Washington to push for even more sanctions to elicit even greater Iranian flexibility.""There is a temptation in Washington to believe that no positive step is taken unless the US issues a threat, takes military action or imposes sanctions,"" a European diplomat at the UN said.In conversations with the Iranian side, it is clear they have doubts about whether the US is ready to take nuclear diplomacy to a new level.Iranian nuclear concessions will likely only be offered - even by Mr Rouhani - if Mr Obama puts significant sanctions relief on the table.If that is not forthcoming, Iranian hardliners will be able to attack the president for offering too much for no tangible reward.They denounced him as a traitor in 2003 when, as Iran's top nuclear negotiator, he agreed to the suspension of Iran's uranium enrichment activities without gaining any US concessions.But Mr Rouhani is unlikely to once again offer the West anything on credit.The problem is that some of the most hard-hitting sanctions can only be lifted by the US Congress. It remains to be seen whether Mr Obama has what it takes to neutralise Congress in the same way in which Mr Rouhani appears to have temporarily pacified Iran's parliament. The week ahead at the UN will provide some clues.What is for certain is that millions of Iranians will be watching proceedings in New York for reactions to the president they elected into office, despite all odds, to see if both he and their country's opponents seize the moment and find a peaceful resolution to their dispute.

He reaffirmed that clear evidence that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons would be a ""game changer"", but that any response would not be rushed. Earlier Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the US was no longer ruling out arming the rebels.Meanwhile, US media reports are quoting unnamed US officials as saying Israel has conducted an air strike in Syria.They say the attack probably happened on Thursday or Friday, but Israeli aircraft did not enter Syrian airspace. The report say the target was likely to be an arms depot or a weapons shipment en route to Hezbollah in Lebanon. There has been no confirmation from the US or Israeli governments.Mr Obama told reporters in Costa Rica on Friday that as a commander-in-chief he could rule nothing out ""because circumstances change"".But he added he did not foresee a scenario in which ""American boots on the ground in Syria"" would be good for either America or Syria.He also said he had already consulted with Middle Eastern leaders and they agreed with him. Mr Obama reiterated that there was evidence that chemical weapons had been used in Syria, but that ""we don't know when, where or how"".He stressed that if strong evidence was found it would be ""a game changer for us"" because ""there is a possibility that it (weapons) lands in the hands of organisations like Hezbollah"" in neighbouring Lebanon.On Thursday, Mr Hagel became the first senior US official to state publicly that Washington was reconsidering its opposition to supplying weapons to rebel forces.""Arming the rebels - that's an option,"" he told reporters.""You look at and rethink all options. It doesn't mean you do or you will. These are options that must be considered with the international community.""With no appetite for direct military intervention, many US officials increasingly feel that arming the rebels is now the least-worst option, the BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says.US allies such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia are already providing weapons to various groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.The pressure to act has intensified in recent days after emerging evidence that Syria has used chemical weapons such as the nerve gas sarin.'Pools of blood'Mr Obama spoke after more than 40 people were reportedly killed by government troops in north-western Syria on Thursday.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Violations Documentation Centre in Syria said the incident occurred in al-Bayda, near the port of BaniyasAn online video appears to show seven bodies in pools of blood. State media blamed the incident on ""terrorists"".It also reported that ""a number of terrorists"" had been killed when government forces captured a cache of arms and ammunition in the area.Al-Bayda is reportedly a predominantly Sunni Muslim village located in an area inhabited largely by members of President Assad's Alawite sect, a heterodox offshoot of Shia Islam. More than 70,000 people have been killed since fighting between government forces and rebels erupted in March 2011."

This will be replaced by a new £140 flat rate, with inflation expected to push this up to £155 by 2015 or 2016.The state pension age will rise to 66 for both men and women by 2020.The Queen's Speech outlined plans to increase the state pension age further to 67 between 2026 and 2028 - affecting those aged 52 or younger now.The speech also signalled government plans for this state pension age to continue to rise automatically in line with longevity. This could be done either through a formula linking pension age to average life expectancy, or through a regular official review.  A universal flat-rate payment in England, Wales and Scotland would be the biggest overhaul of the system for decades.The flat-rate pension will only be available for new pensioners reaching state pension age, rather than the millions of existing pensioners.This could create a two-tier system of state pension for some time. Existing pensioners, when the system changed, would still gain their entitlement under the old system, but those who reach pension age after the changes come in would get the new flat rate.More than one-and-a-half million eligible pensioners do not claim pension credit, and the government believes that such individual losses of entitlement would not occur under a simpler flat-rate system.The self-employed, and some women, are also likely to benefit, as National Insurance rules have meant they have tended to get a lower state pension.However, there is likely to be debate about the fairness of a flat rate that makes no distinction between poor and wealthy pensioners.""We are delighted by this confirmation of the government's commitment to a long-awaited, landmark reform,"" said Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF).""This is another big step towards a simpler, more generous state pension that no longer penalises people for saving. A new system will take millions out of means-tested benefits and will encourage people to take control of their own age by saving towards it.""We are all living longer, so it is inevitable that retirement ages move upwards to reflect that. The trade-off for working longer must be a better state pension come retirement."""

The prime minister had pushed for military action following the suspected chemical weapons attack on 21 August. The US says it killed 1,429 people and was carried out by the Syrian government.It is a claim that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denies.President Obama had previously said that the use of chemical weapons would represent a ""red line"" that would change his thinking about intervening in a conflict in which more than 100,000 people have died.UN inspectors investigating the attacks arrived in the Netherlands on Saturday with samples from site visits, which will be tested in laboratories in Europe.President Obama said in his speech on Saturday that he had decided the US should take military action against the Syrian regime, but said he would formally ask congress to authorise military action.He said he was ""confident"" that the US government had made a case for military action without the need to wait for the United Nations inspectors to compile their report.He added he was comfortable going forward without the support of the UN Security Council ""that, so far, has been completely paralysed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable.""As a consequence, many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress, and undoubtedly they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the prime minister supported taking action.""Yet, while I believe I have the authority to carry out this action without specific congressional authorisation I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course and our actions will be even more effective.""UK Foreign Secretary William Hague tweeted that President Obama's address was a ""fine speech"".And Lord Ashdown said: ""This was a brave and principled act from a brave and principled president.""It opens up all sorts of different new possibilities, one of which is the UK Parliament certainly could reconsider its position."" Lord Ashdown had been critical of the decision to not take military action in Syria in the aftermath of the vote, saying the UK was ""hugely diminished"".Writing in the Observer on Sunday, he said the result of Thursday's vote had ""made it more difficult for Barack Obama to act"".Labour leader Ed Miliband has not commented on the president's speech, but has previously said he does not believe that the House of Commons vote means the UK cannot make a difference to ""innocent civilians"" in Syria. The White House has now sent draft legislation to Congress formally asking for approval to use military force in Syria to ""deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade"" the potential for further chemical attacks. Although the president acknowledged that US military chiefs stood ready to act, his pledge to wait for a vote effectively rules out intervention until Congress returns to session on 9 September.Russian President Vladimir Putin - an ally of Syria - has challenged the US to present its case for military intervention to the UN, and has called for further talks at the G20 summit in St Petersburg on Thursday.Russia has previously warned that ""any unilateral military action bypassing the UN Security Council"" would be a ""direct violation of international law"".The five permanent members of the UN Security Council - Russia, China, the US, UK and France - have been divided on taking action in Syria.Meanwhile, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said the Commons vote - although ""shocking"" - was ""understandable"" given that intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan had been ""far more perilous and difficult than we expected"".People fear that ""we will end up in a 'quagmire'"" in Syria, he said in the Sunday Times.But he added the conflict in Syria was ""crucial to our security"" and warned that Britain would have to take sides sooner or later.""Intervention can be uncertain, expensive and bloody.

Are these the conditions that will allow us to achieve... a democratic transition in Syria?"" he asked.Mr Sabra was also fiercely critical of the international community, accusing it of failing to punish the Syrian government after the 21 August poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians near Damascus.The Syrian government and military deny they were involved.""The international community has focused on the murder weapon, which is the chemical weapons, and left the murderer unpunished and forgotten the victims,"" he added.The SNC was the original main opposition group outside Syria but broadened almost a year ago into a wider coalition, of which it still remains the biggest component.Mr Sabra's statement came as US Secretary of State John Kerry was preparing to meet United Nations and Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in London on Monday.The Syrian government has already agreed to attend peace talks, as has Ahmed Jarba, the leader of the umbrella opposition coalition.George Sabra's declaration underlines the difficult task facing the Americans in trying to get a unified and credible opposition delegation to take part, says the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut. Mr Jarba has faced a storm of protest within the coalition leadership, our correspondent says, with the group already accused of being out of touch with the situation on the ground. Several of the major rebel fighting groups have renounced the coalition and have rejected the idea of talks.Meanwhile, more radical groups, who are allied to al-Qaeda and reject democracy altogether, have been told by its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri not to compromise and keep fighting for an Islamic state.Also on Sunday, Syrian state-run TV reported that an International Red Cross mission had come under attack in the north-western province of Idlib, with some workers ""abducted"". A spokesman for the Red Cross, Ewan Watson, said he could not confirm or deny the report but was in the process of finding out the facts.Separately, Syria's Red Crescent reportedly said on Sunday it had evacuated at least 1,500 people over the weekend from a rebel-held Damascus suburb besieged by the army for months.""Around 1,500 people, most of them women and children, were evacuated from a point on the outskirts of Muadhamiya al-Sham and taken to shelters,"" Red Crescent head of operations Khaled Erksoussi told AFP.More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN.Earlier this month, the UN estimated that more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes by the country's civil war by the end of 2014.No date has been fixed for peace talks, but they are expected in the middle of next month."

If the Syrians quickly backed down, that could let President Obama off the hook for a vote that is going to be very tricky for him.But if this is choreography, then there are some startlingly good actors in the White House and at the US Department of State, who appear less than impressed.At State, they sounded very cynical about the Russian plan: ""Picking up this ball and turning it into something it was never intended to be is an example, quite frankly, we think, of yet another stalling tactic.""  The White House say they will ""look hard"" at the idea but note Mr Assad's track record doesn't suggest he can be trusted. They argue that only their threat of force has brought this response, so it makes the case for a ""yes"" vote.They have a point, but I suspect many more in Congress - who don't want action anyway - will feel this glimmer of hope is another reason to vote ""no"".If the White House has based its whole case on common sense, then there is nothing more common sense than putting chemical weapons beyond use. It will make other countries even more keen on the UN route.It is a distraction from the big sell, another question to divert President Obama from making a straight case. If action is delayed, it will annoy those senators who want a grander action aimed at regime change, even if that is now called ""degrading assets"". It raises even more memories of Iraq - the ability of regimes to play games with weapons inspectors and for the US to use that as a reason for action. Mr Kerry was ""thinking aloud"" the other day when he envisaged some circumstances where there could be boots on the ground. This is being called ""a rhetorical statement"" by his staff. I dislike politicians being forced to speak in confined straight lines, but you can see why their communications directors may not feel the same.Many in the world may regard this as a hopeful day.

It gave no details.The opening of a Taliban office is seen as a step in formalising a channel for talks between Kabul and the  militants.

The report alleges that in areas they control, ISIS forces had committed numerous serious rights abuses, including some that amount to war crimes, such as abductions, arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment, and unlawful killings.Ten former detainees interviewed by an Amnesty researcher in the past month recounted ""a shocking catalogue of abuses"", the report said, including being flogged with rubber generator belts or cables, tortured with electric shocks or forced to adopt a painful stress position in which their wrists were secured together over one shoulder.Some of those held by ISIS were suspected of theft; others of ""crimes"" against Islam, such as smoking, alcohol consumption or sex outside marriage, the report added. Others were seized for challenging ISIS's rule or because they belonged to rival rebel groups.Amnesty said it was told that several children had received severe floggings. Two detainees described how they had seen a 14-year-old get more than 90 lashes during interrogation at Sadd al-Baath, an ISIS prison beside a dam on the Euphrates river at al-Mansoura.Amnesty said the local Sharia court judge at Sadd al-Baath invariably appeared wearing an explosives belt and had ""instituted a reign of terror over its detainees"".Former detainees accused him of presiding over grotesquely unfair trials lasting no more than a few minutes, and of handing down death penalties which were subsequently carried out.""After years in which they were prey to the brutality of the Assad regime, the people of Raqqa and Aleppo are now suffering under a new form of tyranny imposed on them by ISIS, in which arbitrary detention, torture and executions have become the order of the day,"" Mr Luther said.Raqqa, a city sheltering around a million people, is under the full control of ISIS.Smaller but better funded than other rebel groups, it has historically been made up of foreign jihadists from Arab countries - particularly Iraq, but also Libya, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia - Russia's north Caucasus, and Europe.But activists from Raqqa told the BBC's Newsnight that it was now attracting more and more Syrian recruits. In the past few months, ISIS has made significant advances, largely at the expense of rebel brigades affiliated to the Western-backed Free Syrian Army, and controls a wide swathe of northern Syria close to the Turkish border.Amnesty called on the international community to help to block the flow of arms to Isis and other armed groups implicated in war crimes and serious rights abuses.It also renewed its appeal to the Syrian government to ""end its violations of human rights and international law, including the use of torture in its own detention centres"".

Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing was ""astonished"" by the report, saying it was rare for a country's leader to insult its neighbour, China's Xinhua news agency reports.Mr Abe is serving as Japan's top leader for a second time, after a brief period in power in 2006-7. He is the fifth Japanese prime minister that Mr Obama has met in office. His visit is seen as a bid to shore up a security alliance between the two countries that goes back decades. Ties were strained somewhat under the previous Democratic Party (DPJ) administration amid a row over the relocation of a US military base in Okinawa.But Mr Abe, who heads a Liberal Democratic Party administration, has spoken out about the need to prioritise the Japan-US alliance amid a changing regional dynamic. In his Washington Post interview, Mr Abe said improved ties with Washington were top of his agenda in the US.On the bitter row with China over disputed islands in the East China Sea, he said US support was key. Both Beijing and Tokyo have ships in waters around the islands - known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China - leading to fears of a clash. Japan controls the islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan.""It is important for us to have them recognise that it is impossible to try to get their way by coercion or intimidation,"" Mr Abe said, referring to China.""In that regard, the Japan-US alliance, as well as the US presence, would be critical.""The US has urged restraint from both sides, while Chinese state media has warned the US against taking sides.Mr Obama's top Asia advisor, Danny Russel, said on Thursday that the president ""remains supportive of the peaceful efforts to find diplomatic resolution to outstanding issues of territorial claims"", AFP reports.He added that Mr Obama has ""been clear in the United States' opposition to coercive actions or unilateral steps that threaten the stability of the region"".On North Korea, both the US and Japan support action being taken against Pyongyang in the UN Security Council in the wake of its third nuclear test, on 12 February. Economic ties are also expected to be on the agenda for the meeting.  The two leaders are expected to discuss the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposal for a free-trade agreement between countries in North America, Asia and South America. Japan has discussed becoming part of the TPP over the years. But this has been met with opposition from farmers, who say that tariff removals will have an a negative impact on their industry."

Panama's vice-president and a former ally of outgoing President Ricardo Martinelli, Mr Varela won a clear majority and easily defeated the president's hand-picked successor, Jose Domingo Arias. Mr Varela leads the conservative Panamenista Party and helped Mr Martinelli get elected in 2009. But the two had a bitter falling out in 2011, when Mr Varela was fired from his job as foreign minister. He subsequently became one of Mr Martinelli's fiercest critics, accusing his government of corruption. Mr Varela, aged 50, is the scion of one of Panama's richest families and studied engineering in the United States. He is likely to continue many of Mr Martinelli's economic policies, but says he will focus on helping the poor and reducing inequality.

It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator.""In another tense moment, Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, said Mrs Clinton's acknowledgement that she had not read the cables from Libya seeking additional security ahead of the attack was ""inexcusable"".""Had I been president at the time and I found that you did not read the cables,"" he said, ""I would have relieved you of your post.""Mrs Clinton told the senators her department was implementing - as well as going above and beyond - 29 recommendations by an independent panel that investigated the incident.Earlier, Mrs Clinton's voice cracked with emotion as she described the moment she and President Barack Obama welcomed home the coffins of those killed in the Benghazi attacks. ""I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters, and the wives left alone to raise their children,"" she said.Mrs Clinton testified in the afternoon before the House foreign affairs committee, where Republican members pressed her on why cables and other memos about security deficiencies in Benghazi seemed to have been ignored.""The dots here were connected ahead of time. The state department saw this was coming,"" said Representative Ed Royce, a Republican and the chairman of the panel. ""The state department didn't act.""Four state department employees have been put on administrative leave over the Benghazi attack.Mrs Clinton, who is stepping down from her post in two weeks, has spent a month recuperating from a series of ailments in December, which delayed her testimony.She is considered a strong candidate for the Democratic nomination for president should she run in 2016.Mr Obama has nominated Democratic Senator John Kerry to replace her as Secretary of State."

Crime evolves and we must evolve with it.""In the last year alone, we have seen successful confiscation orders against people who have participated in all types of crime, including drug dealing, selling counterfeit goods, embezzlement, human trafficking and benefit fraud.""We will continue to use our experience and expertise to maximise disruption to criminal enterprises.""In the past financial year, more than £4.3 million was netted from those involved in the so-called ""black fish"" cases, relating to large-scale undeclared landings of fish in the north of Scotland.Confiscation orders totalling £4,314,290 were made last year against a number of vessel skippers, as well as Shetland Catch Ltd and Fresh Catch Ltd.Others whose wallets were targeted included James Mangan, 54, Robert Robb, 65, and Craig Hunter, 41, members of an organised crime network involved in importing Class A drugs, which was unearthed by Strathclyde Police's Operation Trust.The Civil Recovery Unit (CRU) will also recover £5.6m after Aberdeen-based drilling company Abbot Group Ltd accepted it had benefited from corrupt payments made in connection with a 2006 contract entered into by one of its overseas subsidiaries and an overseas oil and gas company. The money will be paid in three stages to the end of March 2015.The ownership and structure of Abbot is said to have changed significantly since that time.In another notable case, the home of gangland figure Kevin ""Gerbil"" Carroll, who was gunned down in a supermarket car park in 2010, was seized by authorities last year.Over the last 10 years more than £50m was netted by the SOCD, which deals with the confiscation of proceeds of crime following a conviction.The remaining £30.5m was secured by the CRU, which can recover proceeds of crime through the civil courts without the need for a criminal conviction.Last year confiscation orders amounting to £8,025,600 were secured by the SOCD and orders to the tune of £4,123,156 were granted following work by the CRU.Solicitor General Lesley Thomson QC, who announced the figures, said: ""By full use of the proceeds of crime legislation, law enforcement can strike at the very heart of criminality in Scotland to ensure that criminal networks big and small are disrupted and dismantled.""My message is clear - if you try to make a profit from crime, the Crown will use this legislation to the maximum to take that profit from you and ensure it is put it to a much better use in communities across Scotland through the Scottish government's CashBack scheme.""The initiative, CashBack for Communities, is a scheme which takes money recovered through proceeds of crime legislation and invests it in activities and facilities for young people at risk of turning to a life of crime.Since it began in 2007, more than £50m has been ploughed back into Scottish communities.Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said: ""Prosecutors and police are cracking down on organised crime and criminals have nowhere to hide.""More than £12m has been confiscated from criminals last year, hitting them where it hurts - their wallets.""Our communities are benefiting from the hard work of prosecutors and police putting ill-gotten gains to good use through our CashBack for Communities Programme, which invests crooks' cash in facilities and activities for our young people and their communities across the length and breadth of the country."""

A grant to help with funeral costs and a telephone allowance for pensioners have been cut.The price of a pint of beer and a packet of cigarettes will both increase from midnight by 10 cents (8p).The opposition accused the government of targeting the elderly in the budget.The savings measures include a review of the Irish medical card system, which entitles eligible people to access certain health services free of charge.The government said it aims to save 113m euros (£95m) by removing all ""ineligible and redundant"" medical cards, but the opposition said the changes would mean many pensioners would lose access to free health care.There will also be greater restrictions on sickness benefit - the number of days a person must report sick from work before they are eligible to claim will double from three to six days.  Maternity benefit is being ""standardised"" for new claimants, in a move the government said will save 30m euros (£25m) over the next year.However, the government is introducing free GP care for all children under five years of age, and has set aside 37m euros (£31m) to provide this new benefit.The main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, said the medical card changes would badly affect 35,000 pensioners and accused the minister of ""robbing grandparents so he can give free GP care to their grandchildren"".There will be no change to the state pension, child benefit or carers' allowances, and pensioners will still be entitled to free public transport and TV licences.Finance Minister Michael Noonan said his government was ""100% committed to the 12.5% corporation tax rate"". The Irish coalition had come under pressure from Europe to raise the business tax in the aftermath of the international bailout.But Mr Noonan said the Republic of Ireland's corporation tax rate was a ""settled policy"" and ""will not change"".The Irish economy is emerging from one of the deepest recessions in the eurozone, having sought an 85bn euros (£72m) international bailout in November 2010.At the weekend, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny told his annual party conference the Republic of Ireland was on track to exit the bailout programme by December.Mr Noonan introduced his budget by saying: ""The story of insolvent Ireland is familiar to all our people and the sacrifices people have had to make in recent years are well known.He said financial assistance from the IMF and the European authorities ""came at a high price"" as Ireland had ""lost its sovereignty"".However, he said that Tuesday's budget was the first since 2007 to be delivered against a backdrop of rising employment.""By the time the majority of the measures that I have announced today become law on the first of January next, I am confident that Ireland will have left the EU/IMF programme. ""We will have closed this chapter of Ireland's history that began for most of us with the governor of the Central Bank announcing to the Irish public that the country would be forced to turn to the lenders of last resort. ""There will be no promissory notes, there will be no Anglo Irish Bank and there will be no bank guarantee. We will have exited the programme and Ireland will have been handed back her purse.""Mr Noonan added: ""We are well along the recovery path and it is time now, as a nation, to begin to look forward.""Fianna Fáil finance spokesperson, Michael McGrath, said: ""We all hope the country is on the cusp of recovery but I believe it is too early too early to draw any definitive conclusions on that front.""He said: ""This is a budget that targets the elderly, it targets those who hold medical cards, it targets young mothers, it abandons people struggling to kept their home, and yet again, incredibly, the government has gone out of its way to insulate the better off from the worst affects of this budget"".Mr McGrath criticised the withdrawal of the 850 euros (£718) bereavement grant and said the way that pensioners in particular had been treated in the budget was ""nothing short of disgraceful"".""Not only will many of them now lose their medical card, they will have higher prescription charges, they will lose their telephone allowance, their bereavement grant is gone and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is going up.  ""Even the dead, minister, are not safe from this government.  As if it isn't enough to take a property tax from the estate of those who are deceased, but the modest grant that their loved one gets to given them the dignity of a decent burial is now being removed by this government,"" Mr McGrath added."

The Sun is outraged by the story. Under the headline ""tweet and sour"", the paper insists the remarks tweeted by Paris Brown when she was 16 would be ""unpleasant from any teenager - let alone one on the public payroll as a youth crime tzar"".The Times appears to take a more reasoned approach, arguing that ""most of this loose talk is the sort of silly thing that teenagers have always done"".  But it goes on to question whether £15,000 of public money should be spent on having a Youth Commissioner at all - suggesting if the post is indeed necessary then ""more diligence"" should have been shown during the recruitment process.The Guardian carries a piece by blogger Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, who believes the controversy raises a wider issue about social media.  Young people do not distinguish as much as older generations between their online lives and the things they are doing when they are not on their computers, she explains.""The internet is making teenage life much more public than it would have been in the school corridor.""Elsewhere, the Daily Telegraph suggests on its front page that the price of a first class stamp could rise to £1 within three years if the Royal Mail is privatised.  The warning comes from the campaign group Save Our Royal Mail, which believes the price hike would be likely because a privatised service might no longer be allowed to be exempt from VAT - due to European competition law.  The paper's leader concludes that ""it would be naive to pretend that prices will not go up"" in the event of privatisation, which it believes is ""long overdue"".The Daily Mail is highly critical of advice from the Equalities and Human Rights Commission that minority groups such as druids and vegans should be given special treatment at work.  ""What an insult to Christians"", is the headline. And the paper's editorial is furious: ""So much for the government's promise to stop the quangocrats strangling business with onerous new obligations.""That sense of outrage is shared by the Daily Express.  ""These rights are all wrong,"" it argues, going on to suggest that, at first glance, the idea that druids and pagans will be allowed time off work to celebrate sacred rites ""looks like some kind of April fool"".According to the Independent, an advertising campaign against plans in Scotland to sell cigarettes in plain packages has caused anger among anti-smoking groups. Japan Tobacco International has taken out a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph, showing a picture of what is claimed to be a Department of Health memo questioning whether plain packaging discourages people from buying cigarettes.Finally, the Financial Times reports on the re-emergence of the coach tour as the holiday of choice for many people.  The paper says the trips - once seen as the preserve of elderly people - are coming back into vogue, partly due to the fact that times are tight. One coach tour operator tells the paper that ""this is not a renaissance, but there is a re-invention. We sell the experience, not the mode of transport""."

The opposition Tamil National Alliance (TNA) won 30 seats in the 38-member Northern Provincial Council, which took place four years after the army defeated Tamil Tiger rebels.However, the run-up to the election was marred by allegations of army intimidation that were firmly denied by the authorities.""We learned that opposition candidates and their supporters, as well as voters at large, faced instances of intimidation and harassment,"" the Commonwealth Observer Mission to the elections wrote in its preliminary findings on Tuesday.""The freedom to hold campaign meetings and openly interact with the electorate was restricted,"" the report said, adding that the ""heavy presence and influence of the military"" also compromised the electoral environment.However, it applauded the ""determination and resilience of voters"" who nonetheless turned out to vote, and praised the electoral commission's organisation of the poll as ""impressive"".Meanwhile, the head of a team of South Asian poll monitors, N Gopalaswami, told the BBC that he was ""101% sure that military personnel were involved"" in an attack on the house of a female Tamil opposition candidate a day before the polls.In an email to the BBC, military spokesman Brig Ruwan Wanigasooriya rejected the claims.He said the allegation of military involvement in the attack was made ""by politically inclined people"".""The military was not involved in any of the electoral processes,"" he said.

The Nuclear Iran Prevention Act was drafted well before Mr Rouhani's election victory in June, but critics, including 20 dissenting members of the House of Representatives, believe that more time should be given to finding a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear impasse.""It gives ammunition to the hardliners who will operate against him, so the timing of this bill could not be worse from a foreign policy perspective,"" said Democrat Jim McDermott, who voted against the bill.Iran has described the move as ''unhelpful'' and said that it will not change its nuclear policy.Iranian oil exports have already been halved from pre-sanctions levels when they stood at 2.2 million barrels per day. The house bill obliges the US administration, which has not supported the move, to reduce Iran's oil exports by another one million barrels per day (bpd).  It is uncertain if the Senate will adopt the one million bpd figure when it votes on the bill in September.Mr Rouhani's election victory raised hopes that existing sanctions may be eased after 130 US lawmakers wrote a letter to the White House, asking for all ""diplomatic tools"" to be used in dealing with Iran.  The US treasury department also took the step of expanding a list of medical devices that can be exported to Iran without special permission.Some of the house members who voted in favour of the bill were signatories to the letter asking for a diplomatic approach with regards to Iran.Other members in support of the sanctions bill remained adamant.

At least 80 died in a single incident near Rabaa al-Adawiya on 27 July.Mr McCain and Mr Graham arrived in the Egyptian capital on Monday evening for two days of negotiations.Both senators have made several trips to Egypt since the country's revolution in 2011.Before heading to Cairo, Senator Graham warned that the Egyptian military must back out of politics quickly or risk a cut of the $1.3bn (£860m) in aid that it receives from the US each year. In the meantime the Muslim Brotherhood also navigates a difficult path, the BBC's Caroline Wyatt in Cairo reports.Ending the sit-ins could alienate its own grassroots supporters, our correspondent says, while continuing the protests might further alienate the Egyptian public and increase the prospects of a violent end to the demonstrations.Several prominent Brotherhood figures were arrested in a crackdown on the Islamist movement following Mr Morsi's removal, including Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie and Mr Shater. The US state department said a delegation led by Mr Burns had visited Mr Shater to ""prevent further violence, calm tensions and facilitate an inclusive dialogue to help the transition to a democratically elected civilian government"".However, Mr Shater cut the visit short, saying they should instead meet Mr Morsi.According to Brotherhood spokesman Gehad al-Haddad, Mr Shater told the US delegation that he was in ""no position to speak"" and that they should direct their questions to Mr Morsi.He told the diplomats that Mr Morsi held the key to solving the crisis and that there was no alternative to constitutional legitimacy, according to statements on Mr Haddad's Twitter feed.Separately, Mr Haddad told Reuters news agency that the Brotherhood had rejected the diplomats' pleas to ""swallow the reality"" that Mr Morsi would not return as Egypt's president. There had been reports that the new interim government was prepared to release leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood from custody and offer the group ministerial positions if they called an end to the sit-ins, correspondents say.However, a presidential adviser denied such an offer had been made - and Mr Morsi's supporters repeated that they would accept nothing short of his reinstatement.Meanwhile the EU's envoy, Bernardino Leon, met Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi on Monday.The foreign ministers of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are also involved in the diplomatic push.Over the weekend, the government reiterated its call for Morsi supporters to end their sit-ins peacefully.A government helicopter dropped leaflets over the Rabaa al-Adawiya demonstration which pledged that protesters would face no action if they had not committed a crime. The army removed Mr Morsi following huge protests against him. The new government has outlined its own roadmap leading to fresh elections in 2014."

Under a coalition deal signed last month, a minimum hourly rate of 8.50 euros (£7.11; $11.55) will come into force for the first time in 2015.Our correspondent, Steve Evans, says the SPD will be a minority part of the government and no-one doubts that Chancellor Merkel will be in charge.

Unless Congress wills it otherwise.President Obama clearly feels this deal may be the answer. Others at home and abroad will argue it is not - and that he is in danger of being  hoodwinked.A lot of effort has gone into this - some of it secret. AP has a fascinating article detailing secret talks leading up to the deal. A senior Obama administration official tells us that there has been ""a several-year"" effort intended to ""reinforce"" the wider talks.  Allies are unlikely to mind this, unless they want to find offence. Which brings us to a vital question - what about Israel?Particularly tricky is the obvious dismay of Israel's Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu - he's branded the deal ""a historic mistake"" - and this will embolden the president's critics at home who may claim he has betrayed Israel - always a potent charge in American politics. It is clear from the initial reaction that many will take some convincing that this is a good deal.Politicians in congress have been planning new sanctions and show every sign of pressing ahead with them.A couple of days ago the Democrat leader of the Senate Harry Reid said:""I will support a bill that would broaden the scope of our current petroleum sanctions, place limitations on trade with strategic sectors of the Iranian economy that support its nuclear ambitions, as well as pursue those who divert goods to Iran."" This is critically important. A senior Obama administration official is warning that ""the introduction of new sanctions would, we believe, derail the agreement"". Although technically Obama could veto any new sanctions that would be politically very awkward. Determined senators might find a way to bundle them in with other laws the President wouldn't want to stop. Once again Congress finds itself in a position where it can bring Mr Obama's plans crashing down in flames. Their opposition derailed his plans to attack Syria (although for that he may have been grateful). It brought about a government shutdown and took America to the brink of what some warned was ""economic Armageddon"".It has stopped his plans for gun controls and immigration reform.The recent decision of Senate Democrats to scrap the filibuster for some important deals has only sharpened the sense of hyper-partisan dysfunction. This was called, in a good example of beltway linguistic inflation, ""the nuclear option"". It may play into Iran's very real nuclear option in an unforeseen way. Going on the evidence Mr Obama must know of the risk he is now taking.The gamble that Iran will keep its word is one thing.The gamble that Congress will do as he wishes is quite another - not one I would like to take a bet on.

However, the head of the group's negotiation team, Sumlut Gam, told Reuters the announcement was ""good to hear"" but that they would wait to see what happens on Saturday.Tens of thousands of people have been displaced since the conflict was reignited.The government acknowledged earlier this month that it had been carrying out air attacks on rebel fighters who tried to block military supply routes.The statement from the information ministry said the military would ""follow the command of the president not to carry out offensive attacks except in self-defence"".But it went on to say: ""In an armed conflict, both sides need to halt attacks to cool tensions.""Earlier, Burma's new parliament approved a motion calling for a ceasefire and peace talks to end the 18 months of fighting between the military and Kachin rebels.Burma's new military-backed civilian government - which has embarked on a series of reforms since elections in November 2010 - has pledged to resolve conflicts in border areas with ethnic minority groups.

Our correspondent explains that pressure from the Council played a key role in stopping Yemen's sliding towards a civil war and getting the country's two main power blocks to agree on a political transition.Under the deal, Mr Saleh had to step down in exchange for immunity and politicians formed a national unity government to prepare for elections due to be held in February 2014.

The council statement also expressed concern about reports ""of money and weapons being brought into Yemen from outside for the purpose of undermining the transition''.Yemen has complained to the Council about a seized weapons shipment it says was sent by Iran whom it claims is supporting a southern separatist movement. The ship, Yemen says, contained Iranian-made bomb-making material, suicide belts, explosives, rockets, surface-to-air missiles, grenades and ammunition.Iran has strongly denied the charges, and the UN is investigating the claims."

""Although this is a pan-Army issue, the impact is most serious in the Army Reserve... As a stark indicator, 367 recruits were enlisted in Q1 of 2013-2014 against a target of 1,432.""The prediction against an overall in-year target of 6,383 is that only 50% of this number will be realised.""As part of the coalition government's defence review, the number of regular soldiers is set to fall from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, while reservist numbers are expected to rise from the current 19,000 to 30,000.The Ministry of Defence has carried out several rounds of redundancies so far, with more to follow.Col Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, does not believe increasing the size of the Army Reserve was realistic and accused the government of ""hollowing out"" the armed forces.He told BBC News that the government had been ""cynical"" in deciding soldiers sacked from the regular army would ""suddenly and miraculously"" decide to join the reserves.""Well, clearly that hasn't happened and is unlikely to happen,"" he said.He also criticised the handling of recruitment since it was outsourced to civilian firm, Capita.The new focus on Facebook and Twitter campaigns were no substitute for face-to-face meetings with soldiers, he said.""It's not just like walking into a normal civilian job - it's actually quite daunting.""It's a different world and I think to have personal contact with people who have or are serving is really the most effective way of recruiting,"" he said.He also said the idea of converting the Army Reserve into an American-style national guard could not ""happen overnight"".A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was ""early days"" in the recruitment process and it had ""always been a challenge"".He added that a new offer with better incentives and training for potential recruits and employers had been set this summer, and now the way was clear for a ""sustained recruitment campaign over the next 12 to 18 months"" to start to build the numbers.It said £1.8bn would be invested in training, support and equipment for the reserves over the next 10 years.Last year, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he hoped some of those leaving the slimmed-down regular forces would join the reserve.He said cutting the size of the regular Army was ""unfortunately one of the steps we had to take to rebalance the defence budget""."

A new government can now be formed - three months after a general election.The BBC Berlin correspondent says there are unlikely to be any big changes in government policy, although the SPD has already negotiated a minimum wage.    Under a coalition deal signed last month, a minimum hourly rate of 8.50 euros (£7.11; $11.55) will come into force for the first time in 2015.Our correspondent, Steve Evans, says the SPD will be a minority part of the government and no-one doubts that Chancellor Merkel will be in charge. Her Christian Democrats won an unprecedented victory in September's elections but fell just short of an absolute majority in parliament.  Their traditional coalition partner, the Free Democrats won no seats, forcing Mrs Merkel to seek a new coalition partner.The coalition is to make formal announcements about the cabinet on Sunday but media leaks revealed many of its most prominent members, AFP news agency reported.The all-important finance ministry is thought likely to stay with Wolfgang Schaeuble - the previous finance minster who drove through the tough conditions on bail-outs of euro-zone countries in difficulty.The SPD ballot paves the way for parliament to re-elect Mrs Merkel on Tuesday.Mrs Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU signed a 185-page agreement with the SPD entitled ""Shaping Germany's Future"" in November.Mrs Merkel spoke afterwards of ""mutual trust"" while SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel said it was a fair deal.She said the coalition would stand for ""solid finances, secure prosperity and social security"" and oppose a ""debt union"" in Europe.

Concerns have been raised about membership recruitment which need to be investigated. An officer of the party will carry out an investigation to ensure the integrity of the process.""Questions have also been raised about Labour's selection of candidates for the 2014 European elections after Anne Fairweather, a favourite candidate of the Labour right, failed to make the shortlist.Former Labour General Secretary Peter Watt said: ""The feeling is that as she has a pro-business background she was blocked by the trade unions.""Since Labour lost power in 2010 Mr McCluskey and others on the left of the Labour Party have been vying for influence with ""Blairite"" factions on the right, associated with the think tank Progress, which is mostly funded by Lord Sainsbury.Mr McCluskey said: ""Mandelson also appears untroubled that Lord Sainsbury's vast wealth, channelled through the Progress organisation, has been used to give particular candidates, invariably on the right, an advantage in Labour selections.""Unite, which backed Ed Miliband for the Labour leadership in 2010, is currently one of the party's biggest financial backer. Lord Sainsbury has halted donations to the party, reportedly because he views Mr Miliband a ""mediocre"" leader.Speaking at the Progress conference on 11 May, Lord Mandelson said ""too many"" selections for European or Westminster parliament candidates were being put in the hands of ""one union at worst, a couple of unions at best, orchestrated by a cabal of NEC members.""He warned the party that efforts to recruit more working class candidates should not be confused with recruiting trade union officials.His comments echoed those made by former Home Secretary Alan Johnson, who told Progress in February that increasing the number of working class MPs could not be ""left to a small clique in the affiliated unions who want to get the people who mirror their views into parliament"".At the time Mr McCluskey responded: ""The stale prescriptions offered by the likes of Alan Johnson are the road to defeat and working class disappointment.""

There appears to be less protection for NGO workers at a time they are badly needed as the state fails to carry out basic functions such as education and health care. At the same time there is growing intolerance in society as the use of violence and weapons to address grievances rather than courts of law is on the increase. At least 19 male and female officials working with a countrywide children's polio immunisation campaign have been killed by the Taliban and other Islamic radicals since last July. The worst incident took place in December when five health workers were shot dead by militants in different parts of the country. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the killings, with Mr Ban saying they were ""cruel, senseless, and inexcusable"". But nobody has been caught and the government appears paralysed - unable to prevent further killings.In a worrying development this year, policemen escorting polio teams are now being deliberately targeted. The vaccination drive remains partially suspended in two of Pakistan's four provinces - Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) - and despite the deployment of security forces, there is no indication when the vaccination drive can be completed. Last October the young but prominent educationalist Malala Yousafzai was attacked in her school bus and had to be flown to England for a series of operations. Her attackers were self-proclaimed Pakistani Taliban. Malala, who is only 14, has become an international celebrity and has now been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, but it is still not safe for her to come home. Asma Jahangir, the country's leading human rights lawyer and women's rights advocate, has been forced to respond to a campaign launched by right-wing politicians such as Imran Khan and religious leaders who have called her unsuitable to become the caretaker prime minister when parliament is dissolved.  In reality, no political party has nominated her for the job and it is only the speculative Pakistani media that has suggested her. She has several times refuted claims that she would ever be a candidate for such a job and yet she continues to be attacked by political parties. On 6 February she delivered a blistering rebuttal to Imran Khan, describing his statement against her as ""illogical but also vicious"", saying that he seems to be acting on the cue of the ""establishment"" which is shorthand for the army. His PTI party responded by ""taking note"" of her comments, reasserting their belief she is not suitable for the job and accusing her of bias against the party.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its representative in Pakistan, Ali Dayan Hasan, have been accused by the army of maligning Pakistan in a recent report, which the army described as ""a pack of lies, propaganda-driven and totally biased"". A statement by the media wing of the military said that HRW was trying to add fuel to ""ongoing sectarian violence"" in Pakistan. The military has never before used such language. It was responding to HRW's World Report 2013, a 665-page annual tome which covers human rights in every country in the world and is compiled in New York. The report said ""the security and intelligence services"" have ""continued to allow extremist groups to attack religious minorities"". It also said Pakistan's human rights worsened in 2012 and the military perpetrated ""abuses with impunity in Balochistan"".In fact, such charges against the security forces have been made repeatedly over the years by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, local media groups and other local and international human rights groups such as Amnesty International and the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.  In March 2012, the Supreme Court issued a stern warning to military intelligence services not to overstep their writ, with Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudry saying: ""Who gave you the right to hound people?""In 2012, more than 400 Shias, most of them belonging to the Hazara community of Balochistan, were killed in targeted attacks by Sunni militants. So far this year, more than 100 Shia Hazaras have been killed. No culprits have been arrested and the Hazaras are now fleeing Pakistan en masse as the government provides no relief.Meanwhile some 800 schools have been closed down in KP province and the Federal Administered Tribal Areas because of attacks by militants, while hundreds of primary schools are shut in Balochistan because of violence. Teachers have fled these areas and NGOs dealing with health and education have reduced their operations because of security threats. Farida Afridi, a prominent activist working with tribal women in KP province, was shot dead in July 2012. In January 2013 gunmen shot dead seven aid workers including six women working with ""Support with Working Solutions"", a local NGO in KP province. The culprits have not been found.Foreign aid workers are not immune. A British Muslim doctor working for the International Committee for the Red Cross, Khalil Dale, was kidnapped and then killed in April 2012. More than 60 foreign aid workers left Pakistan in 2012, largely because of security concerns or the refusal of the authorities to renew their visas. Suspicions against foreign NGOs have increased substantially after an unethical ruse by the US Central Intelligence Agency to try to kill Osama bin Laden, by using a fake NGO to try to obtain his blood sample. In the next few months, general elections are expected to be held. But there is a grave political crisis with some parties wanting to delay the elections and the ruling party accusing unnamed dark forces of conspiring to do this. If elections are held, civil society groups are expected to be at the forefront of monitoring the polls, as they have done for past elections. However, the lack of protection for NGOs, the inability or refusal of the state machinery to protect them and the growing intolerance of their neutral stance is dismaying many."

True, he says no decision has been taken. But in his interview with PBS Newshour he said if there was action it would be to send the Syrian regime a ""pretty strong signal"". He goes on to say that it would be ""limited, tailored"" and would not be ""a repetition of, you know, Iraq, which I know a lot of people are worried about - but if we are saying in a clear and decisive but very limited way, we send a shot across the bows saying, stop doing this"".This is a distinction the Obama administration has made repeatedly - not regime change and intervening in Syria's civil war, but teaching them a lesson. Some worry that it is impossible to draw a sensible line between the two. The speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, has written to the president with a number of questions, including • What result is the administration seeking from its response?• What is the intended effect of the potential military strikes?• If potential strikes do not have the intended effect, will further strikes be conducted?More than 100 members of Congress have also written to the president, calling on him to seek their approval before taking action. Mr Boehner doesn't quite call for that, but he does make it clear there are too many unanswered questions for his taste. The president has another problem. The UK Prime Minister David Cameron has been forced to offer MPs a second vote before taking action and to wait for a UN inspectors' report. While administration officials have been careful not to criticise the UK, they are scornful of the UN route, saying the inspectors' report would be ""redundant"", insisting they will not proceed with a Security Council resolution and arguing that Syria must not be able to hide behind the United Nations.Of course, America does not really need the UK's military help to carry out the task. But to go ahead without its closest military ally (perhaps apart from Israel) leaves the US without important diplomatic cover. For a president who has always insisted on the importance of building international coalitions, it would be a bit embarrassing.  "

Mr Morsi is due to go on trial on Monday.Mr Kerry will go on to tour countries in the Middle East and North Africa.John Kerry's visit to Cairo was kept under wraps by US officials until he landed - although Egyptian state media did announce his arrival - the first time a US secretary of State has travelled to Egypt on what is known as an unannounced visit for security reasons.The BBC's Kim Ghattas, travelling with Mr Kerry, says it is the kind of precaution that characterises trips by US officials to countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. This is a sign of US concerns about continued instability in the country, but it is also a reaction to the high level of anti-American resentment in Egypt, our correspondent says.Although Washington has not declared the military takeover that deposed the Islamist Mr Morsi a coup, it has de facto suspended military aid to Egypt in compliance with US law.This has angered supporters of the army, while supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood also feel bitter and accuse the US of letting them down.Mr Kerry's visit comes a day before the trial of Mr Morsi who is accused of inciting the killing of protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012.But the State Department said the timing of Mr Kerry's visit was not connected to the trial, our correspondent adds.Mr Kerry was meeting the interim leaders that assumed control following July's ouster - President Adly Mahmud Mansour, Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi, Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy and army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.He is also reported to be meeting, behind closed doors, members of Egyptian civil society alarmed by a crackdown in which hundreds of people have died.Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan and Morocco are among the countries on the next stages of Mr Kerry's itinerary, which spans 3 to 12 November.After his Egyptian visit, Secretary Kerry will go on to the Saudi capital, Riyadh.The Saudi government has recently expressed its disappointment with what it sees as America's hesitant approach in Syria and a lack of support for the new Egyptian government.Mr Kerry is expected to discuss defence and trade issues with officials, with Syria likely to be high on the agenda across the region.The secretary of state will also meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders to discuss the peace process in Jerusalem and Bethlehem.He will then travel to Algeria and Morocco towards the end of the nine-day trip to chair strategic dialogue meetings.Mr Kerry may also have to face difficult questions over allegations of widespread US spying.In the wake of revelations sparked by leaks from ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, Mr Kerry said last week that spying by the US National Security Agency may have gone too far.

What is expected to be in it?Following the government's latest setback in deporting Abu Qatada, Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs she would bring forward an Immigration Bill. This is expected to allow foreign criminals to be deported more easily. Mrs May has also indicated the bill could encompass plans to tighten the laws relating to the UK Border Agency to make it more effective at deporting people who are in this country illegally. In a speech on immigration at the end of March, Prime Minister David Cameron said he would legislate to make sure illegal immigrants can't get driving licences and also change the rules so private landlords have to check their tenants' immigration status. Both these measures could be included in the Immigration Bill.In January, Prime Minister David Cameron announced his plan to bring forward a Co-operatives Bill to ""help build a fairer economy"" before the next election. He said the bill would cut red tape and consolidate more than a dozen outdated pieces of legislation governing co-operatives and mutuals.The Department of Work and Pensions intends to put forward legislation to introduce a single weekly state pension of £144 per week, which will replace the current pension of £107 plus means-tested top-ups. The move could benefit 750,000 women who reach pension age between 2016 and 2026 by around £9 a week.The government intends to introduce measures which simplify the currently complex laws which protect consumers from unsatisfactory service. A consultation paper last year set out proposals to overhaul and strengthen core consumer rights and remedies in relation to faulty goods and poor services, and update and clarify consumer rights and remedies in relation to 'digital content' and other things bought online.The government wants to introduce a cap on the cost of social care, as recommended by the Dilnot Commission. This is going to be a complex piece of legislation, as it will involve setting up the assessment process which decides what counts towards the total cost of a person's social care, and which costs will be covered free by the NHS. People who look after elderly or vulnerable relatives could gain the legal right to ask for financial support, professional assistance or home adaptations from their local council. The government intends to allocate around £150 million to help fund the move, although councils may still struggle to implement the proposals at a time of budget cuts. The government wants to make it an offence for a dog to be dangerously out of control in any place, including all private property. If a dog attacks a guide dog it will be an aggravated offence, and when courts are deciding if a dog needs to be destroyed the character of the owner will be taken in to account.There could be a slight overhaul of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. This would most likely involve extending rights of access to data which has been released, including rights of re-use. It could also involve limiting the use of freedom of information requests by extending the government's ability to refuse them on the basis of cost. The government is expected to formally introduce a law banning the use of wild animals in circuses. Circus owners have already been given notification of this, and they have been told they will probably have until December 2015 to comply.There is likely to be a bill paving the way for the second phase of the high speed rail link between Birmingham and Leeds, and Birmingham and Manchester. This is a piece of legislation which allows funding to be made available for the early design stages of a big project, before the whole project is given the go-ahead.Home Secretary Theresa May announced in the Commons last year that she intended to legislate to allow the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to investigate private companies which were employed by the police. It is possible that this could be in the Queen's Speech this year, along with other powers to strengthen the IPCC.The commitment to set up a mechanism for constituents to recall their MPs if they've engaged in ""serious wrongdoing"" was set out in the coalition agreement nearly three years ago, but the government has yet to bring in a bill. On one of his recent weekly phone-in shows, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg assured Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, a strong supporter of recall, that he wanted ""recall provisions on the statute book in this parliament"". What's unlikely to make the Queen's Speech...This is the controversial so-called ""snoopers charter"". It refers to legislation which allows for the monitoring of UK citizens' online and mobile communications. Draft proposals have been described as unworkable by MPs, and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said the plans will not happen while the Lib Dem are in government. All this makes it unlikely the bill will make it into the Queen's Speech without a fundamental rewrite, which would be seen as a setback for Home Secretary Theresa May.David Cameron supports minimum alcohol pricing and the government has been consulting on a price of 45p per unit. But several cabinet ministers, including Theresa May, Michael Gove and Andrew Lansley, are said to be against the plan, meaning it is now unlikely to feature in the Queen's Speech.Ministers consulted last year on bringing in plain cigarette packets. Campaigners say it will help discourage young people from taking up smoking, but tobacco companies have said plain packs could easily be illicitly copied and the move could lead to job losses. Recent reports have suggested David Cameron has withdrawn support for the plan because it could damage the packaging industry. Plans to set a legally defined target of 0.7% of GDP for the amount of financial aid Britain provides to other countries are now unlikely to make it in to the Queen's speech, according to the Guardian. The plans had proved unpopular among many Conservative MPs.  "

Argentina refuses to pay anything to investors who declined to participate in a previous debt reduction deal involving most of the nation's lenders.Argentina was not minded to obey the previous court order, lawyers said.""We would not voluntarily obey such an order,"" Jonathan Blackman, a lawyer for Argentina, told the appeal hearing.However, he said Argentina was open to a solution that is ""workable and doesn't create a terrible confrontation"".The appeal comes after a Manhattan court ruled last February that Argentina had violated its contractual obligation to treat all creditors equally. That meant the country would have to pay the bondholders, led by NML Capital and Aurelius Capital Management.Argentina defaulted on some $100bn of debts in 2002, and has since restructured its debt twice, cancelling around 75% of the nominal value of the bonds.Almost 92% of the country's bondholders agreed to write off most of the amount owed to them.NML Capital and Aurelius are demanding 100% repayment plus interest.The two investors were so determined to get their money that they went to court to have an Argentinean ship, the Libertad, impounded in Ghana. After several weeks, the ship returned home.There is concern that if the pair succeed in getting all their money, Argentina's settlement with other creditors could unravel. The court ruling could also set an unfortunate precedent for other heavily-indebted nations seeking to restructure their finances.However, Circuit Judge Reena Raggi said at Wednesday's hearing that a court's role is to enforce contracts, ""not to rewrite them"".She said it ""hardly seems appropriate for a court not to enforce one of its orders, because a party will breach another of its obligations"".The appeals court is expected to take several weeks to make a judgement."

However, the head of the group's negotiation team, Sumlut Gam, told Reuters the announcement was ""good to hear"" but that they would wait to see what happens on Saturday.Tens of thousands of people have been displaced since the conflict was reignited.The government acknowledged earlier this month that it had been carrying out air attacks on rebel fighters who tried to block military supply routes.The statement from the information ministry said the military would ""follow the command of the president not to carry out offensive attacks except in self-defence"".But it went on to say: ""In an armed conflict, both sides need to halt attacks to cool tensions.""Earlier, Burma's new parliament approved a motion calling for a ceasefire and peace talks to end the 18 months of fighting between the military and Kachin rebels.Burma's new military-backed civilian government - which has embarked on a series of reforms since elections in November 2010 - has pledged to resolve conflicts in border areas with ethnic minority groups. But the escalation of fighting in Kachin in recent weeks has brought international condemnation, and raised questions about the extent of civilian government control over the armed forces, who ruled Burma for decades.

It also says the cost of litigation against the Ministry of Defence is up, with £130m going towards it in 2012-13.Lawyers for the families of service personnel have dismissed the findings as ""political"" and ""biased"".Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he remained ""concerned about the challenge to combat immunity arising from recent court judgment"".Entitled The Fog of Law, the report points to the application of the Human Rights Act and the growing application of civilian norms to military conduct via the courts as risks to the UK's armed forces.It says the MoD has earmarked a total of £130m for litigation - including 5,827 legal cases - in 2012-13; under £70m was spent on legal action in 2008-9.As part of this, the MoD now employs around 310 lawyers and legal consultants at a cost of £36m a year, the report says.Its authors are Territorial Army Lieutenant Colonel and strategy consultant Tom Tugendhat, and retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Laura Croft, who served in Iraq and also as a lawyer. They say the main ""weapon"" used in the legal challenge is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).Although the ECHR had applied since September 1953, the Human Rights Act (HRA) in 1998 gave individuals the ability to appeal directly to domestic courts.  This, combined with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, saw a rise in actions brought through the courts.In the past, those serving in the military were protected from prosecution under Combat Immunity, while the Law of Armed Conflict regulated the conduct of war. But recent judicial findings have extended common law claims of negligence and civil claims of duty of care to the combat zone, and the authors claim this is already affecting the combat capability of the services. They cite cases such as that of Ahmed al-Fartoosi, the leader of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's militia, who is in the process of suing the British government for compensation. He alleges abuse during his captivity in Basra, and claims that he was denied his rights under the ECHR. Other claims include that of Ali Al Jedda v the UK (2011). The claimant was arrested travelling from London to Iraq in 2003 on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist group involved in weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in Iraq. He sued the government under Article 5 of the Human Rights Act, a decision rejected by the UK Supreme Court but overturned by the ECHR.The Supreme Court ruled this year that British troops remain within the UK's jurisdiction and so fall under the Human Rights Act, even when deployed on active service abroad. This has led to cases in which relatives of British soldiers have sued the MoD under human rights law. The report's authors warn that ""legal creep"" could pose a ""mortal threat to the culture and ethos of the military which cannot be easily reversed.""They say that the extension of law risks ""catastrophically weakening the UK"". They insist it may not be long before a foreign power or even insurgent forces begin to sponsor legal actions as a way of paralysing UK forces through legal process. The report adds that claims involving human rights law are increasingly costly, with the MoD estimating that such cases will cost a total of £57m in 2012-13.The most common cases not involving human rights law brought against the MoD last year related to noise-induced hearing loss and cost £51.3m altogether.

But he added: ""If the expectation is that we can only have direct negotiations when everything is settled ahead of time, then there is no point for negotiations.""While there were ""irritants on both sides"", such problems could not be used ""as an excuse to do nothing"", he said.""My argument is that even though both sides may have areas of strong disagreement, maybe engaging in activities that the other side considers to be a breach of good faith, we have to push through those things to try to get to an agreement,"" he said. Thanking the US administration for its continuing support for the Palestinian Authority, Mr Abbas said peace with Israel should not be achieved through violence, occupation, settlements, arrests or denial of refugee rights.About 150 protesters were kept away from the Palestinian president's compound by police.Later in Jerusalem, Mr Obama told a student audience that the only way for Israel to thrive as a Jewish, democratic state was through the realisation of an independent and viable Palestinian state.  He said peace was necessary, just and possible, and that Mr Abbas and Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad were ""true partners"" for peace.Mr Obama was heckled as he spoke - but responded by saying it was part of the ""lively debate"" in Israel.On Thursday morning, Israeli officials said two rockets were fired from Gaza into southern Israel, but there were no reports of anyone being hurt. A further two rockets fired from Gaza reportedly fell inside Gaza itself. Mr Abbas condemned ""violence against civilians, whatever its source, including the firing of rockets"", according to a Palestinian spokesperson.On Wednesday Mr Obama pledged America's strong support for Israel as he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a two-state solution. Palestinians, however, will be sceptical about Mr Obama's commitment to statehood as such words have been uttered before, the BBC's Jon Donnison reports from Ramallah.In a 2009 speech in Cairo, Mr Obama called the situation for Palestinians ""intolerable"" and spoke of their ""undeniable"" suffering in pursuit of a homeland. Since then, however, little has changed on the ground as the Middle East's most intractable conflict has been sidelined by the Arab Spring, and US-Israeli concern over Syria and Iran, our correspondent says.Meanwhile, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said his country would ""raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to ground if Israel attacks"", Iranian state media report.Iran and its nuclear programme, which Israel believes is a threat to its existence, has been a major topic  during Mr Obama's visit.On Wednesday, he and Mr Netanyahu reaffirmed their commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, with the US president saying he still hoped the issue could be resolved with diplomacy, but repeating his assurances to Israel that he had not ruled out military action.The two leaders said they agreed that Israel had the right to ""defend itself by itself"".Before travelling to the West Bank on Thursday, the US leader visited the Israel Museum in Jerusalem with Mr Netanyahu to see the Dead Sea Scrolls. He will leave for Jordan on Friday.Security for his three-day visit is tight, with thousands of Israeli and Palestinian security officers on duty in Jerusalem and Ramallah, the Palestinians' de facto capital."

""Although this is a pan-Army issue, the impact is most serious in the Army Reserve... As a stark indicator, 367 recruits were enlisted in Q1 of 2013-2014 against a target of 1,432.""The prediction against an overall in-year target of 6,383 is that only 50% of this number will be realised.""As part of the coalition government's defence review, the number of regular soldiers is set to fall from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, while reservist numbers are expected to rise from the current 19,000 to 30,000.The Ministry of Defence has carried out several rounds of redundancies so far, with more to follow.Col Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, does not believe increasing the size of the Army Reserve was realistic and accused the government of ""hollowing out"" the armed forces.He told BBC News that the government had been ""cynical"" in deciding soldiers sacked from the regular army would ""suddenly and miraculously"" decide to join the reserves.""Well, clearly that hasn't happened and is unlikely to happen,"" he said.He also criticised the handling of recruitment since it was outsourced to civilian firm, Capita.The new focus on Facebook and Twitter campaigns were no substitute for face-to-face meetings with soldiers, he said.""It's not just like walking into a normal civilian job - it's actually quite daunting.""It's a different world and I think to have personal contact with people who have or are serving is really the most effective way of recruiting,"" he said.He also said the idea of converting the Army Reserve into an American-style national guard could not ""happen overnight"".A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was ""early days"" in the recruitment process and it had ""always been a challenge"".He added that a new offer with better incentives and training for potential recruits and employers had been set this summer, and now the way was clear for a ""sustained recruitment campaign over the next 12 to 18 months"" to start to build the numbers.It said £1.8bn would be invested in training, support and equipment for the reserves over the next 10 years.Last year, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he hoped some of those leaving the slimmed-down regular forces would join the reserve.He said cutting the size of the regular Army was ""unfortunately one of the steps we had to take to rebalance the defence budget""."

Al-Qaeda and ""individual jihadists"" were both seen as threats, it added. ""There is a risk of extremist elements in Syria taking advantage of the permissive environment to develop external attack plans, including against Western targets,"" the ISC, which oversees the work of the intelligence agencies, said in its annual report. Protests in Syria, inspired by the Arab Spring which saw changes of government in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, were brutally suppressed by security forces in 2011. The stand-off has since escalated into a civil war which has claimed tens of thousands of lives so far, according to UN estimates. After hearing evidence from senior members of the intelligence agencies and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), the committee highlighted ""serious concern"" among its witnesses that Syria's  weapons stockpiles might be compromised. Assessments of their contents ""vary considerably"", the report said, but suggest they include sarin, ricin, mustard gas and VX, which the committee described as ""the deadliest nerve agent ever created"". ""There has to be a significant risk that some of the country's chemical weapons stockpile could fall into the hands of those with links to terrorism, in Syria or elsewhere in the region,"" the committee concluded. ""If this happens, the consequences could be catastrophic.""The ISC also warned: ""Large numbers of radicalised individuals have been attracted to the country, including significant numbers from the UK and Europe. ""They are likely to acquire expertise and experience which could significantly increase the threat posed when they return home.""The report said there was a growing threat of attacks by ""lone actors"", like the assailant who stabbed Labour MP Stephen Timms while he was holding a surgery in his east London constituency in 2010.By their nature, lone actors are much harder for intelligence agencies to detect, it added.One Home Office official reportedly told the committee: ""There is no doubt that the more sophisticated people in al-Qaeda recognise that groups are, in some ways, a thing of the past; and that encouraging lone acts of terror is exactly the way forward.""The ISC expressed concern that the agencies were struggling to make projected efficiency savings, due to be completed by 2014-15.It highlighted a forecast £59m shortfall in the £220m savings that the agencies - MI5, MI6 and GCHQ - were supposed to have achieved through more collaborative working.While the agencies said they were ""fairly confident"" that the targets set by the Treasury would be met, the committee said it ""does not fully share that confidence"".The committee said: ""It is essential that real and sustainable efficiencies are delivered if frontline capabilities are to be protected. More needs to be done urgently."""

Mr Museveni has been in power since 1986, and elections are due in 2016.There has been long-standing speculation that his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, a brigadier in the army, is being groomed as his successor.The government has denied having any such plans.The BBC's Ignatius Bahizi, in Kampala, says Uganda's Human Rights Network for Journalists had organised peaceful sit-down demonstrations outside the offices.A crowd of about 100 journalists and activists had gathered outside the Daily Monitor on Tuesday morning, he says.""This is a violation of media freedom and economic sabotage,"" rights activist Geoffrey Ssebaggala shouted at police, AFP news agency reports.Police chief Kale Kayihura told the BBC on Monday evening that the media houses - The Daily Monitor and Red Pepper - would remain closed until they co-operated with police.The authorities want evidence of how the Daily Monitor got hold of the confidential letter, purportedly written by Gen David Sejusa, who is out of the country.Daily Monitor managing director Alex Asiimwe told our reporter the paper would continue to refuse to reveal its sources.Two radio stations, linked to the Daily Monitor, also remain off air."

15281	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-21573733	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	Italians have voted in the country's general election.The election was called two months early after Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom party withdrew support for Mario Monti's government.Mr Monti's reform and austerity measures have been unpopular with many voters.BBC News website readers in Italy have given their views on the election.The atmosphere in Rome is vibrant. This election feels different from the previous ones.I voted for the Democratic Party. I like the party's leader, Pier Luigi Bersani. I feel I can trust him. Italy doesn't need another big personality like Berlusconi. Berlusconi came along and he seemed to be acting on behalf of everyone in Italy. People really believed what he told them.But Italy has had many problems with corruption. I feel that this is Italy's chance to finally get rid of Berlusconi. But more than that, it's the first real chance to get over the past and vote for a change in the country.Beppe Grillo, the leader of the Five Star Movement, is too distractive. He has a big personality and a lot of people are voting for him as a protest vote, rather than for his policies.We have many problems in Italy with our culture. People often stick with their political ideologies and are reluctant to change. They may vote for the same party as their parents.But this election represents an opportunity for Italians to take responsibility and change things for the better. In this election I finally withdrew my support for Berlusconi after supporting him for 20 years.Italy needs change. It needs new politicians - honest men and women. I voted for Mario Monti. I wanted to support a new party, so I didn't vote for Bersani's Democratic Party or Berlusconi's People of Freedom because these parties are old.The Five Star Movement is new, but it's only really a movement of protest. It is a party without structure. For deep change to take place, a party needs structure.Italy has many problems, including economical ones. It's strange to have this feeling of stillness and stagnation in the country. Many sectors are no longer doing well. For example, building and mechanical engineering aren't seeing much movement. We need to relaunch our markets and show our excellence in mechanics, food, fashion and tourism.We can't bear all this mess and disorder any longer. Only Berlusconi has the experience to deal with the situation. The Beppe Grillo movement is an Italian phenomenon that is so bog-standard here. No-one will vote for him. All will pretend to have voted for Bersani and his Democratic Party, but I suspect many many more than predicted will vote for Berlusconi.  The one and only thing holding back Italy is the Euro.  It is fixed at the wrong rate - the German one - and Italy's pricing points across the board are not geared to Germany's pricing points.At the very least, Berlusconi will have a strong say in the next legislation, and he just might win the election and become prime minister again.I have lived here for years with my Italian husband and three children.My husband and I both chose to vote for Beppe Grillo and the Five Star Movement. The alternatives are simply the same old, often corrupt candidates just re-presenting themselves.Before the many complex issues are dealt with here, we need new faces who can give people hope that we can finally turn the page over and start over.Things are not in the best shape here. A lot of people that were previously complacent and have good jobs in local authorities and banks, are now suffering and finding that they are not getting paid.I don't normally go for extremes, and the same is true in elections. But I get the impression that Beppe Grillo is an honest man and ready to represent the people.Italy desperately needs representatives who are trustworthy and genuine to improve things for everyone. We don't want politicians simply looking to line their own pockets. Voting for Grillo is really the only effective way of getting that message across. Fingers crossed that things are going to change for the better here.I voted for Mario Monti because I think he worked well during the technocratic government. If Silvio Berlusconi obtains a considerable proportion of the vote, we are in danger. We are in a deep recession after 20 years of his government, but a lot of Italians still vote for him because he is a good communicator. I am worried about our public debt. I believe that we can't have real growth with this dangerous state.Monti wants to reduce our huge public debt and to reduce our high cost of work to encourage companies hiring workers. He thinks our companies have to become more competitive on the international scene and invest more in research and development.Unfortunately, Mario Monti's party has not engaged in civil matters very much, such as looking at marriage for homosexuals or immigration issues. He wants economic and fiscal reform, but he remains conservative about civil rights.

15283	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21197583	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Negative	bbc.co.uk	"In six months' time Iranians will go to the polls to elect a new president. Although the campaign does not officially start until March, there has already been much speculation about who will be competing in the race to succeed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.After a year dominated by infighting between supporters and opponents of Mr Ahmadinejad, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has warned politicians not to engage in early electioneering. Despite this, names are beginning to emerge, and parties and factions have quietly started lobbying for their preferred candidate.Intriguingly, many of the potential contenders so far have one thing in common - they have been involved in the international negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme. Hassan Rohani, who was the country's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005, is the latest politician to tacitly acknowledge that he is intending to stand.He hit the headlines last year when he published an outspoken memoir about his time as nuclear negotiator, which detailed clashes with President Ahmadinejad and eventually forced Mr Rohani to resign.Claiming to appeal to both conservative and reform-minded voters, Mr Rohani told reporters in early January that it was time for a ""new tone"" in Iranian nuclear policy and that President Ahmadinejad had been too ""confrontational"". Ali Larijani, the current speaker of parliament, is another possible candidate with a nuclear past.In 2005, he succeeded Mr Rohani as Iran's nuclear negotiator, but his moderate and pragmatic stand also put him at odds with the president and he resigned after two years. Now the conservative faction in the Iranian parliament - which controls almost two-thirds of the seats - has given him its backing. Another name in the hat is Saeed Jalili, Iran's current chief nuclear envoy. A tough negotiator who lost a leg during the Iran-Iraq war, Mr Jalili is keeping silent about his intentions. But there has already been a high-profile and well-organised campaign running in the Iranian blogosphere to support his candidacy, and some members of the influential conservative Islamic Stability Front have gone public to back him.And lastly there is Ali Akbar Salehi, the current foreign minister and former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI).Mr Salehi has so far declined to confirm whether he will be standing for the presidency, but his elusive answers when questioned at news conferences have fuelled speculation that his name will also be in the running. So why is there such a buzz around these ""nuclear candidates""?Clearly one issue is their relationship with the man who has the final say on Iran's nuclear policy, Ayatollah Khamenei. Observers say that being a member of the nuclear policy-makers' club is seen as a badge of honour in Iranian politics because the supreme leader only lets the most trusted people into this inner circle.For all of the names currently in the running, involvement in the nuclear talks has resulted in a high-speed train ride to the very top of Iranian politics. For Mr Salehi, a stint as Iran's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was a fast-track to being appointed foreign minister in 2011.Mr Larijani went from head of the state broadcaster, Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran (VVIRI), to speaker of parliament after his two years as nuclear negotiator. But while they may have Ayatollah Khamenei to thank for their current high-profile roles, it is not clear how popular any of these men really are with ordinary voters. Mr Larijani, who has the most solid profile among them all, tried his luck in the presidential election in 2005, but only won 4% of the vote.Iran watchers say that the emergence of the ""nuclear candidates"" also indicates just how crucial the nuclear issue has now become at all levels of Iranian political life.   For the conservative politicians who came to power after the last presidential election in 2009, the ongoing confrontation with the West over Iran's nuclear ambitions is becoming so serious they fear it could threaten the very existence of the Islamic Republic. For the Revolutionary Guards and the business world, while sanctions may have offered the chance to monopolise the economy in the short term, there is a growing awareness that as the economy shrinks, so will their share of the profits.Earlier this month, one MP confirmed what many had suspected when he announced that Iran's oil sales had fallen 40% and its income has dropped 45% over the last nine months.But most important of all is the stance of the supreme leader. US President Barack Obama has warned that the window of diplomacy is ""shrinking"" and Ayatollah Khamenei knows that if he does not negotiate him, there is no guarantee the next interlocutor will be someone with the same degree of patience and persistence.  Ayatollah Khamenei has made no secret of his growing impatience with the tensions between President Ahmadinejad and other officials over the nuclear issue.  It is clear he would welcome a new president who could try to build consensus on the issue and get everyone working in the same direction. Given the complexities of Iranian politics, observers caution that even if one of the ""nuclear candidates"" is elected president, there are unlikely to be big changes in the short term.But it would send an important message to people inside Iran and in the West that solving the nuclear issue is now a top priority for the supreme leader and that Iran is keen to solve the deadlock while there is still time."

The US also announced it would begin formal talks to be followed by the direct Afghan talks.Mr Karzai objected to the office, saying the Taliban flag and sign saying ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"" which were initially erected there showed the Taliban were trying to portray themselves as a government-in-exile.He warned that the High Peace Council, which he has empowered to negotiate for his government, would not take part in any peace talks unless the process was ""Afghan-led"". The president relented after receiving reassurances from US Secretary of State John Kerry, who also persuaded the Qatari government to get the Taliban to take down the flag and sign.Following Tuesday's attack in Kabul, Mr Karzai said the Taliban could not open an office for peace in Qatar and at the same time continue to kill people in Afghanistan.""The enemies of the people of Afghanistan once again proved with their failed attack that they are against peace, stability and progress in Afghanistan,"" he said.US ambassador James Cunningham said the attack had failed to achieve its goals and demonstrated ""the futility of the Taliban's efforts to use violence and terror to achieve their aims"".White House spokesman Jay Carney later said that in their video conference Mr Obama and Mr Karzai had both ""reaffirmed that an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace and reconciliation process is the surest way to end violence and ensure lasting stability in Afghanistan and the region"".""And they reiterated their support for an office in Doha for the purpose of negotiations between the High Peace Council and authorized representatives of the Taliban.""The two leaders also discussed the handover of responsibility for security from Nato to Afghan forces last week, the importance of Afghan-led reconciliation efforts, preparations for Afghanistan's 2014 elections, and negotiations on the bilateral security agreement.""The two presidents reaffirmed that free, fair, and credible elections would be critical to Afghanistan's future,"" Mr Carney said.The BBC's Jane Little in Washington says Tuesday's attack highlights just how difficult the bridge-building process will be."

It also includes: Restrictions on political advertisements in the publicly run media during election campaignsA rule that university students can only get state grants if they pledge to work in Hungary after graduationFines or prison terms for homeless people who sleep on the streets.It is the fourth amendment to Hungary's new basic law since it came into force just 14 months ago - a fact which helps underpin criticism that the new constitution was both hurried and flawed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports.Critics at home and abroad say the amendment dismantles the architecture of democracy established since the fall of communism, and allows Fidesz to cement its own ideology at the heart of the state. The measure was passed by 265 votes to 11, with 33 abstentions.Fidesz and its allies the Christian Democrats voted for, along with three independents.The opposition Socialists boycotted the vote, walking out of parliament and hanging black flags from their windows to symbolise a black day for Hungarian democracy. Leader Attila Mesterhazy said Mr Orban's aim was to ""take revenge on the constitutional court, students, opposition parties, and all those who do not do as the government wishes"".Fidesz argues the changes are necessary to make a clean break with the previous constitution, which was adopted in 1989 when Hungary threw off communist rule.Mr Orban had been under pressure at least to postpone Monday's vote until experts from the Council of Europe - Europe's main human rights watchdog - could examine the amendment, our correspondent says.German MEP Alexander Lambsdorff urged the European Commission to investigate a possible ""systematic violation of European values""  by the Hungarian government ahead of the vote, the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reports.In a separate development, the prime minister described as ""scandalous"" a court decision against the government over state-imposed gas price cuts.

Councillor Danny Healy-Rae, who proposed the motion, said it would apply to ""older people"" who ""are being isolated now at home, and a lot of them falling into depression"".But Kerry Mayor Terry O'Brien said the motion did not ""make any sense"".The motion was passed on Monday afternoon by five votes to three, with seven abstentions - though according to TheJournal.ie news website, 12 councillors were absent for the vote which took place ""towards the end of a long meeting"".A number of the councillors who approved the measure are reportedly themselves pub owners - but Mr Healy-Rae denied that this had influenced the vote. The county of Kerry, hugging the rugged and windy south-west coast of Ireland, is known for its mountains, its rural scenic beauty and its winding country lanes. Mr Healy-Rae told The Journal the people he thought could apply for the permits ""are living in isolated rural areas where there's no public transport of any kind, and they end up at home looking at the four walls, night in and night out, because they don't want to take the risk of losing their licence.""""I see the merit in having a stricter rule of law for when there's a massive volume of traffic and where there's busy roads with massive speed. But on the roads I'm talking about, you couldn't do any more than 20 or 30 miles per hour [30-50km/h] and it's not a big deal. I don't see any big issue with it.""Mr Healy-Rae said the current drink-driving rules were forcing an older generation to stay at home.""All the wisdom and all the wit and all the culture that they had, the music and the singing, that's all being lost to the younger generation because these older people might as well be living in Japan and Jerusalem because the younger generation don't see them at all any more.The council will now call on the justice department to implement the change.But the move was condemned by the mayor of Kerry, who told Irish broadcaster RTE:  ""It is incredibly dangerous. I don't know how anybody can be allowed to say: 'You've had two pints, so you're justified to drive'.""I don't know what expertise one would have to look at someone in a bar to give them a permit to drive a car after any alcohol.""Conor Cullen of Alcohol Action Ireland told the BBC: ""Almost one in three crash deaths in Ireland is alcohol-related. Even in small amounts, alcohol impairs driving ability - any amount of alcohol increases the risk of involvement in a fatal crash.""He said tougher measures against drink-driving in Ireland over recent years had seen road deaths fall by 42% between 2008 and 2012. ""Those in rural areas who may be suffering from isolation will not benefit from putting their lives and the lives of the other members of their community at risk by drinking and driving,"" Mr Cullen said. ""Also, it should be noted that the link between alcohol use and suicide has been well established and drinking alcohol will exacerbate not alleviate any mental health difficulties that a person may be struggling with, such as depression or anxiety.""In 2011, the maximum blood-alcohol limit in Ireland was reduced from 80mg per 100ml of blood - the same as the UK legal limit, one of the highest in the world - to 50mg for most drivers.While the level of alcohol in the blood depends on the driver, for many the new law means a single drink could push them over the limit.Learner, novice and professional drivers in Ireland are now limited to a maximum of 20mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood."

True, he says no decision has been taken. But in his interview with PBS Newshour he said if there was action it would be to send the Syrian regime a ""pretty strong signal"". He goes on to say that it would be ""limited, tailored"" and would not be ""a repetition of, you know, Iraq, which I know a lot of people are worried about - but if we are saying in a clear and decisive but very limited way, we send a shot across the bows saying, stop doing this"".This is a distinction the Obama administration has made repeatedly - not regime change and intervening in Syria's civil war, but teaching them a lesson. Some worry that it is impossible to draw a sensible line between the two. The speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, has written to the president with a number of questions, including • What result is the administration seeking from its response?• What is the intended effect of the potential military strikes?• If potential strikes do not have the intended effect, will further strikes be conducted?More than 100 members of Congress have also written to the president, calling on him to seek their approval before taking action. Mr Boehner doesn't quite call for that, but he does make it clear there are too many unanswered questions for his taste. The president has another problem. The UK Prime Minister David Cameron has been forced to offer MPs a second vote before taking action and to wait for a UN inspectors' report. While administration officials have been careful not to criticise the UK, they are scornful of the UN route, saying the inspectors' report would be ""redundant"", insisting they will not proceed with a Security Council resolution and arguing that Syria must not be able to hide behind the United Nations.Of course, America does not really need the UK's military help to carry out the task. But to go ahead without its closest military ally (perhaps apart from Israel) leaves the US without important diplomatic cover. For a president who has always insisted on the importance of building international coalitions, it would be a bit embarrassing.  "

The legislation makes provision for the interception of communications and the carrying out of surveillance.Undercover surveillance on council staff is often undertaken when there is a suspicion that fraud is being committed.BBC Wales contacted the 22 local authorities in Wales over the matter.Gwynedd, Cardiff, Bridgend, Caerphilly and Denbighshire all said they had used undercover surveillance, although Caerphilly stopped in April and was reviewing its policy.Conwy council said it would only use surveillance ""if the circumstances justified"" it.But five councils, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Swansea, failed to reply to the BBC's request for information.Teacher Kim Shaw was followed by a surveillance company on behalf of Caerphilly council two years ago while she was on sick leave. Although the authority has since stopped using undercover monitoring, she says it has left her feeling vulnerable.""My reaction when I first saw it was utter revulsion,"" said Mrs Shaw.""Then I experienced a whole range of quite intense emotions, ranging from fear that someone had actually been almost stalking me and then to incredulity at the personal details in the report.""For example, my footwear was described as flamboyant with kitten heels and flowers on the front of my shoes, which suggested that I couldn't possibly be stressed.

""These powers are utilised at the discretion of individual local councils, often when all other avenues have been exhausted.""Such surveillance operations are primarily used to combat suspected law breaking and illegal activity such as fraud.""A recent law change means that councils require a magistrates' warrant before such powers can be used, and councils are also subject to audit and challenge by the Office of Surveillance Commissioners on their use of directed surveillance activity.

He believed Muhammed had been kidnapped by the jihadists.Another activist, who asked not to be named for her own safety, said she and her sister, also involved in the protest movement, had fled after being fired at by ISIS gunmen.""Seven or eight men with explosive belts surrounded my sister. Some said: 'Knife her.' Some said: 'Shoot her.' They tore down her banner that said 'Christians and Muslims are one', and told her she was an infidel,"" the activist said.The protests started in September after jihadists raised their black flag over a church in Raqqa and turned it into their headquarters.  ""Two carloads of armed fighters went onto the roof of the church. They broke the bell with hammers, and threw one of the crosses down into the street. They tried to break it, but it was iron,"" the activist said.Activists filmed protesters carrying the cross through the streets shouting ""Shame! Shame!"" and calling for Muslim-Christian unity.Earlier this year, Raqqa became the first provincial capital in Syria to fall fully under rebel control.But after only two months when control was shared by SMC-aligned and jihadist fighters, it was taken over in May by ISIS. They marked the moment by publically executing three men they said were Alawites, members of the same heterodox Shia sect as President Bashar al-Assad. Now Raqqa, its population swollen by displaced families, may be the largest city in the world ever to be controlled by al-Qaeda.Mr Matar said: ""They banned the sale of alcohol, they tried to close cafes where boys and girls sit together, they banned street theatre, cinema, bright colours, and forced women to wear Islamic dress.""They are the new dictators, just like Bashar al-Assad, but dressed in black. Only the colour has changed.""Smaller but better funded than other rebel groups, ISIS has historically been made up of foreign jihadists from Arab countries - particularly Iraq, but also Libya, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia - Russia's north Caucasus, and Europe.But activists from Raqqa said it was now attracting more and more Syrian recruits. In the last few months, ISIS has made significant advances, largely at the expense of the FSA, and controls a wide swathe of northern Syria close to the Turkish border.

This is not a court of law and intelligence does not work that way.""The British parliament has already voted against the UK joining any US-led military intervention in Syria.Mr Obama cleared his schedule this week to focus all his attention on building support for the Syrian intervention.He will also seek public support in a White House address on Tuesday. He has acknowledged he faces a ""heavy lift"" to win congressional backing.While the White House believes an endorsement from the Senate could be within reach, the passage of the Syria resolution in the Republican-led House is likely to be even harder.A Washington Post survey said 224 of the current 433 members of the House were either ""no"" or ""leaning no"" on military action as of Friday, while 184 were undecided and just 25 were backing a strike.The survey suggested that 27 of the 100 senators were ""no"" or ""leaning no"", while 50 were undecided and 23 supportive of military action.Many US politicians remain concerned that military action could draw the nation into a prolonged war and spark broader hostilities in the region.Outside the US, France supports military intervention but it wants to wait for a report by UN weapons experts before taking action.Russia and China, which have refused to agree to a UN Security Council resolution against Syria, insist any military action without the UN would be illegal.In Syria itself, Magne Barth of the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed for increased access to help the wounded and displaced.He complained the authorities had not allowed aid into areas around eastern Damascus even during lulls in the fighting, and in particular in the aftermath of the 21 August attack.""All parties agree there was a chemical attack, it was only a question of [UN] inspectors going in, there was no possibility to bring in humanitarian aid,"" Mr Barth said."

There are currently about 68,000 US soldiers in the country.Mr Rhodes told reporters that an announcement on post-2014 troop levels was not expected during Mr Karzai's visit.But he added that a bilateral security agreement between the US and Afghanistan is expected by November of this year.White House officials have previously suggested they favour keeping between 3,000 and 9,000 troops in Afghanistan after the combat mission ends.The Afghan leader is due to see President Obama on Friday, their first meeting since the US presidential election. Ahead of the trip, the White House issued a statement saying Mr Obama ""looks forward to... discussing our continued transition in Afghanistan, and our shared vision of an enduring partnership"" between the two countries.The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul says the US president is likely to discuss the size of the force that remains, and whether they are there to fight the Taliban or shift their primary focus to tackling al-Qaeda.The visit comes days after a drone attack that killed Pakistan militant leader Mullah Nazir, who was accused of sending fighters to Afghanistan to support the Taliban.Mr Karzai is expected to provide a request for future requirements for the Afghan military such as heavy weaponry, an improved air force and medical support.Our correspondent says the US spent almost $120bn (£74bn; 91bn Euros) in Afghanistan in 2011, a figure that diplomats in Kabul say will be increasingly difficult to justify because of economic problems at home and extensive corruption within Afghanistan.Meanwhile Mr Karzai has held back from signing a long-term binding security agreement with the US, amid fears that Afghan sovereignty is being undermined.He is unwilling to grant US soldiers immunity from prosecution and is unhappy that Afghans are still being held in US-run military prisons on Afghan soil, our correspondent adds.US and Iraqi authorities reached a similar sticking point in negotiations over the drawdown of US troops from Iraq. Aside from a contingent guarding the embassy, all US soldiers left the country by December 2011.As of December, Nato forces in Afghanistan numbered 102,000, including 68,000 US troops."

15338	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22886729	News	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"For a president who began his first term in the centre of the Islamic political spectrum, Hassan Fereydoun Rouhani, 68, has now moved firmly to the left, placing himself with the reformists.In his election campaign for a second term in office, he promised a moderate modern and outward looking Iran, in sharp contrast to the vision his main rival Ebrahim Raisi, a hardline senior cleric and judge, had put forward.He warned Iranians that a single wrong decision by the future president could engulf the country in war. This was a reference to Mr Raisi, who is not overly impressed by the nuclear deal President Rouhani reached with world powers - a deal which removed a serious threat of war hanging over the country. President Rouhani is keen to see the nuclear deal survive - even though US President Donald Trump and opponents of the deal in the United States Congress are looking for ways to put further pressure on Iran, or even scrap the deal. Mr Rouhani also promised to revive the sluggish economy, to extend individual and political freedoms, to steer the country away from the extremist ideas of the hardliners, to ensure equality for men and women, to extend access to internet and generally work for moderations and an outward-looking Iran.  Time and again, he praised the reform movement in Iran and its leaders - something that is likely to bring him into constant clashes with the hardliners in his second term. He was re-elected in May 2017 with an emphatic margin of victory.Hassan Rouhani has been a key player in Iran's political life since the revolution in 1979.He was an influential figure in Iran's defence establishment during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War and subsequently held several important political posts.From 1989 to 2005, Mr Rouhani was secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), the top decision-making body in Iran, appointed by and answerable to the Supreme Leader. He served as deputy speaker of parliament between 1996 and 2000 (while simultaneously completing a thesis on Sharia - Islamic law - as a post-graduate student at Glasgow Caledonian University) and in 1997 became a member of the Expediency Council, the highest arbitration body on issues of legislation.Mr Rouhani was Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, from 2003 to 2005, earning the moniker ""the diplomat sheikh"", when he agreed to suspend uranium enrichment. He resigned from the SNSC and from his role leading the nuclear talks just weeks after the election of the combative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, amid sharp differences with the new president.When Mr Rouhani stood as a presidential candidate in 2013, he knew he was up against an establishment stacked with hardliners who were highly suspicious of him. His campaign slogan ""moderation and prudence"" resonated with many Iranians who had seen their living standards, and their country's reputation, plummet under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Although he was seen as part of the establishment, Mr Rouhani promised to relieve sanctions, improve civil rights and restore ""the dignity of the nation"" - and drew large crowds on the campaign trail.Many believe he was not the first choice of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But seeing that he might offer a way to end the nuclear confrontation with big world powers without destabilising the whole system, Mr Khamenei backed Mr Rouhani. Within weeks of taking office in 2013, Mr Rouhani spoke on the phone to US President Barack Obama - the first direct contact at the highest level between Iran and the US since the 1979 revolution.The conversation paved the way for historic open and direct talks between Iran and the US, as well as with other world powers. After assuming office himself in 2013, Mr Rouhani got the Supreme Leader to allow the foreign ministry, rather than the SNSC, to take charge of nuclear negotiations with the West, and appointed his Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to lead the talks. The sight of Mr Zarif and US Secretary of State John Kerry taking a stroll around Lake Geneva just outside the venue of nuclear talks, chatting and joking together, would once have seemed extraordinary.But as the negotiations progressed, it became almost commonplace.From the outset Mr Rouhani had cautioned that there would be ""no overnight solutions"" to Iran's many problems. The nuclear deal ensured that many sanctions against Iran were lifted, but the benefits of this have been slow in coming for many Iranians. Ordinary Iranians say they have not felt it in their day-to-day lives. The economy remains sluggish, and desperately needed foreign investment has been far slower than had been expected.  Mr Rouhani had pledged to help free reformist opposition leaders, held without trial since 2011, but the hardliners have stood firm and they remain under house arrest.He also promised to usher in an era of more freedoms in a country where human rights abuses are rife. However, few believe there has been much improvement here, and in some areas the situation may have worsened. There are still many journalists and opposition activists in jail, and the number of executions carried out in Iran has soared. Censorship in the media has not eased under Mr Rouhani, although in one of his key speeches as president he told state media chiefs that Islam could tolerate a lot more than state TV allows its viewers. Iran's internet also remains tightly controlled, forcing many to use proxy servers to circumvent the restrictions in a country whose internet speeds rank among the lowest in the world. "

Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing was ""astonished"" by the report, saying it was rare for a country's leader to insult its neighbour, China's Xinhua news agency reports.Mr Abe is serving as Japan's top leader for a second time, after a brief period in power in 2006-7. He is the fifth Japanese prime minister that Mr Obama has met in office. His visit is seen as a bid to shore up a security alliance between the two countries that goes back decades. Ties were strained somewhat under the previous Democratic Party (DPJ) administration amid a row over the relocation of a US military base in Okinawa.But Mr Abe, who heads a Liberal Democratic Party administration, has spoken out about the need to prioritise the Japan-US alliance amid a changing regional dynamic. In his Washington Post interview, Mr Abe said improved ties with Washington were top of his agenda in the US.On the bitter row with China over disputed islands in the East China Sea, he said US support was key. Both Beijing and Tokyo have ships in waters around the islands - known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China - leading to fears of a clash. Japan controls the islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan.""It is important for us to have them recognise that it is impossible to try to get their way by coercion or intimidation,"" Mr Abe said, referring to China.""In that regard, the Japan-US alliance, as well as the US presence, would be critical.""The US has urged restraint from both sides, while Chinese state media has warned the US against taking sides.Mr Obama's top Asia advisor, Danny Russel, said on Thursday that the president ""remains supportive of the peaceful efforts to find diplomatic resolution to outstanding issues of territorial claims"", AFP reports.He added that Mr Obama has ""been clear in the United States' opposition to coercive actions or unilateral steps that threaten the stability of the region"".On North Korea, both the US and Japan support action being taken against Pyongyang in the UN Security Council in the wake of its third nuclear test, on 12 February. Economic ties are also expected to be on the agenda for the meeting.

""It was used for different purposes: operational, assistance to injured people,  rental costs and other goals. This was efficient assistance and we appreciate it,""  he said in a statement.He added that the money had been delivered to Afghanistan's National Security Council, which is part of the president's office, during the last 10 years.The New York Times report said: ""Wads of American dollars packed into suitcases, backpacks and, on occasion, plastic shopping bags have been dropped off every month or so at the offices of Afghanistan's president.""It quoted Khalil Roman, who was Mr Karzai's chief of staff from 2002 until 2005, as saying the cash was referred to as ""ghost money"". ""It came in secret, and it left in secret,"" Mr Roman is quoted as saying.The report cited unnamed US officials' assessments that there was little evidence the payment bought the influence the CIA sought, and said that the cash was not subject to the conditions placed on official US aid.It added that much of the money fuelled corruption and went to paying off warlords and politicians with dubious connections. The CIA declined to comment on the New York Times report, as did the US state department.

It is also supplying up to 240 troops to train soldiers in Mali and neighbouring countries in the region.Mr Hague said the UK was committed to ""restoring security"" in Mali. The foreign secretary has held meetings with the country's acting president Dioncounda Traore, its prime minister and foreign minister in the capital Bamako to discuss security and political developments. Troops from France and a number of African countries have driven Islamist groups out of the main cities in the north of the country following a major offensive beginning in January. Although it has not supplied combat troops, the British government has made available two aircraft to assist the operation, which it says is vital for stabilising the country and ensuring it does not become a safe haven for terrorists groups linked to al-Qaeda.On his visit, the first by a British foreign secretary to Mali, Mr Hague also met the commander of the AFISMA international force as well as the deputy commander of the EU mission training Malian soldiers and British troops serving under him. Mr Hague said restoring security and democratic rule to Mali after last year's military coup was important for stability in the wider region.""Mali is at the heart of a range of complex political, security and development challenges that have the potential to affect the wider region and it is vital that we work together to tackle these challenges,"" he said.

The move followed the death of Savita Halappanavar.The four Catholic Archbishops of Ireland, including Cardinal Sean Brady, have criticised the decision.

She had to watch the consequences of his firmness from the sidelines, as she had been removed from office by her own MPs in the last weeks before the American-led invasion of Iraq and Kuwait began in January 1991.  Lady Thatcher's belief in the importance of Britain's relationship with the United States was only part of the reason why she sent RAF aircraft to Saudi Arabia within 48 hours of the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and soon after started the deployment of what became a force of more than 53,000 British troops. Her response to what was happening in Kuwait was conditioned by her own experience of the war to recapture the Falklands Islands from Argentina in 1982. And Britain had its own reasons to protect oil supplies from the Gulf, and what had become a highly lucrative business relationship with Saudi Arabia. Britain had pulled its military forces out of the Middle East after the decision to retreat from east of Suez in the 1960s. The UK's Middle Eastern moment appeared to be over, so when the Thatcher government rushed troops to Saudi Arabia in 1990 the British army had to announce that it no longer had desert pattern uniforms. Embarrassingly, it emerged that it sold its stocks to Iraq in the 1980s. But Britain had retained big business interests. From early on in her premiership Mrs Thatcher had recognised the commercial possibilities in the Gulf. She was closely involved in the negotiations that led to the al-Yamamah arms deal, selling British warplanes worth tens of billions of pounds to Saudi Arabia. The deal has also been surrounded by allegations that bribes were paid to members of the Saudi royal family. Since the first war against Iraq in 1991, many thousands of British soldiers have spent time in the Middle East.  Mrs Thatcher's government revived Britain's political and military role in the region, which continues.Since Margaret Thatcher's death was announced both Israel's president and prime minister have praised her support for their state. During her time in Number 10 though, Britain was one of the first Western countries to establish relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, pressing it to recognise the existence of Israel. In 1989 she sent William Waldegrave, then a junior minister in the Foreign Office, to Tunis to meet PLO officials and eventually the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It was one of the steps that led to the Oslo process, the attempt to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s. "

Twenty-five attacks will be examined - in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, the Palestinian territories and Somalia. Mr Emmerson told journalists in London that the increasing use of drones ""represents a real challenge to the framework of international law"".If unregulated, he said, the use of drones would continue to grow.The inquiry will assess the extent of civilian casualties, the identity of militants targeted and the legality of strikes where there is no UN recognition of a conflict.Defenders of drones say they minimise civilian casualties, but opponents say drone strikes can constitute extra-judicial killing and point to data suggesting hundreds of civilians have died in such strikes.Drones - or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - have become an increasingly potent weapon for nations seeking to target militants but there is increasing controversy over their toll on civilians.Between 2004 and 2013, CIA drone attacks in Pakistan killed up to 3,461 people - up to 891 of them civilians, according to research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.The vast majority of the strikes were carried out under the administration of President Barack Obama, it said.Some kinds of drone attacks - in particular ""double tap"" strikes where rescuers attending a first blast become victims of a second - could constitute a war crime, Mr Emmerson has previously said, according to the Guardian newspaper. Addressing journalists on Thursday, he denied the inquiry was unfairly singling out the US and Israel, saying 51 states had the technology to use drones.He said it was not a substitute for ""effective, official and independent investigation"" by states, and called for independent investigations where there was ""plausible evidence of a war crime"".The inquiry will report to the UN General Assembly in the latter half of the year."

Whether voters will go for this narrow field is another matter.The election authority has allowed eight people to stand in the ballot on 14 June. Five belong to the conservative camp, one is a centrist and the other is a reformist. The last one, an independent, is not being taken seriously. The choice of the contenders suggests that the conservatives and their right-wing supporters, particularly those in the Revolutionary Guards, are setting the election agenda and seem to have the upper hand. During the past few months, their view of political events has been the most accurate in foreseeing developments and articulating group interests accordingly. The candidates are:  Nuclear strategist Saeed Jalili - conservative Tehran mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf - conservativeFormer Majlis Speaker Gholamali Haddad Adel - conservative Advisor to the Supreme Leader Ali Akbar Velayati - conservative Former Revolutionary Guards commander Mohsen Rezaie - conservative Former nuclear negotiator Hasan Rouhani - centrist Former Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref - reformistMohammad Gharazi - independentAt this stage it is difficult to predict how people might vote or whether they sill vote at all.  In the last election in 2009 more than over 80% of Iranian voters took part. But now that senior reformist leaders are under house arrest and former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani have not been allowed to stand, some reformist supporters might decide not to vote. The conservative vote is also unpredictable because their camp is split between the supporters and opponents of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad and this could break up their votes. The role of the undecided ""floating"" voter, who is not loyal to any of the camps, is critical for all sides. The conservatives are still playing a game of camouflage by fielding five candidates. This protects their final candidate from attacks from rivals and public criticism. The two main figures in the camp are Mr Jalili and Mr Qalibaf. Mr Qalibaf represents mainstream conservative thinking, while Mr Jalili is further to the right and has worked closely with the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei . The critical factor is how the conservative leadership will swing its vote at the final stage. That decision will put their bloc vote - mobilized noticeably by the para-military and the Revolutionary Guards - behind the final chosen contender. Following the disqualification of former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the reformist and centre factions are in a weak position. Their two candidates are not their first choice. Mr Rouhani, a centrist, is a former nuclear negotiator with the aura of a cautious diplomat. Mr Aref, the reformist, worked behind the scenes when he was a vice president and is seen as a quiet operator. Neither is charismatic enough to turn the tide through sheer campaigning. Furthermore, their support organizations have been shut down, their activists harassed and the publications that back them restricted. If Mr Aref and Mr Rouhani both stand they will have to compete for the same voters and may thus cancel each other out. The conservative-controlled political establishment has played safe by eliminating candidates who could have created an unpredictable situation. If they had allowed Mr Rafsanjani to enter the race, there would have been the risk of massive mobilizations on the streets. This happened in the 2009 elections and the regime is determined not to allow a repeat. Although the police and security forces have detailed plans for dealing with possible unrest, a preventative approach was favoured. Better safe than sorry. If the disqualified candidates are not reinstated, a conservative victory seems highly likely. Both Mr Jalili and Mr Qalibaf have a good chance of becoming the next president. An editorial in a leading conservative newspaper speculated that Mr Jalili has the better chance. The future for the reformist and the centrist factions is uncertain. The establishment conservatives want to maintain them, but only as small groups on the political fringes and under firm control. But if the process of eliminating dissidents and critics becomes prevalent, the regime could seriously undermine its social base and consequently become more dependent on coercive methods to maintain order.

Under intense fire, it is said that Sgt Carter made another run for ammunition at great risk to his own life.According to the citation, the enemy then began firing rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), forcing the men to take refuge in a Humvee military vehicle. One RPG hit the vehicle and three servicemen, including Sgt Carter, were wounded by flying shrapnel.About half an hour into the battle, the soldiers decided to move location and join the other members of B Troop.The official narrative says that Sgt Carter, along with another soldier, Sgt Bradley Larson, volunteered to give covering fire to their comrades as they tried to move back. In the process, one member of the group was killed on the spot.Enemy fire intensified, resulting in several casualties, but it is said that Sgt Carter and Sgt Larson were able to kill two enemy fighters and wound another, prompting the attackers to retreat as they were about to overrun the position.As intense fighting continued, Sgt Carter killed four more attackers and helped prevent the south side of Combat Outpost Keating from being taken, the official narrative says.He is also said to have run through a hail of bullets to staunch the bleeding of a wounded soldier and carry him back to a safe place before returning to the fight. Sgt Carter, a cavalry scout with the 4th Infantry Division, was eventually able to bring his injured comrade to an aid station five hours after he was injured.Later in the day, under cover of darkness, the soldier was flown to a hospital where he died of his wounds.Sgt Carter's citation reads: ""Carter's remarkable acts of heroism and skill... exemplify what it means to be an American hero.""During the ceremony, Mr Obama said he wanted to honour Sgt Carter for the ""other battle he has fought"" - coping with PTSD.The president said: ""To any of troops or veterans who are watching and struggling: look at his man, look at this soldier… he's as tough as they come, and if he can find the courage and the strength to not only seek help but to speak out about it [PTSD], to take care of himself and stay strong, so can you."""

Don't hold your breath for any great new announcements. The UK prime minister is in the US partly for a big meeting at the UN on global development  and partly for an event with Prince Harry, also in New York. So his meeting with the president is something added on, rather than the centrepiece of his trip. That means it will be strictly business - no playing of ping pong or sampling of BBQ. As well as Syria, they will talk about Iran, transatlantic trade (the proposed deal with the EU is now known in the trade as ""tee tip"") and probably North Korea. Doubtless the president will want to know the latest about the prime minister's proposed referendum on membership of the European Union and his troublesome colleagues' willingness to turn a political face-saver into a real choice.  While some in Britain dream of leaving the EU and strengthening the transatlantic relationship it its place, America values what the president calls the ""essential relationship"" in part as a bridge to Europe. If it turns into a bridge to nowhere, it will trouble them. But Syria is the hard case. Both Europe and the US are slowly inching towards arming the rebels. But that commonplace phrase disguises the fact that the ""arms"" will be well short of anything the rebels actually want to finish this protracted business.For months now, the noises from Western capitals have vacillated between the cry ""Something must be done!""  and the forlorn reply ""But what?""One rather lame answer is the idea of a peace conference dangled by Russia. But there's not much diplomatic chatter about the proposal, which seems more like a passing thought than a hard plan. I get the impression that the US and Europe will go along with what they privately regard as a bit of a charade only because they have no better ideas. Which brings us back to  ""arming the rebels"" and allied concepts like a no-fly zone. Enthusiasts insist it isn't that difficult - find the right sort of rebels and give them the weapons they need.

He has been criticised by some pro-Israel groups for not returning sooner.Correspondents say the trip could help allay concerns he is cool towards America's closest ally in the Middle East.Mr Obama's decision not to visit Israel when he stopped in Egypt early in his first term disappointed many Israelis.The Democratic president is known to have had a fractious relationship with Mr Netanyahu.The Israeli prime minister emerged from his country's elections weakened, but could still retain power if he can form a coalition government before the deadline in mid-March."

The failure of each round brought more disaster, pain and oppression, instead of progress and improving people's welfare.In light of this, how can any Palestinian be convinced that this round of negotiation is any different? Israel proved that it can make concessions when it endorsed the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in return for the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.But despite its recent decision to release 104 Palestinian prisoners, they will be released in stages over a pre-set timeline and it will be linked to the progress of the negotiations, which means that Israel will turn such a humanitarian issue into a pressing tool to serve its interests in the talks. It is hard to jump to the conclusion that this round will carry new horizons or open new doors. But the two sides should aim to bring about concrete solutions to affect people's lives and provide new economic opportunities for people on the ground.This should include the withdrawal from Area C [an area of the West Bank that remains under Israeli control] and the halting of settlement building and land confiscation.There should be an emphasis overall on at least reaching a compromise that will restore confidence in the peace process. The alternative is so hard and risky.The Palestinian leadership do not represent the Palestinian people. So they know these talks are futile. They are just protecting their interests and hoping to at least prolong the current status quo. The Israeli government also know this is futile and are just stalling. Months of talks will mean that their settlement plans can move forward with less scrutiny. Before any talks can proceed, all Palestinian refugees must be granted their right of return. Those who wish to return home must be allowed to do so. The military occupation should end, all restraints on people's rights should be lifted, and all violations of human rights should be stopped at once. Then you can go to the table and discuss the future of this land. The peace process has been failing and will continue to fail for several reasons. You have one side - Israel - who has the power, is supported by the US unconditionally, and has the protection of the international community, because any UN resolution that is not in favour of Israel will be vetoed by the US. So they have nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, they are also being handed billions of dollars each year in military aid. This so-called peace process is not based on justice, it is based on interests. It will fail because Israel is choosing who to negotiate with.In common with most of my friends and family, we regard the resumption of ""talks about talks"" as a waste of time. We feel that John Kerry is just doing his duty in trying to push the Obama administration agenda.But it also looks as if the Obama administration is once again trying to force the hand of the Israelis in order to forward the Americans' own foreign policy agenda, whatever that might be at the moment.Since Mahmoud Abbas's term as formal head of the Palestinian Authority has long since expired and he has deeply hostile relations with the Hamas rulers of Gaza, it seems that he has no power to sign any valid documents with our representatives.He also has much local opposition from his own people to any talks with the Israeli government.It is obvious that the Palestinian Authority has not made any attempts to promote education for peaceful co-existence.It is incapable of running its own affairs as an independent entity. The main obstacles are clearly the continued and intensive brainwashing of the younger Palestinian generation to hate Israel and Jews. Mr Abbas has yet again just declared that his state will not tolerate the presence of Jews. This is hardly a sign of any attempt at genuine peace-making.These talks will likely go the way of all previous ones. We don't have a partner for peace in either of the Palestinian leadership factions, which are as corrupt and inept as they always have been. The Arab population would do far better as fully-fledged citizens of Israel.  We would all benefit, socially, economically and spiritually. I believe there are enough Arabs who have no interest in bolstering this division any longer. They want to raise their kids and have a normal life. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas have no interest in collaborative effort. The money that has poured into the Palestinian Authority has not gone to build schools or improve infrastructure.I don't think these talks will achieve anything. The history of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations speaks for itself, and it will never fulfil the minimum requirements of the Palestinian people - our basic right to self-determination.So anything that is achieved will be superficial and won't serve the Palestinian people's cause. It will only serve the Palestinian Authority's interests. Ideally, these discussions would address the refugee issue, the issue of prisoners and the continuing land demolition and confiscation, which never ends. They would also discuss our ability and right to visit any place in our land, without Israeli permission, in addition to the basic human rights that we are denied. But this is not going to happen in these talks. They will not be any different from the previous ones. Yes, there may be some formal or temporary changes announced, but no major achievements, such as granting us our rights, as we would hope.Interviews by Stephen Fottrell."

Philip Gordon, a senior official in the US State Department, said it was in America's interests to see a ""strong British voice within the EU"".""Referendums have often turned countries inwards,"" he added.The comments come as David Cameron prepares to make a major speech later this month on future European policy.In response, No 10 said: ""The US wants an outward-looking EU with Britain in it, and so do we.""The prime minister is facing pressure to hold a referendum on Europe at some stage during the next Parliament and has said the Conservatives will offer voters ""real change"" and ""real choice"" on the UK's position in Europe at the next election - scheduled for 2015.Mr Cameron wants the UK to remain within the EU but believes there is a need to redefine the relationship in light of moves towards further integration by countries using the single currency.He has suggested ""fresh consent"" for any new deal that emerges as a result of negotiations with other EU countries could be sought from the UK public.However, many Conservative MPs want him to go further and to commit to a referendum on the question of whether the UK remains in the EU or not - a so-called ""in-out vote"" he does not support. Philip Gordon, the US assistant secretary for European affairs in the State Department, was asked about the possibility of a UK referendum ahead of a meeting with Europe minister David Lidington in London.Mr Gordon told journalists that the UK would always be a key ally of the US and that ""what is in the UK's interests is up to the UK"".But he added: ""We have a growing relationship with the EU as an institution, which has an increasing voice in the world, and we want to see a strong British voice in that EU. That is in America's interests. We welcome an outward-looking EU with Britain in it.""Discussing the often ""inward-looking"" history of EU negotiations, Mr Gordon said that ""referendums have often turned countries inward"". ""The more the EU reflects on its internal debate, the less it is able to be unified,"" he said.""I'm not going to imagine an EU which ever buried any internal debates... but it is best for everyone, we think, when leaders have the time to be able to focus on common challenges rather than spending their time on internal workings.""BBC chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a ""significant development"" in the debate over Europe ahead of Mr Cameron's speech and showed a measure of disquiet in Washington over the ""direction of travel"" that the UK may be taking.Earlier on Tuesday, 10 of the UK's leading business figures warned Mr Cameron not to put membership of the EU ""at risk"" in negotiations over the country's relationship with Brussels.Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ""On the same day that top British business leaders fired a warning shot across the bows of the prime minister, a senior White House official has also signalled concerns about the possibility of Britain leaving the EU. ""There is today a real risk of Britain sleepwalking towards exit because of a prime minister motivated more by the need for party unity than by the interests of the country.""But, in a message on Twitter, Conservative MP Douglas Carswell cast doubt on the US intervention. ""A US official believes UK should continue to be ruled by EU officials. Hardly surprising - it's how officials think.""Fellow Conservative Richard Ottaway, who is chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said the comments were a ""bit unexpected"" and ""the mood of the nation"" was in favour of holding a referendum at some point in the future.""It is too late to say we are not going to hold a referendum because the US does not want us to have one,"" he told the BBC.While he favoured the UK remaining within the EU, he believed that asking the public to decide would help ""clear the air"" and he trusted the British public to reach a ""sensible"" decision. Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party - which campaigns for the UK to leave the EU - said: ""We said no to America over Vietnam and we'll say no to them over the EU if the people get their say.""And, in an editorial, the Financial Times said a future government should hold an ""in-out"" referendum once the UK had ""codified"" its new relationship with the eurozone.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby said the consequences of military action across the Muslim world were unpredictable with the impact on those not directly involved in fighting ""beyond description and horrible"".The Syrian government has blamed opposition fighters for the alleged chemical attack near Damascus on 21 August, in which hundreds of people are reported to have died.In the latest developments:UN weapons inspectors resumed investigations at the site of the attack after a day's delay over security concerns, while UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said the team needed time to do its jobAsian stock markets fell, extending a global sell-off sparked by growing fears of a military strike against SyriaA YouGov poll of nearly 2,000 people suggested 50% were against a missile strike, while 25% were in favourIn analysis: BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus looks at the military options on offer to the WestBBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman looks at whether foreign intervention would be legalThe phone call between Mr Obama and Mr Cameron was the second since the alleged chemical attack.A Downing Street spokesman said the leaders agreed they were ""in no doubt that the Assad regime was responsible"" for the chemical attack.""Regime forces were carrying out a military operation to regain that area from the opposition at the time; and there is no evidence that the opposition has the capability to deliver such a chemical weapons attack,"" he said.The National Security Council includes Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Home Secretary Theresa May and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg among its members, along with military and intelligence chiefs.Meanwhile, the government is expected to publish the Commons motion for debate later, along with details of intelligence linking the Syrian government to the attack.The motion is expected to stress the need for ""appropriate measures"" in response to the use of chemical weapons by any country. Sources said it would not contain ""a timetable for action"" or specific military options. A number of Conservative backbenchers have raised concerns about military intervention in Syria - but it is understood Tory MPs will be told to support the measures.The US has said its forces are ""ready to go"" but former UK military chiefs warned a one-off missile strike could see the UK dragged into deeper action.Admiral Lord West, a former first sea lord, said he was ""extremely nervous"" about any potential military intervention.  The Labour peer said the UK and US should show any evidence of a chemical attack to Russia and China, who have warned against intervention, to back up their case.""Then we need to try and get a security council resolution. If the Russians and Chinese say 'Yes, it is clear it was done by them [the Syrian government]', then they would be in a very difficult position to vote against such a resolution. The most they could do is abstain,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. He said an attack would be ""extremely dangerous"" as it was hard to predict how the regime might respond. ""You can do a surgical strike but you need to be clear what is your whole campaign plan, where do you go from there?"" he said.BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said it was understood military targets had already been chosen and they would probably focus on command centres believed to be involved in the use of chemical weapons.She said cruise missiles could be launched from US ships in the Gulf or the Mediterranean, or Royal Navy vessels including submarine HMS Tireless.Labour leader Ed Miliband said his party would ""consider supporting international action"", but only if it was legal and ""specifically limited to deterring the future use of chemical weapons"".Opposition frontbencher Diane Abbott said she may resign as shadow health minister if Mr Miliband supported intervention.""It's not clear that any such bombing would be legal. It's not at all clear that it would change Assad's evident determination to fight to the last Syrian. And the danger is that we get dragged into a civil war in the Middle East,"" she said. The Stop the War Coalition called on the British public to oppose what it called ""another disastrous military intervention"". It is planning to hold a protest at Downing Street later."
15417	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24347663	News	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Labour Party leader Ed Miliband is locked in a row with the Daily Mail over his father's views. But to what extent do our mothers and fathers shape our political opinions? Many people's first exposure to political debate wasn't watching Question Time or reading newspaper reports about the House of Commons or the US Congress.It was at the dinner table or in the family front room, with a parent cursing conservatives or muttering darkly about socialists.  Labour leader Ed Miliband's upbringing fitted this pattern better than most. His father Ralph was a left-wing academic, his mother Marion a campaigner for progressive causes.Now this family history has become the focus of a bitter media spat. On Saturday, the Daily Mail ran a profile of Ralph Miliband under the headline: ""The man who hated Britain"". After offering his son the right of reply, the paper repeated the original article and ran a leader describing the deceased lecturer's legacy as ""evil"".For its part, the paper justified the attack by arguing that Ralph Miliband's political views had been passed down the generations.""We do not maintain, like the jealous God of Deuteronomy, that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons,"" its leader says. ""But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father's teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different.""The Labour leader has reacted furiously.He insisted his politics were markedly different from those of his Marxist father: ""I have pursued a different path and I have a different vision."" He also said he was ""appalled"" by the Mail's ""character assassination"" of a man who had served in the Royal Navy during World War II after escaping Nazi persecution. The dispute raises the question of the extent to which people's politics are shaped by the influence of their families.Many of those who have backed Miliband in the row have followed the Mail's logic by pointing out that the first Viscount Rothermere, great-grandfather of its present owner, met Hitler and wrote an article titled Hurrah For The Blackshirts in 1934 which praised Oswald Mosley's fascists. There are plenty of political dynasties, even in countries that have long shaken off the shackles of aristocracy - the Bush family, for instance, who have accounted for two of the last four US presidents, or the Gandhis in India. In the UK, the Cecil family have been involved in Conservative parliamentary politics for more than two centuries, while four generations of Benns have sat for Labour or the Liberals in the House of Commons. But there is no shortage of examples of politicians who have rejected the views of their forefathers. Famously, the father of former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo was a left-wing Spanish Republican who escaped his homeland during the civil war. Labour Prime Ministers Clement Attlee and Tony Blair both grew up in Tory households (Attlee's grandson, Earl Attlee, now takes the Conservative whip in the House of Lords).If nothing else, the process of youthful rebellion requires adopting contrary views - teenagers in the Tory shires long having irritated their mums and dads by joining the Socialist Workers Party or announcing their sympathy for the anarchist cause.It's a process the comedian Alexei Sayle understands well. He grew up in a Communist Party household in Liverpool where the only way to appear more radical than his parents was to declare himself a Maoist.Over time, however, Sayle, while retaining left-wing principles, lost his illusions about the brutality of the regimes his family supported. As a result, he feels ambivalent about the environment in which he acquired his values and moral code.""My parents had a genuine hatred of injustice - they were really decent people. On the other hand, that wish for a better world led them to turn a blind eye to the two greatest mass murderers of the 20th Century, namely Stalin and Mao,"" he says.""But I'll always value the fact that they taught me to look sceptically at the news, to question society and people's motives.""It's not just among the left that parents can be crucial in shaping opinions. Margaret Thatcher often spoke of the formative influence of her father, a grocer and Methodist lay preacher, who instilled her faith in the virtues of hard work and thrift.  Of course, plenty of children of politicians and the politically engaged grow up to have no interest whatsoever in parties and ideologies.Others say they became active despite, not because, of their parents' interests.Rachel Johnson belongs to one of the most notable political families in the UK - her father Stanley was a Conservative MEP while her brothers Boris and Jo serve as Mayor of London and head of the Number 10 Policy Unit respectively.But she insists that politics was rarely discussed while she grew up, not least because her parents' affiliations were split - her mother Charlotte was a Labour voter. ""We didn't have a politicised household,"" Johnson, herself a Conservative party member until recently, says. ""The only thing I remember was canvassing for my father for the European Parliament. But we did that not because he was a Tory but because he was my father.""Arguably the political success of the Miliband family is proof that politics aren't simply handed down from father to son.It's difficult to reconcile the Marxist dialectics of Ralph with the views of his Blairite son David, who served as foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010 and was defeated by his brother for Labour's leadership.Though Ed has often spoken warmly of ""the values I grew up with"", he rose to the top of the party in defiance of his father's long-standing belief that Labour could never achieve socialist transformation. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey once joked that Ralph Miliband ""spent his life trying to convince our movement that there was no possibility of a parliamentary road to socialism, while his sons have been loyally putting theory into practice, and proving Ralph right"".Still, when children depart from their parents' political paths delicate situations can arise.In 1994, Sir Nicholas Scott, the Conservative disability minister, left office after coming under severe criticism after the government scuppered a bill that would have banned discrimination against disabled people. One of his sternest critics was his daughter Victoria, a Labour party member who at the time worked for a disability pressure group. Memorably, on one occasion she took to the Today programme to sternly criticise him.Now Victoria says the affair did create tensions, even in a family where she had been encouraged to think independently (Sir Nicholas later told interviewers he was proud she had stood up for herself). ""My dad loved arguments and had a good sense of humour - he'd rather I was left-wing and had different political opinions than that I was totally uninterested,"" she says.""But we weren't prepared for the emotional and personal fallout, which was quite phenomenal. People in my family really felt I had betrayed my father, even if he didn't feel that himself.""Her experience may be far from uncommon, according to Elias Dinas, lecturer in politics at the University of Nottingham, who has researched the impact of parental influence on opinion-forming.""There's a volume of literature that says the more politicised your parents are, the more likely you are to become a politically engaged adult - but you're also more likely to abandon your parents' views,"" he adds. If true, this implies the best way to pass on your political opinions to your offspring is to keep quiet about them. In the Miliband household, this evidently wasn't an option.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

""It still causes the odd sleepless night.  It's very difficult to see an end of this.""In particular, what is likely to keep ACC Harris, and MI5, awake is the threat from the new amalgamated group known as the 'New' IRA.The group was formed last year and is made up of the Real IRA, Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) and powerful elements of unaffiliated, hardened former Provisional IRA members from County Armagh and East Tyrone. He worries about the emergence of a critical mass.""If that starts as a trend, people may feel it's better to be within this bigger grouping,"" he added.""Hitherto they have been very diverse and mistrusting of each other."" I wondered if there was intelligence that other groups were contemplating joining the 'New' IRA? ""We would watch very carefully for that,"" he said. ""All these groups say to themselves that they are in this for the long run."" His other concern is that a new generation of young people is being attracted to the dissidents and he described the process with words that I have come to associate more with Islamist extremists than Irish republicans. ""Radicalisation is happening,"" he said.""Young men, even in their very early 20s, are being charged with serious terrorist offences who must have only been very small children at the time of the Good Friday Agreement. ""They don't have any buy-in to the [peace] process and almost a nihilist response in terms of what a united Ireland would be like. That's worrying.""Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness has not pulled his punches in confronting the so-called ""dissidents"". There is no doubt about his visceral loathing, having steered the Provisional IRA from ""war"" to peace and power-sharing at Stormont. To call the dissidents ""traitors to Ireland"" with the PSNI's then chief constable, Sir Hugh Orde, standing at his side, was about the most damning insult that he could pay them, many of whom are his former comrades in arms. Nor was he daunted recently when the PSNI warned him of a serious death threat and his house was daubed with paint. At last month's Sinn Fein's ard fheis (party conference), he departed from his prepared speech and scathingly asked: ""Where were they when there was a war?""Interviewing Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly, I got the distinct impression that the party was now rowing back from inflammatory remarks of this kind, perhaps realising that such attacks may be counterproductive. David Cameron is now doing much the same with UKIP. Mr Kelly was almost emollient. No mention of ""traitors"" or republican draft dodgers, although he made his opposition clear in a measured way. 'Former comrades'""I think they are wrong,"" he said.""I don't think they have an analysis. I don't think they have a strategy.""But you have to deal with fact, that there are some young people in it. ""They get caught up in the ideology.  I can understand where they are coming from. ""What I'm more critical of are the ones who - some of them my former comrades - are almost trying to plot a revolution after it has taken place."" I asked if he had spoken to the dissidents and asked why they were continuing the ""armed struggle"" when the ""war"" was over?""The answer is yes,"" he added.""At this moment, the offer is out from myself, and from Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, to speak to them about their analysis, our analysis, and where we believe they are going wrong. ""That is a very open door."" It was almost as if Mr Kelly was offering the dissidents an olive branch. Behind the scenes there are signs that some of them may be prepared to take it up.The problem with the dissidents is that they appear to have no coherent and cohesive political programme. When all is stripped away, it is ""Brits Out"" and self determination for the Irish people. They do not accept that the cross-border referendum, in which there was an almost unanimous vote in favour of the peace agreement, was tantamount to self-determination. Talking to dissidents today reminded me of talking to the Provisional IRA way back in 1972 when the IRA leadership, that included Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams, met the Northern Ireland Secretary, William Whitelaw, for negotiations in Chelsea's Cheyne Walk. The IRA effectively told Mr Whitelaw that if the British wanted peace, they had to withdraw the constitutional guarantee to the unionist majority and leave by 1 January 1975. The British were appalled at the IRA's naivety.Perhaps the light then gradually dawned on Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness, realising that a simplistic ""Brits Out"" strategy was going nowhere. It was three years after Cheyne Walk, that Mr Adams and his comrades in the ""cages"" of the Long Kesh internment camp began to map out the IRA's long-term strategy that, over two decades later, led to their controversial acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement. The IRA's acquiescence led to the split in 1997 from which the Real IRA emerged. The following year, they bombed Omagh. The Real IRA then split into yet more armed dissident groups that are now bombing and killing to try to destabilise the peace process and carry on from where the Provisional IRA left off. Leading dissident Londonderry republican, Gary Donnelly, places the 'New' IRA in a longer timeframe. ""The Provisional movement didn't appear overnight,"" he told me. ""It would probably take them (the 'New' IRA) a lot of effort and a lot of time to get up to full steam. ""But the reality is that (as long as) there's a British presence in Ireland, there will always be a respectable minority who will challenge it and who will use force of arms.""However, despite his concerns, ACC Harris does not believe there is any danger of a return to the dark days of the past. ""There's not actually the broad base of support to mount a sustained campaign,"" he said.Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly is even more emphatic. ""It is not gaining momentum because the people do not want it,"" he added.""It's as straightforward as that.""Peter Taylor's report on ""The New Dissidents"" will be broadcast on Tuesday, 7 May at 20:00 BST on BBC Radio Four."

The main purpose of Obama's visit seems to be to re-make his image with the Israeli people. A recent poll indicated only 10% of them had a favourable view of the president. Obama critics at home have long claimed that he's no friend of Israel and say the proof positive is that he hasn't bothered to go there as president. By making this the first foreign trip of his second term he at least gets that out of the way. He'll be only the fifth US president to go to Israel, but his recent predecessors Bill Clinton and George W Bush invested a lot in the relationship. Obama offended some early on in his presidency by going to Cairo to make a high-profile speech to the Arab world but not continuing on to Israel. The speech also offended some Israelis because of the way he made a case for Israel's existence based on the horrors of the Holocaust rather than Jewish origins in the region. Expect him to correct that on this trip. The White House of course attempts to counter all this criticism, retorting that Israel has no better ally, citing the defence co-operation since he became president. The US and Israel are indeed bound together tightly. But the president's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fraught and dysfunctional. Perhaps the low point was when Mr Netanyahu came to the White House and treated the president to lecture on Israeli history in front of the cameras. The president practised a policy of containment, his face rigid with diplomatically suppressed emotions. One aim of the visit will be to present a chummier image. A sense of unity is important if Iran is going to believe that the two countries are capable of concerted action over its nuclear programme. But it is the speech at a convention centre in Jerusalem, where he will talk directly to the Israeli public and the public watching at home, that is the real centrepiece of this trip. Martin Indyk, former US ambassador to Israel, says: ""He's a rock star. They will welcome him. He's bound to get a bounce. And that is very important. This is a public who will punish a prime minister who mishandles his relationship with a popular president. ""Netanyahu eats [opinion] polls for breakfast. He will know if the balance changes."" Mr Netanyahu is already weakened by recent election results, and any change in opinion polls could make him more pliant both over the question of Iran and issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The downside of a speech that lavishes praise on Israel is that it may worsen Obama's image in the Arab world, where it has crashed from the dizzy heights of 2009.  The 2009 Cairo speech raised expectations so high that when little flowed from it many were gravely disillusioned.Several experts on the region have told me that the Arab world expects little of Obama. People are no longer listening.Syria and Iran are officially top of the trip's agenda. But everyone wants to know what the president will say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  He's told both Jewish and Arab Americans that he won't come with any grand peace plan. No wonder.I keep hearing the same two things. The first is that this is just about the last chance for the two-state solution - the idea of Israel and an independent country called Palestine living side by side.British Foreign Secretary William Hague has said it is ""slipping away"".Many others I've spoken to echo him. This isn't just overblown rhetoric. It is based on a simple equation. The more Jewish settlements there are in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the more difficult it is for both sides to do a deal. Some within Israel maintain that one key aim of the new Israeli government is to build even more such settlements. Certainly the composition of the new Israeli cabinet is interesting. The housing minister used to be a leader of the settlers' movement.Marwan Muasher, who served as Jordan's first ambassador to Israel, says the settlements mean any proposed peace talks are ""like two men arguing about a piece of pizza, while one of them is eating it"".The second common assumption is that that there is no real chance of getting talks going again right now. One party in the new government is explicitly against a two-state solution.  There's no sense of urgency among the Israeli public. Egypt is in too delicate a state to go out on a limb. Jordan is under enough strain with a badly performing economy, Syrian refugees and internal instability. Saudi Arabia shows no enthusiasm. Many ordinary Palestinians are unenthusiastic. One Arab expert told me: ""The public is fed up with what they see as a sham, just theatre. The words 'peace process' are enough to throw some Palestinians into seizures.""  So the only place momentum could come from is the US president. But he would be pushing against a door, tightly shut and triple locked by reality. Mr Muasher says: ""The stars are not going to align. The notion that you can leave it for now and pick it up later is over. So the president has to decide if he is going to do something very difficult. The answer is: 'No, he is not.'""Before the trip Mr Obama held meetings with leaders of both the Jewish and Arab communities in the US. He suggested to them that he would appeal directly to the people on both sides of the conflict, telling them that to want peace is not enough - they must act. Such fine words are easy, and are only to be expected.The new Israeli government is only a few days old, so provides a good excuse for not coming up with anything more concrete. What matters is what happens next. There are a few optimists who think Secretary of State John Kerry, who is accompanying the president, is absolutely determined to make an impact. They suggest after the visit he will put together detailed proposals that might at least get some talks going. Under this scenario the president would keep aloof until the end of the year, when he might give another push. Hope springs eternal, but few have realistic hopes of anything coming of all this.A US presidential visit to Israel is bound to generate headlines. Whether it will give birth to anything more lasting is much more open to question. "

In December, the African Union is due to take charge of the regional peacekeeping force of 2,500 troops currently in the country. But Mr Ban said he supported the eventual establishment of a UN peacekeeping mission with as many as 9,000 troops as long as conditions allowed. He also urged Security Council members to impose sanctions against perpetrators of mass rapes and killings allegedly already committed in the CAR.The Christian majority and Muslim minority always lived in harmony until March 2013 when Mr Djotodia seized power after his forces overran the capital, Bangui.Mr Djotodia became the first Muslim to rule CAR, installing himself as interim president and forming a transitional government that he says will organise democratic elections.The government denies targeting any group, but recognises the rise in inter-community violence."

But he added: ""If the expectation is that we can only have direct negotiations when everything is settled ahead of time, then there is no point for negotiations.""While there were ""irritants on both sides"", such problems could not be used ""as an excuse to do nothing"", he said.""My argument is that even though both sides may have areas of strong disagreement, maybe engaging in activities that the other side considers to be a breach of good faith, we have to push through those things to try to get to an agreement,"" he said. Thanking the US administration for its continuing support for the Palestinian Authority, Mr Abbas said peace with Israel should not be achieved through violence, occupation, settlements, arrests or denial of refugee rights.About 150 protesters were kept away from the Palestinian president's compound by police.Later in Jerusalem, Mr Obama told a student audience that the only way for Israel to thrive as a Jewish, democratic state was through the realisation of an independent and viable Palestinian state.  He said peace was necessary, just and possible, and that Mr Abbas and Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad were ""true partners"" for peace.Mr Obama was heckled as he spoke - but responded by saying it was part of the ""lively debate"" in Israel.On Thursday morning, Israeli officials said two rockets were fired from Gaza into southern Israel, but there were no reports of anyone being hurt. A further two rockets fired from Gaza reportedly fell inside Gaza itself. Mr Abbas condemned ""violence against civilians, whatever its source, including the firing of rockets"", according to a Palestinian spokesperson.On Wednesday Mr Obama pledged America's strong support for Israel as he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a two-state solution. Palestinians, however, will be sceptical about Mr Obama's commitment to statehood as such words have been uttered before, the BBC's Jon Donnison reports from Ramallah.In a 2009 speech in Cairo, Mr Obama called the situation for Palestinians ""intolerable"" and spoke of their ""undeniable"" suffering in pursuit of a homeland. Since then, however, little has changed on the ground as the Middle East's most intractable conflict has been sidelined by the Arab Spring, and US-Israeli concern over Syria and Iran, our correspondent says.Meanwhile, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said his country would ""raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to ground if Israel attacks"", Iranian state media report.Iran and its nuclear programme, which Israel believes is a threat to its existence, has been a major topic  during Mr Obama's visit.On Wednesday, he and Mr Netanyahu reaffirmed their commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, with the US president saying he still hoped the issue could be resolved with diplomacy, but repeating his assurances to Israel that he had not ruled out military action.The two leaders said they agreed that Israel had the right to ""defend itself by itself"".Before travelling to the West Bank on Thursday, the US leader visited the Israel Museum in Jerusalem with Mr Netanyahu to see the Dead Sea Scrolls. He will leave for Jordan on Friday.Security for his three-day visit is tight, with thousands of Israeli and Palestinian security officers on duty in Jerusalem and Ramallah, the Palestinians' de facto capital."

Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called on all Iranians to vote.""Whoever is elected, if he enjoys a strong and overwhelming vote, he will be able to stand up against enemies and aggressors more properly,""  Ayatollah Khamenei's website quoted him as saying.EndorsementsThe surge of support for Mr Rowhani came after Mohammad Reza Aref, the only reformist candidate in the race, announced on Tuesday that he was withdrawing his candidature on the advice of the pro-reform ex-president Mohammad Khatami.Mr Rowhani now has the endorsement of two ex-presidents, Mr Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.Most of the other remaining candidates in the poll are conservatives close to Ayatollah Khamenei.Friday's election is the first since 2009, when protesters took to the streets in anger at the results which they said had been rigged in favour of Mr Ahmadinejad.The opposition says more than 80 of its supporters were killed in a crackdown over the following six months, a figure the government disputes. Several have been sentenced to death, and dozens jailed.The two reformist candidates from 2009 - Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi - remain under house arrest."

Alternative for Germany wants the euro abolished, with states returning to their original currencies.Opinion polls suggest the party is unlikely to win widespread support in September's general elections.But analysts say it could skim enough votes from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats to make it harder for her to retain power.About 1,500 members of the Alternative for Germany, established last month, cheered as party founder Bernd Lucke outlined its stance.""Because of the euro, people in southern Europe don't hesitate to express their disgust toward Germany, using old Nazi comparisons,"" he said. ""The euro was a failure and it would be bad if we continue to believe in this fairy tale,"" he said.""If the euro fails, Europe doesn't fail,"" he added, challenging an assertion made frequently by Mrs Merkel.Earlier, Professor Lucke told the BBC he wanted to see a ""gradual dismantling of the euro as a common currency"".""We think that Europe has big problem coping with the euro as a common currency, since there are member countries of the eurozone which have big competitiveness problems, and which actually need a devaluation and can't have it,"" he said, citing Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and France as examples.He argues that bailouts aggravate rather than solve problems in southern European countries, though he says the party is not opposed to European unity.The party has attracted support from a number of academics and disillusioned members of Mrs Merkel's CDU.It also wants to introduce Swiss-style national referendums into EU decision-making, including on issues such as economic rescue packages.Polls suggest, however, that two-thirds of Germans remain in favour of the single currency.One poll earlier this month suggested that 7% of Germans would vote for the new party, and another 17% would consider doing so.But  there is doubt over whether it will garner the 5% of the vote required to enter the German parliament in September's general elections.Correspondents say Mrs Merkel remains comfortably ahead in terms of popularity, but must tread a thin line between those who are frustrated with frequently bailing out poorer eurozone countries, and those who support German efforts to preserve the euro."
15457	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25335797	Opinion	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"President Jacob Zuma's booing at the Nelson Mandela memorial is a topical issue here in South Africa, with local media leading with headlines such as ""Rain boo nation"". Calling this the ""beginning of the end"" of Mr Zuma's presidency would be overstating it - but it was humiliating. Mr Zuma sat quietly with a stern look on his face as several thousands of people booed each time his face appeared on a big screen at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium during Mr Mandela's rain-drenched state send-off. The heckling crowd had to be called into order a number of times, and Mr Zuma managed to deliver his factual but unmoving speech.  The address was a disappointment for those who were hoping he would use the opportunity to speak from the heart, to tell the world about his friend and comrade.He got a few cheers in the end, which I would imagine pleased him.Still, being booed in front of world leaders including US President Barack Obama, who got the loudest applause of all the day's speakers, could not have been fun. The master of ceremonies and African National Congress deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking in Zulu, told the crowd ""not to cause an embarrassment in front of visitors"". While Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for silence, the kind where you could ""hear a pin drop"" - there was no such silence but eventually the booing stopped. Mr Zuma had the enormous task of hosting a fitting tribute to the man Mr Obama described as ""a giant of history"".This was supposed to have been his shining moment, the day he cemented his legacy as the man who buried South Africa's most loved citizen - now a missed opportunity. His role in the affair has instead been overshadowed by South Africans' views on the chilly response he received. Callers took to local radio stations and social networking sites to air their views. Some thought it was inappropriate, especially at a gathering to honour Mr Mandela. But others thought it was testimony to Mr Zuma's leadership - or lack thereof. The ANC, especially in the days of Mr Mandela, was renowned for being disciplined.  When party members did not agree or even like each other, they were always expected to respect the position held by a fellow comrade. Most of all they were expected to always respect their leaders.We do not know, of course, that the people who took a swipe at Mr Zuma were ANC members. But what we do know is that it could not have been easy for the governing party to see the man who is supposed to win them next year's election treated with hostility. Mr Zuma's crowning glory has always been that of being a ""people's person"" - a man who can relate to the struggles of the poor. That is the vote the ANC needs in order to stay in power; it is also the same electorate that new parties - like the Economic Freedom Front lead by sacked ANC youth leader Julius Malema - are gunning for. So it is an important election for the party, and their leading man is bruised after a number of recent scandals. This year alone there has been controversy over the upgrade to Mr Zuma's private residence in Nkandla, a village in KwaZulu-Natal. The state spent 206m rand ($19.8m; £12m) of taxpayers' money to pay for security upgrades which were initially supposed to cost about 20m rand.Details have emerged in recent months that said security upgrades included an expensive swimming pool, a kraal for his livestock, a shop for his first wife, a clinic inside the premises and entertainment area for his guests. Now his party has been hard-pressed to explain that items made it onto the ""security"" list. Strike one.Strike two? The contentious new e-tolling system installed on the highways in the powerful Gauteng province, home to the capital Pretoria and the commercial hub of Johannesburg.The government borrowed 30bn rand to build the state-of-the-art system in time for the 2010 football World Cup and now wants motorists to repay the massive bill.Many say they were not adequately consulted about the process. Others are asking how the government can afford to spend millions on one man, but refuse to foot the bill on a project which is supposedly benefiting the millions that use the province's roads every day. Mr Zuma has raised the ire of many South Africans, including some within the governing party, before. Yet come elections, many people will remain loyal to the ANC - some even instinctively call it ""Mandela's ANC"". They remain loyal to what the party represents - the liberation of millions of black South Africans from the hands of a minority of white people. However, loyalty is not limitless. Could this see him ousted as ANC leader after secret meetings in the dead of night, as happened to former President Thabo Mbeki in 2008?As South Africans prepare to bury Mr Mandela, the booing may force the party to take a closer look at the man leading its bid to remain in power and ask: ""Could this man cost us the Mandela legacy?"""

The committee, which reports directly to the Prime Minister who also chooses its members, then looked at a number of UK intelligence reports that were produced as a result of this activity.In a statement on the allegations against GCHQ, the ISC said: ""The legal authority for this is contained in the Intelligence Services Act 1994.""The Director of GCHQ, Sir Iain Lobban, was questioned ""in detail"" by the committee, it said.

15465	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23003483	other	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The UK's senior military judge has expressed concern about the way in which members of the armed forces can be convicted of serious offences by a  majority of just one member of a military jury.The judge advocate general, Jeff Blackett, told the BBC the rules for military courts looked unfair and could be challenged in future cases.Five members of a panel currently weigh up evidence in a military court and can deliver their verdict on a majority of three to two.Judge Blackett said that should be amended because it did not appear fair when you compared it with what happens in the Crown Court, which has a minimum majority of 10 to two.A military court is already very similar to a Crown Court in many ways and the presiding judge, who is known as the judge advocate, must be a civilian.Instead of a jury, though, there is a board, usually consisting of five officers from other units.In a contested case, the board decides whether the defendant is guilty. A simple majority is sufficient and the defendant is not told whether the verdict was unanimous.Board members also have a say in the sentence passed on a convicted defendant, although the judge has the casting vote.In England and Wales, a majority verdict in the Crown Court needs the support of 10 jurors, or nine if two of the original members have been discharged.In Scotland, where juries in criminal cases have 15 members, the accused will be convicted provided at least eight jurors return a guilty verdict.Speaking to Law in Action, Judge Blackett said it was ""an area of concern"" that a defendant could be convicted by a military court if only three members of the board had voted for a guilty verdict and two had supported an acquittal.Judge Blackett pointed out that military courts had been brought into line with civilian courts in recent years, but he thought this aspect of the system should be amended.""It may look unfair that the defendant doesn't know that he has been convicted by a majority and that it's only by one person,"" he said, ""particularly in the more serious cases, such as murder, manslaughter, rape.""""Interestingly the New Zealand military justice system was changed recently and they used the British system as a model. But one difference was they decided that all convictions must be unanimous,"" he said.The issue of majority verdicts came before the Court Martial Appeal Court nearly three years ago.Three civilian judges headed by the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, held that a majority verdict did not infringe the right to a fair trial or produce an unsafe conviction. The appeal court decided in 2009 that military courts should no longer disclose whether verdicts were unanimous.But Judge Blackett suggested that a convicted defendant might bring a human rights challenge in the future in an attempt to find out whether there had been disagreement among members of board when they were coming up with their verdict. Judge Blackett is due to preside over the trial of Sgt Danny Nightingale next week, an SAS soldier who has denied possession of a prohibited firearm and ammunition.Between 2000 and 2011 there were 7,391 courts martial and 6560 of those cases involved army service personnel.Law in Action is broadcast on Tuesday 25 June at 16:00 BST and repeated on Thursday 27 June at 20:00 BST on BBC Radio 4.

Afghan officials dispute Taliban claims he was acting for them. The male soldier's next of kin have been informed of Monday's attack. Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman described it as a ""tragic incident"", adding: ""The PM's thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the soldier who was killed.""The spokesman said the military had stepped up counter-intelligence efforts and the vetting and screening of new Afghan National Army recruits. The attack comes as President Hamid Karzai is due in the US for a visit seen as key to the future of the American presence in Afghanistan.Spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Major Laurence Roche, said: ""This is an extremely sad day for the Corps of Royal Engineers and everyone serving with Task Force Helmand. Our thoughts are with the soldier's family and friends at this time.""The BBC's Quentin Sommerville said the attack is thought to have been triggered by an argument between Afghan National Army soldiers.Shortly after details of the incident emerged, the Taliban said they were behind the shooting, but they often wrongly claim such attacks, he said.Afghan defence officials told the BBC that initial assessment suggested the gunman was a soldier from the eastern province of Laghman.An official said: ""Currently there is an investigation into the attack. Initial assessment and information shows the attacker was not linked to the Taliban.""After he killed the British soldier, he tried to escape but members of the Afghan national security forces opened fire, killing him.''There has been a sharp rise in so-called insider attacks against local forces and Nato troops in Afghanistan. In 2012, more than 60 Nato service personnel, and a quarter of the British troops who died in Helmand, were killed in such attacks.All six of the British troops killed during the latest six-month tour of duty have died this way. A total of 439 UK service members have lost their lives in Afghanistan since operations began there in October 2001.President Karzai is arriving in the US for a three-day visit, which will include a meeting with President Barack Obama on Friday.It will be their first face-to-face talks since the US presidential elections.

Some 30,000 foreign soldiers left Afghanistan last year, and most of the remainder are expected to pull out by the end of 2014.Our correspondent says the US president is likely to discuss the size of the force that remains, and whether they are there to fight the Taliban or shift their primary focus to tackling al-Qaeda.Mr Karzai's visit comes days after a drone attack that killed Pakistan militant leader Mullah Nazir, who was accused of sending fighters to Afghanistan to support the Taliban.Ahead of the trip, the White House issued a statement saying Mr Obama ""looks forward to... discussing our continued transition in Afghanistan, and our shared vision of an enduring partnership"" between the two countries.Mr Karzai is expected to provide a request for future requirements for the Afghan military such as heavy weaponry, an improved air force and medical support.Our correspondent says the US spent almost $120bn (£74bn; 91bn euros) in Afghanistan in 2011, a figure that diplomats in Kabul say will be increasingly difficult to justify because of economic problems at home and extensive corruption within Afghanistan.Meanwhile Mr Karzai has held back from signing a long-term binding security agreement with the US, amid fears that Afghan sovereignty is being undermined.He is unwilling to grant US soldiers immunity from prosecution and is unhappy that Afghans are still being held in US-run military prisons on Afghan soil, our correspondent adds.Nato forces are committed to training Afghan security forces before foreign combat troops pull out."

At talks in Istanbul, Mr Kerry also called on Turkey and Israel to restore full diplomatic relations.Later he discussed reviving the Middle East peace process with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.Details of the meeting in the West Bank were not released. Mr Kerry is due to meet Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and Israeli President Shimon Peres on Monday, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday.Earlier, in Istanbul, Mr Kerry said after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu that he saw Turkey as an ""important contributor"" to efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East.On Iran, Mr Kerry said President Barack Obama was committed to continuing the diplomatic process, despite what he called the complicating factor of elections there in June. ""Diplomacy is a painful task,"" the secretary of state said, ""and a task for the patient.""World powers suspect Iran of pursuing a covert nuclear weapons programme.Tehran, which insists its intentions are peaceful, is negotiating with the so-called P5+1 group comprising the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, Russia, China, the UK and France - plus Germany.No new round of talks was scheduled after two days of negotiations in Almaty, Kazakhstan, which ended on Saturday.After recently helping broker a reconciliation between Turkey and Israel, Mr Kerry said: ""We would like to see this relationship that is important to stability in the Middle East and critical to the peace process... get back on track in its full measure.''That, he told reporters in Istanbul, meant promises of ""compensation be fulfilled, ambassadors be returned and full relations be embraced"".Mr Davutoglu said Turkey would be ""careful"" in its approach, and stressed that Israeli trade restrictions on the Gaza Strip ""should be eliminated once and for all"".Mr Kerry also met Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.More than 1.2 million people have fled to neighbouring countries since the unrest in Syria began two years ago, according to UN figures.At least 250,000 are in Turkey.Both Turkey and the US oppose Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with Turkey holding that the West should do more to help the Syrian opposition.The start of Mr Kerry's trip was overshadowed by the death of six Americans, along with an Afghan doctor, in two attacks in Afghanistan. The Americans included a foreign service officer who had acted as Mr Kerry's guide during his recent visit to Kabul.Anne Smedinghoff, 25, had been delivering books to students in southern Zabul province. She was the first US diplomat killed in service since last year's attacks in the Libyan city of Benghazi.Speaking to US consulate workers in Istanbul, Mr Kerry said Ms Smedinghoff's death was a ""grim reminder... of how important, but also how risky, carrying the future is""."

Some protesters attempt to force their way inside, smashing a window and attacking councillors' cars parked in the grounds of the building, including a vehicle belonging to DUP councillor, Guy Spence.Alliance councillor for east Belfast, Laura McNamee, confirms she has moved out of her home as a result of internet threats, amid controversy over the council's vote on union flag policy. A threat was posted to her Facebook page and she was advised by police not to return home.Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly also said he had received a death threat through Sinn Fein's North Belfast constituency office on the Antrim Road.A loyalist mob sets fire to an Alliance Party office in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, destroying the building.There is also an attempted arson at the constituency office of Alliance minister, Stephen Farry in Bangor, County Down.The home of a couple who are both Alliance Party councillors in Bangor is attacked. Paint is thrown at Michael and Christine Bower's home, smashing a front window close to where their infant daughter normally plays.A death threat is issued against the Alliance MP for east Belfast, Naomi Long.  She describes it as a ""wanton attack on the democratic process"".A Sinn Fein councillor on Belfast City Council, Jim McVeigh, confirms he has also received a death threat.The home of an Alliance party councillor in County Down is attacked overnight.  Windows are smashed and a car also damaged at Linda Cleland's house in Newtownards.There is an attempt to murder a policewoman as she guards Ms Long's Alliance party office in east Belfast. She is sitting in  car outside the office when a gang of men smash the window and throw a petrol bomb into the vehicle while she is still inside. The officer escapes without injury. Police reveal that to date, 29 police officers have been injured in loyalist protests and 38 people have been arrested.The DUP says two senior members of the party - Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots - have been warned of death threats against them.Mr Donaldson said those behind it threatened to shoot them both, along with their wives and children. Mr Poots said he believed the threat was from dissident republicans.In County Londonderry, a SDLP sign is vandalised and a union flag is erected outside the Limavady office of SDLP East Derry MLA, John Dallat.A death threat is made against the DUP leader and First Minister of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson.Darren Scott, an unemployed man from east Belfast, appears in court charged over the death threat against Mr Robinson.It is alleged in the court that the 34-year-old drank 12 pints of cider before making the threat in a 999 call.The SDLP MLA for south Belfast, Conall McDevitt, and Belfast DUP councillor, Guy Spence, both receive death threats.A DUP constituency office in Richhill, County Armagh, is vandalised. Newry and Armagh MLA William Irwin says the windows of the building have been smashed and paint has been daubed on the walls.It emerges that the Alliance Mayor of Larne has been forced to spend two nights away from her own home on police advice. There were concerns that a protest could be held outside Gerardine Mulvenna's house.She appealed for the protestors to stop and said she was prepared to talk to them. Sinn Fein's Belfast City Council group leader Jim McVeigh received a second death threat.He said that it had been made in a telephone call to a media outlet.""Those behind the threats to myself and other elected representatives cannot stop democracy nor will they,"" he said.""Belfast is a changing city and that change will not be halted by these threats."" A letter intended for SDLP politician Patsy McGlone contained a bullet and  a sympathy card.A package, containing his name and picture, was intercepted at the Royal Mail sorting office in Mallusk.The Mid-Ulster assembly member said whoever sent the sinister threat were ""faceless fascists"". ""This is obviously not something that is a pleasant experience, for me or my family, however, those who sent it will not put me off doing my job,  that is representing the people of Mid-Ulster."" said Mr McGlone.""I would like to pay tribute to the staff at the Post Office and the PSNI for their professionalism and vigilance in dealing with this matter.""Meanwhile, the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said a letter containing a bullet had been addressed to a Belfast-based newspaper reporter.The NUJ said it was intercepted by the PSNI and was sent following the journalist's reporting of the loyalist rioting.NUJ president Barry McCall said it was ""a despicable attempt to intimidate journalists working in extremely difficult circumstances""."
15476	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23508749	Opinion	1	International News	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will hold another round of peace talks within the next two weeks, US Secretary of State John Kerry has said.It follows two days of direct peace negotiations between the two sides in Washington DC - the first in three years.Here, Israeli and Palestinian readers give their views on the talks.I am glad to see a resumption of the talks.I would have hoped to see the resumption of proper communication at this stage, but I don't think at this moment that anything concrete will be accomplished or agreed upon.As always, I see the final status of Jerusalem as being the main obstacle.I would like to see the acknowledgment of the two-state solution as the only viable one.I would also like to see the halting of continued settlement construction, along with the continued access of Jews to the Old City being discussed.The Arab League Initiative, and its proposals of normalising relations between the Arab nations and Israel, must be allowed to reach fruition.There must also be an acknowledgement that the right of return of Palestinians to land on the Israeli side of the Green Line [or 1948 ceasefire lines] is illogical and politically impossible.I am sceptical that any true progress will be accomplished in these talks, but I can only hope to see a commitment on both sides to continue the process of communication.The last 20 years have passed, with several rounds of negotiations ending in vain. The failure of each round brought more disaster, pain and oppression, instead of progress and improving people's welfare.In light of this, how can any Palestinian be convinced that this round of negotiation is any different? Israel proved that it can make concessions when it endorsed the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in return for the release of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.But despite its recent decision to release 104 Palestinian prisoners, they will be released in stages over a pre-set timeline and it will be linked to the progress of the negotiations, which means that Israel will turn such a humanitarian issue into a pressing tool to serve its interests in the talks. It is hard to jump to the conclusion that this round will carry new horizons or open new doors. But the two sides should aim to bring about concrete solutions to affect people's lives and provide new economic opportunities for people on the ground.This should include the withdrawal from Area C [an area of the West Bank that remains under Israeli control] and the halting of settlement building and land confiscation.There should be an emphasis overall on at least reaching a compromise that will restore confidence in the peace process. The alternative is so hard and risky.The Palestinian leadership do not represent the Palestinian people. So they know these talks are futile. They are just protecting their interests and hoping to at least prolong the current status quo. The Israeli government also know this is futile and are just stalling. Months of talks will mean that their settlement plans can move forward with less scrutiny. Before any talks can proceed, all Palestinian refugees must be granted their right of return. Those who wish to return home must be allowed to do so. The military occupation should end, all restraints on people's rights should be lifted, and all violations of human rights should be stopped at once. Then you can go to the table and discuss the future of this land. The peace process has been failing and will continue to fail for several reasons. You have one side - Israel - who has the power, is supported by the US unconditionally, and has the protection of the international community, because any UN resolution that is not in favour of Israel will be vetoed by the US. So they have nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, they are also being handed billions of dollars each year in military aid. This so-called peace process is not based on justice, it is based on interests. It will fail because Israel is choosing who to negotiate with.In common with most of my friends and family, we regard the resumption of ""talks about talks"" as a waste of time. We feel that John Kerry is just doing his duty in trying to push the Obama administration agenda.But it also looks as if the Obama administration is once again trying to force the hand of the Israelis in order to forward the Americans' own foreign policy agenda, whatever that might be at the moment.Since Mahmoud Abbas's term as formal head of the Palestinian Authority has long since expired and he has deeply hostile relations with the Hamas rulers of Gaza, it seems that he has no power to sign any valid documents with our representatives.He also has much local opposition from his own people to any talks with the Israeli government.It is obvious that the Palestinian Authority has not made any attempts to promote education for peaceful co-existence.It is incapable of running its own affairs as an independent entity. The main obstacles are clearly the continued and intensive brainwashing of the younger Palestinian generation to hate Israel and Jews. Mr Abbas has yet again just declared that his state will not tolerate the presence of Jews. This is hardly a sign of any attempt at genuine peace-making.These talks will likely go the way of all previous ones. We don't have a partner for peace in either of the Palestinian leadership factions, which are as corrupt and inept as they always have been. The Arab population would do far better as fully-fledged citizens of Israel.  We would all benefit, socially, economically and spiritually. I believe there are enough Arabs who have no interest in bolstering this division any longer. They want to raise their kids and have a normal life. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas have no interest in collaborative effort. The money that has poured into the Palestinian Authority has not gone to build schools or improve infrastructure.I don't think these talks will achieve anything. The history of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations speaks for itself, and it will never fulfil the minimum requirements of the Palestinian people - our basic right to self-determination.So anything that is achieved will be superficial and won't serve the Palestinian people's cause. It will only serve the Palestinian Authority's interests. Ideally, these discussions would address the refugee issue, the issue of prisoners and the continuing land demolition and confiscation, which never ends. They would also discuss our ability and right to visit any place in our land, without Israeli permission, in addition to the basic human rights that we are denied. But this is not going to happen in these talks. They will not be any different from the previous ones. Yes, there may be some formal or temporary changes announced, but no major achievements, such as granting us our rights, as we would hope.Interviews by Stephen Fottrell."

15487	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21873460	News	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Dust skittered across the red carpet and the waiting press as US President Barack Obama's helicopter landed inside the Palestinian Authority presidential compound. An officer with a drawn sword marched in front as he walked with President Mahmoud Abbas in front of a row of men. They might be carrying guns, they might be dressed in khaki uniforms with gold-tasselled epaulets but they are an honour guard, not an army, for this is not a state - at least not in the eyes of America and much of the world. Mr Obama has come to the Middle East with the prime purpose of persuading the Israeli public that he understands and cherishes them, whatever his critics say. (Read this article by Jeffery Goldberg for a sophisticated take on this perception.)  The more he succeeds the harder it will be to persuade Palestinians that he cares about them. Many are already disillusioned that nothing much has changed since the grand vision of Mr Obama's Cairo speech. As if to make a point, two rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel this morning. Mr Obama is bound to condemn this in the news conference that will follow talks with President Abbas, but Israeli government sources have told the BBC that they will be  watching to see if the Palestinian leader follows suit. It will also be interesting to see if Mr Obama will be stern rather than laying on the love with a trowel as he did in Jerusalem when he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Within minutes of arriving there, he had said ""our alliance is eternal"". How is that for a special relationship? Mr Obama and Mr Netanyahu have rubbed each other up the wrong way so many times in the past that it is a wonder that the friction has not started any serious fires. But at their joint news conference after a meeting on Wednesday that lasted almost three hours, the warmth radiated was of a different kind, although perhaps summoned by arcane political skills.   Their script could almost have been taken from this very weird video released by the Israeli embassy in Washington, featuring both men as adoring bobble heads. The actual venue for the news conference was no less strange - a cross between a tent and a greenhouse, perhaps like an abandoned aviary - with greenery draped around the white trellis work, miniature orange trees in tubs and two large trees growing up between the TV cameras.In this would-be elegant setting, Mr Netanyahu talked of Mr Obama as ""gracious"" and glowed with approval of Mr Obama's twin messages. For the president has come bearing two  gifts for the prime minister. First, his continual stress on Israel's right to exist, not because of the horrors of the Holocaust - which, it could be argued, justifies only the theoretical existence of a Jewish state - but because of its history in the region dating back 3,000 years, which Israelis argue justifies its existence where it is. The second gift is a wholehearted commitment to Israel's security and its right to defend itself. This comes with the offer of a brand-new 10-year defence deal between the two countries. President Obama said that the US had an ""unprecedented"" ""solemn obligation"", which was ""non-negotiable"", to guarantee Israel's security. In case someone had missed the point, he said (without either putting on a leather jacket, or chewing gum)  that the ""tough neighbourhood has got tougher - we've got your back"".This new friendship has some practical consequences. There is a new openness about where the president and prime minister agree and disagree over Iran's apparent quest for nuclear weapons. Both say Iran must not get nuclear weapons - Bibi said he firmly believed that the president would take action to stop it. They underlined that their intelligence services agreed on how far the Iranians had got with their programme but Mr Netanyahu made it clear his red line was Iran getting enough depleted uranium to be able to build a bomb whereas the president's is Iran actually deciding to build the bomb and getting near to achieving it.That is not new - but being frank about it is. Mr Obama has reduced tensions by saying that Israel has the right to defend itself as it sees fit. It is not the first time he has said it, but he repeated it again and again, so there was no misunderstanding.  The president hinted international action might be needed in  Syria. He said that his government was actively seeking information on reports that chemical weapons had been used, while dismissing suggestions the rebels were to blame. He said if chemical weapons had been used it would be a ""game changer"" and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have made a ""serious and tragic"" mistake. Then there is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Mr Obama said he would talk more about that in his big speech. He admitted that he might have handled things more deftly in his first term but denied he had ever given up trying. He said making peace would be a ""hard slog"" but he wanted to listen to both sides rather than come with any big announcement. As everyone, in theory, wants peace, this is very easy to say. As yet, it does not amount to much. But Mr Obama has gone out of his way to make Israel feel loved, and he may just expect something in return.  "
15488	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22025714	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The endless empty rows said it all. For a political party struggling to survive, the choice of a huge Athens stadium for its annual congress was probably a bad one. A few thousand loyal supporters gathered, but the tens of thousands of vacant seats spoke of a party nearing oblivion.The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) has dominated the Greek political scene for more than three decades. It soared to power in 1981. The dictatorship had just ended here; Pasok created a welfare state, transforming Greece into a modern, European country.But today it languishes at around 6% in the polls, widely reviled for corruption and for accepting hated austerity while in power in 2009. At the congress, it still inspires some loyal supporters. ""The party has been misrepresented,"" says Panagiotis Alamanas. ""Any government would have had to cut wages and pensions. Everyone is trying to accuse Pasok of all the mistakes Greece made in the past 40 years.""""It is really difficult to explain to someone today that you support Pasok,"" admits Marina Mithou, a student. ""It's like a dirty word. But we will try to revive it.""For now Pasok is on life support as part of the coalition government. But few expect it can truly rise again. At its height, it was backed by almost half the Greek electorate under the adored leadership of Andreas Papandreou.""He was a genius,"" recalls Sifis Valirakis, one of the founding members. ""Pasok was a love affair. It was about a dream of freedom, democracy and a better future.""The 70-year-old pauses, his smile fading. ""But I feel a little disappointed, because the dream was not realised as we expected. We have a country bankrupt, corrupt and not functioning as it should.""Is Pasok to blame, I ask?""Among others, yes. It is no longer the party we fell in love with.""Pasok modernised Greece, enriched it, but then mismanaged it. The country racked up vast debts while Pasok and the centre-right New Democracy alternated in power. Both parties have been shaken by corruption and clientelism.""Pasok isn't to blame for everything that went wrong here,"" says political commentator Pavlos Tsimas, ""but being the natural party of government for over three decades, it is now being punished"".The party is criticised for sowing the seeds of future problems by building a bloated public sector based on patronage. Tens of thousands of jobs were created in state companies and then given to Pasok members: a system that continued under New Democracy.The notion of meritocracy was pushed aside as senior positions in universities and local councils became party appointees. Public construction licences were often decided on the basis of political support, with MPs lining their pockets through kickbacks. Corruption blossomed - even Andreas Papandreou himself went on trial in 1991 accused of embezzlement. He was narrowly acquitted.But Pavlos Tsimas says that the investment Pasok made in the country was essential, despite the extravagant way it was handled.""When Pasok took over, Greece was not a European state,"" he says. ""It had no public services to speak of. Pasok installed the national health system and free education. So it was a shock to its voters when the party of the welfare state suddenly said it was cutting pensions, salaries and jobs.""The collapse of Pasok has gone hand-in-hand with the decline of the Greece it created. And with it has fallen the once omnipotent Papandreou dynasty: George senior, Andreas and George junior were all prime ministers here, the former leading a party that preceded Pasok. Nepotism has long had a grip on Greek politics.But in their family village of Kalentzi in the Peloponnese, the name is still held high. The tiny community of 600 people nestles in the mountains, overlooking a lush valley. In George Papandreou Square, an iron statue of Andreas faces another of his father, George senior. The Papandreou home has become a cafe. Inside, I meet a cousin, Vasilis Stavropoulos. ""The Papandreous are a great political family,"" he says proudly. ""But perhaps democracy shouldn't be about dynasties.""Maria Leventi remembers the Papandreous fondly. ""All of them are beloved here,"" she tells me, ""because they gave us a better life when we were poor. They gave us the money to buy food and clothes. We could buy four televisions for one house, four cars for one family,"" she adds with a smile.Did they make Greece feel richer than it actually was, I ask?""Yes - a little,"" she confesses.So what is replacing Pasok's Social Democracy? The answer is clear in nearby Patras. The city was always a party stronghold. But in last year's election, it ditched Pasok for the first time, backing the new anti-bailout leftists, Syriza. Its leader is often compared to Andreas Papandreou for his firebrand rhetoric.Alexandros Liakopoulos and his family were among those who switched sides. Former staunch Pasok supporters, they are now suffering as many Greeks are, with two family members out of work and his mother's pension slashed by 60%.""Now the party has destroyed our national identity, our social and business environment. It has destroyed everything,"" Alexandros says.Would the Liakopoulos family ever return to Pasok?""Of course not. It's a corpse.""One of Europe's leading left-wing parties has fallen far. Its destiny has been tied to that of Greece: a confident European nation that has now lost its way. Pasok dreamed of a different legacy, to be remembered for its considerable early achievements. But instead it has become the political victim of a crisis it helped create. And one which might bring it down for good. "

He likened his main rival candidate, Henrique Capriles, to Spanish conquerors fighting indigenous people in the 16th Century.A centuries-old curse, he said, would fall on those who did not vote for him.Mr Capriles responded by saying the only curse for Venezuelans would be if Mr Maduro won the election. The country goes to the polls next Sunday to elect a successor to Hugo Chavez, the long-time leftist leader who died of cancer last month.Opinion polls suggest Mr Maduro, who was Chavez's deputy, has a lead of at least 10 points over his rival.Wearing a local indigenous hat at a rally in Amazonas state, a largely jungle territory on the borders of Brazil and Colombia, Mr Maduro said: ""If anyone among the people votes against Nicolas Maduro, he is voting against himself, and the curse of Maracapana is falling on him.""He was referring to a 16th Century battle when Spanish colonial fighters defeated indigenous fighters decisively.""If the bourgeoisie win, they are going to privatise health and education, they are going to take land from the Indians, the curse of Maracapana would come on you,"" the candidate continued.Analysts say that Venezuela's mix of Catholic and animist beliefs, especially in the south-central plains and jungles, is fertile ground for talk of spirits and curses which may otherwise seem out of place in an election campaign. Mr Capriles dismissed the election favourite's rhetoric.""Anyone who threatens the people, who tells the people a curse can fall on them, has no right to govern this country,"" he said at a rally in the western state of Tachira.""I tell you here, all Venezuelans, the real curse is that little group that we are going to get rid of on April 14.""There are five other candidates for the presidency but they trail far behind Mr Maduro and Mr Capriles."

The campaign has set 26 October as a day for Saudi women to take to the roads - in defiance of the informal ban on women behind the wheel.  In a sign of how pervasive online social networks have become in Saudi Arabia, the campaign was started on Twitter.It is the idea of the activist, Eman al-Nafjan, who set things in motion with a simple message saying that Saudi women would express their feelings about driving on 26 October.  The hope is that women will come out en masse to drive on that day, she told the BBC. Ms Nafjan says the campaign is meant to be a grassroots movement open to all Saudis - men as well as women - to show their support. Influential Saudis have given their public backing, while several videos of women driving have been posted on the campaign's website.  There is even a song linked to the campaign by the Saudi-born singer Shams, entitled It's Our Right to Drive. Photos have also been sent in showing supporters' hands with parts of the online petition written across them.  The first point in the petition reads: ""Since there is no justification for the Saudi government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so, we urge the state to provide appropriate means for women seeking the issuance of permits and licenses to apply and obtain them"".It goes on to say that  the Saudi government must provide a valid and legal justification if it continues to deny women the right to drive.  Women activists in Saudi Arabia say the issue of being allowed to drive is key to gaining other rights. There have been moves in this direction recently with women allowed onto the influential Shura council for the first time, as well as having the right to vote in the next municipal elections.But many Saudi women see this as little more than window dressing and are urging deeper freedom from traditional restrictions, such as those imposed by what they see as oppressive male guardianship. They argue that there is in any case an absurdity in the ban on driving as it means that women must rely on male drivers - thereby spending large amounts of time with a man outside their family. In other circumstances, this would be condemned as a serious transgression of the country's deeply conservative interpretation of Islam.  Those who oppose women driving do so on the grounds that it would violate that deeply traditional code.   In public, there have been signs that Saudi officials may be softening their line on women driving.  That is a change from when the first campaign was staged more than 20 years ago, leading to dozens of women who took to the wheel being arrested or losing their jobs. But Eman al-Nafjan says persistent rumours that the ban might be lifted soon are so far nothing more than that.  That has not dented the optimism of one veteran of the right to drive movement, Madeha al-Ajroush, who took part in the 1990 protest. She has already tweeted that she is ready to drive again."

The Commission's last report on the bill said the government wasn't going far enough on key issues like requiring the banks to keep more capital in relation to their debts, and on enforcing a ring-fence within banks, between utility and ""casino banking"", where they want tougher rules, and a reserve power to allow the Treasury to enforce a split across the whole sector, if it decides that the old habits are reappearing.A lot of the Commission members radiate scepticism about the bill (which is a kind of skeleton measure, empowering Treasury ministers to write the detailed rules on the running of banks, the firewall etc) so expect quite an astringent offering, when the report appears, and no backing down from their previous position. This will matter, because there will doubtless be an attempt to amend the bill in the Commons - and the government might accept some changes - but that will be backed up by a much more serious threat in the Lords, where the Commission's membership can muster formidable support for the changes they want to make. That apart, any excitement in Parliament next week will probably come from the unscheduled business like ministerial statements or urgent questions - because the main agenda is pretty humdrum. Early in the week, watch the amendments put down for the Crime and Courts Bill....this has long been touted as a possible vehicle for introducing Lord Leveson's proposals for press regulation, but the deadline for putting amendments down to achieve that will fall next week. At the moment the Labour peer Lord Puttnam has attached ""Leveson"" amendments to the Defamation Bill, and the prime minister may end up dropping that much campaigned-for measure to liberalise the libel laws, rather than allow the Commons to vote on them. Attaching similar amendments to a different bill might both give the government more time to find a compromise and get the Defamation Bill off that particular hook. There's a bit of a queue of bills amended in the Lords building up, and they all have to be approved or rejected by the Commons... and the Defamation Bill's being held in a kind of parliamentary purgatory while alternative press regulation proposals, based on the Conservatives' preferred idea of a Royal Charter, are negotiated. But agreement seems to be elusive and without it there's a chance Labour and the Lib Dems might be able to push Leveson-style statutory regulation through. The bill has to be passed by the end of the Parliamentary year, early in May. Interestingly, this week's statement of forthcoming Commons business, by the Leader of the House, Andrew Lansley, mentioned that Tuesday 19 March has been set aside for ""proceedings on a bill"", which might signal the deadline for sorting out the issue and bringing the Defamation Bill back.  (And incidentally there's also talk that something similar might be attempted in the Lords, with a last minute attempt to attach Leveson amendments to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill....)Here's my rundown of the week's scheduled events....The Commons meets at 2.30pm on Monday for Work and Pensions questions, then - assuming no ministerial statements or urgent questions - MPs turn to the second reading Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill.In the Lords (from 2.30pm) questions to ministers range across inequality in income in the UK, access to justice for those who will not be able to receive free legal advice on social welfare law (and this is the latest shot in a guerrilla campaign against changes to legal aid rules which come into force from 1 April) and future railway re-openings.Then peers move onto their final scheduled half day of report stage debate on the much-mangled Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill - ministers lost three votes on detailed amendments this week. Expect at least one vote, on an amendment from the Labour peer, Lord Mitchell, on directors' pay. After that there are a series of short debates, and the two which caught my eye are on the recommendations of the Francis Report into the Mid-Staffordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and on a European Union Committee report on Somali piracy.Tuesday starts at 11.30am as the Commons sits for Treasury Questions and then the Conservative backbencher Graham Evans has a ten minute rule bill on National Commonwealth Military Day (one of a number of Commonwealth-related events this week). Then there are two Labour-led debates, on tax fairness and apprenticeships. In the Lords (at 2.30pm) questions cover the effective implementation of the stalking offences added to the Protection of Freedoms Act, last year, and the UK's lack of foreign language skills. Peers then turn to the second report stage day on the Growth and Infrastructure Bill - here watch out for an ambush aimed at the government's City Deals programme, which hands extra powers to city councils. Labour and Lib Dem peers will be pushing for an annual report on how that's working out. There could also be a vote on planning powers for broadband infrastructure in areas of outstanding natural beauty, following some lobbying from countryside groups. On Wednesday, the Commons begins work at 11.30am with International Development questions, followed at noon by prime minister's questions. After that the Labour MP Diana Johnson takes centre stage to move a ten minute rule bill to allow the Consecration of Women Bishops. This is intended to remind the Church of England that Parliament is increasingly impatient with the General Synod's failure to authorise what many MPs see as the next logical step after the decision to allow women priests - and there might be an attempt to ensure there's a vote, simply to emphasise the level of Commons support.Then MPs turn to the report and third reading stages of the Crime and Courts Bill (see above). The Lords (from 3pm) there's a question to ministers on their consultation of early years practitioners on plans to increase the maximum ratio of carers to babies and toddlers - and then peers move onto report stage consideration of the Succession to the Crown Bill, the measure which allows gender equality in the rules of succession, so an older princess will trump a younger prince, in future. This could bring some of the Lords' traditionalists to the fore - Lord Laing of Monckton has tabled an amendment to extend the number of people who still need the Queen's permission to marry, and Lord James of Blackheath has an amendment to require the approval of the Scottish Parliament. And they'll also debate Commons amendments to the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill.There's also a short debate - continuing this week's Commonwealth theme - on the impact of discrimination against gay men and women in Commonwealth countries on efforts to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS.On Thursday, the Commons sits at 9.30am for Energy and Climate Change questions, which will be followed by the weekly Business Statement, by the Leader of the House, Andrew Lansley. And the rest of the day is devoted to subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee: Sir Alan Beith launches of a report on Youth Justice, from the Justice Committee and then MPs discuss Accountability and Transparency in the NHS with MPs Charlotte Leslie, Philip Lee, Stephen Barclay, John Pugh, Sarah Wollaston and Kate Hoey leading the debate. Meanwhile, over in Westminster Hall there's a debate on Commonwealth Day led by Sir Alan Haselhurst, who chairs the UK Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. There was an attempt to get all Commonwealth parliaments to have a Commonwealth-themed debate on on Commonwealth Day, (Monday 11), but alas the UK Parliament didn't manage to arrange one, and this is the nearest they could get.  In the Lords, (from 11am) there are questions on forcing British companies to disclose any tax avoidance schemes that could be detrimental to poorer countries. That's followed by a debate on Afghanistan's regional relationships and their impact on its long-term future, and then peers will be asked to approve a couple of Church of England measures, on the diocese in Europe and clergy discipline.Neither House will sit on Friday"

But it warned it would be costly to maintain a level of intelligence-gathering which would meet the encryption and computer security standards of its bigger partners. And it pointed out a senior, more powerful partner, such as the rest of the UK, would dictate the policy and costs, raising questions about how much independence a Scottish security service would really have. Mr Pearson said it was clear experts had real concerns about the security implications of breaking up the UK. He said: ""As part of the UK we currently enjoy a high level of security. ""Why would we want to put this at risk because of Alex Salmond's obsession with independence?"" He said: ""The SNP can't answer basic questions about what kind of intelligence and security service a separate Scotland would have, how much this would cost and whether we would enjoy the same level of security.""From my experience as a police officer for over 35 years, developing effective working relationships with colleagues across the UK is far easier because we are part of the UK.""Mr Burnett, previously counter-terrorism co-ordinator with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (Acpos), said: ""Based upon my experience, I simply do not accept these criticisms of Scotland's abilities to have effective security arrangements - and it is worth recalling that Graeme Pearson fought very hard to keep the SCDEA as a Scottish institution, and not part of a UK-wide unit. ""This helped ensure that Scotland got a better deal in fighting drugs and serious organised crime.""An excellent Scottish intelligence organisation could be developed in an independent country.""He added: ""I have witnessed great Scottish talent in military, secret and police intelligence services, and can readily envisage the huge ability, energy, integrity and innovation they would pour into this exciting mission.""The Scottish government also rejected the claims. A spokesperson said: ""An independent Scotland will have first-rate security arrangements to counter any threats we may face.  ""And we will continue to work in very close collaboration with the rest of the UK and international partners on security and intelligence matters, which is in everyone's interests."" "

In a joint statement, the two sides say they are ""building agreement"" on the rebels' participation in politics, despite a tense week in Colombia. The five-decade-old conflict has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Meanwhile, President Juan Manuel Santos praised the army for killing the regional Farc leader, Jesus Antonio Plata Rios, known as Zeplin, on Friday.""Thanks to the joint work of the air force and the army, the head of Farc's western front, Zeplin, has been neutralised,"" he wrote on Twitter. Mr Plata Rios led the rebels in western Colombia and was also in charge of gathering support for the rebels in the region, authorities say.The joint statement issued by the Colombian government and the left-wing rebels in Cuba says concrete proposals have been presented and discussed by both parties.They started building an agreement to ""secure rights and guarantees for the exercise of the political opposition"", it says.Political participation is the second bloc of issues being negotiated at the talks aimed at ending more than 50 years of armed conflict. ""Never before has anyone come this far,"" Mr de la Calle told reporters at the end of the latest round of negotiations.Land reform was the first item agreed on the six-point agenda of the talks, in May, after more than six months of negotiations.Mr de la Calle's optimistic words on Saturday came after a tense week in Colombia, with strong words coming from the government.Farc leaders criticised Mr Santos remarks on Friday, saying that rebel leaders would be tracked down and killed by government forces.In an interview earlier in the week, the Army commander, General Sergio Mantilla, said Colombia's largest rebel group was ""in agony"".But the left-wing group said they were not ""demoralised"" and blamed the government for pre-emptying the talks.Despite the slow pace of negotiations, the Colombian government has insisted a peace accord can be agreed before the end of the year.The Farc warned of the dangers of rushing into a settlement.""It is possible [to reach an agreement by November]. But to achieve peace, you need time. A bad peace deal is worse than war,"" he said in an interview with Colombian network RCN.A study by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory suggests 220,000 people have died as a result of the country's five decades of internal conflict.There is huge pressure in Colombia for justice for those who have perpetrated acts of violence from both sides of the conflict. The government has promised to bring to justice those responsible. The rebels say most of the victims were poor peasants and other civilians targeted by the army and right-wing paramilitaries for their alleged support to the rebels."

The drones are made by an Italian firm, Selex ES, a subsidiary of the Italian giant Finmeccanica.UN officials expect three more to be deployed in the coming months - one by the end of December and two more by the end of March 2014.They will be deployed across North Kivu, which has been one of the areas worst affected by two decades of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DR Congo.They have a range of 250km (155 miles) from their base in Goma. Technicians say other bases could easily be set up, which would allow for a broader surveillance. Congolese Defence Minister Alexandre Luba Ntambo says the drones will help the army against rebel groups.""Once we know exactly where they are hiding, our operations will be much more efficient,"" he said.Despite the defeat of the M23, numerous other armed groups still roam eastern DR Congo, including the FDLR, whose leaders are accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda."

He was speaking alongside Afghan President Hamid Karzai on the eve of US-led talks aimed at soothing tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.Nato is set to end its decade-long combat mission in Afghanistan before the end of next year.Mr Karzai said he was looking forward to Nato's continued support. Speaking at Nato's Brussels headquarters, Mr Rasmussen said: ""We need a positive engagement of Pakistan if we are to ensure long-term peace and stability not only in Afghanistan, but in the region. ""Pakistan and Afghanistan have a mutual interest in fighting extremism and terrorism and cross-border activities.""A secret Nato report on Islamabad's links to the Afghan Taliban leaked in February says the Taliban are helped by Pakistani security services.Pakistan has denied the claim, saying it has no hidden agenda in Afghanistan.Mr Rasmussen said the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force was in the process of handing security operations to Afghan forces; Isaf's role was gradually shifting ""from combat to support"", he added.The 100,000 remaining Isaf soldiers are due to be withdrawn by the end of 2014, after which Nato says its role in the country will essentially be a training one.Mr Karzai said Afghanistan would ""definitely be able to provide for the security of the Afghan people"". The Afghan leader was later scheduled to meet US Secretary of State John Kerry, who was also holding talks with the head of Pakistan's military, Ashfaq Kayani.On Wednesday the three men will hold a joint meeting - alongside Afghan Defence Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi and Pakistani Foreign Secretary Jalil Jilani - as part of what the US describes as ""an ongoing trilateral dialogue"".Mr Kerry hopes Wednesday's talks will help to bolster security in Afghanistan and along its rugged 2,600 km (1,600 mile) border with Pakistan. He has described 2013 as a ""critical"" transition year for Afghanistan, 12 years after the US-led invasion to topple the Taliban regime that was harbouring al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.The leaked Nato report - based on the interrogations of 27,000 captured Taliban, al-Qaeda and foreign fighters as well as civilians - says Pakistan is aware Taliban leaders take refuge within its borders.Senior Taliban figures such as Nasiruddin Haqqani are housed close to ISI headquarters in Islamabad, adds the report, entitled State of the Taliban.Adm Mike Mullen, former chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, has explained Pakistan's closeness to the Afghan Taliban by pointing to infiltration of its army by the religious right.

Two employees received a final written warning, one for ""posting worrying comments"" and the other for ""bringing the council into possible disrepute by posting inappropriate comments"". In a statement Powys council said: ""The use of social media within the council is limited during core working hours unless staff members request access for business purposes to update information for the public. ""In which case, they have to submit a business case to our communications team for approval."" In Gwynedd, three council employees received a written warning for disparaging the council on Facebook.There were three cases of misuse in Torfaen in 2012, but the council would not release details claiming it would be ""contrary to the principles of the Data Protection Act"".

It also says the cost of litigation against the Ministry of Defence is up, with £130m going towards it in 2012-13.Lawyers for the families of service personnel have dismissed the findings as ""political"" and ""biased"".Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he remained ""concerned about the challenge to combat immunity arising from recent court judgment"".Entitled The Fog of Law, the report points to the application of the Human Rights Act and the growing application of civilian norms to military conduct via the courts as risks to the UK's armed forces.It says the MoD has earmarked a total of £130m for litigation - including 5,827 legal cases - in 2012-13; under £70m was spent on legal action in 2008-9.As part of this, the MoD now employs around 310 lawyers and legal consultants at a cost of £36m a year, the report says.Its authors are Territorial Army Lieutenant Colonel and strategy consultant Tom Tugendhat, and retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Laura Croft, who served in Iraq and also as a lawyer. They say the main ""weapon"" used in the legal challenge is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).Although the ECHR had applied since September 1953, the Human Rights Act (HRA) in 1998 gave individuals the ability to appeal directly to domestic courts.  This, combined with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, saw a rise in actions brought through the courts.In the past, those serving in the military were protected from prosecution under Combat Immunity, while the Law of Armed Conflict regulated the conduct of war. But recent judicial findings have extended common law claims of negligence and civil claims of duty of care to the combat zone, and the authors claim this is already affecting the combat capability of the services. They cite cases such as that of Ahmed al-Fartoosi, the leader of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's militia, who is in the process of suing the British government for compensation. He alleges abuse during his captivity in Basra, and claims that he was denied his rights under the ECHR. Other claims include that of Ali Al Jedda v the UK (2011). The claimant was arrested travelling from London to Iraq in 2003 on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist group involved in weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in Iraq. He sued the government under Article 5 of the Human Rights Act, a decision rejected by the UK Supreme Court but overturned by the ECHR.The Supreme Court ruled this year that British troops remain within the UK's jurisdiction and so fall under the Human Rights Act, even when deployed on active service abroad. This has led to cases in which relatives of British soldiers have sued the MoD under human rights law. The report's authors warn that ""legal creep"" could pose a ""mortal threat to the culture and ethos of the military which cannot be easily reversed.""They say that the extension of law risks ""catastrophically weakening the UK"". They insist it may not be long before a foreign power or even insurgent forces begin to sponsor legal actions as a way of paralysing UK forces through legal process. The report adds that claims involving human rights law are increasingly costly, with the MoD estimating that such cases will cost a total of £57m in 2012-13.The most common cases not involving human rights law brought against the MoD last year related to noise-induced hearing loss and cost £51.3m altogether. Lt Col Tugendhat told the BBC that military personnel should not be above the law.But he added: ""As the ultimate guarantors of a nation's liberty they have agreed, voluntarily, to surrender or limit many of their own rights. Without this, the nation would be undefended.""The report recommends that: the government should introduce legislation to define Combat Immunity to allow military personnel to take decisions without having to worry about the risk of prosecutionParliament should legislate fully to exempt the MoD from the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Actthe UK should derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights during deployed operationslegal aid should be removed from lawsuits brought by foreign nationals against the UK government. But lawyers for Sue Smith, whose son was killed in a Snatch Land Rover in Iraq in August 2007, criticised Policy Exchange's conclusions.Jocelyn Cockburn of Hodge Jones & Allen said: ""Wives or mothers such as Sue Smith come to me not because they wanted compensation money, but to campaign against the use of Snatch Land Rovers in Iraq because they wanted to protect other soldiers, and improve the safety of servicemen and women abroad.  ""It's very important to have independent scrutiny of decisions made by the MoD. War is risky, and therefore you have an obligation to reduce risk and mitigate the threat."" Mr Hammond welcomed the report as a ""timely contribution to the debate about the appropriate balance between legal protections and freedom of decision-making by commanders in the field"".But he added: ""It cannot be right that troops on operations have to put the European Convention on Human Rights ahead of what is operationally vital to protect our national security.""

The Council named former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his deputy Ali Salim al-Beidh, along with others. The statement also expressed concern about reports that money and weapons are being brought into Yemen.The British ambassador to the UN said such meddling would not be tolerated. ""What [President Ali Abdullah Saleh] should not do is undermine the political transition, the national dialogue, which is fully supported by all the international community,'' Britain's UN Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said.""What we are saying is that we are giving our full weight behind that process, and we will not tolerate individuals of whatever stature undermining that process.''The statement was approved by all 15 council members.The BBC's Barbara Plett, at the United Nations in New York, says that despite its troubles the Security Council regards Yemen as a rare success story in its track record on the Arab uprisings. Our correspondent explains that pressure from the Council played a key role in stopping Yemen's sliding towards a civil war and getting the country's two main power blocks to agree on a political transition.Under the deal, Mr Saleh had to step down in exchange for immunity and politicians formed a national unity government to prepare for elections due to be held in February 2014. A dialogue process intending to draw in marginalised and excluded political groups is set to begin mid-March, but UN officials have warned that the process is very fragile and could still collapse. The council statement also expressed concern about reports ""of money and weapons being brought into Yemen from outside for the purpose of undermining the transition''.Yemen has complained to the Council about a seized weapons shipment it says was sent by Iran whom it claims is supporting a southern separatist movement. The ship, Yemen says, contained Iranian-made bomb-making material, suicide belts, explosives, rockets, surface-to-air missiles, grenades and ammunition.Iran has strongly denied the charges, and the UN is investigating the claims."

""They told me that this was Obama's car,"" he told the newspaper. ""They didn't say what had happened to it. They just said it had got stuck. Only the mechanic was there when I arrived. The driver had left in another car. The whole thing was very funny."" Mr Matmon said the limousine was being repaired at a garage in Jerusalem. Despite the apparent hitch, correspondents said the atmosphere for Mr Obama's red-carpet reception at Ben Gurion airport was friendly and relaxed.President Obama even made a light-hearted reference to Mr Netanyahu's warning of a ""red line"" with Iran's nuclear programme.As they headed to inspect a nearby anti-missile system, TV cameras picked up Mr Obama asking a military official: ""Where do you want to start?""""We are following the red line, sir,"" the officer said, referring to a red line on the tarmac.""The red line, okay,"" said Mr Obama, who smiled, gestured with his thumb toward Mr Netanyahu and said: ""He's always talking to me about red lines.""On Thursday President Obama will visit the West Bank to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas."

He believed Muhammed had been kidnapped by the jihadists.Another activist, who asked not to be named for her own safety, said she and her sister, also involved in the protest movement, had fled after being fired at by ISIS gunmen.""Seven or eight men with explosive belts surrounded my sister. Some said: 'Knife her.' Some said: 'Shoot her.' They tore down her banner that said 'Christians and Muslims are one', and told her she was an infidel,"" the activist said.The protests started in September after jihadists raised their black flag over a church in Raqqa and turned it into their headquarters.  ""Two carloads of armed fighters went onto the roof of the church. They broke the bell with hammers, and threw one of the crosses down into the street. They tried to break it, but it was iron,"" the activist said.Activists filmed protesters carrying the cross through the streets shouting ""Shame! Shame!"" and calling for Muslim-Christian unity.Earlier this year, Raqqa became the first provincial capital in Syria to fall fully under rebel control.But after only two months when control was shared by SMC-aligned and jihadist fighters, it was taken over in May by ISIS. They marked the moment by publically executing three men they said were Alawites, members of the same heterodox Shia sect as President Bashar al-Assad. Now Raqqa, its population swollen by displaced families, may be the largest city in the world ever to be controlled by al-Qaeda.Mr Matar said: ""They banned the sale of alcohol, they tried to close cafes where boys and girls sit together, they banned street theatre, cinema, bright colours, and forced women to wear Islamic dress.""They are the new dictators, just like Bashar al-Assad, but dressed in black. Only the colour has changed.""Smaller but better funded than other rebel groups, ISIS has historically been made up of foreign jihadists from Arab countries - particularly Iraq, but also Libya, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia - Russia's north Caucasus, and Europe.But activists from Raqqa said it was now attracting more and more Syrian recruits. In the last few months, ISIS has made significant advances, largely at the expense of the FSA, and controls a wide swathe of northern Syria close to the Turkish border.

The website has not further elaborated on Mr Snowden's exact whereabouts.Both Wikileaks and Russia have denied reports that the Russian secret police have questioned the American.Mr Snowden first fled to Hong Kong before flying to Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on Sunday.He was expected to board a flight to the Venezuelan capital Caracas on Monday but his seat remained vacant. The 30-year-old IT expert has had his US passport revoked and applied for Ecuadorean asylum.Speaking during a visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Wednesday, Mr Patino compared the case to that of Mr Assange, who has been living inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London for more than a year.Mr Assange walked into the embassy when his appeal against extradition to Sweden for questioning on accusations of sex crimes was turned down last June.Mr Patino was quoted as saying that ""it took us two months to make a decision in the case of Assange, so do not expect us to make a decision sooner this time.""But on his Twitter account he later accused the media of misrepresenting what he had said.""In Kuala Lumpur I said that the decision about asylum could be taken in a day, a week, or - as in the case of Assange - could take two months,"" he wrote.""Some media cut off the first half of my statement and left only the second. They are trying to confuse, we know what they are like.""Mr Patino also said Ecuador had not yet decided whether to offer protection to Mr Snowden in the meantime.""If he goes to an embassy, then we will make a decision."" Ecuador said it would consider the American's application ""responsibly"" and would weigh ""human rights obligations"".It added that the US would have to submit its position in writing regarding Mr Snowden.Venezuela has also said it will consider an asylum application from Mr Snowden.Mr Snowden's case has caused a diplomatic spat, with the US accusing Russia and China of assisting the fugitive. Both nations have rejected the charges.Russia earlier confirmed that Mr Snowden was still in a transit zone at the Moscow airport.Although the country has no extradition treaty with the US, Washington said it wanted Moscow to extradite Mr Snowden without delay.But Russia said that the American was technically not yet under its jurisdiction because he had not passed through immigration.However, the United States is in ongoing discussions with the Russian authorities over the fate of Edward Snowden, according to White House spokesman Jay Carney.He told reporters travelling with the US President to Africa that he was ""not at liberty to get into the details of those conversations"" but that they were taking place.  Meanwhile, China described accusations that it allowed Mr Snowden to leave Hong Kong despite an arrest warrant as ""groundless and unacceptable"".The Chinese government has expressed deep concern about the leaker's allegations that the US had hacked into networks in China.Mr Snowden is wanted by the US for leaking highly sensitive information to the media about a secret government surveillance programme, which he obtained while working as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA).He is charged with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence.His leaks have led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under an NSA programme known as Prism.US officials have defended the practice of gathering telephone and internet data from private users around the world.They say Prism cannot be used to target intentionally any Americans or anyone in the US, and stress that it is supervised by judges."

Argentina refuses to pay anything to investors who declined to participate in a previous debt reduction deal involving most of the nation's lenders.Argentina was not minded to obey the previous court order, lawyers said.""We would not voluntarily obey such an order,"" Jonathan Blackman, a lawyer for Argentina, told the appeal hearing.However, he said Argentina was open to a solution that is ""workable and doesn't create a terrible confrontation"".The appeal comes after a Manhattan court ruled last February that Argentina had violated its contractual obligation to treat all creditors equally. That meant the country would have to pay the bondholders, led by NML Capital and Aurelius Capital Management.Argentina defaulted on some $100bn of debts in 2002, and has since restructured its debt twice, cancelling around 75% of the nominal value of the bonds.Almost 92% of the country's bondholders agreed to write off most of the amount owed to them.NML Capital and Aurelius are demanding 100% repayment plus interest.The two investors were so determined to get their money that they went to court to have an Argentinean ship, the Libertad, impounded in Ghana. After several weeks, the ship returned home.There is concern that if the pair succeed in getting all their money, Argentina's settlement with other creditors could unravel. The court ruling could also set an unfortunate precedent for other heavily-indebted nations seeking to restructure their finances.However, Circuit Judge Reena Raggi said at Wednesday's hearing that a court's role is to enforce contracts, ""not to rewrite them"".She said it ""hardly seems appropriate for a court not to enforce one of its orders, because a party will breach another of its obligations"".The appeals court is expected to take several weeks to make a judgement."

Twenty-five attacks will be examined - in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, the Palestinian territories and Somalia. Mr Emmerson told journalists in London that the increasing use of drones ""represents a real challenge to the framework of international law"".If unregulated, he said, the use of drones would continue to grow.The inquiry will assess the extent of civilian casualties, the identity of militants targeted and the legality of strikes where there is no UN recognition of a conflict.Defenders of drones say they minimise civilian casualties, but opponents say drone strikes can constitute extra-judicial killing and point to data suggesting hundreds of civilians have died in such strikes.Drones - or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - have become an increasingly potent weapon for nations seeking to target militants but there is increasing controversy over their toll on civilians.Between 2004 and 2013, CIA drone attacks in Pakistan killed up to 3,461 people - up to 891 of them civilians, according to research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.The vast majority of the strikes were carried out under the administration of President Barack Obama, it said.Some kinds of drone attacks - in particular ""double tap"" strikes where rescuers attending a first blast become victims of a second - could constitute a war crime, Mr Emmerson has previously said, according to the Guardian newspaper. Addressing journalists on Thursday, he denied the inquiry was unfairly singling out the US and Israel, saying 51 states had the technology to use drones.He said it was not a substitute for ""effective, official and independent investigation"" by states, and called for independent investigations where there was ""plausible evidence of a war crime"".The inquiry will report to the UN General Assembly in the latter half of the year."

America's weak spot is its economy, which began to totter from the drain of its military and security expenditure,"" he says.Zawahiri advocates ""continuing the drain of military and security expenditures so that we keep America in a state of tension and anticipation, [wondering] when and where the next blow will come"".""Keeping America in a state of tension and anticipation does not cost us anything but [organising] dispersed strikes here and there. In other words, just as we defeated it in a war of nerves in Somalia, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan, we must afflict it with a similar war in its own home.""These dispersed strikes can be carried out by one brother, or a small number of brothers."" The emphasis on smaller-scale strikes may well be seen as an acknowledgement of a diminishing ability of al-Qaeda's central leadership to plan and carry out major, organised attacks of the type it managed in the past.That shift is evident in Zawahiri calling on supporters to begin an economic boycott.""We must explain to them that every dollar's worth of goods that we buy from America and her allies amounts to a bullet or shrapnel that kills a Muslim in Palestine or Afghanistan.""Most analysts believe that the al-Qaeda core in Pakistan has been severely damaged and this message appears to be an acknowledgement of that reality.However, affiliates in other parts of the world - notably al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen - are said by government officials to remain a threat. Zawahiri, who has historically tended to focus more on ideology and strategy, also spends a significant amount of the message talking about recent events in Egypt.He says that the US was behind the ""coup"" against the Muslim Brotherhood.He also criticises Mohammed Morsi, the deposed president who hails from the Muslim Brotherhood, saying he was not governing according to Islamic law and had committed to abide by security agreements with the US and Israel.Zawahiri, whose background before joining al-Qaeda was in Egypt's Islamist movements, also emphasises his opposition to the Brotherhood's willingness to work through democratic politics.He criticises other Islamist movements in places like Tunisia for coming to ""an understanding with America"".The events in the Middle East have raised serious ideological challenges for al-Qaeda, with it appearing increasingly irrelevant amid signs that protests, people power and even democratic elections might be a more viable vehicle for change than the kind of violence that al-Qaeda espoused.However, with the optimism of the past few years fading fast, Zawahiri appears to be hoping that al-Qaeda's ideology of rejecting democracy and promoting uncompromising violence might be able to gain more of a foothold.Syria remains a key focus for international attention - including for al-Qaeda. Zawahiri warns Islamist opposition groups there not to come to any agreement with ""secularists"" who are also fighting the Assad regime.""Let what happened in Egypt be a lesson to them,"" he says, before arguing that the jihadists groups need to unite in the region.This may well be a reference to recent reports of splits and divisions, not just within Syrian jihadist groups but also with the Iraqi-based groups.

Speeds of up to 250mph on HS2 would reduce a Birmingham to Leeds journey from two hours to 57 minutes.Supporters of HS2 says it holds massive future benefits for the economy and would cut emissions from air travel.Critics - many in traditional Tory-voting areas - argue that HS2's predicted economic benefits have been overestimated by the government, and suggest swathes of picturesque countryside would be blighted by the railway.More than 70 groups oppose HS2. Eighteen councils along the route which are against the scheme, known as the 51m group, say that taxpayers cannot afford the line and it will increase greenhouse gas emissions. But Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ""This commitment is the next important step in securing a modern high-speed rail network linking the north and south of Britain which will unlock significant economic and environmental benefits.""He said the legislation was ""good news for both passengers and the economy and "" key to providing the extra capacity today's booming rail industry will need in the years ahead"".Institution of Civil Engineers director general Nick Baveystock said the plan ""presents an opportunity to bring about a real step-change in rail capacity and help regenerate and boost the economies of our city regions"".Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, which campaigns for lower taxes, said HS2 was a ""great vanity project...  poor value compared to more affordable alternatives, but there is still time to reconsider that white elephant""."

Angela Merkel is a texter: she does it all the time.  There she is during a debate, thumbs going furiously. Sometimes she texts colleagues across the chamber, and then looks up and catches their eye to check they have got the message.   In her office in the Kanzleramt - the Chancellery - it lies on the floor, charging.  But the rest of the time, it is not far from her hand.Since she has learnt that others might be reading her messages at the National Security Agency in Maryland outside Washington, she has said that she doesn't plan to change her habits.  An enterprising German company has marketed what it calls the Chancellor Phone - one so secure that prying eyes and ears cannot intrude. The chancellor will no doubt use the Chancellor Phone - but you cannot doubt that recent events have shaken her.In Germany, particularly in East Germany where Angela Merkel grew up, people feel strongly about the state tapping phones and bugging rooms.  In the east of Berlin,  an amazing complex of buildings houses what was once the headquarters of the ministry of state security, the Ministerium fur Staatssicherheit - the Stasi.Today, the headquarters is a museum and a home for the vast archive where East Germans can learn who spied on whom.One Berlin politician learnt after the Berlin Wall came down that her husband had spied on her.  She divorced him.The offices themselves now display all the paraphernalia of eavesdropping - the hollow tree-trunks with a hole for the camera; the jacket buttons that turn out to be lenses.  The spying of the past is there for all to see.When communism collapsed, there were 91,000 people working for the Stasi.  It is easy to find maps showing old Stasi premises, and just in the area where I live in Berlin, there are seven places used by the spooks of the Stasi - seven secret flats within an area not much bigger than a football field.  That's how pervasive spying on citizens was.  Just behind where I live, 79 Dunckerstrasse was, it turns out, rented by the Stasi.  At the end of my square - Helmholzplatz - there was an apartment which purported to be for students but which was actually the place where one Major Grabner and his colleague, Wolf, met informers.  At the other end of the square, there is now a bright blue door between a second-hand clothes shop and a chi-chi restaurant.  This used to be the door through which informers would go.  Everybody knew what was going on. After all, Chancellor Kohl used to go off to telephone boxes to make sensitive calls when he was the leader of West Germany - he assumed the official phones he used might be tapped by the East German authorities.    So when Angela Merkel says now that friends do not spy on friends, she means what she says. She knows about it.      But perhaps Chancellor Merkel has just been too trusting despite growing up in a police state.  I've noticed how she seems to have far less security in general than do other world leaders.  I once went to a meeting she was addressing, a big meeting with demonstrators.  One man was striding up and down along the entrance hall, waiting for her.  He had a long stick with a banner on the end of it.    I can remember thinking as she was about to arrive that he was not going to be allowed to remain there, right on her route as she walked by.  And sure enough, the police went up to him.  There was a long discussion.  But instead of him being carted off, as would have happened in the United States or, I think, Britain, he was told that the big stick was a problem. He was welcome to stay and wave the banner in her face, but not with the stick.I found that refreshing.  And also the way she keeps texting.  What did the Americans learn?  Only they know.  It would be nice to think that it was nothing more useful than:  ""I'll be back from Brussels later, dear. Why don't you get a couple of schnitzel from the corner shop?"""
15579	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23875121	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"US President Barack Obama has said he has not yet decided on a plan for retaliatory action against Syria.But he said he had concluded Syrian government forces were behind a recent chemical weapons attack near Damascus.Speaking on US television, Mr Obama said the use of chemical weapons affected US national interests and that sending a ""shot across the bows"" could have a positive impact on Syria's war. His comments follow a day of behind-the-scenes wrangling at the UN.The UK had been pushing for permanent members of the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution which would have authorised measures to protect civilians in Syria.But Syrian ally Russia refused to agree to the resolution and the meeting produced no end to the diplomatic stalemate which has long characterised the UN position on Syria.The US State Department criticised ""Russian intransigence"" and said it could not allow diplomatic paralysis to serve as a shield for the Syrian leadership.Russia is sending an anti-submarine ship and a missile cruiser to the eastern Mediterranean.The ships are being sent to strengthen the navy's presence in the area because of the ""well-known situation"" there, the Russian news agency Interfax has said.But another news agency, RIA Novosti, quotes a senior naval command spokesman as saying that this is just a planned rotation, unconnected with Syria. Critics have questioned what purpose a limited strike on Syria could serve, but Mr Obama told the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) it would send the government of Bashar al-Assad ""a pretty strong signal that it better not [use chemical weapons] again"".The US has yet to produce the intelligence it says shows Mr Assad's government is guilty of using chemical weapons, and UN weapons inspectors are still investigating inside Syria. The team has just begun a third day of on-site investigations, and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has appealed for it to be ""given time to do its job"". He said the inspectors would finish their investigations and be out of the area by Saturday morning.Syria denies using chemical weapons and blames opposition fighters for the attack near Damascus on 21 August, which reportedly killed hundreds of people. It accused the West of ""inventing"" excuses to launch a strike.In a sign of growing fears about an impending attack among Syrians, the Associated Press quoted Lebanese officials as saying at least 6,000 Syrians crossed into Lebanon in a 24-hour period through the main Masnaa crossing - compared to a normal daily tally of between 500 and 1,000 refugees.""Isn't it enough, all the violence and fighting that we already have in the country, now America wants to bomb us, too?"" one 45-year-old woman, entering Lebanon with her five children, told AP. In Damascus senior military commanders are reportedly staying away from buildings thought likely to be targeted. You ""could hear a pin drop"" at one of them, a local resident said. President Obama told PBS that the US had ""not yet made a decision, but the international norm against the use of chemical weapons needs to be kept in place, and hardly anyone disputes that chemical weapons were used in a large scale in Syria against civilian populations"".""We've looked at all the evidence, and we don't believe the opposition possessed chemical weapons of that sort,"" he said. He added he had concluded that the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attack.""There need to be international consequences, so we are consulting with our allies,"" he said.There was ""a prospect that chemical weapons could be directed at us - and we want to make sure that doesn't happen"".The BBC's David Willis in Washington says Mr Obama looked cautious and spoke in a measured way, and he was clearly concerned about getting Congress on board as well as the American public. Opinion polls until now have shown very little interest among the US public in getting involved in the Syrian conflict.In an open letter to the president, US House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner demanded he explain ""the intended effect of military strikes"", and how he would prevent the intervention escalating, if he wanted to win public and congressional backing for action.More than 110 members of Congress have signed a letter formally requesting that Mr Obama seek congressional approval for any action in Syria.US officials are expected to give senior members of Congress a classified briefing on the evidence that the Syrian government carried out the alleged chemical attack on Thursday. The US has said it will not take action alone - but one of its primary allies, the UK, has agreed to wait until UN inspectors report back before taking a parliamentary vote on potential action.Russia rejected a UK push to try to agree a resolution on Syria among permanent UN Security Council members on Wednesday, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying the UN could not consider any draft resolution or proposed action in Syria before the UN weapons inspectors reported back.  The use of force without a sanction of the UN Security Council would be a ""crude violation"" of international law and ""lead to the long-term destabilisation of the situation in the country and the region"", Mr Lavrov has said.The UK, US and France are continuing their discussions following the meeting of the five permanent members.The UK will want to be seen to be exhausting every diplomatic avenue, says the BBC's Nick Bryant at the UN headquarters in New York. For the UK, there needs to be a UN ""moment"" - despite the fact that UN action will likely again be blocked by Russia or China.But even without UN backing the US and its allies have been clear that they see the military option still open to them, our correspondent says.""This is the first use of chemical warfare in the 21st Century,"" said UK Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""It has to be unacceptable... or we will confront even bigger war crimes in the future.""More than 100,000 people are estimated to have died since the conflict erupted in Syria in March 2011, and the conflict has produced at least 1.7 million refugees.Four US destroyers - USS Gravely, USS Ramage, USS Barry and USS Mahan - are in the eastern Mediterranean, equipped with cruise missilesCruise missiles could also be launched from submarines, including a British Trafalgar class boat.

The Labour government ran into trouble over lone parents' and disabled people's benefits. I remember talking to an employment secretary in the Blair government while the debate was raging over their ""Welfare to Work"" programme.""It's just so complicated,"" he told me, ""fraught with unintended consequences. It's like one of those jigsaw puzzles where whenever you put one piece in place, another one pops out.""But there is general agreement that the evolution of our system of benefits, allowances and tax credits under governments of one shade and then another has become increasingly piecemeal and haphazard, resulting in the chaotic tangle we have today.That is why ministers want to simplify and rationalise it. Their 'Big Idea' is the Universal Credit into which a range of benefits are being subsumed. Housing benefit, for example, will become just one of its major elements.It is part of the Government's radical reorganisation which is about to come into effect.And of course, it's not just about streamlining. Inevitably, in these straitened times, it is also about cutting costs. ""And so it should be"", according to most people surveyed in recent opinion polls. Ministers tell us the cost to the public purse of housing benefit alone has doubled over the past decade. Benefits and tax credits account for by far the biggest single chunk of all the UK's public spending - £230bn out of £709bn.The government assures us that making savings is only part of the story.It also wants to target help where it can do most good. So alongside the introduction of a benefits cap, the disability living allowance morphs into the personal independence payment which will continue to rise year-on-year for the remainder of this parliament. Some existing 'in work' benefits are also due to be up-rated.This is the vision the coalition hopes we will buy into. But the controversy raging around it continues to develop. Over the past few days we have heard warnings of grave hardship and deprivation from organisations as diverse as the Child Poverty Action Group, the National Housing Federation and the Citizens Advice Bureau. Church leaders have also made their feelings known. But it is from pressure groups and campaigning organisations that the most outspoken opposition is coming.Labour leaders clearly sense they have to tread carefully. Partly because of the party's own record while in office, partly because they do not want to find themselves on the wrong side of public opinion, and not least because it is becoming increasingly clear that whoever forms a government after the next election will have to continue implementing the general austerity drive for years to come.Though some in Labour's ranks are agitating for a more aggressive approach, the prevailing line of attack against the government appears to be less about welfare reform in principle and more about whether or not the measures are being implemented intelligently, fairly or competently.Take for example the debate surrounding what Labour call the 'bedroom tax' which they say penalises some of the most vulnerable claimants. Labour's view is that it is a policy which is simply ill thought out. For the record, ministers counter that it is a benefit not a tax. They would rather we call it a 'spare room allowance' and point to the widespread issue of under-occupation while so many people have no bedroom of their own.When the Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill intervened in the debate this week, it was significant he again berated the government over how it was implementing the changes, not over whether they were right or wrong.""Under this government,"" he said, ""the Department for Work and Pensions hasn't got the first idea what it is doing. Ministers simply do not know what impact their housing benefit changes will have.""Shropshire is one of the areas chosen by the government to pilot some of the most radical features of the new system. In this case, the council tested the system through which housing benefits will be paid directly to many of the claimants, except for the most vulnerable including the elderly or those with disabilities.The council told the BBC's Sunday Politics Midlands programme recently that the project had been extraordinarily hard work. Social landlords in the area were worried that paying benefits direct to claimants rather than to their landlords could put their income streams at risk which in turn could undermine their efforts to invest in new affordable housing.Ministers, for their part, argue that direct payments encourage claimants to develop a responsible approach to the management of money and so equip them better for the world of work.We are about to discover who is right and who benefits. At a time when money is so tight for government, claimants and taxpayers alike, the stakes could not be much higher."

Total turnout in the election was higher than expected at nearly 40%.The Seanad has existed for more than 90 years.The current Irish government had argued it cost too much to run and that its abolition could have saved Irish taxpayers as much as 20m euros (£16.92m) a year.Opponents wanted it retained and reformed, saying it played an essential role in holding governments to account.More than three million people were eligible to vote on whether or not to abolish the Seanad.Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny had claimed the abolition of the Seanad would create a leaner, more effective and more accountable system of government.After the result, he said:  ""Sometimes in politics you get a wallop in the electoral process. ""I accept the verdict of the people. But I also say in humility in accepting that verdict, that there is a virtue in actually being able to stand before the people and say: 'I did say four years ago I would ask you this question. We've honoured that commitment in full and so have you'. ""You've given your verdict and decision and I accept it fully.""Opponents, led by the largest opposition party Fianna Fáil, said the Seanad was necessary to serve as a government watchdog and to hold cabinet ministers to account.BBC Dublin correspondent Shane Harrison said the result would be a disappointment for Enda Kenny.""Abolition was very much the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny's idea and he has been criticised by Sinn Féin - his temporary ally during the campaign - for his failure to debate the issue with opponents on radio and television,"" he said.""Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams and his colleagues will not be happy that voters in party strongholds in Dublin, rejected their recommendation.""The vote was much better news for Fianna Fáil, the only major party to oppose abolition and suggest the Seanad should be reformed.""Independent senator Katherine Zappone said it was important that senators now held a meeting with the prime minister to come up with a way of ensuring that the upper house was reformed.Meanwhile, the referendum to establish a Court of Appeal has been passed by a majority of almost two to one.The official result shows just over 65% of voters were in favour of establishing the court.The new court is expected to be operating by this time next year"

The hard mud track is flanked by identical houses in an advanced state of disrepair. Girls queue with containers at a communal tap - there is no running water in the houses.  Many children wave or shout greetings. Some adults return my nod, others simply scowl. Mayor Erik Fulop says he and his party use the phrase ""gypsy crime"" to refer to ""types of criminality which are unfortunately especially prevalent among the Roma - extortion by loan sharks, and robberies from homes and gardens"".He has launched extortion proceedings with the tax and customs office against 17 local Roma.He has also set up a ""gendarmerie"" based on an erstwhile nationwide force of the same name - Csendorseg - disbanded in 1945. The word carries unfortunate connotations in Hungarian - in 1944, gendarmes played a central role in rounding up Jews whom the Nazis then deported to concentration camps. In Tiszavasvari, 10 gendarmes now patrol the streets, separately from the police. Five of them are paid from the council budget. They are unarmed but have the right to detain any suspected wrong-doer until the police arrive. I accompany them in their patrol car and we first investigate a burglary, close to a Roma area, where regular police caught the suspect - a young Roma man - red-handed. Next we visit the house of Margit Papp.The 76-year-old widow, who lives alone in a house with a big vegetable garden she tends herself, complains that almost every crop she plants is stolen by Roma. Once they even took the metal poles which hold up her vines. Another time they cut her phone line, before smashing the window and climbing into the house.""I was pleased when I heard that there would be gendarmes,"" she said. ""Whoever it is, they're responsible for public order.""But the government in Budapest have been stung into action by recent incidents between Jobbik-affiliated vigilantes and local Roma in two other settlements, Gyongyospata and Hajduhadhaza.Zoltan Balog, state secretary for social inclusion, told me that local government could not endorse paramilitary activity aimed at ethnic or religious groups.The government has just amended the penal code and passed a decree issuing fines for citizens' groups that try to take over the job of the police.In Tiszavasvari, Erik Fulop accuses the government of suppressing initiatives aimed at ""upholding law and order"".County police, however, challenge his portrayal of the town as a hotbed of crime, pointing out that it compares favourably with other towns in the county, where the crime rate is below the national average. A police spokesman stressed that there was no co-operation agreement with the gendarmerie. Aniko Koka, a local Roma activist, says relations between Roma and non-Roma have deteriorated since Jobbik won control of the town.""What we desperately need here now is jobs, and for the town leadership not to fan the flames of racism,"" she says.In October 2006, a Tiszavasvari teacher, Lajos Szogi, was beaten to death by Roma when he accidentally ran over a child in a nearby village. In April 2009, Roma man Jeno Koka, who worked in the pharmaceutical factory, was shot dead by anti-Roma vigilantes - possibly in retaliation. Four men accused of that, and the killing of five other Roma, are now on trial in Budapest. In a primary school on the eastern edge of town, the principal, Erika Levai Kerekesne, argues that her town does have a future, provided jobs are created. She challenges the stereotype of Roma children who play truant, insisting: ""These children want to learn."" The mayor has plans to encourage unskilled Roma to farm council-owned agricultural land, and is looking to attract foreign investment.And in the gypsy ghetto, Margo is organising the first neighbourhood litter collection, ""so people don't look down on us anymore"".

That was about the only good line in a speech by President Barack Obama that may not have won many converts. He stood behind a podium rather than sitting at the desk in the Oval Office, and made a speech that was clear but almost entirely lacking in passion and devoid of new arguments. Indeed, the first two-thirds seemed cut and pasted from earlier speeches. The trouble was that while he made the clinical case for military action against Syria, we knew there was a ""but"" coming.Had he still been calling for a vote in Congress in a few days' time and had he wanted the American people to pressure their politicians, he would have had to make a much stronger speech about the dangers of inaction.As it was, Syria's acceptance of the Russian plan to give up their chemical weapons has changed everything. He didn't express any cynicism about the idea but said it was an ""encouraging sign"". He had asked Congress to delay a vote, and said the US, Britain and France would work through the UN and talk to China and Russia. They would wait for the UN inspectors to report. The military would stand ready to respond if diplomacy failed. All this leaves more questions than answers. We don't know how long Mr Obama will give diplomacy or what its failure would look like. We don't know if the three Western nations will go ahead with a resolution backed up with force or go for something more modest. We have no idea how UN inspectors could do their job in a country ravaged by civil war.The President's speech was for a few days a hugely important date in the diary, but by the time he came to deliver it, events had rendered it almost an irrelevance.  The next key event is likely to be the meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Thursday. The speeches that follow that meeting might actually tell us something. "

Quentin Bryce, 70, made the comments during a speech in Sydney in which she outlined a future vision for Australia.""Perhaps one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation's first head of state,"" she said, reigniting the republic debate.Australians voted against becoming a republic in a 1999 referendum.The country is a parliamentary democracy that retains Britain's monarch as its head of state.In the 1999 vote, Australians opted to preserve the status quo, with Queen Elizabeth II remaining as the head of state - although the republican movement was split between those who wanted an elected president and those who preferred a parliamentary appointee.The issue has largely fallen into the political doldrums in Australia in recent years. Ms Bryce, the country's first female governor-general, was appointed in 2008 when Kevin Rudd was prime minister. Her tenure ends in March next year.Her comments, made at the end of a four-part lecture series, have reignited a debate about the nation's ties to Britain. ""We will always be friends with Britain, but now we should be equals,"" said Geoff Gallop, the head of the Australian Republican Movement. ""We need an unambiguous, independent national identity that reflects and celebrates our freedom, our unity, our values of the fair go and our place in the world."" However, David Flint of the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy described her comments as ""a pity"".""The constitutional system requires that the Crown be above politics... it goes against the position. There are a number of people who are now going to wonder about her. ""There's this sense of division that she's created... we've got commentators everywhere on these issues, couldn't she have left them alone until she was out of the office?"" Mr Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a staunch royalist who used to be the executive director of the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, said Ms Bryce was entitled to her opinion.""It's more than appropriate for the governor-general approaching the end of her term to express a personal view on a number of subjects and that's what she was doing, she was expressing a personal view and, as you would expect from Quentin Bryce, she did it with grace and style,"" he said.Ms Bryce also voiced support for same-sex marriage - a position that Mr Abbott, a devout Catholic, also opposes.

15613	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22894459	News	0	International News	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Many of the US ambassadors to swanky European capitals are campaign donors. Are politically appointed diplomats a bad idea?Last week President Barack Obama recommended 10 new individuals for ambassadorships. Two of them had raised money for his presidential campaign - Denise Bauer for Belgium and James ""Wally"" Brewster for the Dominican Republic.They are ""bag men"", people who give money to political campaigns - a group that is increasingly female, despite its name. They are like dozens of other ambassadors who are chosen by the White House for the postings - though they have no background in foreign service. Rather than serving in the diplomatic corps, political appointees have instead worked as business executives, lawyers, consultants and in other professions. As non-career diplomats, they can be appointed ""without competition"", according to the Office of Personnel Management.Giving money - and later becoming ambassador - is a long-standing tradition in the US diplomatic world. In the early 1970s, President Richard Nixon was blunt about the arrangements he had in place when talking with an aide about a diplomatic posting to Belgium.""Anybody who wants to be an ambassador must at least give $250,000,"" Nixon said. ""I'm not going to do it for political friends and all that crap.""Political appointees are not necessarily wealthy.  At times, presidents nominate individuals who have personal ties. ""There was an ambassador in the Bush administration who used to bicycle with the president,"" says Robert Rizzi, a Washington lawyer who helps clients through the official vetting process for political appointees.Once the president has selected a candidate for an ambassadorship, the individual appears before the Senate foreign relations committee for a confirmation hearing. The proportion of political appointees among ambassadors has remained the same - roughly one-third - since the 1950s. The political appointees are part of the ""spoils system"", says Susan Johnson, president of the American Foreign Service Association. ""It undermines the whole concept of meritocratic professional diplomatic service,"" she says. Many people have found fault with the system over the years.Shortly after being elected president, Obama vowed to ""reform the political appointee process"". A statement on his website reported that ""in the Obama-Biden administration, every official will have to rise to the standard of proven excellence"".Yet instead of declining under Obama, the percentage of political appointees has remained the same.Today about 29% of ambassadorships are held by political appointees, according to the American Foreign Service Association.The UK, Canada and other countries have political appointees - but not as many. Jim LeBlanc, a consultant who used to work for a Canadian ambassador, says: ""It doesn't go as deep.""Bruce Oreck is a lawyer who helped raise $575,000 (£377,000) for Obama's presidential campaign. He got a call from the White House after the election.""They said, 'Would you be willing to serve and, if so, where would you have an interest in serving?'"" Oreck recalls.Oreck, whose father is the founder of Oreck, a company that has sold millions of vacuum cleaners, is now the ambassador in Helsinki. He had never seen the city before his posting.""People who are successful are disciplined,"" Oreck says. ""You want people who've had that kind of success because they're going to be good advocates for America.""Some political appointees do well. Citigroup's Louis Susman raised money for Obama and then went to London as ambassador. Shortly before he left in April, Susman had an audience with the Queen, ""a privilege rarely afforded to departing ambassadors"", reports the Telegraph.The ambassador in Paris, Charles Rivkin, helped raise $800,000 (£524,000). ""Neither the ambassador nor the embassy in Paris have any comment on this topic,"" says embassy spokesman Mitchell Moss.The ambassador in Lisbon, Allan Katz, raised $500,000 (£328,000).Embassy spokeswoman Virginia Staab says: ""In the US Foreign Service, we aim to strike the perfect balance between career and political appointees since each can provide strengths and opportunities to further US foreign policy."" Career diplomats such as Thomas Boyatt, who served as ambassador to Colombia after working for years in the foreign service, resent the way that wealthy individuals end up in cushy posts. ""The media used to call us 'the striped-pant boys',"" says Boyatt. ""I used to say, 'The only stripes I ever had on my pants were from my own blood.' That shut them up.""Whether political appointees or career diplomats, they should accept posts that are located in the developing world - rather than accepting ambassadorships only to European or wealthy nations, says Boyatt.The Obama administration has had an unusual number of high-level disasters among its political appointees, many from postings in Western nations. Cynthia Stroum, a political appointee who served as the ambassador to Luxembourg, was ""hostile and intimidating"", according to a 2011 governmental report about that embassy. ""I'm baffled that I was forced to resign over such petty and unsubstantiated allegations,"" Stroum says.Regarding the selection of ambassadors, Stroum says: ""I have no way of knowing how they made or continue to make their choices or what criteria they use.""Not all political appointees are fundraisers. Some are public figures who are known on a national level or for their work in a local community. One appointee, Douglas Kmiec, a former Catholic University of America dean, resigned as head of the US mission in Malta in 2011. State department officials said he had been spending hours every day writing about Catholicism - and not enough hours, apparently, on his diplomatic work.Kmiec says he chose to resign ""when individuals within the department refused to follow the president's efforts to use faith-based diplomacy"".Another political appointee, Nicole Avant, the former ambassador to the Bahamas, lasted less than two years. The state department's office of inspections gave her a negative report. She says she ""had inherited a dysfunctional embassy. Under the direction of the new executive team that I appointed, the embassy began to recover.""Critics say they wish career diplomats were serving in more posts as ambassadors, since political appointees do not always fare well.""There have been some that have turned out to be real busts,"" says the American Foreign Service Association's Susan Johnson.

She told the Mail on Sunday that they were choosing to ""ignore Parliament's wishes""."

Deputy President William Ruto is due to appear at The Hague next week on charges of crimes against humanity. The ICC said the case would continue, even if Kenya pulled out.President Uhuru Kenyatta is due to appear at The Hague in November on charges similar to those faced by Mr Ruto. Both men deny the charges, which stem from violence that broke out after disputed elections in 2007. They were on opposite sides of the 2007 election but formed an alliance for elections in March this year and analysts say the ICC prosecutions bolstered their campaign as they portrayed it as foreign interference in Kenya's domestic affairs.Parliamentary Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso issued the order for the ""special sitting of the assembly"" to take place on Thursday. About 40 MPs said they would support a motion calling for Kenya to end its membership of the ICC, the local Daly Nation newspaper reports.Kenya's parliament is dominated by the Jubilee coalition, led by Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto. Some MPs hope the motion, expected to be passed, will free Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto from the ICC cases, says the BBC's Ruth Nesoba in the capital Nairobi. However, ICC spokesman Fadi El Abdallah has been quoted by local media as saying that the cases against Kenya's two top leaders and journalist Joshua arap Sang would go ahead even if Kenya withdrew from the Rome Statute that established the ICC. Mr Abdallah also said it would take at least a year before an application to withdraw from the ICC comes into effect. Any decision by Kenya to withdraw from the ICC would have immense implications, our reporter says. No other country has ended its membership  of the ICC. Both Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto have repeatedly called for the cases against them to be dropped, saying the charges are politically motivated. The ICC has refused and says it pursues justice impartially.In May, the African Union accused the ICC of ""hunting"" Africans because of their race.The ICC strongly denies this, saying it is fighting for the rights of the African victims of atrocities.  The ICC was set up in 2002 to deal with genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression.The court has been ratified by 121 countries, including 34 in Africa."

Recently relations between the two countries seem to have improved and Saturday's meeting between the two men appears to have been brief but cordial, the BBC's Karen Allen reports from Kabul.There has been a fresh impetus to revive Afghanistan's peace process before Nato troops withdraw next year.The Taliban have refused direct contact with President Karzai or with the Afghan High Peace Council, dismissing them as puppets of Washington.The High Peace Council wants to open negotiations with Taliban insurgents, who have fought US-led Nato and Afghan forces since 2001.President Karzai was also angered when the Taliban opened an office in Qatar in June, dealing another blow to reconciliation hopes.Mr Karzai visited Islamabad in August for talks with the Pakistani prime minister but Saturday's one-day visit is Mr Sharif's first to Kabul since he took office in May.The two leaders also met British Prime Minister David Cameron in London last month for the fourth of a series of trilateral meetings designed to foster regional stability.One of President Karzai's main demands has been the release of high-profile Taliban prisoners held in Pakistan in the hope that this will help jump-start direct talks with insurgents.Meanwhile, Washington and Kabul are still finalising a deal allowing US troops to remain in Afghanistan after 2014.Mr Karzai has so far refused an early signature of the pact, seeking further assurances from the US.

Around 100 Conservative backbenchers and ministerial aides are expected to back the amendment or abstain, but the party leadership is hoping to reduce this number by publishing the draft bill.Foreign Secretary William Hague told the BBC that publishing the draft bill was a ""demonstration of our commitment to a referendum"".And Downing Street said: ""The prime minister has set out a very clear route for this country to take and nothing that has happened has changed that path.""The spokesman dismissed any comparisons between Mr Cameron and former Prime Minister Sir John Major, whose government was damaged by ongoing rows about Europe during the 1990s.The draft legislation is being published by the Conservatives so that it can be brought to the Commons for debate by one of the party's backbench MPs in the form of a private member's bill, rather than one sponsored by the government.The ballot to choose who can bring forward private members' bills will be held on Thursday and, although they have little chance of becoming law, there is non-government parliamentary time available for them to be debated.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the Conservatives' strategy was aimed at persuading the public they would only get an EU referendum if they vote for them at the next election and contrast this with Labour and Liberal Democrat opposition.On Monday, Mr Cameron - who is on a trip to the US - said his approach was in the ""national interest"" and holding a referendum now would provide a ""false choice"" between the status quo and an immediate exit.Nevertheless, two senior cabinet ministers - Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Education Secretary Michael Gove - have said they would vote to quit the EU if a poll was held straight away.Conservative chairman Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that the draft bill had been in preparation for several months and the timing of its publication had nothing to do with Wednesday's vote - in which MPs were ""entitled"" to express their views. But Tory MP Philip Hollobone told the same programme that No 10 had been ""in chaos"" over the past week on the issue and it should have published the draft bill at the time of last week's Queen's Speech.And Eurosceptic Tory MP John Baron, one of the key movers behind the Queen's Speech amendment, said the PM should have the ""courage"" to support it and ""force Labour and the Liberals to decide"" their position on the EU.More pro-European Conservatives have said there must be an orderly process leading up to any vote over the UK's future in the EU. Former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke urged his colleagues to ""move on"" from the current wrangling and warned that leaving the EU would be ""catastrophic"" for the UK's economic prospects and global standing. Labour says committing to hold a referendum in four years' time is not the ""right choice"" for the country and internal Tory ""machinations"" are causing uncertainty at a time when securing economic recovery should be the government's priority.""Our agenda is reform and change within Europe, not exit from the European Union,"" said shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander.The Lib Dems said the government had already legislated to seek public approval before any further powers were handed to Brussels, and accused their coalition partners of ""navel-gazing"" over Europe. The UK Independence Party - which campaigns for a UK exit - has raised the possibility of Conservative and Labour candidates who favour withdrawal standing under a joint banner with UKIP at the next election. Leader Nigel Farage described the proposed draft bill as ""nothing more than gesture politics""."

Edgardo Parra,  a member of the governing socialist party, his son and two other people are accused of extortion and money laundering.President Nicolas Maduro has been stepping up his campaign against corruption. Congress is expected this week to grant Mr Maduro special powers to accelerate his anti-corruption drive.But the opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, has dismissed as ""political pantomime"".Mr Parra was arrested on Saturday and is expected to appear before a court on Monday.Investigators apprehended vehicles, money in cash and documents, local media reported.""We have enough details to believe that a number of acts of corruption have been committed by the mayor, his son and two other people who find themselves arrested,"" the Minister of Internal Affairs, Justice and Peace, Miguel Rodriguez Torres, told reporters.The authorities accuse Mr Parra and his group of running a ""sort of parallel office"", which used a number of cooperatives and companies to deviate and launder official funds.The investigations were run by Venezuela's intelligence agency, Sebin.""We will not protect anyone who commits a crime involving public funds, which are sacred because they are the people's money. There are no untouchables here,"" Francisco Ameliach, the governor of Carabobo state and another member of the ruling party, told state media.Meanwhile, Venezuela's Congress is expected later this week to grant President Maduro the powers to govern by decree for a year.The successor of former President Hugo Chavez has been seeking the change saying it is needed for him to stamp out corruption in the country, as well as what he called economic sabotage.But the opposition says only low-level officials have been arrested and fears the new powers will be used against them.""How dare you tell us you'll fight corruption, when the people guilty of stealing public funds are exactly the same ones you chose to govern with you?"" Mr Capriles wrote. Venezuela recorded the highest inflation in Latin America and is experiencing slow economic growth and basic products shortages, despite boasting the world's largest oil reserves.A power cut last month left more than two-thirds of the country without electricity.Finance Minister Nelson Merentes has conceded that while the social-oriented policies of Mr Chavez may have improved the living standards of many Venezuelans, they did not solve the ""structural problems"" of the economy.Hugo Chavez died of cancer in March after 14 years in power.His vice-president and handpicked successor, Mr Maduro, has pledged to continue his policies but does not command the same support enjoyed by Mr Chavez."

The ICC accuses him of using child soldiers and the UN says he controls several mines in the east of the country.The group briefly seized control of the city of Goma last November after carving out an area for themselves in North Kivu province.DR Congo's government and rebels have been holding talks in Uganda aimed at reaching an agreement on a range of issues. In January, the rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire.An earlier attempt to reach a deal collapsed in December after the group accused President Joseph Kabila of failing to honour a deal to integrate rebels into the army.The region's mineral riches have been plundered by numerous groups and countries over the past 15 years and little has been spent on DR Congo's infrastructure.

This is despite the fact that it is the ""most important document"" for Wednesday's election, he added. The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said it plans to take court action to obtain the voters' roll. The poll ends the coalition between the MDC and the president's Zanu-PF party.President Robert Mugabe, the Zanu-PF candidate, is seeking to extend his 33-year rule and will face Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai of the MDC at the ballot box.The two long-time rivals have been sharing power since 2009, under a deal brokered by the regional bloc the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), to end conflict that marred elections held the previous year.Mr Membe, Sadc's chief observer and Tanzania's foreign minister, said the voters roll was not a ""top secret"" document and its release was overdue.""It has to be made available for the people to see; for the people to verify their names; for the people to know where they're going to vote,"" he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. MDC Secretary-General and Finance Minister Tendai Biti said the party would take legal action against the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) to get a copy of the roll.""With virtually a day to go to the election, no political party in Zimbabwe other than Zanu-PF perhaps has got a copy of the final voters roll,"" he said, AFP news agency reports. ""Our lawyers are in the process of filing a court application to actually obtain a copy of that voters roll,"" he added. In June, a non-governmental organisation, Research and Advocacy Unit, alleged that the roll included around one million dead  voters or people who have moved abroad, as well as over 100,000 people aged over 100 years old.The MDC alleges that these ""ghost voters"" are intended to boost Mr Mugabe's vote and it wants them to be removed from the voters roll.

It is also a huge test for some of the most important elements of President Barack Obama's foreign policy - the Obama doctrine, if you like. At the heart of that doctrine is Obama's determination to act through alliances of the unwilling, or at least extremely reluctant. He wants to turn rivals and even enemies into partners of a sort, when it comes to policing the world.  No country is more important in this regard than China. He wants to ""pivot to Asia"" - believing America has focused too much on the Middle East at the expense of the region that will be a growing source of an American prosperity in the future. At least that's the given reason. I suspect he also is well aware it will be the crucible of the most important ideological and political battles of the future, between dictatorship and democracy, open markets and closed systems. No country is more important in this regard than China. And of course no country has more influence with North Korea than China. Kerry's visit to Beijing has produced some measure of agreement with the secretary of state claiming that China is ""very serious"" about the denuclearisation on the peninsula. China has good reason to warn North Korea, as its Foreign Minister Wang Yi did last week that ""the situation's development on the peninsula will not necessarily go according to the ideas and expectations of the DPRK [North Korea"".It is often said that China is North Korea's only ally. It is more remarkable that North Korea is just about China's only ally, at least in the immediate region. That doesn't say much about the soft power of this growing superpower. Obama's pivot is sometimes seen by China as America not only turning to face the region, but adopting a more aggressive posture as it does so. It fears being encircled and contained by the US, in alliance with countries hostile to its interests.  Before this latest North Korean escalation America beefed up its deployment of marines in Australia and conducted more exercises with the Philippines. The North Korean crisis not only justifies America moving more hardware into the region, it also pushes fearful allies to welcome America's strong embrace. It has prompted China's old enemy, Japan, to move its missiles around and has given Japan's new prime minister the excuse he was looking for to challenge constitutional constraints of the growth of military power. A long-term resolution to North Korea's nuclear ambitions would strip much of the rationale from the military part of Obama's pivot. That would be a gift for China, as would the moral kudos that would flow from defusing regional tension. This moment is a critical test for the world's most important big power relationship, one which may have repercussions for years to come. "

But the National Audit Office is concerned that the DCLG - which is responsible for controlling spending by local councils - has not been keeping a proper eye on its own books.The department went over its cash spending limits towards the end of the financial year and took out an unauthorised bank overdraft, the National Audit Office has revealed.Despite this, Downing Street said Prime Minister David Cameron still shared Mr Osborne's favourable opinion of Mr Pickles.""I think the prime minister agrees with the chancellor's assessment,"" a No 10 spokesman said.The department said its accounts showed that it stayed ""well within"" the Treasury's overall spending limits.""The department has taken immediate action to address the issues raised,"" a spokesman said.""Internal audit reports were commissioned and the findings are now being implemented before the next supplementary estimate. This will avoid any recurrence.""But Margaret Hodge said the £217m overdraft was ""a shocking example of incompetence - no-one was keeping an eye on the cash position"". She said she was ""staggered that the department has been so blase with its resources and so poor at staying within some of its budgets. ""If local authorities, for whom the department is responsible, acted in this way, the department would be down on them like a ton of bricks.""The department also went over its capital limit for local government spending. Two quangos - the Valuation Tribunal Service, which handles ratepayer appeals against council tax in England, and the local government ombudsman in England - spent a total of £1.2m, against a limit of £80,000.A DCLG spokesman said: ""The annual report and accounts for 2012-13 show the department has an excellent record for saving money and has stayed well within the Treasury's overall spending limits.

It will be incapable of producing anything like the reach the minister seems to think it will have.""He called for a more ""rational"" approach to defence spending and urged Prime Minister David Cameron to sack Mr Hammond and ""get somebody who knows what they are doing to look after the forces"".Both men said they hoped to remain Conservative Party members and Col Brazier said thousands of the party's rank-and-file would support what they are doing.""There are thousands of Conservatives who agree with exactly what we are doing and I'm sorry if Mr Hammond finds that embarrassing,"" he said.""It's not half as embarrassing as it is for me looking in the faces of some of our young soldiers who have come back from Afghanistan to be told that they are redundant or they are going to be posted to regiments they've never heard of to support them.""Murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby belonged to the same battalion and Col Brazier said it was ""incredibly insensitive"" of the government to disband it. Speaking after the incident, Mr Hammond said the Army had decided which regiments would be affected by the cuts.""If they'd stayed in the hall a bit longer they would have heard the case that I was building in my speech for why we have to invest in the new capabilities we need to defend Britain,"" he told Sky News.""While we all cherish our military traditions - and we have great regiments with proud histories - we have to reduce the size of our conventional armed forces.""The Army has made the decision about how it needs to restructure to be able to defend Britain in the future with a smaller army than we've had in the past.""These two RRF guys - the campaign's been long running - they know very well the point that we are making.""An Army spokeswoman said: ""We have been clear that the regular Army is becoming smaller and over a year ago we also announced changes to its structure so it is more reflective of the complex global situation.""These changes were led by the Army, who took account of a number of criteria to determine which infantry battalions would be withdrawn, to ensure the Army is more adaptable to future challenges.""To suggest decisions were taken on recruitment performance alone is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Army's process."""

Sales to Sri Lanka raise ""very serious questions"", the report adds.The committees consist of four select committees meeting and working together: business, defence, foreign affairs, and international development.The chairman, Conservative MP Sir John Stanley, said he was astonished at the scale and value of the licences. There were, for example, more than 60 licences for Iran, including components for military electronics and what is described as ""equipment employing cryptography"".This appears to be a catch-all term which encompasses a variety of equipment, much of it in the telecommunications sector.Similar equipment figured prominently in China's £1.4bn worth of licences, which also included some small arms ammunition, even though there is a European Union arms embargo on Beijing.Sir John told the BBC that in his view the EU embargo ""was not drafted as widely as many people would wish"".Arms licences to Sri Lanka included pistols, small arms ammunition and approval for the sale of 600 assault rifles, which he said ""raised very serious questions"".The report urges the UK government to look again at all the 134 existing UK export licences to Egypt to ensure that they do not breach the current policy, which is not to issue licences where it feels ""there is a clear risk that the proposed export might provoke or prolong regional or internal conflicts, or which might be used to facilitate internal repression"".The committees also want more detail on a sales licence granted to Israel earlier this year for the purchase of £7.7bn worth of what is described as ""equipment employing cryptography and software for equipment employing cryptography"".This one licence granted in February 2013 accounted for well over 50% of the value of all existing licences to the countries in question.The committees also comment on military sales to Argentina.The UK has adopted a restrictive policy for such sales and the committees note that: ""It is reprehensible that the UK government is unwilling to lobby other (friendly) governments to make the same changes in (their) arms export policies towards Argentina.""The committees have asked the government to report back and give assurances that arms export licences to all the countries mentioned are in tune with policy.The report concludes: ""Whilst the promotion of arms exports and the upholding of human rights are both legitimate government policies, the government would do well to acknowledge that there is an inherent conflict between strongly promoting arms exports to authoritarian regimes whilst strongly criticising their lack of human rights at the same time,  rather than claiming, as the government continues to do, that these two policies 'are mutually reinforcing'.""""Cryptography"" is a term that appears frequently in the arms licensing data.It appears to refer to technology which can be applied to a variety of tasks, encapsulating the ""dual-use"" problem - technology which can be used for peaceful purposes but which equally could have a security or military role.A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokeswoman said cryptography was ""a means of ensuring information security, ie preventing unauthorised access to data"". There was, she explained, ""a huge range of commercial applications that use cryptography, from public mobile telephony, online shopping and banking, through to providing secure networks for businesses and governments. Commercial applications account for the vast majority of licences under the cryptography category.""These commercial applications, she stressed did ""not raise any concerns with respect to internal repression or conflict""."

Days earlier, Mr Duffy accused Mr Harper's office of wielding ""bribery, threats and extortion"" in an effort to cover up a growing expenses row.Mr Duffy said Mr Harper's office sought to force him to repay taxpayer-reimbursed expenses that Mr Duffy believed were properly claimed.Ms LeBreton challenged the allegation: ""The story that Senator Duffy spun in this place is not based in facts and it certainly leaves open to question what he was talking about and what he was thinking.""She said Mr Duffy spoke a ""blatant falsehood"" in order to avoid being expelled from the Senate over the expenses matter.On Wednesday, Mr Harper denied involvement in the affair, telling the House of Commons he had been unaware of Mr Duffy's activities.Canadian senators are appointed by the governor general of Canada - the Queen's representative - on the advice of the prime minister. They typically join either the government caucus or the opposition caucus, or sit as independents.Mr Duffy has been accused of seeking reimbursement for living expenses associated with a home in Ottawa, thought that, rather than a cottage in his home province of Prince Edward Island, was his primary residence.He has argued the expense claims were within government guidelines for the reimbursement of senators who live outside Ottawa but must maintain a second home there.Mr Duffy has said Mr Harper ordered him to repay the government after months of negative publicity. But he declined, arguing that to pay back money to which he was entitled would damage his reputation.He then accused Mr Harper's office of ""bribery, threats and extortion"", and said Mr Harper threatened to force him from his Senate seat in order to cover up the row.Mr Duffy's lawyer says the prime minister's office sought a way to repay the 90,000 Canadian dollars ($86,336; £53,292) it said Mr Duffy owed the taxpayers in order to put an end to the potentially damaging row.  Mr Duffy reportedly agreed in order to avoid an audit.Mr Harper's chief of staff Nigel Wright said in May that he provided the money to Mr Duffy, prompting an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.Mr Wright later resigned his post.""Any assertion that I was in any way consulted or had any knowledge of Mr Wright's payment to Mr Duffy is categorically false,"" Mr Harper later told the media. ""Had I known about it, I would not have permitted it.""Mr Duffy, Ms Wallin and Mr Brazeau have left the Conservative Senate caucus after audits uncovered what officials labelled ""troubling"" expenses claims.The government leader in the Senate Claude Carignan later recommended that the three be suspended, saying the move was needed ""to protect the dignity and reputation of the Senate"".On Friday, senate Conservatives gave notice of their intent to bring the matter to a vote by as early as mid-next week, according to media reports.Conservative Senator Donald Plett defended his three colleagues, arguing the suspension would set a precedent enabling the Senate to punish merely unpopular members.Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, has sought to pin the row on Mr Harper.""A leader takes responsibility when things go wrong and this prime minister has consistently avoided taking any responsibility for this sordid mess,"" Mr Trudeau said.But the Liberal Party has also been touched by the expenses row.Ex-Liberal Senator Mac Harb left the chamber in August, dropping a dispute of an order that he repay 231,000 Canadian dollars ($220,000; £141,000) in expense reimbursements deemed improper."

Deputy President William Ruto is due to appear at The Hague next week on charges of crimes against humanity. The ICC said the case would continue, even if Kenya pulled out.President Uhuru Kenyatta is due to appear at The Hague in November on charges similar to those faced by Mr Ruto. Both men deny the charges, which stem from violence that broke out after disputed elections in 2007. They were on opposite sides of the 2007 election but formed an alliance for elections in March this year and analysts say the ICC prosecutions bolstered their campaign as they portrayed it as foreign interference in Kenya's domestic affairs.Parliamentary Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso issued the order for the ""special sitting of the assembly"" to take place on Thursday. About 40 MPs said they would support a motion calling for Kenya to end its membership of the ICC, the local Daly Nation newspaper reports.Kenya's parliament is dominated by the Jubilee coalition, led by Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto. Some MPs hope the motion, expected to be passed, will free Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto from the ICC cases, says the BBC's Ruth Nesoba in the capital Nairobi. However, ICC spokesman Fadi El Abdallah has been quoted by local media as saying that the cases against Kenya's two top leaders and journalist Joshua arap Sang would go ahead even if Kenya withdrew from the Rome Statute that established the ICC. Mr Abdallah also said it would take at least a year before an application to withdraw from the ICC comes into effect. Any decision by Kenya to withdraw from the ICC would have immense implications, our reporter says. No other country has ended its membership  of the ICC. Both Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto have repeatedly called for the cases against them to be dropped, saying the charges are politically motivated. The ICC has refused and says it pursues justice impartially.In May, the African Union accused the ICC of ""hunting"" Africans because of their race.The ICC strongly denies this, saying it is fighting for the rights of the African victims of atrocities.  The ICC was set up in 2002 to deal with genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression.The court has been ratified by 121 countries, including 34 in Africa."

But by the end of Wednesday, and a personal intervention by US Secretary of State John Kerry, the Taliban flag and their sign reading ""The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"" were removed from their new office in the Gulf state of Qatar.After hours of mounting tension, Afghan President Hamid Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi told me the president now ""wanted to get the wheels moving again.""But as much as symbols matter, the substance of any future talks matters far more. Off the record conversations with a number of people involved in the sensitive dialogue that led to this milestone underline continuing uncertainty over what the Taliban leadership is hoping to achieve. ""It's still not clear whether they are interested in sharing power, or just taking power again,"" reflected one source who has been engaged in this process for many years.Another spoke with more cautious optimism about ""frank and productive talks,"" and ""changes in rhetoric"" that suggested new thinking among the Taliban, who enforced a strict and harsh interpretation of Islam during their rule in the 1990s.The row over symbols served to highlight how a movement that once banned television understood the importance of projecting a certain message. For example, the words on the sign, ""The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,"" were those they used to describe their regime that was eventually toppled in 2001. For President Karzai, long suspicious that the Taliban office would be used as base for a ""government in waiting"" to raise its profile and its fund raising, it only confirmed his worst fears about the Taliban, and his ally, the United States.On Wednesday, he suddenly suspended bilateral security talks with the US, and called off a planned trip to Qatar by his negotiating body, the High Peace Council.""President Obama had given us written assurances this would not happen,"" explained Aimal Faizi. He also pointed out that there had been more than a month of intense discussions, in person and over the telephone, between senior Afghan and American officials to ensure misunderstandings did not arise this time.Not long before the announcement, President Obama himself called the Afghan leader to ensure he was fully informed of the expected breakthrough.On more than one occasion in the past, President Karzai has scuppered imminent deals, accusing the US and other countries of trying to undermine his authority and his country's sovereignty. Some Western officials, with barely concealed frustration, often dismiss what they see as a prickly paranoia. But in this latest upset, the president's anger seemed justified. In recent months, the Afghan leader has also been invited to Doha, as well as the Norwegian capital Oslo, to discuss ongoing negotiations. The ribbon cutting ceremony at the office on Tuesday came after months of renewed effort involving key roles for Norwegian and British envoys, as well as Qatari officials and Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) agency. German diplomats played a vital a role at earlier stages of the protracted process. One source said the ISI, which is known to exercise influence over many Taliban commanders, ""did what it had to do"" to get the talks moving again in Doha.After months of silence that followed the Taliban suspension of negotiations with the US in March 2012, a new push was made at the end of last year to revive an initiative that has been in the making since 2011.Western diplomats also pressured Qatar to make more of an effort to encourage those Taliban who settled in Doha some time ago - at Qatari expense - to return to negotiations about an office. Diplomats also wielded the UN sanctions list to highlight how some of the Taliban travelling freely were actually still on a black list.But the US also held out sweeteners too. After insisting since the start on what one American diplomat conceded was an ""unrealistic demand"" for an explicit statement from the Taliban, Washington dropped its pre-conditions which required a written commitment to renounce terrorism and links to Al Qaeda, accept the Afghan constitution, and agree to talk to the Afghan government. Instead, the Taliban spoke of not allowing their soil to be used to threaten other countries, and expressed a commitment to try to find a ""peaceful solution to the occupation.""One source engaged in talks said the demand for direct talks with the Afghan government ""has been a sticking point all the way through.""  He said: ""We think they will agree on this but it is difficult for them to spell it out.""Another problem for the negotiators has been to establish whether their main interlocutor, Tayeb Agha, still had the authority conferred on him by the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Reports last year spoke of power struggles within the Taliban's political office, and Tayeb Agha was reported to have been sidelined. But sources say he is playing a central role again. Recent talks, which have not included direct American participation, are also said to have involved wide ranging discussions on issues including the constitution, human rights, the role of women. ""We definitely did not agree on everything,"" said one Western official who also highlighted that there are still more hard-line elements outside this process.American officials say they expect the Taliban's first goal, when direct talks resume shortly with the US, will be to obtain the release of five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. In exchange, they are to free the only US soldier believed to be in captivity, Bowe Bergdahl. It is understood he is being held by the group known as the Haqqani network, whose representatives have also been involved in negotiations.But this issue is already stuck in the tangled web of US politics. When talks took place in 2012, headed by the then US Special Representative Marc Grossman, leading Republican senators balked at releasing the Afghans.  The Pentagon is said to be still opposed while President Obama backs a deal.Significant questions and concerns still hang over a tortuous process that will sit alongside continuing bombings and military battles on the ground.  But for the moment, there is a long awaited window to open a channel of negotiations that will, at the least, give departing US-led Nato troops some political cover as they prepare to pull out most of their troops.But that window will only remain open so long as President Karzai, and other key players, do not do everything in their power to shut the door of the office if it seems to be moving in the wrong direction."

""They go a critical step further, by imposing dangerous conditions on prostitution; they prevent people engaged in a risky - but legal - activity from taking steps to protect themselves from the risks.""Under the ruling, the Canadian parliament has 12 months to rewrite the legislation or it will be withdrawn.Anti-prostitution laws will continue to be enforced in the meantime.Canadian Justice Minister Peter MacKay said the government would reflect on ""this very complex matter"".""We are reviewing the decision and are exploring all possible options to ensure the criminal law continues to address the significant harms that flow from prostitution to communities, those engaged in prostitution and vulnerable persons,"" his statement said.A Canadian women's rights group condemned the court's decision, saying it was a ""sad day"".""We've now had confirmed that it's OK to buy and sell women and girls in this country,"" Kim Pate, executive director of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.""I think generations to come - our daughters, their granddaughters and on - will look back and say, 'What were they thinking?'"" A constitutional challenge by three women with experience in the sex trade, Terri-Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch and Valerie Scott, prompted the case.In March, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a ban on communicating for the purpose of prostitution, a decision which Ms Bedford challenged.The federal and Ontario governments appealed against two other parts of that decision: striking down the law against brothels; and limiting the ban on living off the avails of prostitution.The Canadian authorities argued that they should be entitled to legislate against prostitution as they ""see fit"".Lawyers for the Ottawa government reportedly claimed ""if the conditions imposed by the law prejudice [sex workers'] security, it is their choice to engage in the activity, not the law, that is the cause"".But the Supreme Court ruled it was not a choice for many.""Whether because of financial desperation, drug addictions, mental illness, or compulsion from pimps, they often have little choice but to sell their bodies for money,"" Justice McLachlin wrote."

The Committee says they are disappointed with this approach.The National Farmers Union says the government view is ""balanced and sensible"".Last April, the European Commission agreed to a EU wide ban for two years from December on some neonicotinoid chemicals, used on crops attractive to bees.While there has been scientific division on the impact of these pesticides on bees, the British government strongly opposed the plans.The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) criticised the government's approach in their report earlier this year.The government now says that they accept the ban but not the science behind it. ""We opposed these restrictions because our assessment was (and remains) that the evidence did not point to risks to pollinators that would justify the proposed restrictions,"" they wrote in a response that has been published by the Committee.The government stated they were not convinced by the results of laboratory studies showing harmful effects to bees from these chemicals.

The UN says it needs another $3.3bn (£2bn) to deal with the Syrian refugee crisis up to the end of this year. World Bank president Jim Yong Kim told the BBC that the refugee situation was ""disastrous"", and required ""all hands on board"".""As a medical doctor, I've seen the pictures; I've seen the medical data. It really is appalling,"" he said.Mr Obama discussed the deepening crisis in Syria with other G20 delegates at a lengthy working dinner on Thursday night - and it was there, correspondents say, that their differences in opinion became obvious.The BBC's Bridget Kendall, who is at the St Petersburg summit, says that on the final day of their talks these divisions are even more entrenched. The US government accuses Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces of killing 1,429 people in a poison-gas attack in the suburbs of Damascus on 21 August. But Mr Assad has blamed rebels for the attack - and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, says it still is not clear which side used the weapons.While the UK, Canada and Turkey all support Mr Obama's call for action, the only leaders at the G20 meeting to commit to force in Syria are the US and France.Correspondents in St Petersburg say opponents of US military intervention appear to far outnumber supporters within the G20.China and Russia, which have refused to agree to a Security Council resolution against Syria, insist any action without the UN would be illegal. Joint UN-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi also said no state had the the right to take action without the approval of the Security Council.Also on Friday, the US embassy in Lebanon said that it would be evacuating its non-essential staff.The move was prompted by ""threats to US mission facilities and personnel,"" a statement said. The US Consulate General in the Turkish city of Adana is also withdrawing non-essential staff. The UN is appealing for more aid for people in Syria, and also for the estimated two million Syrians who have fled their country. The UN humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, told the BBC that donor countries should ""look again"" at their contributions and be ""as generous as they can"".  UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced on Friday that the UK would give an additional £52m ($80m) in aid for Syria - much of which will go towards medical training and equipment to help civilians targeted by chemical attacks.Some analysts say Mr Cameron has been sidelined at the summit because the UK parliament has already voted against military strikes.A senior Russian aide reportedly dismissed Britain as ""just a small island: no-one pays any attention to them"" - comments later denied by Mr Putin's chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Our correspondent Bridget Kendall says the views of the G20 leaders could be the least of Mr Obama's worries, as his real difficulties might lie back in the US, where Congress is preparing to vote next week on whether to back military strikes. A poll commissioned by the BBC and ABC News suggested more than one-third of Congress members were undecided whether or not to back military action - and a majority of those who had made a decision said they would vote against the president.Syria's parliamentary speaker has written to the speaker of the House of Representatives urging members not to rush into an ""irresponsible, reckless action"".Meanwhile the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, has accused Russia of holding the Security Council hostage by blocking resolutions.Ms Power said the council was no longer a ""viable path"" for holding Syria accountable for war crimes.She told a news conference in New York: ""Even in the wake of the flagrant shattering of the international norm against chemical weapons use, Russia continues to hold the council hostage and shirk its international responsibilities.Meanwhile, on the ground in Syria, rebels have withdrawn after briefly entering an ancient Christian town north of Damascus, the main opposition alliance has said.Free Syrian Army (FSA) units captured military positions outside Maaloula after heavy clashes with government forces and militiamen on Thursday.The National Coalition said they were in the vicinity for several hours, ""but did not attack any church or convent"".Analysts say the fighting highlights the delicate position of Syria's Christian minority."

The US has said it is neither ""practical nor possible"" to delay the signing.The Bilateral Security Agreement also has to be approved by the Afghan parliament.The deal under discussion may see 15,000 foreign troops remain after 2014, although the US says it has not yet taken a decision on any presence.The soldiers who stay beyond 2014, when most foreign combat forces leave, would primarily train and mentor Afghan forces.

The past few days have seen tense diplomatic telephone exchanges between US Secretary of State John Kerry and President Karzai, our correspondent says. Washington insists the deal - which has taken months to negotiate - must be signed before the end of this year in order to secure plans for how many troops will remain in Afghanistan beyond 2014. State department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: ""We believe that signing sooner rather than later is essential to give Afghans certainty about their future before the upcoming elections, and enable the United States and other partners to plan for US presence after 2014.""It is neither practical nor possible for us to further delay because of the uncertainty it would create.""Security has been tight for the meeting after a suicide bombing last weekend near the huge tent where it is being held.The Taliban has branded the meeting a US-designed plot, and has vowed to pursue and punish its delegates as traitors if they approve the deal."

That is White House-speak for their intense lobbying of members of Congress before next week's vote. It's Labour Day but they can't stop laboring to avoid a ""no"" vote. It would be a huge and profoundly important humiliation for the president.  After meeting the president, John McCain sounded as though he was almost persuaded - he has long been for military action but thought the president didn't have a proper plan. He can now see the glimmers of one. Mr McCain set out what was at stake - a ""no"" vote would be a catastrophe and shred America's credibility in the world. Given that, I asked, him wasn't he bound to vote yes? He said that a weak response was worse than nothing at all. But it is clear he's moving towards supporting the president, and that will influence others.A phone call between some of Mr Obama's top people and more than 100 Democrats was apparently acrimonious at times with one politician saying that they had collective amnesia - they had forgotten Vietnam and Iraq. John Kerry, in reply, apparently called it America's ""Munich moment""- a reference to [UK Prime Minister Neville] Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler.This is strong stuff. But it points to the central dilemma of Obama's response. No-one seems to believe in what Obama is proposing - very limited strikes. A shot across the bows, as the president called it. As someone has pointed out, a shot across the bows only works if they believe you might sink the ship.  John McCain, and those in his camp, think you have to go much further and seriously weaken Bashar al-Assad so he has to, at the very least, be forced into considering a political solution without him. Those in the opposite camp think that is exactly what they want to avoid - stronger and longer American involvement, even if troops on the ground are ruled out. President Obama's middle way satisfies very few, and the fact of this debate, may change what is being considered."

The government has been beset by corruption scandals. Mr Bansal called for a police investigation into the bribery allegations. ""I have always observed the highest standard of probity in public life,"" he told local media. The opposition's demands for Mr Bansal to resign paralysed parliament and disrupted a budget session.

Secretary of State John Kerry said that by using chemical weapons against his own population, Bashar al-Assad had joined a list including Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein.A few weeks later, Mr Kerry was praising Damascus for co-operating with an ambitious international agreement to rid Syria of its chemical weapons, while still saying Mr Assad had to go.At the same time, reports from across the country started to focus more and more on the violence perpetrated by the Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), hardline Islamic radicals linked to al-Qaeda. As the year draws to a close, and the West's chosen allies in Syria suffer one setback after another, have policymakers started to ponder the unthinkable - that there's more to be gained from working with Mr Assad than against him?It's not a thought being openly voiced by the US State Department or the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but a week ago the highly respected former US diplomat Ryan Crocker told the New York Times that it was time ""to start talking to the Assad regime again"".""As bad as he is,"" Mr Crocker said, ""he is not as bad as the jihadis who would take over in his absence.""The former ambassador to both Iraq and Syria made it clear he was talking about a dialogue over specific issues and said it would have to be done ""very, very quietly"".But other observers go further.""Someone has got to bite the bullet and say Assad stays,"" says Prof Joshua Landis, Director of the Centre of Middle Eastern Studies at Oklahoma University whose views are frequently sought by policy makers in Washington. ""We don't have another game in town.""Prof Landis has consistently opposed arming Syria's rebels, a policy which he says ""blew up in our face."" He doesn't think tentative contacts with the Islamic Front, a recently formed coalition of Islamist groups not aligned with al-Qaeda, are likely to yield better results. Ambassador Crocker may be speaking for himself, Prof Landis says, but he knows what the state department is thinking.US lawmakers are voicing their own concerns.Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has spoken about his anxiety over an unprecedented pooling of al-Qaeda fighters in Syria.""We don't have a good operation to vet rebels on the ground,"" he told a conference at Johns Hopkins University last week. ""This is a recipe for disaster.""Against this backdrop, President Assad starts to look indispensable again. A man who can deliver up his country's chemical weapons and, perhaps, take on and defeat the hardliners of the Nusra Front and ISIS.Progress on the first objective - dealing with Syria's chemical stockpile - has been encouraging but may be stalling. It seems fairly clear that the 31 December deadline for removal of the most toxic material won't be met. The Syrian army claimed to have taken control of the last contested stretch of the key Damascus-Homs highway earlier this week, but says it needs additional heavy equipment to ensure that convoys reach the Mediterranean port of Latakia.Put simply, the success of this critical phase of the deal depends almost entirely on the Syrian government's ability to control events on the ground.In the long run, the second objective - dealing with Islamist hardliners - is likely to prove even more crucial. On the face of it, this also suggests a convergence of interest with the Assad government, which has long talked about this as the real danger. But Syria's leaders have always been disingenuous, sounding alarm bells long before al-Qaeda was a genuine threat in Syria and conspicuously failing to take on al-Nusra and ISIS when they finally appeared on the scene.Critics of the Obama administration say nothing good can come of seeking President Assad's help.""We've made Assad our partner, rather than seeing him as the problem,"" says Kurt Volker, the former US ambassador to Nato.But for all his apparent indispensability, the West is clearly unwilling to rely too heavily on a leader with so much blood on his hands. ""It's very difficult for people to go there,"" says Daniel Levy of the European Council on Foreign Relations, who believes that the limits of the West's reliance on Bashar al-Assad have already been reached. ""The US is already having an uphill struggle with the Saudis over Iran,"" he says, referring to the recent interim deal over Tehran's nuclear programme. ""It's unlikely to want to pick another fight by saying, Assad's the man.""President Assad may never be ""the man"" again, as he briefly was in the wake of the invasion of Iraq. But his recent success on the battlefield, combined with the West's urgent need to secure his chemical weapons and stem the tide of jihadism means we are going to be dealing with him, one way or another, for a while.

15781	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24296811	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"A new campaign asking for the right for women to drive in Saudi Arabia has attracted more than 11,000 signatures in support. The campaign has set 26 October as a day for Saudi women to take to the roads - in defiance of the informal ban on women behind the wheel.  In a sign of how pervasive online social networks have become in Saudi Arabia, the campaign was started on Twitter.It is the idea of the activist, Eman al-Nafjan, who set things in motion with a simple message saying that Saudi women would express their feelings about driving on 26 October.  The hope is that women will come out en masse to drive on that day, she told the BBC. Ms Nafjan says the campaign is meant to be a grassroots movement open to all Saudis - men as well as women - to show their support. Influential Saudis have given their public backing, while several videos of women driving have been posted on the campaign's website.  There is even a song linked to the campaign by the Saudi-born singer Shams, entitled It's Our Right to Drive. Photos have also been sent in showing supporters' hands with parts of the online petition written across them.  The first point in the petition reads: ""Since there is no justification for the Saudi government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so, we urge the state to provide appropriate means for women seeking the issuance of permits and licenses to apply and obtain them"".It goes on to say that  the Saudi government must provide a valid and legal justification if it continues to deny women the right to drive.  Women activists in Saudi Arabia say the issue of being allowed to drive is key to gaining other rights. There have been moves in this direction recently with women allowed onto the influential Shura council for the first time, as well as having the right to vote in the next municipal elections.But many Saudi women see this as little more than window dressing and are urging deeper freedom from traditional restrictions, such as those imposed by what they see as oppressive male guardianship. They argue that there is in any case an absurdity in the ban on driving as it means that women must rely on male drivers - thereby spending large amounts of time with a man outside their family. In other circumstances, this would be condemned as a serious transgression of the country's deeply conservative interpretation of Islam.  Those who oppose women driving do so on the grounds that it would violate that deeply traditional code.   In public, there have been signs that Saudi officials may be softening their line on women driving.  That is a change from when the first campaign was staged more than 20 years ago, leading to dozens of women who took to the wheel being arrested or losing their jobs. But Eman al-Nafjan says persistent rumours that the ban might be lifted soon are so far nothing more than that.  That has not dented the optimism of one veteran of the right to drive movement, Madeha al-Ajroush, who took part in the 1990 protest. She has already tweeted that she is ready to drive again."
15785	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19992263	other	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The east Hungarian city of Miskolc has seen a march by several thousand supporters of the far-right Jobbik party in protest against ""Gypsy crime"", and a counter-demonstration by 1,000 Roma (Gypsies) and their supporters against the party's ""Nazi ideology"".Communism was kind to Miskolc. In 1980 the city boasted 207,000 inhabitants. The Avas housing estate was built to accommodate 35,000 new workers flooding in from the countryside to work in the steel mill and a host of other factories. Capitalism has been a rougher experience. Factories collapsed like dominoes in the early 1990s. Those who could moved away. The population of the city is now 167,000. The unskilled - particularly, but not only Roma - have been the hardest hit, both in the city and the surrounding countryside.""As a child, we longed to live in Avas, but the waiting list was very long,"" remembers Mariann Demeter, a Roma woman who runs her own hairdressing and beauty parlour in Avas 3.Her father worked in the steel mill, her mother in the hospital. Avas is divided into three sections, climbing the hill of the same name. Mariann employs both Roma and non-Roma staff, and her customers are equally mixed. On the day of the march she closed for the day and joined the Roma gathering.Other Roma were more cautious. One young woman, who gave her name only as Gabriella, said she had fetched her children early from school, hurried them home and locked the doors. She lives in Avas 2, in one of the most notorious blocks. Most of the windows in the stairwells are broken. The doors of better-off families are reinforced. Some of the tenants, Roma and non-Roma, pose for a photograph together. ""We get on fine here,"" they say.Imre, who has lived in the block since it was built, says it deteriorated when a ""nest-building"" programme was launched by the previous, Socialist-run city administration. Designed to give poor families a chance to buy their first flats, it was exploited by a group of largely non-Roma lawyers and businessmen, who ran off with the subsidies on offer after installing the poorest of the poor in the flats - rural Roma who had never lived in a home with running water or indoor toilets and had no income. The ""nest-builders"", as around 300 families are now known, became the terror of the estate, ripping out metal fittings to sell as scrap, selling the baths and basins, and living sometimes 30 to a room. This offended the long-term Roma residents as much as the non-Roma ones. Several hundred people now stand accused of fraud in a long-running court battle. About 100 ""problem families"" remain, but other Roma complain they have been tarred with the same brush. ""The situation is like a road accident, in which the person who got hit is left bleeding in the road, while the police pursue the driver,"" says Mariann.What angers residents today is that Jobbik, and the media, paint the Avas housing estate as a single black hole, rather than as a self-respecting district with localised problems in dozens of flats and stairways.The streets are clean and almost beautiful in the autumn sunshine, lined with trees, their leaves turning yellow and gold. There is no litter, even around the recycling bins. The 10-storey buildings look no less dilapidated than those built in the 1970s in London, Berlin or Paris. Norbert Petrusko, a local journalist, complains that the value of his flat in Avas 3 has fallen by more than half in five years, just because of the bad reputation of the estate.  Vera, Imre's neighbour in Avas 2, has been trying to sell her flat for six years - in vain.   Peter Jakab, a Jobbik councillor and a main organiser of the far-right demonstration, is unrepentant: ""This protest is a warning signal to the government. ""We have had enough. For 22 years, Avas and Miskolc have become a symbol, a centre of squalor, of crime, of the lack of public order.""He taught history in a Roma secondary school until he was sacked for running for office in the Jobbik colours. The answer, he says, is the eviction of families who do not pay rent or public utility bills, more police, tougher prisons, and an ""end to the terror"". His party got 17% in the local elections in Miskolc - the same as their proportion in the national parliament. County police challenge Jobbik claims that crime is rising in the housing estate. Statistics released to coincide with the demonstrations show cases of assault and burglaries at their lowest level on the estate for four years, and lower than comparable-sized towns elsewhere in the country. Roma organisations say solidarity, not punishment, is the answer. ""The poorest of the poor need help not Nazi ideology,"" says Gabor Varadi, of the local Roma self-government.

The country has been the target of four rounds of UN sanctions and numerous UN Security Council resolutions calling on it to cease enrichment work amid fears it aims to develop nuclear weapons.Iran has refused to obey, saying it intends to enrich only for power station fuel or other peaceful purposes.

They spent millions restoring it before opening it to the public.They argued they could not grant an untrammelled right of way for reasons of security, insurance and maintenance. As a result of the council's decision, the couple closed the estate in 2009 although it was attracting 40,000 visitors a year. They also let 11 staff go.In a statement at the time, they said it had become impossible to operate the house as a historic house or private home. ""No property whatsoever, let alone a large tourist facility, could be operated on the basis of unregulated, uncontrolled and unfettered access,"" they said. Lissadell is one of the Republic of Ireland's most historic premises and was the childhood home of high profile rebel Countess Markiewicz. The house featured in a poem by W B Yeats, for whom it was a favourite haunt.Countess Markiewicz fought alongside the Irish insurgents during the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. She was condemned to death by the British authorities, but her sentence was later quashed and she was imprisoned instead. After refusing to take her seat as the first woman MP at Westminster, she later sat as a member of the first Dail, the Irish parliament. The case has already been the subject of a 58-day high court hearing estimated to cost 6m euros (£5m).The Supreme Court judgment will have serious implications for Sligo County Council, which had argued there was an inferred dedication of public right of way through decades of public use."

Mr Davies, who was elected to the post in 2009, had planned to stand for a second term at May's local elections.He will now continue in office as an independent until the poll.Party chairman Robin Tilbrook said he was saddened at the development but denied the party had been infiltrated.The BBC's Yorkshire political editor Len Tingle said it had been known for some time that Mr Davies - whose son is a Conservative MP - was uncomfortable with his party's current direction. Mr Davies told the BBC last year that he had not been mayor very long before he ""realised that being an English Democrat was a total irrelevance"" and the job was ""about doing what's best for everybody in the town"".Speaking on Tuesday, he said ""all seemed to be well until about 18 months ago when it became clear more members of the BNP were being hoovered up by the party leadership"" and, he claimed, one new member was still working for the BNP.""It seemed odd to say the least and, to me personally, unacceptable,"" he said. ""I realised things were heading in a direction I didn't want them to go in.""Mr Tilbrook claimed that it was not certain that the English Democrats would have selected Mr Davies to stand again as he had not followed party policy during his term of office in promoting its main aim to create an English Parliament. He strongly denied that his party had been infiltrated by far-right elements and pointed out that any new member has to sign a pledge confirming their opposition to racism. Mr Davies campaigned on behalf of the UK Independence Party in the 1990s before joining the English Democrats in 2005. The English Democrats, whose only electoral success has been in Doncaster's mayoral elections, say they will choose another candidate at a selection meeting later this month. The party secured 0.2% of the total vote in the 2010 general election. Residents of Doncaster voted to keep the mayoral post in a referendum last year, having originally approved it in another public vote in 2001. The British National Party lost all six of the seats it was defending in last year's English local elections and one of its two MEPs, Andrew Brons, has said he has been ""expelled in all but name"" from the party.

His decision to put off an attack on Syria and seek authorisation from Congress apparently stunned some of his closest advisers. Secretary of State John Kerry has defended the president's abrupt change of approach, telling NBC: ""He didn't think it was worthwhile acting and having the Syrians and a whole bunch of other folks looking at the United States arguing about whether or not it was legitimate, or should he have done it, or should he have moved faster.""But that is precisely what will happen for at least the next 10 days. There's lots of criticism already and a lot of rehashing of how he got to this position. Only on Friday, the Secretary of State went out on a limb stressing what was at stake for the world and America's reputation. It is hard to imagine that he's best pleased that Assad's punishment has been put on hold. If Congress votes ""No"", his words will come back to haunt him and Obama.That could happen: victory is by no means assured, particularly in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Perhaps the Senate isn't safe either - this will be a free vote and there'll be no formal attempt by party leaders to persuade their colleagues. After receiving a lengthy classified intelligence briefing on Capitol Hill, several senators and congressmen seemed unconvinced. The draft resolution from the White House calls for authorisation for action to ""deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade"" Syria's ability to use chemical weapons: two senators - one Republican, one Democrat - called that too open-ended.Republican Senator John McCain, who has been leading the demand for military intervention in Syria, said that there was ""no strategy, no plan"" - and both were needed before he'd back the motion.If Congress doesn't back him, it will be disastrous for the president. His decision to call for a vote will look foolish and he would be left with an appalling choice.Ignore the vote and enrage Congress and many Americans. Or don't strike and live with John Kerry's words that America will be weakened, petty dictators emboldened and history's judgement harsh on America's leaders.  So everything hangs on Obama winning the vote. But even if he does, the delay gives Assad more time to prepare for the blow.The decision has left many commentators questioning his leadership and asking how Obama managed to box himself in.But to have taken action without the UN, without the UK, without Congress and without the American people's support would have been very uncomfortable for a man who came to office vowing to end America's foreign wars."
15819	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23351997	Opinion	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"US Secretary of State John Kerry has again refrained from characterising the ousting of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi by the military as a coup. Washington's hesitation to use the term has drawn accusations from the pro-Morsi camp that the US was complicit in the coup. For the White House, it is an on-going and agonising determination that has legal and possibly even security implications. ""This is obviously an extremely complex and difficult situation,"" said Mr Kerry, speaking in Amman during a news conference with his Jordanian counterpart Nasser Judeh.""The fact is we need to take the time necessary because of the complexity of the situation to evaluate what has taken place,"" he said. Mr Kerry, and other American officials, have repeatedly said it was important to take the time to determine what exactly had happened in Egypt - even while prominent US lawmakers like Senator John McCain, analysts, and supporters of Mr Morsi, have said it is clearly a coup. Under US law, most aid must stop to ""any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup d'etat or decree"" or toppled in ""a coup d'état or decree in which the military plays a decisive role"".The US provides $1.15bn (£756m) of aid a year to Egypt, $1.13bn of it military. But the ''coup legislation"" does not set a deadline, so the administration can use delaying tactics before reaching the legal determination, while it looks into the possibility of allowing aid to continue and hopes that the situation in Egypt improves rapidly. Mr Kerry expressed concern about instability in Egypt and called for an end to political arrests but said it was too soon to judge how the situation would unfold.  In the build-up to the removal of Mr Morsi, the US was clearly uncomfortable with the prospect of a coup but failed to convince him  to compromise with the opposition or push the military to find a different way forward. But Washington had never been comfortable with Mr Morsi as a president either, so it has now come around to accepting the new phase. William Burns, deputy secretary of state, said on a visit to Cairo earlier this week: ""Despite our concerns about the developments of the past two weeks, we believe that the on-going transition is another opportunity... to create a democratic state that protects human rights and the rule of law.""We hope it will be a chance to learn some of the lessons and correct some of the mistakes of the past two years."" Although almost everyone in Washington agrees the administration of President Barack Obama should say it was a coup, opinions are divided about whether the US should suspend aid or find ways to maintain the flow. Marwan Muasher, former Jordanian foreign minister and vice-president at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace overseeing Middle East studies, said: ''The US' best strategy now is to call it a coup, to respect US law, but to get a waiver, because it's not necessarily constructive to stop aid to Egypt.""There is no waiver in the ''coup legislation'' but Congress is looking into passing a bill that would allow aid to continue even if a legal determination is reached that Mr Morsi's ousting was a coup. Similar legislation was approved for Pakistan in 2001. ""The US has been accused of interfering on this or that side, cutting off aid will further antagonise the Egyptians and will not result in any additional leverage for the US,"" said Muasher.   When Mr Morsi was in power, his opponents accused the US of being in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood, while American officials repeatedly explained they were simply trying to work with a president who had been democratically elected. Cutting off aid now would only confirm that impression in the anti-Morsi camp. A US official speaking anonymously expressed concern about a possible violent backlash in Egypt from anti-Morsi forces if the US declared his removal a coup. But Khalil el-Anani, a Durham University scholar who focuses on the Muslim Brotherhood, warned that the US' continued reluctance to describe the events as a coup would also fuel anger towards the US among supporters of the Brotherhood and the wider Middle East - the kind of anger that al-Qaeda would tap into.He urged the US to make aid conditional on progress towards democracy and respect for human rights, including an end to the rounding-up of members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Washington is also concerned that cutting military aid to Egypt could undermine the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. American military aid to Egypt started after the 1979 Camp David accords. Although nothing in the accords mandates the US to provide aid to Egypt, there is an expectation that as long as Egypt abides by the treaty, it can expect aid in return. Under the Congress Appropriations Act of 2012, US military aid to Egypt was also made conditional on progress in the transition towards a civilian government and general respect for human rights.  At the end of last year, Congress put a hold on aid to Egypt because of a clear deterioration in the political transition. In May, Mr Kerry used a waiver included in the act to lift the restrictions, citing national security interests. These included the need to support Egypt as it increased security in the Sinai or helped secure transit through the Suez canal - among other goals directly tied to US national security - according to Mr Kerry. But Tamara Wittes from the Brookings Institution said while the US is worried that cutting aid would rupture the relationship with the military, it should work on ways to hold the military accountable. She said that while the relationship with the Egyptian military was close and beneficial, it was not without tension. Along with 11 members of the Egypt Working Group which brings together analysts, former officials and human rights activists, Ms Wittes signed a statement calling to suspend aid and warning that ""cajoling on democracy while keeping aid flowing did not work when the military ruled Egypt in the 18 months after Mubarak's fall, and it did not work to move President Morsi either.""

Whether voters will go for this narrow field is another matter.The election authority has allowed eight people to stand in the ballot on 14 June. Five belong to the conservative camp, one is a centrist and the other is a reformist. The last one, an independent, is not being taken seriously. The choice of the contenders suggests that the conservatives and their right-wing supporters, particularly those in the Revolutionary Guards, are setting the election agenda and seem to have the upper hand. During the past few months, their view of political events has been the most accurate in foreseeing developments and articulating group interests accordingly. The candidates are:  Nuclear strategist Saeed Jalili - conservative Tehran mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf - conservativeFormer Majlis Speaker Gholamali Haddad Adel - conservative Advisor to the Supreme Leader Ali Akbar Velayati - conservative Former Revolutionary Guards commander Mohsen Rezaie - conservative Former nuclear negotiator Hasan Rouhani - centrist Former Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref - reformistMohammad Gharazi - independentAt this stage it is difficult to predict how people might vote or whether they sill vote at all.  In the last election in 2009 more than over 80% of Iranian voters took part. But now that senior reformist leaders are under house arrest and former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani have not been allowed to stand, some reformist supporters might decide not to vote. The conservative vote is also unpredictable because their camp is split between the supporters and opponents of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad and this could break up their votes. The role of the undecided ""floating"" voter, who is not loyal to any of the camps, is critical for all sides. The conservatives are still playing a game of camouflage by fielding five candidates. This protects their final candidate from attacks from rivals and public criticism. The two main figures in the camp are Mr Jalili and Mr Qalibaf. Mr Qalibaf represents mainstream conservative thinking, while Mr Jalili is further to the right and has worked closely with the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei . The critical factor is how the conservative leadership will swing its vote at the final stage. That decision will put their bloc vote - mobilized noticeably by the para-military and the Revolutionary Guards - behind the final chosen contender. Following the disqualification of former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the reformist and centre factions are in a weak position. Their two candidates are not their first choice. Mr Rouhani, a centrist, is a former nuclear negotiator with the aura of a cautious diplomat. Mr Aref, the reformist, worked behind the scenes when he was a vice president and is seen as a quiet operator. Neither is charismatic enough to turn the tide through sheer campaigning. Furthermore, their support organizations have been shut down, their activists harassed and the publications that back them restricted. If Mr Aref and Mr Rouhani both stand they will have to compete for the same voters and may thus cancel each other out. The conservative-controlled political establishment has played safe by eliminating candidates who could have created an unpredictable situation. If they had allowed Mr Rafsanjani to enter the race, there would have been the risk of massive mobilizations on the streets. This happened in the 2009 elections and the regime is determined not to allow a repeat. Although the police and security forces have detailed plans for dealing with possible unrest, a preventative approach was favoured. Better safe than sorry. If the disqualified candidates are not reinstated, a conservative victory seems highly likely. Both Mr Jalili and Mr Qalibaf have a good chance of becoming the next president. An editorial in a leading conservative newspaper speculated that Mr Jalili has the better chance. The future for the reformist and the centrist factions is uncertain. The establishment conservatives want to maintain them, but only as small groups on the political fringes and under firm control. But if the process of eliminating dissidents and critics becomes prevalent, the regime could seriously undermine its social base and consequently become more dependent on coercive methods to maintain order.

When it signed up to the freedom of movement rules in 1999, the country claimed the right enact a ""safeguard clause"" if the annual influx of workers from countries exceeded a certain number.

Mr Kucherena said Mr Snowden was being looked after by a legal expert from the whistleblowing organisation Wikileaks.Russia's Federal Migration Service later officially confirmed that Mr Snowden had been granted temporary asylum for one year, Interfax news agency reported.In a statement issued on the Wikileaks website, Mr Snowden said: ""Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law, but in the end the law is winning. ""I thank the Russian Federation for granting me asylum in accordance with its laws and international obligations.""President Obama and President Putin had been scheduled to meet on the sidelines of a G20 summit in early September in Saint Petersburg.However, Mr Carney said: ""We're extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and in private to have Mr Snowden expelled to the United States to face the charges against him.""We're evaluating the utility of a summit in light of this and other issues.""Earlier, US Senator Robert Menendez, chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described Thursday's development as ""a setback to US-Russia relations"".""Edward Snowden is a fugitive who belongs in a United States courtroom, not a free man deserving of asylum in Russia,"" he said.Republican Senator John McCain also issued a stinging rebuke, saying Russia's actions were ""a disgrace and a deliberate effort to embarrass the United States"". ""It is a slap in the face of all Americans. Now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with Putin's Russia.

Critics say the bill is an attempt to silence opposition voices in Argentina. Supporters say it will boost pluralism and reduce the dominance of big corporate interests.   Following the ruling, Clarin's share price fell nearly 6% and sales had to be suspended. The group is expected to have to sell a number of lucrative radio and television licenses.In a statement, the company said it was considering appealing to international courts.""The most concrete proof of the true intention of this government with this law has been the enormous official colonization of media companies since its passage.

Speaking to PBS Newshour, he said any action would be ""tailored"", ""limited"" and intended to send a signal to the Syrian government to discourage them from using chemical weapons again.But he also said he had decided against ""direct military engagement"", adding: ""I have no interest in any kind of open-ended conflict in Syria"" and spoke of ""not getting drawn into a long conflict, not a repetition of Iraq"".There is no doubt that is not just Mr Obama's view - it is a heartfelt plea by a military involved in 10 years of war. But it raises a lot of questions. What action sends a message to Bashar al-Assad, but does not loosen his grip on power? A couple of cruise missiles? Three days of air attacks? The destruction of air bases?  The most obvious response, on the chemical weapons bases themselves, has apparently been ruled out by most experts because it would simply disperse the deadly agents far and wide.It is obvious that when President George W Bush declared war on Afghanistan he didn't expect troops to still be there more than a decade later. Yet it happened. The slope to war is very slippery. Of course in one sense it is relatively easy for Mr Obama not to get dragged in. He could order one attack and refuse to do any more. But that could leave him looking weak, his action a hollow symbol. There could be retaliation. Mr Assad could be more determined than before. By declaring that he will avoid a long conflict Mr Obama could be unintentionally signalling to him that this is a one-off punishment, not a response that could escalate to match the regime's actions.One source, deeply involved, told me an important part of the discussions was exactly that: ""Something needs to be done, but what is the impact? What is a surgical strike for? If Assad does it again what do you do? What is the ultimate action? ""Big question mark.""It is indeed."

However, assisting another person to kill themselves can lead to a jail sentence of up to 14 years.Ms Fleming, a former lecturer from County Wicklow, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1986.She is cared for by her partner, Tom Curran, and has two adult children.The four-day appeal hearing was told that she is in the final stages of MS, can only move her head, cannot swallow and lives in constant pain.Her legal team argued that the ban on assisted suicide is discriminatory towards severely disabled people.Lawyers for Ms Fleming told the court that she should be given the same right to die by suicide as an able-bodied person.She took the case against the state, the Irish attorney general and the director of public prosecutions (DPP).Ms Fleming's legal team claimed the Section 2.2 of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act, which renders it an offence to aide, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another, was unconstitutional.They argued that it breached her personal autonomy rights under the Irish constitution and the European convention on human rights."

They demand land and jobs for the poor, and ultimately want to establish a ""communist society"" by overthrowing India's ""semi-colonial, semi-feudal"" form of rule.In an editorial titled Act tough on red terror, the Hindustan Times says the attack ""must be condemned in the strongest possible terms"".""Doubts about the Maoists being engaged in anything short of a civil war should now be laid to rest. This is no longer just a battle between the Maoists and the police and paramilitary forces. ""It is an all-out war against the Republic of India. By attacking the political class in this manner the Maoists have made it clear that they will give no quarter and that the war will not stop until they are decimated,"" the paper says.The Times of India says the massacre of Congress leaders and workers in Chhattisgarh is ""a tragedy wrapped in complacency"".""Saturday's strike is a grim reminder that while Maoist onslaughts in states such as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa have decidedly been blunted, Chhattisgarh continues to test the capacity of the centre and the [state's] BJP government to coordinate their counter-insurgency offensive,"" the paper says.""The relative calm in a few other states in the Red Zone appeared to have lulled the security forces into a strange complacency,"" it adds.The Indian Express describes the ambush as ""one of the most daring and vicious attacks"".""This [the attack] should dispel any romantic illusions about the Naxal cause. The fight is not for the greater welfare of the tribals on whose behalf they claim to be staging this revolutionary intervention, but for the destruction of the democratic state. The paper says the state must ""establish its presence in the dense wilds of Bastar and Dantewada, which have been virtually left to the Maoists. Writing in the Firstpost, security analyst Praveen Swami says India must make a fundamental choice: ""to decide if our democracy is worth killing for"". ""Large elements of India's elite don't have the stomach for a long and dirty war - which is what all insurgencies involve. For years, there's been a complicity with the killing - on the Left because of misplaced guilt over India's hideous failures to ensure equity for citizens; on the right, because of the misguided belief that geographical distance allows for apathy. ""It's been facilitated by the fact that police officers' lives are cheap, because the local Dalam [Maoist unit] commander can be bribed to let mines and factories run, and because Maoists aren't - yet - setting off bombs in our cities.""The Hindu, however, strikes a note of caution saying the killings should not be allowed to worsen the situation in Chhattisgarh.""Saturday's attack is likely to end up being used by sections of the political establishment to push for larger, more lethal operations by the paramilitary forces and the police... ""Violence must always be turned into an opportunity to push for peace, and never as an excuse to use the armed might of the state on hapless villagers living in fear of both the Maoists and the security personnel,"" it adds.

Mr Richardson has also held talks with North Korea over its military activities. In December 2010, he met North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator in Pyongyang, in an attempt to ease tensions between the two Koreas.But some analysts speculated that for Google's Eric Schmidt the trip could have more strategic reasons.""I think this is part of Google's broader vision to bring the Internet to the world, and North Korea is the last frontier,"" said Peter Beck, of South Korean's non-profit Asia Foundation, to Reuters. South Korea's confirmation of Mr Schmidt's trip came days after the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, delivered a new year's message on state TV, the first such broadcast for 19 years. Kim Jong-un, in power since 2011, spoke of the need to improve the economy and also to reunify the Koreas, warning that confrontation only led to war. Kim Jong-un said 2013 would be a year of creations and changes, calling for a ""radical turnabout"" that would transform the impoverished, isolated state into an ""economic giant"" and raise living standards.But while he said confrontation between the North and the South should be removed, Mr Kim stressed that military power remained a national priority.Under Mr Kim's leadership, North Korea has conducted two long-range rocket launches - actions condemned by the US and Pyongyang's neighbours as banned tests of missile technology. The launch in April failed, but December's attempt appears to have been a success, placing a satellite into orbit. The US, Japan and South Korea are seeking a response in the UN Security Council, which banned North Korea from missile tests after nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. "

Legal aid costs taxpayers about £2bn every year - half goes on criminal defence and the rest on civil cases including mental health, asylum and family law involving domestic violence, forced marriage or child abduction.Government proposals include cutting fees in complex, high cost cases by 30%, and in other crown court work by up to 18%.  Treasury Counsel said the ""entirely obvious and predictable outcomes will be lost quality and reduced supply of criminal advocates"".Meanwhile, the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, accused the government of putting ""cuts before justice"".Maura McGowan QC, chairwoman of the Bar, told BBC Radio 5 live there was clear evidence that standards were at risk.""The fees that are paid to people who do these cases have been reduced by almost as much as 40% already, before the planned reductions,"" she said.""It will drive people of quality out of the system and will mean those who depend on publicly funded representation run the risk of getting a lower standard. ""So to say that they're making these cuts because they want to protect those who most need help, cannot be right.""The Law Society, which represents some 130,000 solicitors in England and Wales, said it had some concerns about proposals for flat fees in magistrates' courts and the crown court and a single national fixed fee for police station work.Law Society President Nicholas Fluck said: ""To maintain quality, it is vital that we have the most diverse range of solicitors possible in the system within the boundaries of long-term financial viability. ""The current proposals for a single national fixed fee for police station work will have a disproportionate effect on firms in high-cost areas where the cost of doing business is greater.""It is unwise to risk tarnishing the respect in which our justice system both domestically and internationally is held by an apparent incentive to plead guilty, which could jeopardise the relationship of trust between clients and solicitors.""The MoJ said the cut in high cost cases was to ensure it would impact high earners and not junior barristers, and denied other cuts were unjust.An MoJ spokeswoman said: ""We have tried to ensure our proposals have more impact on high earners - 70% of criminal barristers contracted to Very High Cost Cases receive fee incomes of over £100,000, which is why we targeted the largest fee reductions at this type of work.""Nor do we accept our proposed rates for more routine work are unjust. The minimum a QC would be paid for such a case is £306 each day.""At around £2 billion a year we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world and even after our changes would still have one of the most generous.""We agree legal aid is a vital part of our justice system and that's why we have to find efficiencies to ensure it remains sustainable and available to those most in need of a lawyer. ""We have engaged constructively and consistently with lawyers - including revising our proposals in response to their comments - and to allege we have not is re-writing history."""

""They told me that this was Obama's car,"" he told the newspaper. ""They didn't say what had happened to it. They just said it had got stuck. Only the mechanic was there when I arrived. The driver had left in another car. The whole thing was very funny."" Mr Matmon said the limousine was being repaired at a garage in Jerusalem. Despite the apparent hitch, correspondents said the atmosphere for Mr Obama's red-carpet reception at Ben Gurion airport was friendly and relaxed.President Obama even made a light-hearted reference to Mr Netanyahu's warning of a ""red line"" with Iran's nuclear programme.As they headed to inspect a nearby anti-missile system, TV cameras picked up Mr Obama asking a military official: ""Where do you want to start?""""We are following the red line, sir,"" the officer said, referring to a red line on the tarmac.""The red line, okay,"" said Mr Obama, who smiled, gestured with his thumb toward Mr Netanyahu and said: ""He's always talking to me about red lines.""On Thursday President Obama will visit the West Bank to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas."
15891	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21883155	Opinion	1	International News	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"US President Barack Obama came with a desire to inspire. As at home, he reached over the heads of the politicians to the people. He has made a clever speech invoking passion, morality and Jewish history to argue for a new peace process.But cynics may note no-one doubts he is good with words. Good at painting a big, visionary picture. The cynics - and they abound in this region - may reflect that he is sometimes less adept at turning his moral vision into practical politics. There will also be the suspicion that Mr Obama is ticking a box.Many, including UK Foreign Minister William Hague, have warned that the door is closing for the chance of two states, Palestine and Israel, living side by side in peace.No president wants this idea - the two-state solution - to die on his watch. So a bit of energetic, over-optimistic resuscitation cannot do him any harm, even if the patient does pass away. It is perhaps wrong to be too cynical. I have no doubt Mr Obama means all this. It is more a question of whether he can achieve anything.The speech was well-crafted and audacious. It pressed lavish praise of Israel into service to argue for peace. He spoke of the meaning of the Passover to African Americans, another people once enslaved in a foreign land, yearning for freedom.He lauded Zionism, saying: ""People deserve to be free in a land of their own."" He did not yet say that this applied to the Palestinians too. First, he declared that those who rejected Israel's right to exist might as well deny the sky above them or the earth below, a phrase with something of a Psalmist ring to it. Boldest of all, he said that a Palestinian state would ""permanently secure the Zionist dream"".This may sound a bit woolly and philosophical, but it is a wrapped-up warning. If, because of the growth of settlements, more and more Palestinians abandon the two-state solution, the only place they have to go is a one-state solution.That is, by dominating a larger Israel by demographics and a civil rights movement demanding equality and democracy.That might take a long time but it could happen, and the end result would not be a Jewish state. It can seem that Mr Obama is never happier than when tracing the moral arc of the universe, but he is trying to inject a note of urgency, saying that in a region that is growing ever more unpredictable, peace becomes harder to make as time passes.Most experts on the region are pessimistic about the chance of talks starting up soon.But a senior advisor says that Mr Obama is not - his conversations here have given him ""a lot of confidence"".He is urging the parties build trust and then get down to the tough stuff pretty quickly - dealing with the fundamentals such as borders, refugees and the status of Jerusalem.The new US secretary of state, John Kerry, is key to all this. He will be back in Israel at the weekend, seeing if any of the parties will make good their public commitments.Mr Obama will soon be home and turn his attention to the domestic front. But this speech will be part of his legacy, for good or for ill. Will he be seen as a man who promised so much and delivered so little, or one who inspired people to achieve something not short of a miracle."

""A state visit is the highest mark of respect and esteem that one country can pay to another in the diplomatic parlance so the fact that the president of Ireland is paying the first state visit by an Irish president to the UK next year is extremely meaningful, it's a very significant thing to do,"" he said.""The fact that is happening only three years after Her Majesty the Queen paid her state visit to Ireland, so two state visits within a very short period of time, I think that also tells you a lot about how interested we all are in investing in this relationship and what a good state of affairs it is in at the moment.""During the Queen's visit to Ireland, she paid her respects to republican dead at Dublin's Garden of Remembrance and visited Croke Park - site of the 1920 Bloody Sunday massacre.She also made a speech on Anglo-Irish history at Dublin Castle.President Higgins' visit to the UK comes ahead of planned commemorations by the Irish government to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016.The 1916 event saw rebels take over a number of buildings in Dublin as part of an uprising against British rule. British troops put down the rebellion and many ringleaders were executed. ""The 1916 Rising is going to be a very important moment in the decade of commemorations that are taking place in the Republic,"" Mr Chilcott said.""It's a commemoration, that we hope the British governments will be able to take part in as well and that although we'll be remembering events that were tumultuous, and indeed divisive between the UK and the people of Ireland at the time, nowadays we can look at them 100 years on, a bit more dispassionately perhaps and able to give those events and those who took part in them the respect that the historical memory deserves. ""Now clearly if the relationship between Britain and Ireland is as good as it can possibly be, that will be easier to do.""The state visit next year will take it on to an even stronger level. It will add momentum to all of this and I think that will be helpful in the context of remembering the Rising.""Mr Higgins, a former Labour government minister, poet and academic, has met members of the Royal Family before.Both he and his wife met the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in June 2012 at Belfast's Lyric Theatre, and he has also met Princess Anne and the Duke of Kent.Though he has visited the UK several times since becoming president, these were not full state visits.The Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, welcomed the news.""This is a further demonstration of the warm and positive relationship that now exists between Ireland and the United Kingdom,"" he said.It is expected that the Queen will host a state banquet for the president, during which both heads of state will make speeches.Although the official programme is yet to be finalised it is expected that Mr and Mrs Higgins will stay at Windsor Castle from 8 April to 10 April.The president is expected to include official visits to the prime minister at Downing Street as well as to the leader of the Opposition.In line with other state visits it is likely the Lord Mayor of the City of London will host a banquet for the president and it is also expected that the Queen will host a state banquet.Recent state visits include the president of South Korea, Her Excellency Park Geun-hye. A state visit is the highest level of diplomatic recognition between two countries in a bilateral relationship. The key difference between an inward state visit to the UK and other routine official visits, is the direct involvement of the Queen and other members of the Royal Family, and the ceremonial elements that are always integral to these programmes."

The prime minister had pushed for military action following the suspected chemical weapons attack on 21 August. The US says it killed 1,429 people and was carried out by the Syrian government.It is a claim that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denies.President Obama had previously said that the use of chemical weapons would represent a ""red line"" that would change his thinking about intervening in a conflict in which more than 100,000 people have died.UN inspectors investigating the attacks arrived in the Netherlands on Saturday with samples from site visits, which will be tested in laboratories in Europe.President Obama said in his speech on Saturday that he had decided the US should take military action against the Syrian regime, but said he would formally ask congress to authorise military action.He said he was ""confident"" that the US government had made a case for military action without the need to wait for the United Nations inspectors to compile their report.He added he was comfortable going forward without the support of the UN Security Council ""that, so far, has been completely paralysed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable.""As a consequence, many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress, and undoubtedly they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the prime minister supported taking action.""Yet, while I believe I have the authority to carry out this action without specific congressional authorisation I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course and our actions will be even more effective.""UK Foreign Secretary William Hague tweeted that President Obama's address was a ""fine speech"".And Lord Ashdown said: ""This was a brave and principled act from a brave and principled president.""It opens up all sorts of different new possibilities, one of which is the UK Parliament certainly could reconsider its position."" Lord Ashdown had been critical of the decision to not take military action in Syria in the aftermath of the vote, saying the UK was ""hugely diminished"".Writing in the Observer on Sunday, he said the result of Thursday's vote had ""made it more difficult for Barack Obama to act"".Labour leader Ed Miliband has not commented on the president's speech, but has previously said he does not believe that the House of Commons vote means the UK cannot make a difference to ""innocent civilians"" in Syria. The White House has now sent draft legislation to Congress formally asking for approval to use military force in Syria to ""deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade"" the potential for further chemical attacks. Although the president acknowledged that US military chiefs stood ready to act, his pledge to wait for a vote effectively rules out intervention until Congress returns to session on 9 September.Russian President Vladimir Putin - an ally of Syria - has challenged the US to present its case for military intervention to the UN, and has called for further talks at the G20 summit in St Petersburg on Thursday.Russia has previously warned that ""any unilateral military action bypassing the UN Security Council"" would be a ""direct violation of international law"".The five permanent members of the UN Security Council - Russia, China, the US, UK and France - have been divided on taking action in Syria.Meanwhile, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said the Commons vote - although ""shocking"" - was ""understandable"" given that intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan had been ""far more perilous and difficult than we expected"".People fear that ""we will end up in a 'quagmire'"" in Syria, he said in the Sunday Times.But he added the conflict in Syria was ""crucial to our security"" and warned that Britain would have to take sides sooner or later.""Intervention can be uncertain, expensive and bloody. But history has taught us that inaction can merely postpone the reckoning,"" he said.More than 100,000 people are estimated to have died and at least 1.7 million refugees displaced since civil conflict erupted in Syria in March 2011.The violence began when Syrian security forces clamped down on anti-government protests.President Assad blames opposition forces for last week's attack and has said his country will defend itself against any Western ""aggression"".Forces which could be used against Syria:•Four US destroyers - USS Gravely, USS Ramage, USS Barry and USS Mahan - are in the eastern Mediterranean, equipped with cruise missiles. The missiles can also be fired from submarines, but the US Navy does not reveal their locations•Airbases at Incirlik and Izmir in Turkey, and in Jordan, could be used to carry out strikes•Two aircraft carriers - USS Nimitz and USS Harry S Truman are in the wider region•French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is currently in Toulon in the western Mediterranean•French Rafale and Mirage aircraft can also operate from Al-Dhahra airbase in the UAE"

The bill now needs to be approved by a majority of the state congresses.The reform may challenge the empire of the world's richest man, Carlos Slim, whose America Movil company controls two-thirds of the phone market.It is also likely to affect the interests of Latin America's biggest television network, Televisa, which has a 70% share of the audience.The constitutional change is expected to encourage more foreign investment, allowing non-Mexican companies to become majority shareholders for the first time.It also creates mechanisms that aim to prevent one company from becoming too dominant.These include the creation of a new powerful regulatory agency, and a specialised court system to deal with specific cases. ""We are touching on something which for a long time was thought to be untouchable - the monopolies,"" left-wing senator Alejandra Barrales told Reuters news agency.Correspondents say that so far the mighty Mexican telecom companies have eluded efforts to tighten regulations.If enacted, the new bill will also make it possible for the government to force companies to sell assets , so that they cannot control more than 50% of the market.The motion was approved by 108 votes, with three against and two abstentions.It was passed by the Lower House last Thursday with a few changes.Now the reform must to be approved by a majority of the 31 Mexican states and the Federal District (Mexico City).But before it comes into force, lawmakers say a secondary bill to implement the changes will have to be drawn up.The telecommunications reform is seen as a consequence of President Enrique Pena Nieto's Pact for Mexico, a broad alliance designed to bring about structural changes."

Some say that Russia's decision to grant temporary asylum to the fugitive US intelligence analyst Edward Snowden is the reason for the crisis in bilateral relations. Others, however, point to stalled negotiations on nuclear arms reduction and the lack of progress on other important issues for the past several years. According to one commentator, problems between Washington and Moscow have now become ''strategic and long-term'', while another writes that the US has ''struck Russia off its priority list''.  The cooling of Russian-US relations will set back the solution of important issues until a new ''window of opportunity'' opens, which will not happen for at least one or two years.In any complex and unstable system there are special phases known as ''bifurcation points''. When they pass through them, systems can no longer return to their previous state. The ''Snowden case'', or rather the decision by the Kremlin to grant the ''fugitive from the Matrix'' temporary one-year asylum, became such a ""bifurcation point"" for Russian-US relations.After President Obama publicly said that the issue of Snowden's extradition was extremely important and fundamental, it became impossible to reduce the scale of this problem between Russia and the USA. Figuratively speaking, the head of the White House has climbed up a high fence from which he can no longer jump down. This is an asymmetrical reaction on the part of Obama that casts doubt on the ''reset'' (of US-Russian relations). Apparently, hawks in the Congress have yet again put pressure on the president… So, are we in for another cooling period? The meeting of US and Russian foreign and defence ministers, that will take place at the end of this week, will show whether this is the case.The White House decision was prompted not only by ''the Snowden case'', but also by Washington's understanding that it would be impossible to reach a breakthrough on issues considered to be important by the US president - the reduction of nuclear arsenals, and missile defence. According to experts, this is not only an indication of a new cooling of relations between the two countries, but also shows that guiding lines in US foreign policy have changed. The country has in fact struck Russia off its priority list. The meeting (with Russian President Vladimir Putin) would have been meaningless anyway, as no progress has been achieved on any issue (in bilateral relations). Moreover, Obama coming to Moscow would make him appear weak in the eyes of opposition Republicans who have heavily criticised him over Snowden.Even in 2008, during the war with Georgia, there were problems in (US-Russian) relations. Now these problems have become strategic and of a long-term character. Small conflicts should not prevent political decisions from being taken and the US president understands this very well… Both sides are interested in holding a separate meeting of their presidents and the situation with Snowden is not an obstacle but yet another topic for discussion.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

15920	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25335797	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"President Jacob Zuma's booing at the Nelson Mandela memorial is a topical issue here in South Africa, with local media leading with headlines such as ""Rain boo nation"". Calling this the ""beginning of the end"" of Mr Zuma's presidency would be overstating it - but it was humiliating. Mr Zuma sat quietly with a stern look on his face as several thousands of people booed each time his face appeared on a big screen at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium during Mr Mandela's rain-drenched state send-off. The heckling crowd had to be called into order a number of times, and Mr Zuma managed to deliver his factual but unmoving speech.  The address was a disappointment for those who were hoping he would use the opportunity to speak from the heart, to tell the world about his friend and comrade.He got a few cheers in the end, which I would imagine pleased him.Still, being booed in front of world leaders including US President Barack Obama, who got the loudest applause of all the day's speakers, could not have been fun. The master of ceremonies and African National Congress deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking in Zulu, told the crowd ""not to cause an embarrassment in front of visitors"". While Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for silence, the kind where you could ""hear a pin drop"" - there was no such silence but eventually the booing stopped. Mr Zuma had the enormous task of hosting a fitting tribute to the man Mr Obama described as ""a giant of history"".This was supposed to have been his shining moment, the day he cemented his legacy as the man who buried South Africa's most loved citizen - now a missed opportunity. His role in the affair has instead been overshadowed by South Africans' views on the chilly response he received. Callers took to local radio stations and social networking sites to air their views. Some thought it was inappropriate, especially at a gathering to honour Mr Mandela. But others thought it was testimony to Mr Zuma's leadership - or lack thereof. The ANC, especially in the days of Mr Mandela, was renowned for being disciplined.  When party members did not agree or even like each other, they were always expected to respect the position held by a fellow comrade. Most of all they were expected to always respect their leaders.We do not know, of course, that the people who took a swipe at Mr Zuma were ANC members. But what we do know is that it could not have been easy for the governing party to see the man who is supposed to win them next year's election treated with hostility. Mr Zuma's crowning glory has always been that of being a ""people's person"" - a man who can relate to the struggles of the poor. That is the vote the ANC needs in order to stay in power; it is also the same electorate that new parties - like the Economic Freedom Front lead by sacked ANC youth leader Julius Malema - are gunning for. So it is an important election for the party, and their leading man is bruised after a number of recent scandals. This year alone there has been controversy over the upgrade to Mr Zuma's private residence in Nkandla, a village in KwaZulu-Natal. The state spent 206m rand ($19.8m; £12m) of taxpayers' money to pay for security upgrades which were initially supposed to cost about 20m rand.Details have emerged in recent months that said security upgrades included an expensive swimming pool, a kraal for his livestock, a shop for his first wife, a clinic inside the premises and entertainment area for his guests. Now his party has been hard-pressed to explain that items made it onto the ""security"" list. Strike one.Strike two? The contentious new e-tolling system installed on the highways in the powerful Gauteng province, home to the capital Pretoria and the commercial hub of Johannesburg.The government borrowed 30bn rand to build the state-of-the-art system in time for the 2010 football World Cup and now wants motorists to repay the massive bill.Many say they were not adequately consulted about the process. Others are asking how the government can afford to spend millions on one man, but refuse to foot the bill on a project which is supposedly benefiting the millions that use the province's roads every day. Mr Zuma has raised the ire of many South Africans, including some within the governing party, before. Yet come elections, many people will remain loyal to the ANC - some even instinctively call it ""Mandela's ANC"". They remain loyal to what the party represents - the liberation of millions of black South Africans from the hands of a minority of white people. However, loyalty is not limitless. Could this see him ousted as ANC leader after secret meetings in the dead of night, as happened to former President Thabo Mbeki in 2008?As South Africans prepare to bury Mr Mandela, the booing may force the party to take a closer look at the man leading its bid to remain in power and ask: ""Could this man cost us the Mandela legacy?"""

Mr Hagel told the Manama Dialogue - a regional security forum - the US has more than 35,000 military personnel in the region and would not reduce that number.""We know diplomacy cannot operate in a vacuum,"" Mr Hagel said.""Our success will continue to hinge on America's military power, and the credibility of our assurances to our allies and partners in the Middle East.""""Iran has been a profoundly destabilising influence and a nuclear-armed Iran would pose an unacceptable threat to regional and global stability,"" he added.Under the interim deal agreed with six world powers in Geneva, Tehran will receive some $7bn (£4.3bn) in sanctions relief while talks continue to find a more permanent agreement.Although the accord was generally welcomed, Israel said it was a ""historic mistake"" and some US senators have said it is too soft on Iran.Mr Hagel said the agreement ""bought time for meaningful negotiation, not for deception"".He said US diplomacy would ultimately be backed up by military commitments and co-operation with regional partners.""As America emerges from a long period of war, it will not shirk its responsibilities,"" Mr Hagel said. ""America's commitment to this region is proven. And it is enduring.""Mr Hagel's remarks came at a time of heightened tension between Washington and its Gulf Arab partners.Saudi Arabia reacted angrily when the US backed down from launching a military strike against Syria in September following chemical weapons attacks near Damascus. Saudi officials very publicly criticised Washington for what they perceived as its timid approach to the region.Mr Hagel told the Manama Dialogue that while the US would continue to provide aid to Syrian refugees and the neighbouring countries of Jordan and Turkey, the rise of violent extremism among rebel groups in Syria had to be addressed.""We will continue to work with partners throughout the region to help bring about a political settlement to end this conflict,"" he said. However, he called for efforts to ensure that aid for the opposition ""does not fall into the wrong hands.""The Obama administration has signalled a strategic shift in its foreign policy towards the Pacific region, in recognition of China's growing military power."

15937	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-21950197	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"A bill containing harsher punishments for rapists was passed by India's parliament earlier in March. Karuna Nundy, a leading Supreme Court lawyer, explains the new laws. Why change the law? Reacting to the massive protests that followed the fatal gang rape of a student in Delhi last December, the government set up a panel headed by a retired judge to recommend legal reform and other ways to reduce sexual violence. The Justice Verma Committee received 80,000 recommendations, held wide consultations and referred to laws and research from around the world.Its report gave many women the audacity to hope that freedom from violence and constitutional equality would be reclaimed by and for women. The new law is a combination of just thinking about gender and existing patriarchal attitudes in society, as well as those ingrained in the colonial Indian Penal Code of 1860. It also reflects the government's desire to be seen as tough on crimes against women. So ""outraging the modesty of a woman"" remains a legitimate legal standard, though some new crimes based on a women's right to bodily integrity and to be free of sexual harassment have also been incorporated.A clearly defined rule should have been to penalise violent, coercive activity.Instead, most marital rape is still legal, even the rape of a ""married"" child, aged between 15 and 18. If an unmarried girl and boy of about 17 years have consensual intercourse, though, the boy risks being sent to a juvenile home for three years, reported for statutory rape by unhappy parents, unofficial caste-councils, or religious moral police.  Which new crimes are included? ‪The new laws are closer to addressing violence as women experience it. New crimes include stalking, which is intimidating and often leads to assault, even murder. Acid violence and disrobing, common now in India, are specific crimes. Voyeurism - spying on a woman when naked or circulating her pictures without her consent - is a new crime. The law also expands the definition of rape and says explicitly that the absence of physical struggle doesn't equal consent.A major reason such a tiny percentage of crimes against women are reported is that the police don't let complaints through. Now the security blanket that protected misogynist police officers and other public servants who failed to register complaints and compromised survivors' rights during investigations has been removed. Compulsory jail time has been prescribed for the non-military public servant who fails to register a complaint or himself commits sexual assault. Procedures for gathering evidence and the trial are a little easier on women now, and more careful of disabled people's rights. Also, all healthcare providers must now give survivors of sexual violence or acid attacks free and immediate medical care. There's a legal provision for compensation but the relevant governments have not set up systems to give survivors quick and adequate restitution.Are the laws tougher?  The word tough can be a red herring: people often think it's about higher sentencing. The new laws increase jail terms in most cases, and bring in the death penalty for a repeat offence of rape, or rape that causes coma. We don't have comprehensive, long-term studies that measure the effect of higher sentences on the rate of sexual violence - but evidence from India and other countries shows that the death penalty is no deterrent to violent crime.There's also a concern that if sentences are thought of as too harsh by the judges, the already high acquittal rate in cases of sexual violence will rise further. Certain and swift justice is more likely to reduce crime. Without comprehensive expansion of the criminal justice system it's unclear how fast rape and assault trials will be, but there's a hopeful amendment in the Criminal Procedure Code - that trials ""as far as possible"" be completed two months from the date of filing charges.There are fears of false complaints, but the power to prosecute malicious complaints already exists under law. Besides, a recent UK study released earlier this month by the Crown Prosecution Service says false cases of rape and sexual violence are much rarer than many believe and compromise justice for women who have in fact been raped, assaulted or harassed.What about the age of consent?The 'age of consent' is a misnomer and lead to all sorts of confusion in public and parliamentary debates. The age of statutory rape would be more accurate. For about 30 years that age was 16 years. It was increased a few months ago to 18 years without much discussion by the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.There were those who thought keeping the age of consent at 16 years would be a social and moral endorsement of teenage sexual activity. But the criminal law doesn't tell you to do this or that. Families, schools, society and free will do. If two young people decide to engage in sexual intercourse with others around the same age, the truncheon of the criminal law is not the appropriate societal signal. Now boys of 16-18 years or slightly older may be branded rapists if they have consensual sex with a girl of the same age and the judge will have no discretion in the matter. This is against the ""best interests"" of teenagers, who weren't even consulted on this important decision, although India is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.A ""proximity clause"" is badly needed: one that clarifies that sexual intercourse between a teenager of 16-18 years with a person not more than four years older will not be criminalised.Parents, schools and communities are free to impart their social values to children, whatever they may be. What do the new laws not cover?That the new laws only protect women from rape and sexual assault and not men and transgender people is a major failure.  The infamous section 377 of the Penal Code penalises ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"". Even if it survives a Supreme Court challenge, the law is limited, and doesn't have violence or coercion at its core. The absence of a proximity clause means 18 as the ""age of consent"" criminalises intercourse between young adults that is neither violent nor forced. Marital rape is still legal - unless the couple are separated. Armed forces in ""disturbed areas"" are still effectively immune from prosecution for rape and sexual assault. They benefit from the boys' club protections that are enhanced in situations of sanctioned violence, committed against communities they are seriously alienated from. While in state and central legislatures politicians accused of crime may remain in office and benefit from the slow justice system until convicted. What lies ahead?The Justice Verma Committee report has laid out a comprehensive roadmap for women's constitutional equality - the panel was set up by the government, it should use that blueprint. It includes police reforms, educational reforms, training of personnel in the criminal justice system, services such as well equipped rape-crisis centres. The new amendments are only a start and a law is nothing if it's not enforced; but you have to have a law first. And for better or for worse, now we do.  Karuna Nundy spoke to the BBC's Soutik Biswas. "

Mr Bae, a Korean-American, was given 15 years' hard labour in May.North Korea said Mr Bae, a Christian missionary and tour operator, used his tourism business to plot sedition.State department spokeswoman Marie Harf said on Friday the US was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the decision to rescind the envoy's invitation.""We have sought clarification from the DPRK [North Korea] about its decision and have made every effort so that Ambassador King's trip could continue as planned or take place at a later date,"" Ms Harf said in a statement.She added that the US was ""gravely concerned"" about 45-year-old Mr Bae's health.Mr King had been expected to travel on Saturday from Tokyo to spend two days in Pyongyang. He will now return to Washington.""We have not been told that anything is definite,"" the US envoy said in Japan on Wednesday. ""We are going to make an appeal."" He said Mr Bae ""has health problems and we are hopeful that we are going to be able to make progress on that"". Kenneth Bae's family say he is seriously ill and has been moved from a labour camp to a hospital. They say he has diabetes and an enlarged heart. Mr Bae (known in North Korea as Pae Jun-ho) was arrested in November 2012 as he entered the north-eastern port city of Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China.Mr Bae's trial and conviction came at a time of high tension between the US and North Korea, in the wake of the communist state's third nuclear test. It also came as the US and South Korea conducted annual large-scale military exercises, which angered Pyongyang. It had been hoped that Mr King's visit could kick-start new contacts between Washington and Pyongyang, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul. North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians, accused of proselytising.They were released after visits to Pyongyang by high-profile officials, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

Like the six other detainees with me, we were whipped 70 times every day.""""We were mostly accused of setting up 'Sahwa' - Awakening Councils - against the state.""Mohammed's horrific tale of torture from Syria might not sound that unusual if the ""state"" his captors' were referring to was the government of President Bashar al-Assad.But they were from the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), an al-Qaeda affiliate that has become an equally feared force in rebel-held areas.Mohammed, an engineer in his early 50s who is the father of four children, joined the peaceful protest movement against Mr Assad when the uprising in Syria began in 2011.When Raqqa province fell under rebel control, he helped set up a local council to provide basic services in the absence of the state.But little did they know that it would not take long for a new dictatorship to replace the one from which they had freed themselves. On 9 July 2013 - the first day of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan - Mohammed and six other members of the council in the border town of Tal Abyad were detained by members of ISIS, who handcuffed and blindfolded them and took them to the city of Raqqa.Over the next 33 days, Mohammed was tortured on a daily basis by the jihadists.But even after his release, Mohammed was not safe. He soon learned that his life was at risk and so fled north by foot to Turkey.He is now staying in Gaziantep, attempting to ensure safe passage for his wife and children so that they can start a new life together, away from Syria.Sitting in a flat in the city that has become home to many other refugees, Mohammed is filled with bitterness as he describes how he believes the revolution in his country has been hijacked by extremist groups that do not represent Syrians.""They are mostly foreigners coming to impose their ideologies on us,"" he says in a low, calm voice.Mohammed is a non-practising Muslim who believes that Syria should continue to be a secular state, and that religion is a private issue. That stance, however, was enough to prompt ISIS to declare that he was a ""kafir"" - a non-believer - who deserved to be punished. The group has used such designations to force out moderates in areas under its control, whether they are local councillors, opposition activists or even fellow rebels.But Mohammed says the jihadists' extremist ideology is not the only reason for doing that. He claims they are working with the government to undermine the rebellion.""[In Raqqa], they have occupied the governor's house and other former Baath Party buildings. But when the city comes under bombardment, only schools, hospitals and residential areas are hit, and not any ISIS-occupied locations,"" he says.Mohammed says ISIS is led by a mixture of Syrian and foreign ""emirs"", and that 11 of the Syrians were detained at Saydnaya military prison in southern Damascus before the uprising began in March 2011. They were released, along with many other Islamists, the next month when President Assad issued a general amnesty, he adds.""The Syrians were practicing on us the same methods of torture they were subjected to in prison,"" Mohammed says. ""But the power lay with the 'shadow' emirs - Iraqis and Tunisians, mainly. They were the ones beheading people and imposing an extremist interpretation of Islam that is not even accepted by religious people in Syria.""""They never pray nor fast, but they force us to do so and they claim they want an Islamic state,"" he adds.Mohammed recalls how two brothers were detained by ISIS fighters in Raqqa and then killed - one was tortured to death; the other shot in the head - simply because they were members of President Assad's minority Alawite sect.""They had been living in Raqqa for years and were part of the revolution,"" he says. ""When different [rebel] brigades captured the town, they obtained documents from them to prove that they were not spies for the regime.""""But those documents - including one from the [al-Qaeda affiliated] al-Nusra Front - didn't protect them from ISIS.""Mohammed also says a heating oil merchant, Abu Wael, was tortured after refusing to sell any at a discounted rate to members of ISIS. He apparently told them that he had agreed a price with their emir, but they demanded it be halved. One night, he was detained and then tortured for six consecutive days.""His shirt was so embedded in his flesh [from the flogging] that I had to push my finger deep into the wounds to pull out the material,"" Mohammed says.""We managed to convince them later to transfer the remainder of his punishment to us, and we received 70 lashes a day to save him from more torture.""

We have to prove, first and foremost, that it is safe."""

The BBC's Charles Haviland in Islamabad says that his decision is a surprise development as the president seeks Mr Sharif's help in bringing the Afghan Taliban to the negotiating table. Officials say that the fact that Mr Karzai's talks in Islamabad will continue on Tuesday - when he will meet Mr Sharif again - indicates that so far they have gone well and that the two sides have something concrete to talk about.   In their public statements after their talks, both Mr Sharif and Mr Karzai mentioned the problem of militant violence - although Mr Karzai focused much more on it. Lack of security was the main concern for both neighbouring countries, the president said. Three times in his brief speech Mr Karzai said that a joint fight against militancy was needed and that he pinned ""great hopes"" on the re-elected Mr Sharif, who came back to power in June.  Afghanistan believes that Taliban safe havens in Pakistan are the main cause of increased violence in the country.Elements of Pakistan's intelligence service have long been accused of backing the Afghan Taliban and giving them refuge on Pakistani soil - something Islamabad strongly denies.Mr Karzai said that he wanted the Pakistani government to play a mediating role with the Taliban, with whom Pakistan has a high degree of influence.Speaking after the talks, he said that the two countries discussed the ""joint fight against extremism and reconciliation and peace-building in Afghanistan with the expectation that the government of Pakistan will facilitate and [provide] help... to the peace process"".""We hope that with this on top of our agenda we can move forward in bringing stability and peace to both countries,"" the president said.For his part the Pakistani prime minister said that Pakistan would extend all possible facilities for peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.  ""I assured President Karzai that we will continue to extend all possible facilitation to the international community's efforts for the realisation of this noble goal,"" he said.""Pakistan will also help reinforce regional efforts in support of [the] stabilisation of Afghanistan.""He said Pakistan wanted a neighbour that was ""peaceful, stable and united"" and that the peace process had to be ""inclusive, Afghan-owned and Afghan-led"". The Taliban refuse to talk with Mr Karzai, dismissing him as a US puppet.One of Mr Karzai's main demands has been the release of high-profile Taliban prisoners held in Pakistan in the hope that this will help jump-start direct talks with insurgents.He is particularly eager for Taliban's second-in-command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar who was arrested in Karachi in 2010, to be freed.Sources have told the BBC that in his case the Afghans would like him to be transferred to Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.  Mr Karzai's visit came after an attempt to kick start peace talks in the Qatari capital of Doha foundered in June. "

At a reception with journalists at the Foreign Correspondents' Club on Thursday, Mr Young also expressed disappointment at how Beijing and Hong Kong did not extradite Mr Snowden, the Oriental Daily News reports.The Beijing-backed Ta Kung Pao voices ""strong dissatisfaction and protests"" at how a ""rude and unreasonable"" Mr Young ""flew into a rage"" when its reporter asked him when the US government would respond to Mr Snowden's claims that it had been hacking into the city's computer networks.""Well, I thank you for all of your objective reporting at Ta Kung Pao, first of all. And if you don't get the sarcasm, it's there. I do wish you'd be more objective. But I know you have your master in Beijing,"" Mr Young was quoted by the Post as saying.Mr Young also criticised the Ta Kung Pao and another pro-Beijing paper, the Wen Wei Po, for questioning whether Washington deliberately staged protests by supporters of Mr Snowden outside the US consulate to cover up its alleged secret funding of the pan-democrats.""The US has not only failed to apologise, but has made groundless accusations... The US must give an explanation and apology to the people of Hong Kong and stop invading Hong Kong's computers,"" the Wen Wei Po replies.Another major story in the Hong Kong press, including the Oriental Daily News, the Ming Pao and the Apple Daily, is a probe by the Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog into a whistle-blowing journalist's allegations of corruption and wrongdoing by China Resources Power Holdings (CRP), a state-run conglomerate registered in Hong Kong. The company, however, has rejected Economic Information Daily reporter Wang Wenzhi's allegations that its executives paid inflated sums for overvalued coal mining assets in Shanxi province, The Beijing News adds.Back in the mainland, the Southern Metropolis Daily, The Beijing News and many internet users are repeating calls for an inquiry into the death of a watermelon seller in Linwu county, Hunan province, during a dispute with urban management inspectors or chengguan on Wednesday that has triggered two days of protests.The Beijing News says the chengguan authorities are denying witness accounts that officers beat Deng Zhengjia and his wife while one of them hit his head with an iron measuring weight. They say that the officers tried to fine the Dengs for running a stall without a licence.Violent clashes erupted again after protesters tried to stop riot police taking away Mr Deng's body from the street, note the China Daily and the South China Morning Post.The Global Times says the case has ignited public suspicion that the local government may be shielding the chengguan, but stresses that violence, not the chengguan system, should be blamed for any rough tactics employed by officers.A village petitioner tells the China Youth Daily how she is waging a legal battle against authorities in Zhoukou, Henan province, after she was locked up in a labour camp and then sent to a mental hospital for 132 days for endangering ""social stability"". The Beijing News says the public are questioning inconsistencies in the 2012 expenses accounts of central government departments amid an ongoing crackdown on officials splashing out on the ""three public's"" (san gong) - cars, banquets and foreign travel.Beijing insiders tip off the Ming Pao on how official celebrations on 26 December to mark communist republic founder Mao Zedong's 120th birthday will be toned down amid an ongoing ideological dispute between liberals and ""leftist"" conservatives.The Beijing Morning Post says a ban in Beijing on renting out illegally subdivided flats that often squeeze scores of tenants into bunkbeds has ignited concerns among internet users over having to pay higher rents.Finally, many Chinese internet users have posted icons of candles to mourn the closure of the microblog accounts of the Asahi Shimbun, the South China Morning Post reports. The Tokyo newspaper says social media operators Sina, Tencent, Sohu and Netease deleted its microblog accounts on Wednesday without any explanation.

Mr Hai is believed to have defected to the Taliban along with two of his bodyguards on Tuesday.   Officials say it is unclear why he decided to join the Taliban and played down the impact of his decision and dismissed his influence.""His defection does not have any impact on his people in the district, because he was not a very influential person,"" Abdul Ghafore Dastyaar, deputy governor of Sar-e-Pol, told the BBC's Jafar Haand in Kabul.  He added that Mr Hai had left Afghanistan and was believed to be over the border in Pakistan.The Taliban welcomed the move, describing it as an achievement that supports their cause and said that it was partly due to their efforts in the area. Mr Hai also appears in a video posted on the Taliban website in which he describes himself as a former mujahideen fighter and says that in his four years in Kabul he saw what he describes as ""the corrupt face of the government"".""In my four years' time during which I represented my people in the Senate I saw that a lot of cruelty and corruption carried out by the government people towards the Afghan population . Our villages were bombarded and our houses were searched by the invaders,"" he says on the video.Correspondents say the video is being used as an opportunity to bolster Taliban propaganda effort as well. They add that fact he is ethnically Aimaq - as opposed to Pashtun from whom the Taliban draw most of their strength - will be important for the Taliban, who want to present themselves as a cross-ethnic movement.  Abdul Khabir, a former MP from Sar-e Pol who knows Mr Hai very well, told BB Uzbek that the former senator had links with the Taliban from the time they were in power.He added that Mr Hai had influence in some 20 to 30 villages in the district. ""Because elections are coming, the Taliban might want to use him to somehow disturb the process of the vote in the local areas where he has loyal followers,"" he said.Sar-e-Pol, a mountainous region in Afghanistan's north, has not suffered the worst of Taliban violence over the years, but militants have increased their presence in the north in recent years.Last year there were several defections to the Taliban among police with a police commander and 13 junior officers joining militants in western Farah province in late July. This was followed when 11 policemen defected in Helmand.  "

They have already been warned to expect ""significant"" time in jail.Five of the six would-be attackers were caught by chance when traffic police stopped their uninsured car  - after they had turned back to head home because the EDL rally in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire had finished early. Police who later searched the car found it contained weapons, an 18in nail bomb and a partially-assembled pipe bomb. The men had also printed a leaflet described in court as ""chilling"" which called the Queen a ""female devil"" and  outlined their motivation for the attack.The message said they planned to kill EDL members in retaliation for their ""blasphemy"", although in pre-sentence statements the men said they intended only to cause minor injuries and frighten them.The Old Bailey heard the planned attack could have had repercussions for community relations that would have been still reverberating today. Had it gone ahead it would have been ""bound to draw a response in revenge from its target and those who sympathise with the EDL"", prosecutor Bobbie Cheema QC told the court, adding it ""would most likely led to a tit-for-tat spiral of violence and terror"". Police and security services had no intelligence about the planned attack, although one of the plotters, Jewel Uddin, was under surveillance in relation to another terror plan.He was an associate of another group of Birmingham-based Islamists who were jailed after planning their own terror attack.Uddin was under partial counter-terrorism surveillance and, five days before the aborted EDL attack, was seen by a surveillance officer with fellow plotter Omar Khan buying some of the knives eventually found in the car boot.A second member of the group, Ahmed, had been separately charged with possession of jihadist magazines that included bomb-making instructions. He was on bail at the time of the failed bombing. Five of the men were from Birmingham - Uddin, 27, Khan, 28, Ahmed, 22, Hasseen, 23 and Hussain, 24. One, Saud, 22, was from nearby Smethwick.Prosecutors said Hasseen, who was not in the car on the day the other men were stopped, was the most ""ideologically committed"" of the group.He was found to have 859 files containing extreme material.The Old Bailey heard that the men met the day before the botched attack at an Islamic fitness centre in Birmingham where Hussain worked and five of the six were members.There was a large police presence outside court as around 40 EDL supporters gathered for the start of the sentencing.EDL leader Tommy Robinson, who claimed he was the target of the attack, briefly appeared in the public gallery with deputy Kevin Carroll before leaving to join other supporters in a nearby pub, BBC correspondent Dominic Casciani said.The sentencing comes as police investigate the destruction of a Somali community centre in north London which was daubed with graffiti saying ""EDL"" and destroyed by fire.Counter-terrorism police are investigating the blaze which follows a reported rise in attacks against Muslims since the killing of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last month.The EDL have held a series of protests since Drummer Rigby's death, including one near his barracks on the night he was killed.

The Castlederg parade, which was supported by Sinn Féin, began after 15:00 BST on Sunday and supporters clapped as it moved off.The counter-demonstration was staged by the Derg Valley Victims Voice, who said the march would glorify terrorism and traumatise families affected by IRA violence. The protesters held banners opposing the commemoration and some of them shouted 'disgrace' as the march began.At one stage, a man whose relative had been killed by the IRA managed to break through the line to vent his anger, but was stopped by stewards.The Parades Commission had placed restrictions on the march, which the parade organisers had already re-routed away from the town's war memorial.At a newly built republican memorial in Castlederg, the names of dead republicans were read out to the marchers.They included the names of the two IRA men, who died when the bomb they were transporting exploded prematurely in 1973.Sinn Féin North Belfast MLA, Gerry Kelly, addressed the marchers, criticising what he called the ""media maelstrom of attacks"" ahead of the event.Mr Kelly said: ""No unionist MLA, councillor, MP or minister, no loyalist paramilitary or loyal order spokesperson - no matter how loud they shout, will prevent me or any other republican honouring our comrades who gave their lives in the struggle for Irish freedom and equality.""He added that the centre of Castlederg was supposed to be a ""shared space"" and almost 20 unionist marches had taken place in the town so far this year.""Yet when a single republican commemoration parade is organised we are confronted with a deluge of orchestrated complaints.  ""In effect we are being told that it is right for unionism to remember their British dead without interference but how dare republicans remember their Irish dead in the same way.""Mr Kelly said there must not be ""a hierarchy of victims which would discriminate against republicans and nationalists not just in life, but in death also"".The Ulster Unionist representatives for the area, Ross and Derek Hussey, were among those attending the counter-demonstration. Ross Hussey said: ""In the face of intense provocation from apologists for murder, the families maintained their dignity and ensured that the memories of their loved ones will always rise above that of the bombers and those that celebrate murderers."" He added: ""Despite Sinn Féin dancing on the graves of IRA victims, the people of Castlederg sent out a strong message today that they will not be faced down by Sinn Féin.""As for Sinn Fein themselves, I don`t think they have any shame - celebrating Irish republican bombers on the same day as families gather in Omagh to remember their loved ones, murdered by Irish republican bombers in that town 15 years ago"""

It would be unforgivable not to seize this opportunity to bring an end to the suffering and destruction it has caused,"" he warned.But in his interview with al-Jazeera on Tuesday, Gen Idris said: ""Conditions are not suitable for running the Geneva II talks at the given date and we, as a military and revolutionary force, will not participate.""""We will not stop combat at all during the Geneva conference or after it, and what concerns us is getting needed weapons for our fighters.""Gen Idris said any opposition delegation would have to include ""influential and significant figures from inside Syrian territory"", and that any agreement would have to meet several conditions.The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says assembling an opposition delegation that is credible and can deliver was one of the main obstacles which held up agreement on a date for the Geneva II talks for months. General Idris's statement pouring cold water on the conference makes it clear there is still a long way to go, our correspondent adds.Many rebel brigades are loosely aligned to Gen Idris and the Supreme Military Council, but he is thought to have little operational control.His influence has been reduced in recent months by powerful Islamist rebel groups who have formed their own alliances and are strongly against negotiations.Our correspondent says that puts the main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, in a difficult position. It has said it will attend the talks, but it insists that President Assad and his associates must be absolutely excluded from the proposed transitional government and from the country's political future. Its other preconditions include a demand for the government to free all detainees - particularly women and children - and allow aid agencies to access rebel-held areas under siege. ""We did not make a final decision yet on our participation in the Geneva conference,"" the National Coalition's president, Ahmed Jarba, told reporters in Cairo on Tuesday. ""We think that the Syrian regime is the one which doesn't want to go to Geneva II, but the Russians are putting pressure on them to attend.""The government itself has always said it is ready for talks without preconditions.On the ground in Syria on Tuesday, at least 15 people were killed and more than 30 were wounded in a suicide bomb attack at a bus station in the western Soumariya district of the capital, Damascus, state media and activists said.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine civilians, including two children, were among the dead.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization confirmed new cases of polio in two more areas of Syria, one in Damascus Countryside province and one in Aleppo province. Syria had been free of polio for 14 years, but at least 13 children are now known to have been paralysed in Deir al-Zour province, and hundreds of thousands more are thought to be at risk because vaccination rates have dropped sharply since the war began."

Mrs May has also indicated the bill could encompass plans to tighten the laws relating to the UK Border Agency to make it more effective at deporting people who are in this country illegally. In a speech on immigration at the end of March, Prime Minister David Cameron said he would legislate to make sure illegal immigrants can't get driving licences and also change the rules so private landlords have to check their tenants' immigration status. Both these measures could be included in the Immigration Bill.In January, Prime Minister David Cameron announced his plan to bring forward a Co-operatives Bill to ""help build a fairer economy"" before the next election. He said the bill would cut red tape and consolidate more than a dozen outdated pieces of legislation governing co-operatives and mutuals.The Department of Work and Pensions intends to put forward legislation to introduce a single weekly state pension of £144 per week, which will replace the current pension of £107 plus means-tested top-ups. The move could benefit 750,000 women who reach pension age between 2016 and 2026 by around £9 a week.The government intends to introduce measures which simplify the currently complex laws which protect consumers from unsatisfactory service. A consultation paper last year set out proposals to overhaul and strengthen core consumer rights and remedies in relation to faulty goods and poor services, and update and clarify consumer rights and remedies in relation to 'digital content' and other things bought online.The government wants to introduce a cap on the cost of social care, as recommended by the Dilnot Commission. This is going to be a complex piece of legislation, as it will involve setting up the assessment process which decides what counts towards the total cost of a person's social care, and which costs will be covered free by the NHS. People who look after elderly or vulnerable relatives could gain the legal right to ask for financial support, professional assistance or home adaptations from their local council. The government intends to allocate around £150 million to help fund the move, although councils may still struggle to implement the proposals at a time of budget cuts. The government wants to make it an offence for a dog to be dangerously out of control in any place, including all private property. If a dog attacks a guide dog it will be an aggravated offence, and when courts are deciding if a dog needs to be destroyed the character of the owner will be taken in to account.There could be a slight overhaul of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. This would most likely involve extending rights of access to data which has been released, including rights of re-use. It could also involve limiting the use of freedom of information requests by extending the government's ability to refuse them on the basis of cost. The government is expected to formally introduce a law banning the use of wild animals in circuses. Circus owners have already been given notification of this, and they have been told they will probably have until December 2015 to comply.There is likely to be a bill paving the way for the second phase of the high speed rail link between Birmingham and Leeds, and Birmingham and Manchester. This is a piece of legislation which allows funding to be made available for the early design stages of a big project, before the whole project is given the go-ahead.Home Secretary Theresa May announced in the Commons last year that she intended to legislate to allow the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to investigate private companies which were employed by the police. It is possible that this could be in the Queen's Speech this year, along with other powers to strengthen the IPCC.The commitment to set up a mechanism for constituents to recall their MPs if they've engaged in ""serious wrongdoing"" was set out in the coalition agreement nearly three years ago, but the government has yet to bring in a bill. On one of his recent weekly phone-in shows, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg assured Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, a strong supporter of recall, that he wanted ""recall provisions on the statute book in this parliament"". What's unlikely to make the Queen's Speech...This is the controversial so-called ""snoopers charter"". It refers to legislation which allows for the monitoring of UK citizens' online and mobile communications. Draft proposals have been described as unworkable by MPs, and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said the plans will not happen while the Lib Dem are in government. All this makes it unlikely the bill will make it into the Queen's Speech without a fundamental rewrite, which would be seen as a setback for Home Secretary Theresa May.David Cameron supports minimum alcohol pricing and the government has been consulting on a price of 45p per unit. But several cabinet ministers, including Theresa May, Michael Gove and Andrew Lansley, are said to be against the plan, meaning it is now unlikely to feature in the Queen's Speech.Ministers consulted last year on bringing in plain cigarette packets. Campaigners say it will help discourage young people from taking up smoking, but tobacco companies have said plain packs could easily be illicitly copied and the move could lead to job losses. Recent reports have suggested David Cameron has withdrawn support for the plan because it could damage the packaging industry. Plans to set a legally defined target of 0.7% of GDP for the amount of financial aid Britain provides to other countries are now unlikely to make it in to the Queen's speech, according to the Guardian. The plans had proved unpopular among many Conservative MPs.  "

They spent millions restoring it before opening it to the public.They argued they could not grant an untrammelled right of way for reasons of security, insurance and maintenance. As a result of the council's decision, the couple closed the estate in 2009 although it was attracting 40,000 visitors a year. They also let 11 staff go.In a statement at the time, they said it had become impossible to operate the house as a historic house or private home. ""No property whatsoever, let alone a large tourist facility, could be operated on the basis of unregulated, uncontrolled and unfettered access,"" they said. Lissadell is one of the Republic of Ireland's most historic premises and was the childhood home of high profile rebel Countess Markiewicz. The house featured in a poem by W B Yeats, for whom it was a favourite haunt.Countess Markiewicz fought alongside the Irish insurgents during the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. She was condemned to death by the British authorities, but her sentence was later quashed and she was imprisoned instead. After refusing to take her seat as the first woman MP at Westminster, she later sat as a member of the first Dail, the Irish parliament. The case has already been the subject of a 58-day high court hearing estimated to cost 6m euros (£5m).The Supreme Court judgment will have serious implications for Sligo County Council, which had argued there was an inferred dedication of public right of way through decades of public use."

They would then charge the costs to an owner who failed to take action.However, wildlife groups have raised concerns that the proposed law may lead to the removal of protected trees.The bill would need to make it through two more stages of scrutiny at Holyrood, before becoming law."
16024	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-21938451	News	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Successive governments have talked about reforming the benefits system and ending the culture of welfare dependency. The Labour government ran into trouble over lone parents' and disabled people's benefits. I remember talking to an employment secretary in the Blair government while the debate was raging over their ""Welfare to Work"" programme.""It's just so complicated,"" he told me, ""fraught with unintended consequences. It's like one of those jigsaw puzzles where whenever you put one piece in place, another one pops out.""But there is general agreement that the evolution of our system of benefits, allowances and tax credits under governments of one shade and then another has become increasingly piecemeal and haphazard, resulting in the chaotic tangle we have today.That is why ministers want to simplify and rationalise it. Their 'Big Idea' is the Universal Credit into which a range of benefits are being subsumed. Housing benefit, for example, will become just one of its major elements.It is part of the Government's radical reorganisation which is about to come into effect.And of course, it's not just about streamlining. Inevitably, in these straitened times, it is also about cutting costs. ""And so it should be"", according to most people surveyed in recent opinion polls. Ministers tell us the cost to the public purse of housing benefit alone has doubled over the past decade. Benefits and tax credits account for by far the biggest single chunk of all the UK's public spending - £230bn out of £709bn.The government assures us that making savings is only part of the story.It also wants to target help where it can do most good. So alongside the introduction of a benefits cap, the disability living allowance morphs into the personal independence payment which will continue to rise year-on-year for the remainder of this parliament. Some existing 'in work' benefits are also due to be up-rated.This is the vision the coalition hopes we will buy into. But the controversy raging around it continues to develop. Over the past few days we have heard warnings of grave hardship and deprivation from organisations as diverse as the Child Poverty Action Group, the National Housing Federation and the Citizens Advice Bureau. Church leaders have also made their feelings known. But it is from pressure groups and campaigning organisations that the most outspoken opposition is coming.Labour leaders clearly sense they have to tread carefully. Partly because of the party's own record while in office, partly because they do not want to find themselves on the wrong side of public opinion, and not least because it is becoming increasingly clear that whoever forms a government after the next election will have to continue implementing the general austerity drive for years to come.Though some in Labour's ranks are agitating for a more aggressive approach, the prevailing line of attack against the government appears to be less about welfare reform in principle and more about whether or not the measures are being implemented intelligently, fairly or competently.Take for example the debate surrounding what Labour call the 'bedroom tax' which they say penalises some of the most vulnerable claimants. Labour's view is that it is a policy which is simply ill thought out. For the record, ministers counter that it is a benefit not a tax. They would rather we call it a 'spare room allowance' and point to the widespread issue of under-occupation while so many people have no bedroom of their own.When the Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill intervened in the debate this week, it was significant he again berated the government over how it was implementing the changes, not over whether they were right or wrong.""Under this government,"" he said, ""the Department for Work and Pensions hasn't got the first idea what it is doing. Ministers simply do not know what impact their housing benefit changes will have.""Shropshire is one of the areas chosen by the government to pilot some of the most radical features of the new system. In this case, the council tested the system through which housing benefits will be paid directly to many of the claimants, except for the most vulnerable including the elderly or those with disabilities.The council told the BBC's Sunday Politics Midlands programme recently that the project had been extraordinarily hard work. Social landlords in the area were worried that paying benefits direct to claimants rather than to their landlords could put their income streams at risk which in turn could undermine their efforts to invest in new affordable housing.Ministers, for their part, argue that direct payments encourage claimants to develop a responsible approach to the management of money and so equip them better for the world of work.We are about to discover who is right and who benefits. At a time when money is so tight for government, claimants and taxpayers alike, the stakes could not be much higher."

""So far, we have progressed based on our plans and we agreed to start serious and detailed negotiations tomorrow,"" Mr Zarif said in a Facebook post.A spokesman for the baroness said ""a great deal of progress"" was made at the previous meeting, and it is hoped the remaining differences could be ""narrowed this time"".The P5+1 ""remains united and will continue to be united"", Michael Mann said.

However, decades of peace-making have also shown that a persistent mediator - most often an American - is necessary, but not sufficient, to reach an historic deal.Still, after six months of meetings and meals at Israeli, Palestinian and Arab tables, Mr Kerry has finally persuaded both sides to come to Washington to sit at an American table to talk. His careful choice of words underlines that this first round of direct negotiations since 2010 is still just talks about talks. Senior negotiators will take their seats, not the leaders.But there is no denying that Mr Kerry's dogged diplomacy has achieved a small important step on this rocky road to peace.In part, the breakthrough is a face-saving device for all sides.

A stop to settlement building is another highly sensitive issue putting Palestinian pressure on President Abbas not to go back to the table now. But it appears Mr Kerry was able to persuade Israel to move on another major Palestinian concern, the release of prisoners.  Israeli minister Yuval Steinitz said prisoners would be released in phases including ""heavyweights who had been in prison for tens of years"".Demands on Palestinians are certain to include assurances that no unilateral steps will be taken, including a return to the United Nations in September.

The BBC's Charles Haviland in Islamabad says that his decision is a surprise development as the president seeks Mr Sharif's help in bringing the Afghan Taliban to the negotiating table. Officials say that the fact that Mr Karzai's talks in Islamabad will continue on Tuesday - when he will meet Mr Sharif again - indicates that so far they have gone well and that the two sides have something concrete to talk about.   In their public statements after their talks, both Mr Sharif and Mr Karzai mentioned the problem of militant violence - although Mr Karzai focused much more on it. Lack of security was the main concern for both neighbouring countries, the president said. Three times in his brief speech Mr Karzai said that a joint fight against militancy was needed and that he pinned ""great hopes"" on the re-elected Mr Sharif, who came back to power in June.  Afghanistan believes that Taliban safe havens in Pakistan are the main cause of increased violence in the country.Elements of Pakistan's intelligence service have long been accused of backing the Afghan Taliban and giving them refuge on Pakistani soil - something Islamabad strongly denies.Mr Karzai said that he wanted the Pakistani government to play a mediating role with the Taliban, with whom Pakistan has a high degree of influence.Speaking after the talks, he said that the two countries discussed the ""joint fight against extremism and reconciliation and peace-building in Afghanistan with the expectation that the government of Pakistan will facilitate and [provide] help... to the peace process"".""We hope that with this on top of our agenda we can move forward in bringing stability and peace to both countries,"" the president said.For his part the Pakistani prime minister said that Pakistan would extend all possible facilities for peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.  ""I assured President Karzai that we will continue to extend all possible facilitation to the international community's efforts for the realisation of this noble goal,"" he said.""Pakistan will also help reinforce regional efforts in support of [the] stabilisation of Afghanistan.""He said Pakistan wanted a neighbour that was ""peaceful, stable and united"" and that the peace process had to be ""inclusive, Afghan-owned and Afghan-led"". The Taliban refuse to talk with Mr Karzai, dismissing him as a US puppet.One of Mr Karzai's main demands has been the release of high-profile Taliban prisoners held in Pakistan in the hope that this will help jump-start direct talks with insurgents.He is particularly eager for Taliban's second-in-command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar who was arrested in Karachi in 2010, to be freed.Sources have told the BBC that in his case the Afghans would like him to be transferred to Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.  Mr Karzai's visit came after an attempt to kick start peace talks in the Qatari capital of Doha foundered in June. "

The hard mud track is flanked by identical houses in an advanced state of disrepair. Girls queue with containers at a communal tap - there is no running water in the houses.  Many children wave or shout greetings. Some adults return my nod, others simply scowl. Mayor Erik Fulop says he and his party use the phrase ""gypsy crime"" to refer to ""types of criminality which are unfortunately especially prevalent among the Roma - extortion by loan sharks, and robberies from homes and gardens"".He has launched extortion proceedings with the tax and customs office against 17 local Roma.He has also set up a ""gendarmerie"" based on an erstwhile nationwide force of the same name - Csendorseg - disbanded in 1945. The word carries unfortunate connotations in Hungarian - in 1944, gendarmes played a central role in rounding up Jews whom the Nazis then deported to concentration camps. In Tiszavasvari, 10 gendarmes now patrol the streets, separately from the police. Five of them are paid from the council budget. They are unarmed but have the right to detain any suspected wrong-doer until the police arrive. I accompany them in their patrol car and we first investigate a burglary, close to a Roma area, where regular police caught the suspect - a young Roma man - red-handed. Next we visit the house of Margit Papp.The 76-year-old widow, who lives alone in a house with a big vegetable garden she tends herself, complains that almost every crop she plants is stolen by Roma. Once they even took the metal poles which hold up her vines. Another time they cut her phone line, before smashing the window and climbing into the house.""I was pleased when I heard that there would be gendarmes,"" she said. ""Whoever it is, they're responsible for public order.""But the government in Budapest have been stung into action by recent incidents between Jobbik-affiliated vigilantes and local Roma in two other settlements, Gyongyospata and Hajduhadhaza.Zoltan Balog, state secretary for social inclusion, told me that local government could not endorse paramilitary activity aimed at ethnic or religious groups.The government has just amended the penal code and passed a decree issuing fines for citizens' groups that try to take over the job of the police.In Tiszavasvari, Erik Fulop accuses the government of suppressing initiatives aimed at ""upholding law and order"".County police, however, challenge his portrayal of the town as a hotbed of crime, pointing out that it compares favourably with other towns in the county, where the crime rate is below the national average. A police spokesman stressed that there was no co-operation agreement with the gendarmerie. Aniko Koka, a local Roma activist, says relations between Roma and non-Roma have deteriorated since Jobbik won control of the town.""What we desperately need here now is jobs, and for the town leadership not to fan the flames of racism,"" she says.In October 2006, a Tiszavasvari teacher, Lajos Szogi, was beaten to death by Roma when he accidentally ran over a child in a nearby village. In April 2009, Roma man Jeno Koka, who worked in the pharmaceutical factory, was shot dead by anti-Roma vigilantes - possibly in retaliation. Four men accused of that, and the killing of five other Roma, are now on trial in Budapest. In a primary school on the eastern edge of town, the principal, Erika Levai Kerekesne, argues that her town does have a future, provided jobs are created. She challenges the stereotype of Roma children who play truant, insisting: ""These children want to learn."" The mayor has plans to encourage unskilled Roma to farm council-owned agricultural land, and is looking to attract foreign investment.And in the gypsy ghetto, Margo is organising the first neighbourhood litter collection, ""so people don't look down on us anymore"".

The bill still has the potential to be used as an instrument of secrecy in a democracy that can only thrive in a climate of openness,"" Sanef said in a statement.The revised bill has removed provisions that would have allowed almost any government agency to classify material, Reuters news agency reports.Public interest provisions have also been introduced into the bill, which was first passed by the lower house of parliament in November 2011.But Right2Know says this does not stop whistleblowers, journalists or activists who disclose classified information from being charged with ""espionage"" and ""hostile activity"".The group said there was also a need for a ""public domain defence"" so that once a secret was in the public domain a person could not be prosecuted."

In a joint statement, the two sides say they are ""building agreement"" on the rebels' participation in politics, despite a tense week in Colombia. The five-decade-old conflict has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Meanwhile, President Juan Manuel Santos praised the army for killing the regional Farc leader, Jesus Antonio Plata Rios, known as Zeplin, on Friday.""Thanks to the joint work of the air force and the army, the head of Farc's western front, Zeplin, has been neutralised,"" he wrote on Twitter. Mr Plata Rios led the rebels in western Colombia and was also in charge of gathering support for the rebels in the region, authorities say.The joint statement issued by the Colombian government and the left-wing rebels in Cuba says concrete proposals have been presented and discussed by both parties.They started building an agreement to ""secure rights and guarantees for the exercise of the political opposition"", it says.Political participation is the second bloc of issues being negotiated at the talks aimed at ending more than 50 years of armed conflict. ""Never before has anyone come this far,"" Mr de la Calle told reporters at the end of the latest round of negotiations.Land reform was the first item agreed on the six-point agenda of the talks, in May, after more than six months of negotiations.Mr de la Calle's optimistic words on Saturday came after a tense week in Colombia, with strong words coming from the government.Farc leaders criticised Mr Santos remarks on Friday, saying that rebel leaders would be tracked down and killed by government forces.In an interview earlier in the week, the Army commander, General Sergio Mantilla, said Colombia's largest rebel group was ""in agony"".But the left-wing group said they were not ""demoralised"" and blamed the government for pre-emptying the talks.Despite the slow pace of negotiations, the Colombian government has insisted a peace accord can be agreed before the end of the year.The Farc warned of the dangers of rushing into a settlement.""It is possible [to reach an agreement by November]. But to achieve peace, you need time. A bad peace deal is worse than war,"" he said in an interview with Colombian network RCN.A study by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory suggests 220,000 people have died as a result of the country's five decades of internal conflict.There is huge pressure in Colombia for justice for those who have perpetrated acts of violence from both sides of the conflict. The government has promised to bring to justice those responsible. The rebels say most of the victims were poor peasants and other civilians targeted by the army and right-wing paramilitaries for their alleged support to the rebels."

That is White House-speak for their intense lobbying of members of Congress before next week's vote. It's Labour Day but they can't stop laboring to avoid a ""no"" vote. It would be a huge and profoundly important humiliation for the president.  After meeting the president, John McCain sounded as though he was almost persuaded - he has long been for military action but thought the president didn't have a proper plan. He can now see the glimmers of one. Mr McCain set out what was at stake - a ""no"" vote would be a catastrophe and shred America's credibility in the world. Given that, I asked, him wasn't he bound to vote yes? He said that a weak response was worse than nothing at all. But it is clear he's moving towards supporting the president, and that will influence others.A phone call between some of Mr Obama's top people and more than 100 Democrats was apparently acrimonious at times with one politician saying that they had collective amnesia - they had forgotten Vietnam and Iraq. John Kerry, in reply, apparently called it America's ""Munich moment""- a reference to [UK Prime Minister Neville] Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler.This is strong stuff. But it points to the central dilemma of Obama's response. No-one seems to believe in what Obama is proposing - very limited strikes. A shot across the bows, as the president called it. As someone has pointed out, a shot across the bows only works if they believe you might sink the ship.  John McCain, and those in his camp, think you have to go much further and seriously weaken Bashar al-Assad so he has to, at the very least, be forced into considering a political solution without him. Those in the opposite camp think that is exactly what they want to avoid - stronger and longer American involvement, even if troops on the ground are ruled out. President Obama's middle way satisfies very few, and the fact of this debate, may change what is being considered."

It needs upper house endorsement, too.The vote follows the case of an Indian woman who died in hospital after she was refused an abortion.The debate revealed deep splits in the predominantly Catholic country.Opponents say the bill could lead to more widespread abortion.Anti-abortion campaigners say that the bill will allow the intentional killing of the unborn for the first time in the Republic of Ireland.For them, it is not just a religious but a human rights issue as they believe that in any pregnancy the mother and foetus have equal rights to life.Others argue the bill is too limited as it does not allow for terminations in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a foetal abnormality.Nor does it allow for termination when the foetus cannot survive outside the womb.Members of parliament (TDs) backed the proposal shortly after midnight, after two hotly debated sessions.  Those who support access to abortion say the bill ignores the fact that, on average, 11 women leave the country every day for an abortion in Britain.Since a Supreme Court ruling in 1992, known as the X case, abortion has been constitutionally available when a woman's life, as distinct from her health, is at risk from the continued pregnancy.X was a suicidal 14-year-old schoolgirl who had been raped by a neighbour and was initially prevented from leaving the country for an abortion in Britain.Since then, the credible threat of suicide is, constitutionally, regarded as grounds for a termination.But in the intervening years, until now, no government has introduced legislation to give doctors legal certainty on when an abortion can be carried out. And that uncertainty provided part of the context for the Savita Halappanavar case. She was a 31-year-old Indian dentist who was admitted to hospital in Galway in October 2012 while miscarrying.She died a week later from septicaemia.Her request for an abortion was turned down.Her inquest heard that she could not get a termination at the time because her life was not in danger but, by the time her life was at risk, an abortion would have been too late to save her.The Fine Gael-Labour coalition government says its proposed legislation will bring the law and constitution into line.There have been consequences for TDs who did not support the changes proposed.Fine Gael Junior Minister of State for European Affairs, Lucinda Creighton, voted against the government on the amendment. As a result, she was automatically expelled from the party.She said she felt ""deeply and strongly"" that aspects of the bill were based on ""flawed logic and absolutely zero medical evidence"".Last week, four other Fine Gael TDs, were removed from the party after they voted against the bill's first reading in the Dáil.Sinn Féin TD Peadar Toibín also chose to vote against the amendment, which was supported by his party.In a statement, Sinn Féin said all of its TDs had been ""mandated"" to vote for the legislation.""The decision this evening by Peadar Toibín TD to vote against the Sinn Féin position is a serious breach of party rules,"" said Sinn Féin's party whip in the Dáil, Aengus Ó Snodaigh.""As a consequence Peadar Toibín has been suspended from Sinn Féin for six months with immediate effect."""

They also have a difference of opinion on one particular phrase.""Exceptional."" It was one word toward the end of President Barack Obama's address to the American people on Tuesday night, used to rally support for a possible military strike in Syria.""When, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act,"" said Obama. ""That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional.""Two days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin spent a paragraph in his New York Times opinion piece responding to Obama's use of the word: ""I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States' policy is 'what makes America different. It's what makes us exceptional.' ""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.""American commentators and politicians were quick to respond. ""History teaches us that a strong and engaged America is a source of good in the world,"" wrote Republican Senator Marco Rubio in the National Review. ""No nation has liberated more people or done more to raise living standards around the world through trade and charity than the United States. We remain a beacon of hope for people around the world."" ""America is not exceptional because it has long attempted to be a force for good in the world, it attempts to be a force for good because it is exceptional,"" Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal. But what is ""American exceptionalism"", and where did it come from? It depends on whom you ask. The Washington Post's Dana Milbank writes that ""exceptional"" doesn't mean better, it just means different: ""Americans aren't better than others, but our American experience is unique - exceptional - and it has created the world's most powerful economy and military, which, more often than not, has been used for good in the world.""Others have looked into the history books for the roots of the term, and the results may be surprising to Putin. Terrence McCoy of the Atlantic, in a March 2012 article, notes that the term was first used by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to describe unco-operative American communists. Citing author Ted Morgan's biography of Jay Lovestone, A Covert Life, McCoy writes: ""In 1929, Communist leader Jay Lovestone informed Stalin in Moscow that the American proletariat wasn't interested in revolution. Stalin responded by demanding that he end this 'heresy of American exceptionalism'.""Joshua Micah Marshall, editor of the website Talkingpointsmemo, acknowledges the Soviet origins of the term, but credits its spread with post-World War II American historians such as Louis Hartz, Daniel Boorstin and Richard Hofstadter, who were trying to understand America's recent economic and social successes: ""How and why was it able to avoid all the bloodletting and conflict which beset Europe (obviously this was a particularly glaring contrast in the late 40s and early 50s). The key seemed to come down to the absence, or relative absence, of class conflict.""Marshall notes: ""In this sense, these 1950s academic intellectuals agreed with those Communists having their obscure discussion in the 1920s. They just saw as a good thing what the Communists saw as a bad thing… That's what 'exceptionalism' meant - that the US got a pass on certain laws of history that applied to the rest of the world - as though a particular person got a pass on insecurity and sadness.""The term fell into disuse in the ensuing decades, but the concept returned to prominence with the rise of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. His references to America as a ""shining city on a hill"" - a nod to John Winthrop and the early Puritan settlers of Massachusetts - embraced the idea of America as a unique example of freedom and hope.Now, ""American exceptionalism"" has become a regular talking point among conservative politicians and commentators, a product of American patriotism, faith in God and the wisdom of the Founding Fathers. They howled when Obama said in a 2009 interview: ""I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.""  (In the full quote, Obama endorsed American exceptionalism, but in his opponents' eyes, the damage was done.)""What makes American exceptionalism different is that we are the only people I know of in history to say power comes directly from God to each one of you,"" Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told a South Carolina audience in 2011. With Obama's recent use of the word, and Mr Putin's stern rebuke, ""American exceptionalism"" - whatever it means - is here to stay.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

A good beginning or an honourable failure? At the press conference, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif looked exhausted by the marathon talks. Mr Zarif smiled and insisted the talks had been positive. He didn't take the bait when asked whether he was upset with the French for apparently throwing a wrench in the works and thanked all the ministers for coming, saying it was normal to have differences. But the press conference was short and felt somewhat awkward, as though neither one of them wanted to be there. Mr Zarif said he was not disappointed there was no deal. There was a lot of progress, according to him, and something to build on during the next round of talks later this month. Although Mr Kerry had made clear when he arrived on Friday that there was no deal yet in an effort to manage expectations, no-one really expected the talks to hit a snag because of France. All day reports circulated about divisions within the group of six world powers. Western diplomats told reporters camped in the hotel lobby that they were furious with the French for inserting their objections at the last minute. But France's position has always been tough on Iran - perhaps unnoticed, because the focus is mostly on the US stance. French diplomats have told me in recent years they believed the Obama administration was willing to concede too much too soon.  After the talks ended around 01:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov went to the bar. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius pre-empted the Ashton-Zarif press conference by speaking first, just outside the hotel where all the delegations had been meeting.Mr Fabius unilaterally announced that the ministers had failed to reach a deal and said that more work needed to be done.  For the P5+1, which always insists on showing unity when dealing with Iran, this was not its finest moment. The negotiations will now resume on 20 November at the political director level - a sign perhaps of how much work still needs to be done before an interim agreement can be reached. During his press conference, Mr Kerry was keen to emphasise that there was no need to rush and that it was reasonable to return to capitals for consultations to get ready for the next round. The US has some allies to reassure about the deal and rushing to the finish line this early would have caused unmanageable angst in Israel, but also Saudi Arabia.Mr Kerry also pointed out it wasn't easy to overcome 30 years of mistrust between the US and Iran (although it seems even harder to overcome French mistrust of Iran).  But it's important also to remember that this was only the second round of talks with this Iranian government. Mr Kerry and Mr Zarif had only met once before in September at the UN for a brief first encounter. In Geneva they spent almost 10 hours in the same room over the course of two days. Although there have been many rounds of negotiations in the past, all sides agree that this time is different. Although differences remain, more progress was made over the course of the last few days than over the last 10 years.

He has even become the first Iranian president to pen an op-ed in a US newspaper. Writing in the Washington Post last week, he called for ""constructive"" interaction with other countries and declared Iran's readiness to help end the conflict in Syria.The message President Rouhani is trying to convey is clear - that he has ""complete authority"" and ""sufficient political latitude"" to engage with the US and its allies on the substance of their concerns.Gary Sick, a former White House National Security Adviser, told the BBC: ""What we have seen already has been such a dramatic shift. Rouhani and his team are the 'anti-Ahmadinejad'.""The sound of the rhetoric makes it so much easier for an American president to react positively.""The positive tone was evident in Obama's interview with TeleMundo TV. President Rouhani's overtures are of the kind we have not seen before and we should test it.""The talk of an ""accidental"" meeting between the two presidents in the halls of the UN's headquarters this week has gone from wishful thinking to a real possibility.  The mood in New York is also very different from the previous years. Gone are the protests and annual adverts on TV and billboards on Times Square with big pictures of Mr Ahmadinejad, denouncing his anti-Israel rhetoric and warning about Iran's nuclear programme.Instead, diplomats are waiting with anticipation to see how the new president gets Iran out of the international relations mess he has inherited from Mr Ahmadinejad.There is little doubt that Mr Rouhani's talk of co-operation with the world has put sceptics in the US on the defensive.Opponents of US-Iran dialogue cannot keep up with the flurry of interviews, tweets and positive signals thrown out by Mr Rouhani and his media team. But the Iranian charm offensive brings to light two critical questions - can Mr Rouhani turn his words into deeds, and is Washington ready to make a deal with Tehran?Robert Einhorn, a former state department special adviser for non-proliferation and arms control who was part of the US negotiating team at talks between world powers and Iran, says: ""I believe Obama administration is prepared to address Iran's concerns very seriously and flexibly provided that the administration sees real movement on the Iranian side.""""Under Ahmadinejad, the perception in Washington was that Iran wasn't really interested in a deal. That has changed. I think the administration believes there is a real opportunity here.""  Five years into Mr Obama's presidency, have the stars finally aligned for constructive US-Iran talks? Many believe so.The opportunity at hand is largely the result of the Iranian election, in which Mr Rouhani's surprise victory ushered in the same moderate politicians who prior to the Ahmadinejad era had agreed to suspend Iran's uranium enrichment programme and helped the US defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan.The White House, however, tends to view Iran's new openness as a sign that sanctions have worked. However, that assessment may miss the important changes taking place in Iran and tempt Washington to push for even more sanctions to elicit even greater Iranian flexibility.""There is a temptation in Washington to believe that no positive step is taken unless the US issues a threat, takes military action or imposes sanctions,"" a European diplomat at the UN said.In conversations with the Iranian side, it is clear they have doubts about whether the US is ready to take nuclear diplomacy to a new level.Iranian nuclear concessions will likely only be offered - even by Mr Rouhani - if Mr Obama puts significant sanctions relief on the table.If that is not forthcoming, Iranian hardliners will be able to attack the president for offering too much for no tangible reward.They denounced him as a traitor in 2003 when, as Iran's top nuclear negotiator, he agreed to the suspension of Iran's uranium enrichment activities without gaining any US concessions.But Mr Rouhani is unlikely to once again offer the West anything on credit.The problem is that some of the most hard-hitting sanctions can only be lifted by the US Congress. It remains to be seen whether Mr Obama has what it takes to neutralise Congress in the same way in which Mr Rouhani appears to have temporarily pacified Iran's parliament. The week ahead at the UN will provide some clues.What is for certain is that millions of Iranians will be watching proceedings in New York for reactions to the president they elected into office, despite all odds, to see if both he and their country's opponents seize the moment and find a peaceful resolution to their dispute.

As the hair-raising ride seemingly slows down, he has not lost. He may even have won. Through a series of highly unlikely gambles, he has come close to getting what he wanted. The Syrians have promised to get rid of chemical weapons, and it looks highly likely it was American threats that pushed them to a deal. But no military action has been taken.There is a serious plan in place, and the Syrians say they will comply.If they do not, the Russians say they will back a UN Security Council resolution that could allow the use of force.Everyone, except the rebels, is claiming a measure of victory.But getting here was not glorious and that in itself will have consequences. One price, according to The Observer's Peter Beaumont, is President Putin's re-invention of Russian relevance. That leaves some - such as The Daily Telegraph's Janet Daley - spluttering, but it is a logical outcome of Obama's approach. The outcome also shines a light on something more profoundly important than one conflict in one region of the world. It is clear that Mr Obama wants America to reduce its footprint in the world - no boots on the ground, or on the neck of regimes disobedient to American will. It is clear he wants to work, when he can, through the international system.He acknowledges the importance of the rise of the rest - particularly China. Logic dictates all of this means the US will be one voice among many. Perhaps the loudest, perhaps the most vocal, but not the sole voice. Importantly, it will not be a harmonious chorus - different voices will say different things, some extremely uncomfortable for the West. That is disturbing to those think it is imperative that the world follows America's lead. But it could reinvigorate the United Nations.For now, the deal looks like a minor miracle, won against all the odds. It is no wonder the president found time for a round of golf at the weekend, on one of those Washington days so cool it heralds autumn, even though it is actually hotter than many British summers. He could afford to relax, just a little. Just before he headed to the course, he had spoken to John Kerry to congratulate him on the deal with the Russians.The last few weeks have in many ways seemed the worst of Obama's presidency - but he has managed to pull off the considerable feat of appearing weak and incapable of making decisions, while at the same time being found guilty of making bold and questionable ones.  He has seemed almost torn apart by conflicting instincts. On the one hand, he obviously wanted to avoid high-profile military action in the Middle East. But on the other, he could not allow his threats about red lines and chemical weapons to prove hollow. In a piece for the Today programme on Saturday, I wrote that the last 10 days had seriously damaged the president. I also said that in a year's time he may look like the smartest man in the room. Perhaps that moment has come a little sooner.True, there are lots of potential pitfalls ahead. The Syrians could give the world the run-around.Defining non-compliance could be hard. Getting a UN resolution to condemn it could be harder. Congress could still be a problem if Obama did want to take action.If that happened, Obama could slither down the snake back to square one, without the prospect of a Russian ladder to help him back up. Even if it all goes smoothly, not everyone will be happy. Not the opposition who were hoping for a hammer blow against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Not hawks in Washington who wanted the same and do not trust the deal. And not those who think the whole episode highlights a muddle-headed Middle East policy.The president got here by delay, not by design. I suppose the history books may show there was a cunning plan all along, but I doubt it. It reminds me of the old story, variously described as Persian, Russian, or Middle Eastern, about the man sentenced to death by a tyrannical monarch. He tells the king that if he calls off the execution, he will teach the monarch's horse to sing. Just give him a year. The king grants his plea. Fellow prisoners are astounded - how on earth does he think he can teach the horse to sing? He replies he has bought himself a year - ""the king may die, I may die, the horse might die - the horse might actually learn to sing"". It seems as if Obama's horse is at least making strangled noises that might save it from history's chopping block. "
16128	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23003483	other	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The UK's senior military judge has expressed concern about the way in which members of the armed forces can be convicted of serious offences by a  majority of just one member of a military jury.The judge advocate general, Jeff Blackett, told the BBC the rules for military courts looked unfair and could be challenged in future cases.Five members of a panel currently weigh up evidence in a military court and can deliver their verdict on a majority of three to two.Judge Blackett said that should be amended because it did not appear fair when you compared it with what happens in the Crown Court, which has a minimum majority of 10 to two.A military court is already very similar to a Crown Court in many ways and the presiding judge, who is known as the judge advocate, must be a civilian.Instead of a jury, though, there is a board, usually consisting of five officers from other units.In a contested case, the board decides whether the defendant is guilty. A simple majority is sufficient and the defendant is not told whether the verdict was unanimous.Board members also have a say in the sentence passed on a convicted defendant, although the judge has the casting vote.In England and Wales, a majority verdict in the Crown Court needs the support of 10 jurors, or nine if two of the original members have been discharged.In Scotland, where juries in criminal cases have 15 members, the accused will be convicted provided at least eight jurors return a guilty verdict.Speaking to Law in Action, Judge Blackett said it was ""an area of concern"" that a defendant could be convicted by a military court if only three members of the board had voted for a guilty verdict and two had supported an acquittal.Judge Blackett pointed out that military courts had been brought into line with civilian courts in recent years, but he thought this aspect of the system should be amended.""It may look unfair that the defendant doesn't know that he has been convicted by a majority and that it's only by one person,"" he said, ""particularly in the more serious cases, such as murder, manslaughter, rape.""""Interestingly the New Zealand military justice system was changed recently and they used the British system as a model. But one difference was they decided that all convictions must be unanimous,"" he said.The issue of majority verdicts came before the Court Martial Appeal Court nearly three years ago.Three civilian judges headed by the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, held that a majority verdict did not infringe the right to a fair trial or produce an unsafe conviction. The appeal court decided in 2009 that military courts should no longer disclose whether verdicts were unanimous.But Judge Blackett suggested that a convicted defendant might bring a human rights challenge in the future in an attempt to find out whether there had been disagreement among members of board when they were coming up with their verdict. Judge Blackett is due to preside over the trial of Sgt Danny Nightingale next week, an SAS soldier who has denied possession of a prohibited firearm and ammunition.Between 2000 and 2011 there were 7,391 courts martial and 6560 of those cases involved army service personnel.Law in Action is broadcast on Tuesday 25 June at 16:00 BST and repeated on Thursday 27 June at 20:00 BST on BBC Radio 4.

Senator Roger Pinto was given asylum at the Brazilian embassy last year.He had been accused of at least 14 crimes in Bolivia, including corruption. He denied the charges and asked for asylum saying he was being persecuted.Mr Patriota's resignation was announced in a brief statement from the office of President Dilma Rousseff on Monday. The same statement named Luiz Alberto Figueiredo, Brazil's head of mission at the UN, as the new foreign minister. Mr Patriota is to become Brazil's new UN ambassador, officials said.The BBC's Julia Carneiro in Brazil says Mr Patriota's resignation came after a day of diplomatic tension with Bolivia.Brazilian diplomat Eduardo Saboia said he used his diplomatic immunity to get Mr Pinto out of Bolivia, leaving with him in an official vehicle on Friday, she says. Mr Saboia said Mr Pinto had been suffering from depression and he had taken a personal decision to help him. The senator had been living in a small room in the Brazilian embassy for the past 450 days.After the escape was revealed, Bolivia accused Brazil of violating international agreements and demanded an explanation.According to Brazilian media, President Rousseff's government did not know of the operation and considered it a ""disaster"". Mr Pinto, who arrived in Brasilia on Sunday, says the charges against him are politically motivated and have been fabricated by the Bolivian government."

The Nuclear Iran Prevention Act was drafted well before Mr Rouhani's election victory in June, but critics, including 20 dissenting members of the House of Representatives, believe that more time should be given to finding a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear impasse.""It gives ammunition to the hardliners who will operate against him, so the timing of this bill could not be worse from a foreign policy perspective,"" said Democrat Jim McDermott, who voted against the bill.Iran has described the move as ''unhelpful'' and said that it will not change its nuclear policy.Iranian oil exports have already been halved from pre-sanctions levels when they stood at 2.2 million barrels per day. The house bill obliges the US administration, which has not supported the move, to reduce Iran's oil exports by another one million barrels per day (bpd).  It is uncertain if the Senate will adopt the one million bpd figure when it votes on the bill in September.Mr Rouhani's election victory raised hopes that existing sanctions may be eased after 130 US lawmakers wrote a letter to the White House, asking for all ""diplomatic tools"" to be used in dealing with Iran.  The US treasury department also took the step of expanding a list of medical devices that can be exported to Iran without special permission.Some of the house members who voted in favour of the bill were signatories to the letter asking for a diplomatic approach with regards to Iran.Other members in support of the sanctions bill remained adamant.

Meanwhile, the former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, has begun a protest fast against the state's division.Telangana would comprise 10 districts of the southern state, including the city of Hyderabad.In recent years, there have been protests for and against the creation of India's 29th state.Backers of the new state say the area has been neglected by the government.Opponents are unhappy that Hyderabad, home to many major information technology and pharmaceutical companies, would become a shared state capital.Power generation in Andhra Pradesh has been reduced by 4000MW as several thermal and hydel power generating plants have stopped working. Life in at least 13 districts has been badly hit with power cuts closing cash machines, petrol pumps and cable TV services.Nearly 50 train services have been cancelled or curtailed. Visakhapatnam airport and several major hospitals across the state have also been affected. Unscheduled power cuts have started in the state capital and India's sixth biggest city, Hyderabad.The power supply to the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu has also been affected.Power sector workers say their strike will continue until the decision to divide Andhra Pradesh is withdrawn. India's cabinet approved the setting up of the new state at a meeting on Thursday evening.Soon after the announcement, those against the decision staged rallies, held protests and called a 48-hour strike in parts of the state that shut down schools, colleges, public transport and businesses.Four federal ministers from Andhra Pradesh also offered their resignations - but they were not accepted.Meanwhile, violent protests have been reported from the town of Vijayanagaram, where a curfew was imposed on Saturday.Telangana, with a population of 35 million, comprises 10 of Andhra Pradesh's 23 districts. Hyderabad will be included in the new state, although for the first 10 years it will serve as the joint capital of the two states.The final decision on a new state lies with the Indian parliament. The state assembly must also pass a resolution approving the creation of the new state.Correspondents say the timing of the announcement is linked to general elections due early next year. Recent opinion polls have shown that the Congress party is struggling in the state, which has 42 parliamentary seats.The move to create Telangana has sparked similar demands in the states of West Bengal and Assam.

We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise,"" he said. On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akhbar Salehi welcomed the offer, saying Iran had no ""red lines"".""But we have to make sure... that the other side comes with authentic intentions with a fair and real intention to resolve the issue,"" he said.The minister said Iran would take the offer into ""serious consideration"", but the US had to desist from the ""threatening rhetoric that everything is on the table"".Iran's supreme leader, however, said negotiations with the US ""would solve nothing"".""You are pointing a gun at Iran saying you want to talk. The Iranian nation will not be frightened by the threats,"" he said.President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has several times announced he was ready for direct talks with the US.But Ayatollah Khamenei's advisers have criticised the president for making such a ""submissive"" offer, says the BBC's Bozorgmehr Sharafedin.The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has repeatedly accused Iran of not co-operating fully.In its last report in November 2012, the agency expressed particular concern about activities at a facility in Parchin, just 20km (13 miles) from Tehran.The agency wanted to investigate claims that Iran had built an explosive-containment vessel to conduct experiments there, saying such experiments ""would be strong indicators of possible nuclear weapon development"".But Iran refused to give inspectors permission to visit the site.Iran's repeated failure to ease international concerns has led to a gradual tightening of economic and political sanctions.  Analysts say Iran's economy is being hobbled. Its currency, the rial, has seen its value plunge, and vital medicines are said to be in short supply."

The two men are army generals.The decision put the lives of Salvadoreans under risk as it threatened the future of the non-aggression pact agreed last year, the gang leaders said.But they renewed their commitment to carry on with the ceasefire, provided it was backed by the security authorities.President Mauricio Funes says he disagrees with the ruling but will accept it.""I have no doubt that behind the arguments of the court is a very clear anti-military bias,"" said Mr Funes in his weekly radio address.He promised to appoint replacements in the next few days.LA gang cultureLeaders representing the Mara Salvatruchas (or MS-13) and 18 Street gangs said they hoped the new security minister and police chief would support the truce.MS-13 and the 18 Street gangs were created in the 1980s in Los Angeles in the US by poor, mostly illegal, immigrants who had escaped from the civil war in El Salvador.When the conflict ended, with a peace treaty signed in 1992, many of those already in jail in the US were expelled and deported to El Salvador, exporting LA's gang culture to Central America.El Salvador's neighbours, Honduras and Nicaragua, also saw an increase in gang violence.In March 2012 the two gangs agreed to a ceasefire, mediated by the Catholic Church, which has sharply reduced the number of murders in El Salvador.Murder rates have dropped dramatically since the gangs agreed to stop killing each other last year, the government says.The gangs continue operating in several American cities.Last year, the US Treasury designated MS-13 as a ""transnational criminal organisation""."

But the director said the FBI was in the ""initial stages"" of developing drone policies.The revelation comes amid a debate about how the US government balances privacy and national security.It recently emerged that America's electronic spying agency has been harvesting US phone records and overseas internet data.  Mr Mueller described the drone use in testimony on Wednesday to the US Senate judiciary committee. He was questioned on the matter by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley. ""I will tell you that our footprint is very small,"" said Mr Mueller, who is retiring in September after 12 years as FBI director.He said drones were used in ""particular incidents where you need the capability"", adding he was unsure how long images captured by the drones were kept.The panel's chairwoman, Sen Dianne Feinstein, told the FBI director she believes that unmanned planes are the biggest threat to Americans' privacy, especially their use by private firms.The authorities used a surveillance drone during a February stand-off with an Alabama man who shot dead a school bus driver and then took a five-year-old boy hostage, according to media reports at the time.Congress has ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to open up US airspace to unmanned aircraft by October 2015.The aerospace industry predicts there will be 30,000 drones deployed globally within five years, half of them in the US, the Associated Press news agency reports.In March, a Republican senator raised concerns about the use of drones against Americans.Kentucky's Rand Paul demanded a pledge that the federal government would not use such aircraft in the US to kill terror suspects who are American citizens.Sen Paul spoke without a pause on the issue for nearly 13 hours on the Senate floor, in a tactic known as a filibuster, to delay the nomination of a new CIA chief.In May, US President Barack Obama said he would curtail the use of armed drones in operations outside the US.Under the new policy described by the White House, the US will only allow drones to be used in areas that are not overt war zones when there was a ""continuing, imminent threat"" to the US and capture was not feasible."

Mr Richardson has also held talks with North Korea over its military activities. In December 2010, he met North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator in Pyongyang, in an attempt to ease tensions between the two Koreas.But some analysts speculated that for Google's Eric Schmidt the trip could have more strategic reasons.""I think this is part of Google's broader vision to bring the Internet to the world, and North Korea is the last frontier,"" said Peter Beck, of South Korean's non-profit Asia Foundation, to Reuters. South Korea's confirmation of Mr Schmidt's trip came days after the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, delivered a new year's message on state TV, the first such broadcast for 19 years. Kim Jong-un, in power since 2011, spoke of the need to improve the economy and also to reunify the Koreas, warning that confrontation only led to war. Kim Jong-un said 2013 would be a year of creations and changes, calling for a ""radical turnabout"" that would transform the impoverished, isolated state into an ""economic giant"" and raise living standards.But while he said confrontation between the North and the South should be removed, Mr Kim stressed that military power remained a national priority.Under Mr Kim's leadership, North Korea has conducted two long-range rocket launches - actions condemned by the US and Pyongyang's neighbours as banned tests of missile technology. The launch in April failed, but December's attempt appears to have been a success, placing a satellite into orbit. The US, Japan and South Korea are seeking a response in the UN Security Council, which banned North Korea from missile tests after nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. "
16172	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23351997	News	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"US Secretary of State John Kerry has again refrained from characterising the ousting of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi by the military as a coup. Washington's hesitation to use the term has drawn accusations from the pro-Morsi camp that the US was complicit in the coup. For the White House, it is an on-going and agonising determination that has legal and possibly even security implications. ""This is obviously an extremely complex and difficult situation,"" said Mr Kerry, speaking in Amman during a news conference with his Jordanian counterpart Nasser Judeh.""The fact is we need to take the time necessary because of the complexity of the situation to evaluate what has taken place,"" he said. Mr Kerry, and other American officials, have repeatedly said it was important to take the time to determine what exactly had happened in Egypt - even while prominent US lawmakers like Senator John McCain, analysts, and supporters of Mr Morsi, have said it is clearly a coup. Under US law, most aid must stop to ""any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup d'etat or decree"" or toppled in ""a coup d'état or decree in which the military plays a decisive role"".The US provides $1.15bn (£756m) of aid a year to Egypt, $1.13bn of it military. But the ''coup legislation"" does not set a deadline, so the administration can use delaying tactics before reaching the legal determination, while it looks into the possibility of allowing aid to continue and hopes that the situation in Egypt improves rapidly. Mr Kerry expressed concern about instability in Egypt and called for an end to political arrests but said it was too soon to judge how the situation would unfold.  In the build-up to the removal of Mr Morsi, the US was clearly uncomfortable with the prospect of a coup but failed to convince him  to compromise with the opposition or push the military to find a different way forward. But Washington had never been comfortable with Mr Morsi as a president either, so it has now come around to accepting the new phase. William Burns, deputy secretary of state, said on a visit to Cairo earlier this week: ""Despite our concerns about the developments of the past two weeks, we believe that the on-going transition is another opportunity... to create a democratic state that protects human rights and the rule of law.""We hope it will be a chance to learn some of the lessons and correct some of the mistakes of the past two years."" Although almost everyone in Washington agrees the administration of President Barack Obama should say it was a coup, opinions are divided about whether the US should suspend aid or find ways to maintain the flow. Marwan Muasher, former Jordanian foreign minister and vice-president at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace overseeing Middle East studies, said: ''The US' best strategy now is to call it a coup, to respect US law, but to get a waiver, because it's not necessarily constructive to stop aid to Egypt.""There is no waiver in the ''coup legislation'' but Congress is looking into passing a bill that would allow aid to continue even if a legal determination is reached that Mr Morsi's ousting was a coup. Similar legislation was approved for Pakistan in 2001. ""The US has been accused of interfering on this or that side, cutting off aid will further antagonise the Egyptians and will not result in any additional leverage for the US,"" said Muasher.   When Mr Morsi was in power, his opponents accused the US of being in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood, while American officials repeatedly explained they were simply trying to work with a president who had been democratically elected. Cutting off aid now would only confirm that impression in the anti-Morsi camp. A US official speaking anonymously expressed concern about a possible violent backlash in Egypt from anti-Morsi forces if the US declared his removal a coup. But Khalil el-Anani, a Durham University scholar who focuses on the Muslim Brotherhood, warned that the US' continued reluctance to describe the events as a coup would also fuel anger towards the US among supporters of the Brotherhood and the wider Middle East - the kind of anger that al-Qaeda would tap into.He urged the US to make aid conditional on progress towards democracy and respect for human rights, including an end to the rounding-up of members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Washington is also concerned that cutting military aid to Egypt could undermine the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. American military aid to Egypt started after the 1979 Camp David accords. Although nothing in the accords mandates the US to provide aid to Egypt, there is an expectation that as long as Egypt abides by the treaty, it can expect aid in return. Under the Congress Appropriations Act of 2012, US military aid to Egypt was also made conditional on progress in the transition towards a civilian government and general respect for human rights.  At the end of last year, Congress put a hold on aid to Egypt because of a clear deterioration in the political transition. In May, Mr Kerry used a waiver included in the act to lift the restrictions, citing national security interests. These included the need to support Egypt as it increased security in the Sinai or helped secure transit through the Suez canal - among other goals directly tied to US national security - according to Mr Kerry. But Tamara Wittes from the Brookings Institution said while the US is worried that cutting aid would rupture the relationship with the military, it should work on ways to hold the military accountable. She said that while the relationship with the Egyptian military was close and beneficial, it was not without tension. Along with 11 members of the Egypt Working Group which brings together analysts, former officials and human rights activists, Ms Wittes signed a statement calling to suspend aid and warning that ""cajoling on democracy while keeping aid flowing did not work when the military ruled Egypt in the 18 months after Mubarak's fall, and it did not work to move President Morsi either.""

The other costs covered training, accommodation, meals, welfare, health, salary and other support per Army recruit in 2010-11.Army personnel can be deployed once they turn 18 - which the two groups said meant that ""at any one time, approximately 150 soldiers are fully trained but too young to be deployed.""They added that it costs approximately £2.65m to pay the salaries of these un-soldiers, which it said were each paid a salary of £17,690.The report said the drop-out rate for minors was 36.6% compared with 28.3% for adults, the report said.But it added that under-18s who completed their training were likely to serve for an average of 10 years, compared with seven-and-a-half years for adult recruits.The report suggested taxpayers would save between £81.5m and £94m if all recruits were aged 18 and over.Its authors also say the UK is becoming ""increasingly isolated"" internationally in continuing with the practice - no other country in Europe recruits from such a young age - and are calling on the MoD to raise the Army recruitment age to 18.David Gee, of ForcesWatch, said recruiting under-18s into the Army was ""a practice from a bygone era"".""It's not just young recruits who pay the price for outdated MoD policies - taxpayers do too,"" he said.""And so does the Army when it finds itself undermanned on the front line because so many minors have dropped out of training.""An MoD spokesman said it continued ""to actively recruit across all age groups"".""As part of our duty of care to our recruits, no young person under the age of 18 years may join our armed forces without the formal written consent of their parent or guardian,"" he added.""There are currently no plans to revisit the government's recruitment policy for under-18s, which is fully compliant with United Nations conventions.""One former serviceman said that joining the armed forces as a teenager was ""a good thing for young people"".Jason Hardick, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, told the BBC: ""It gives you self-confidence, self-discipline and a certain self-determination.  You never want to fail, you always want to move forward.""He joined two weeks after his 16th birthday, and stayed for 10 years, only leaving to get married.

A spokesman for the Red Cross, Ewan Watson, said he could not confirm or deny the report but was in the process of finding out the facts.Separately, Syria's Red Crescent reportedly said on Sunday it had evacuated at least 1,500 people over the weekend from a rebel-held Damascus suburb besieged by the army for months.""Around 1,500 people, most of them women and children, were evacuated from a point on the outskirts of Muadhamiya al-Sham and taken to shelters,"" Red Crescent head of operations Khaled Erksoussi told AFP.More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN.Earlier this month, the UN estimated that more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes by the country's civil war by the end of 2014.No date has been fixed for peace talks, but they are expected in the middle of next month."

The president was addressing young people from across Northern Ireland before flying to County Fermanagh for the G8 summit.Hanna Nelson's family came along to the Waterfront Hall to support her as she introduced the First Lady, Michelle Obama. Younger sister, Sophie, 15, like Hanna, a pupil at Methodist College Belfast, said it was ""amazing"". ""I was very proud of her. She was really, really nervous before - I thought something might have gone wrong for her but it went fine, perfectly.""Her father, Jim, said he was nervous, praying for his daughter who spent Sunday practising her speech. Is she a budding politician?""I don't know about that,"" he laughed. ""She's probably too honest.""Ronan Curran, 14, from New-Bridge Integrated College, County Down, shook hands with the US president and the First Lady. He was among the students chosen to share the stage after impressing judges with his essay on making peace in Northern Ireland.Ronan told Barack Obama it was a pleasure to meet him. And what was his response?''No, it's not - being very humble.""He said it was worth getting up at 05:00 BST for - and said he is hoping for a career in journalism.His sister, Tara, said she did not get to meet the president but ""got some great pictures"".

""It still causes the odd sleepless night.  It's very difficult to see an end of this.""In particular, what is likely to keep ACC Harris, and MI5, awake is the threat from the new amalgamated group known as the 'New' IRA.The group was formed last year and is made up of the Real IRA, Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) and powerful elements of unaffiliated, hardened former Provisional IRA members from County Armagh and East Tyrone. He worries about the emergence of a critical mass.""If that starts as a trend, people may feel it's better to be within this bigger grouping,"" he added.""Hitherto they have been very diverse and mistrusting of each other."" I wondered if there was intelligence that other groups were contemplating joining the 'New' IRA? ""We would watch very carefully for that,"" he said. ""All these groups say to themselves that they are in this for the long run."" His other concern is that a new generation of young people is being attracted to the dissidents and he described the process with words that I have come to associate more with Islamist extremists than Irish republicans. ""Radicalisation is happening,"" he said.""Young men, even in their very early 20s, are being charged with serious terrorist offences who must have only been very small children at the time of the Good Friday Agreement. ""They don't have any buy-in to the [peace] process and almost a nihilist response in terms of what a united Ireland would be like. That's worrying.""Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness has not pulled his punches in confronting the so-called ""dissidents"". There is no doubt about his visceral loathing, having steered the Provisional IRA from ""war"" to peace and power-sharing at Stormont. To call the dissidents ""traitors to Ireland"" with the PSNI's then chief constable, Sir Hugh Orde, standing at his side, was about the most damning insult that he could pay them, many of whom are his former comrades in arms. Nor was he daunted recently when the PSNI warned him of a serious death threat and his house was daubed with paint. At last month's Sinn Fein's ard fheis (party conference), he departed from his prepared speech and scathingly asked: ""Where were they when there was a war?""Interviewing Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly, I got the distinct impression that the party was now rowing back from inflammatory remarks of this kind, perhaps realising that such attacks may be counterproductive. David Cameron is now doing much the same with UKIP. Mr Kelly was almost emollient. No mention of ""traitors"" or republican draft dodgers, although he made his opposition clear in a measured way. 'Former comrades'""I think they are wrong,"" he said.""I don't think they have an analysis. I don't think they have a strategy.""But you have to deal with fact, that there are some young people in it. ""They get caught up in the ideology.  I can understand where they are coming from. ""What I'm more critical of are the ones who - some of them my former comrades - are almost trying to plot a revolution after it has taken place."" I asked if he had spoken to the dissidents and asked why they were continuing the ""armed struggle"" when the ""war"" was over?""The answer is yes,"" he added.""At this moment, the offer is out from myself, and from Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, to speak to them about their analysis, our analysis, and where we believe they are going wrong. ""That is a very open door."" It was almost as if Mr Kelly was offering the dissidents an olive branch. Behind the scenes there are signs that some of them may be prepared to take it up.The problem with the dissidents is that they appear to have no coherent and cohesive political programme. When all is stripped away, it is ""Brits Out"" and self determination for the Irish people. They do not accept that the cross-border referendum, in which there was an almost unanimous vote in favour of the peace agreement, was tantamount to self-determination. Talking to dissidents today reminded me of talking to the Provisional IRA way back in 1972 when the IRA leadership, that included Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams, met the Northern Ireland Secretary, William Whitelaw, for negotiations in Chelsea's Cheyne Walk. The IRA effectively told Mr Whitelaw that if the British wanted peace, they had to withdraw the constitutional guarantee to the unionist majority and leave by 1 January 1975. The British were appalled at the IRA's naivety.Perhaps the light then gradually dawned on Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness, realising that a simplistic ""Brits Out"" strategy was going nowhere. It was three years after Cheyne Walk, that Mr Adams and his comrades in the ""cages"" of the Long Kesh internment camp began to map out the IRA's long-term strategy that, over two decades later, led to their controversial acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement. The IRA's acquiescence led to the split in 1997 from which the Real IRA emerged. The following year, they bombed Omagh. The Real IRA then split into yet more armed dissident groups that are now bombing and killing to try to destabilise the peace process and carry on from where the Provisional IRA left off. Leading dissident Londonderry republican, Gary Donnelly, places the 'New' IRA in a longer timeframe. ""The Provisional movement didn't appear overnight,"" he told me. ""It would probably take them (the 'New' IRA) a lot of effort and a lot of time to get up to full steam. ""But the reality is that (as long as) there's a British presence in Ireland, there will always be a respectable minority who will challenge it and who will use force of arms.""However, despite his concerns, ACC Harris does not believe there is any danger of a return to the dark days of the past. ""There's not actually the broad base of support to mount a sustained campaign,"" he said.Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly is even more emphatic. ""It is not gaining momentum because the people do not want it,"" he added.""It's as straightforward as that.""Peter Taylor's report on ""The New Dissidents"" will be broadcast on Tuesday, 7 May at 20:00 BST on BBC Radio Four."
16206	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22368336	other	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	The roadside bomb killed thousands in Afghanistan last year, stifled the economy and created a climate of fear - yet its capacity to wreak destruction and havoc only seems to be increasing.The exact toll is difficult to calculate but the interior ministry says the majority of 1,800 Afghan national police killed last year, died as a result of roadside bombs.In addition, about 900 Afghan National Army soldiers were killed by roadside bombs - averaging three soldiers a day, according to General Zahir Azimi, spokesman for the defence ministry.Over the last two years, the insurgents' focus on roadside bombs - also known as improvised explosive devices (IEDs) - has gained momentum.They no longer want to take on Afghan and Nato forces face-to-face, says Haji Abdul Mutalib, district governor of Marjah in Helmand province. Instead, they are packing TNT and plastic explosives - as well as metal and ball bearings - into their bombs to make them more powerful and more destructive, he says.Due to increased investment by al-Qaeda, a growing number of Afghan insurgents now have the expertise to make such bombs.But they are also outsourcing the job of bomb-making and planting the devices to young jobless men, according to intelligence sources in the south. And every target has a price - whether a police officer or a district governor.The growth in bomb use has also had the unlikely impact of straining relations with Pakistan. The Afghan government complains the fertiliser used in bomb-making comes from Pakistani factories.The structure of the bombs is basic but very effective, and difficult to detect.Last month in Kandahar province, more than 1,000 roadside bombs were found in the Panjwai district. And, according to the regional police chief Abdul Raziq, there are thousands more.Almost daily, Afghan forces are focused on finding and defusing these bombs. It is not unusual for them to be tipped off by farmers, shopkeepers, butchers or villagers who might find one under a bridge or in a field. By laying bombs where ordinary people live and work, insurgents have ensured roadside bombs remain the biggest killer of civilians in Afghanistan.Over the last year, entire families travelling together in a van, perhaps to a wedding, funeral or picnic, have been blown up, leaving 15 or so men, women and children dead.The devices, often detonated through mobile phones or timers, may be powerful but they are not accurate.The tactical advantages of roadside bombs are many.They allow insurgents to block the country's main arteries, cutting off areas and causing serious food and medicine shortages.One road, on the borders of the remote provinces of Daykundi and Uruzgan, usually used by thousands of people, has been closed for five weeks. Insurgents have lined it with bombs to stop people travelling and supplies being delivered.In other instances, construction projects have been cancelled.And, in rural Afghanistan, these bombs have stopped children attending school, and at worst, killed some.They are also laid on routes that insurgents know will be used by Afghan forces about to carry out operations or make arrests.Stopping the spread of these bombs is proving hard. Without helicopters, the local and national police are the most vulnerable.The Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) use drones to detect insurgents, and security cameras on blimps are an aid, but the Afghan government does not have the same capability.However, together with Nato, the government is targeting the Taliban commanders responsible - a side of the story that often goes unreported.Earlier on Wednesday, in the same district in Helmand where three British soldiers were killed on Tuesday, a roadside bomb killed the head of the High Peace Council for Helmand Province, Raees Malim Shah, and two policemen. They had gone to carry out an assessment of the security situation. Now, it means Afghan officials will no longer be able to go to that area.The roadside bomb has, without doubt, been one of the deadliest weapons in this war, and it remains so.

Earlier the White House said President Barack Obama had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by telephone, urging him to resume negotiations with the Palestinians ""as soon as possible"".Mr Kerry has not publicly announced details of his plan to revive direct peace talks, which stalled nearly three years ago. Previously the Palestinians had demanded a freeze on Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem before a return to peace talks. They have also asked for negotiations about borders to be based on pre-1967 ceasefire lines.Israel's coalition government, which includes pro-settler parties, has said there should be no preconditions.  The Israeli prime minister's office declined to comment on reports that Mr Kerry had presented a plan that included the resumption of talks on pre-1967 lines with land swaps that took into account the major settlement blocs in the West Bank.  However on his Facebook page, Naftali Bennett, who leads the third biggest party in the Israeli governing coalition, rejected any such terms.""The Jewish Home party under my leadership will not be a partner, not even for one second, in a government that agrees to negotiation based on 1967 lines,"" he said.""Jerusalem, our capital, is not and will never be subject to negotiations.""   The rights of Palestinian refugees, borders, settlements and the status of Jerusalem are all core issues in any final status peace agreement.In recent months, John Kerry has paid six visits to the Middle East in an effort to restart talks between Israel and the Palestinians.He has said that time is running out for a two-state solution to their decades-old conflict.

""Over the past year the police have made powerful representations to me of the usefulness of this ability.  I must say their arguments have been pretty compelling.""  Drummer Rigby, 25, was murdered on a street in Woolwich, south-east London on Wednesday afternoon. The UK's security services face a Commons inquiry after it was confirmed the two men arrested over the murder were known to MI5.Communities Secretary Eric Pickles suggested the Communications Data Bill could be re-examined, once the inquiry had been completed.But he gave no indication the government was planning immediate action. He told BBC News: ""I've seen nothing in the reports so far that suggests these communications powers would have made any difference whatsoever. However, the prime minister has announced an inquiry, clearly that inquiry will look at all aspects and some time we may come back and re-look at this.

Speaking on Newsnight on Wednesday both Lord Carlile, the Lib Dem former independent reviewer of terror laws, and Labour's Former Home Secretary John Reid urged the government to consider introducing the Data Communications Bill.Prime Minister David Cameron has previously warned that scrapping the plans would put national security at risk by making it harder to bring terror suspects and other criminals to justice.But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg blocked the change, insisting storing records of internet use for a year and allowing police and security service access to a vast ""treasure trove"" of information was neither workable nor proportionate."

Leaflets, posters and messages in local newspapers will also be used to urge illegal immigrants to return home.They will all feature a text number they can message to arrange a return.

They were based on information leaked by former US intelligence analyst Mr Snowden.In written submissions before the judges, Steven Kovats QC, representing Home Secretary Theresa May, said the ""disclosure of all the material stolen by Mr Snowden would be gravely damaging to the national security of the United Kingdom"".He said such disclosure would ""endanger lives"" and added that the home secretary ""pursuant to her duty to protect national security, had a duty to act against that risk"".Mr Kovats said Mrs May's national security duty to find out the nature of Mr Miranda's activity was ""consistent"" with the police's use of Schedule 7.The home secretary submitted that publishing material obtained by Mr Snowden was capable of being an act of terrorism, the QC added.Therefore ""seeking to establish the nature of the claimant's activity"" met her national security duty and discharged the police's Schedule 7 function to seek to determine ""whether the claimant was or appeared to be a person who was or had been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism"".Matthew Ryder QC, for Mr Miranda told the court: ""This claim is about the use of counter-terrorism powers, that can only be used at ports and airports, to seize journalistic material.""He said the case ""illustrates vividly"" why the use of Schedule 7 powers were not compatible with the right to freedom of expression - Article 10 of the Human Rights Act.  Mr Ryder said Mr Greenwald's articles about surveillance, based on source material provided by Mr Snowden, had ""resulted in global public interest at the highest level"".The QC said the powers used in Mr Miranda's case ""were exercised for an improper purpose"".The ""dominant purpose"" of the police officers was not to determine whether he was involved in the commission, instigation or preparation of acts of terrorism but to ""assist the security service in accessing material in the claimant's possession"", Mr Ryder added.He said exercising the powers had been unlawful because it was ""a disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of expression"".Mr Ryder said neither the police nor the security service, MI5, had tried to use the courts process to retrieve the data nor had they launched any investigation to do so before Mr Miranda was detained. High Court judges have ruled previously that material taken from Mr Miranda could be examined only for the purposes of national security and the protection of the public."

""We are going to be exceptionally vulnerable.""In a press conference after the briefing with Gen Alexander, House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers said officials hoped to make public next week the details of terror plots supposedly thwarted by information gained from the programmes. Mr Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said further disclosures would reassure Americans about the scope of US surveillance efforts, including phone records.""There are no American names in that lockbox,"" he said. ""There are only numbers in that lockbox.""He added if there were a ""reasonable suspicion"" that a phone number was tied to a terrorist organisation, it would be turned over to the FBI for further investigation.Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the committee, said at least 10 attacks had been thwarted by the programmes.Senators leaving a separate closed-door briefing with Gen Alexander also defended the programmes.Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska said: ""It is misunderstood that American private information, emails and phone calls are being rummaged through by the government - that is not true. ""Only when there is probable cause given with a court order of a federal judge can they go into the content of phone calls and emails in order to be able to disrupt a terrorist plot.""But despite the defence of the programmes by President Barack Obama and politicians of both parties, some remain sceptical.Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall said they had seen no evidence NSA programmes had produced ""uniquely valuable intelligence"".""Gen Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection programme helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods,"" the senators said in a joint statement.In the House, Representative John Conyers, the intelligence committee's top Democrat, said he feared the US was ""on the verge of becoming a surveillance state""."

And no-one seemed too worried. The Washington DC police told us they did beef up security this morning in the light of the attack in Boston. But it wasn't overbearing, indeed it felt pretty low-key. I asked one mum out with her two young daughters if she felt worried.""I was a little bit,"" she said. ""But my husband convinced me that was silly and we should just come out and enjoy the day.""Another woman told me: ""You have some concerns but you don't want to live your life in fear.""The mood in America after the Boston bombings generally seems one of sadness and horror but not one of anger or ramped-up patriotism. This is not 9/11.Or perhaps people's attitude has changed since then. Or perhaps everyone is too much in the dark to react.President Barack Obama's latest statement shows the frustration that everyone feels.""We know it was bombs that were set off,"" he said. ""We know that obviously they did some severe damage. We do not know who did them. We do not know whether this was an act of an organisation or an individual or individuals. We don't have a sense of motive yet.""He used the term terrorism, which he had avoided on Monday night. ""This was a heinous and cowardly act."" he said. ""And given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism. Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians it is an act of terror.""It may be that when or if it becomes clear who carried out these murders, there will be a big and definite reaction from America.It may be that more than ten years on from 9/11, the first attack on an American city since then is being treated as a horrible, reprehensible fact of life, rather than something that undermines a nation's sense of self.

For the sake of national security, it's time to stop playing politics with our Department of Defense and to move beyond the distractions and delay.""But Republicans, who have agreed to a vote following an upcoming 10-day recess, have said they need more time to weigh outstanding questions about Mr Hagel.South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham also said he would continue to use the confirmation vote as leverage in his effort to wring more information from the White House about the response to the 11 September attack on a US consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Mr Hagel was a private citizen at the time of the attack.""There seems to not be much interest to hold this president accountable for a national security breakdown that led to the first ambassador being killed in the line of duty in over 30 years,"" Sen Graham said. ""No, the debate on Chuck Hagel is not over. It has not been serious. We don't have the information we need. ""And I'm going to fight the idea of jamming somebody through until we get answers about what the president did personally when it came to the Benghazi debacle.""On Thursday, Republicans forced the delay with a parliamentary manoeuvre blocking the Senate Democratic leader's motion to end debate on Mr Hagel's nomination and proceed to an up-or-down vote on confirmation.Even though the Democrats command a majority of 55 votes, Senate rules in this case require them to come up with 60 to end debate. They fell one short.Mr Hagel, a decorated and twice-wounded veteran of the Vietnam War, served in the Senate for 12 years.But correspondents say he is seen by some of his former colleagues as a renegade for breaking with Republican ranks on issues such as the Iraq war.He has also been criticised during the confirmation process for comments he made years ago claiming ""the Jewish lobby"" had too much influence over American policy.His remarks in 1998 that a nominee for an ambassadorial post was ""openly, aggressively gay"" have also raised eyebrows. Mr Hagel has since apologised for that comment."

His comments follow a day of behind-the-scenes wrangling at the UN.The UK had been pushing for permanent members of the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution which would have authorised measures to protect civilians in Syria.But Syrian ally Russia refused to agree to the resolution and the meeting produced no end to the diplomatic stalemate which has long characterised the UN position on Syria.The US State Department criticised ""Russian intransigence"" and said it could not allow diplomatic paralysis to serve as a shield for the Syrian leadership.Russia is sending an anti-submarine ship and a missile cruiser to the eastern Mediterranean.The ships are being sent to strengthen the navy's presence in the area because of the ""well-known situation"" there, the Russian news agency Interfax has said.But another news agency, RIA Novosti, quotes a senior naval command spokesman as saying that this is just a planned rotation, unconnected with Syria. Critics have questioned what purpose a limited strike on Syria could serve, but Mr Obama told the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) it would send the government of Bashar al-Assad ""a pretty strong signal that it better not [use chemical weapons] again"".The US has yet to produce the intelligence it says shows Mr Assad's government is guilty of using chemical weapons, and UN weapons inspectors are still investigating inside Syria. The team has just begun a third day of on-site investigations, and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has appealed for it to be ""given time to do its job"". He said the inspectors would finish their investigations and be out of the area by Saturday morning.Syria denies using chemical weapons and blames opposition fighters for the attack near Damascus on 21 August, which reportedly killed hundreds of people. It accused the West of ""inventing"" excuses to launch a strike.In a sign of growing fears about an impending attack among Syrians, the Associated Press quoted Lebanese officials as saying at least 6,000 Syrians crossed into Lebanon in a 24-hour period through the main Masnaa crossing - compared to a normal daily tally of between 500 and 1,000 refugees.""Isn't it enough, all the violence and fighting that we already have in the country, now America wants to bomb us, too?"" one 45-year-old woman, entering Lebanon with her five children, told AP. In Damascus senior military commanders are reportedly staying away from buildings thought likely to be targeted. You ""could hear a pin drop"" at one of them, a local resident said. President Obama told PBS that the US had ""not yet made a decision, but the international norm against the use of chemical weapons needs to be kept in place, and hardly anyone disputes that chemical weapons were used in a large scale in Syria against civilian populations"".""We've looked at all the evidence, and we don't believe the opposition possessed chemical weapons of that sort,"" he said. He added he had concluded that the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attack.""There need to be international consequences, so we are consulting with our allies,"" he said.There was ""a prospect that chemical weapons could be directed at us - and we want to make sure that doesn't happen"".The BBC's David Willis in Washington says Mr Obama looked cautious and spoke in a measured way, and he was clearly concerned about getting Congress on board as well as the American public. Opinion polls until now have shown very little interest among the US public in getting involved in the Syrian conflict.In an open letter to the president, US House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner demanded he explain ""the intended effect of military strikes"", and how he would prevent the intervention escalating, if he wanted to win public and congressional backing for action.More than 110 members of Congress have signed a letter formally requesting that Mr Obama seek congressional approval for any action in Syria.US officials are expected to give senior members of Congress a classified briefing on the evidence that the Syrian government carried out the alleged chemical attack on Thursday. The US has said it will not take action alone - but one of its primary allies, the UK, has agreed to wait until UN inspectors report back before taking a parliamentary vote on potential action.Russia rejected a UK push to try to agree a resolution on Syria among permanent UN Security Council members on Wednesday, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying the UN could not consider any draft resolution or proposed action in Syria before the UN weapons inspectors reported back.  The use of force without a sanction of the UN Security Council would be a ""crude violation"" of international law and ""lead to the long-term destabilisation of the situation in the country and the region"", Mr Lavrov has said.The UK, US and France are continuing their discussions following the meeting of the five permanent members.The UK will want to be seen to be exhausting every diplomatic avenue, says the BBC's Nick Bryant at the UN headquarters in New York. For the UK, there needs to be a UN ""moment"" - despite the fact that UN action will likely again be blocked by Russia or China.But even without UN backing the US and its allies have been clear that they see the military option still open to them, our correspondent says.""This is the first use of chemical warfare in the 21st Century,"" said UK Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""It has to be unacceptable... or we will confront even bigger war crimes in the future.""More than 100,000 people are estimated to have died since the conflict erupted in Syria in March 2011, and the conflict has produced at least 1.7 million refugees.Four US destroyers - USS Gravely, USS Ramage, USS Barry and USS Mahan - are in the eastern Mediterranean, equipped with cruise missilesCruise missiles could also be launched from submarines, including a British Trafalgar class boat.

In a statement, President Barack Obama praised Ms Napolitano, saying: ""The American people are safer and more secure thanks to Janet's leadership"".Her resignation comes as Congress is debating broad immigration reform.The former Arizona governor had been an outspoken advocate for changing the US immigration laws, and replacing her could complicate an already tough path in the Republican-controlled House, analysts say.Ms Napolitano is only the third person to hold the top job at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), created in response to the 9/11 attacks. It includes 22 departments. The department's mandate is extremely broad, from immigration and deportations to airport screenings to disaster management.She will leave the department in early September.It is unclear who Mr Obama will nominate to replace her, but some names suggested for the post so far include former Senator Joe Lieberman, Senator Susan Collins and former Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen. New York Senator Chuck Schumer has recommended New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly for the job.  Mr Obama thanked the secretary for working ""around the clock"" during disasters over her tenure, including the 2011 Joplin tornado in Missouri and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Ms Napolitano has been praised for restoring the Federal Emergency Management Agency to good standing after its much-criticised response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.But she faced criticism from Republicans who said she was not strong enough on deportations and on US border security.Under her watch, the department focused its resources on deportations for those with criminal records.Other critics said she failed to solve problems within the many departments of DHS, which was voted the least satisfying government agency in which to work.Deputy Secretary Rand Beers is expected to lead the department in the interim."
16322	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23336914	News	0	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The UK government has approved more than 3,000 export licences for military sales to countries which it believes have questionable records on human rights, MPs say.The House of Commons Committees on Arms Export Controls says the value of the existing export licences to the 27 countries in question exceeds £12bn.This includes significant sales to China, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Sales to Sri Lanka raise ""very serious questions"", the report adds.The committees consist of four select committees meeting and working together: business, defence, foreign affairs, and international development.The chairman, Conservative MP Sir John Stanley, said he was astonished at the scale and value of the licences. There were, for example, more than 60 licences for Iran, including components for military electronics and what is described as ""equipment employing cryptography"".This appears to be a catch-all term which encompasses a variety of equipment, much of it in the telecommunications sector.Similar equipment figured prominently in China's £1.4bn worth of licences, which also included some small arms ammunition, even though there is a European Union arms embargo on Beijing.Sir John told the BBC that in his view the EU embargo ""was not drafted as widely as many people would wish"".Arms licences to Sri Lanka included pistols, small arms ammunition and approval for the sale of 600 assault rifles, which he said ""raised very serious questions"".The report urges the UK government to look again at all the 134 existing UK export licences to Egypt to ensure that they do not breach the current policy, which is not to issue licences where it feels ""there is a clear risk that the proposed export might provoke or prolong regional or internal conflicts, or which might be used to facilitate internal repression"".The committees also want more detail on a sales licence granted to Israel earlier this year for the purchase of £7.7bn worth of what is described as ""equipment employing cryptography and software for equipment employing cryptography"".This one licence granted in February 2013 accounted for well over 50% of the value of all existing licences to the countries in question.The committees also comment on military sales to Argentina.The UK has adopted a restrictive policy for such sales and the committees note that: ""It is reprehensible that the UK government is unwilling to lobby other (friendly) governments to make the same changes in (their) arms export policies towards Argentina.""The committees have asked the government to report back and give assurances that arms export licences to all the countries mentioned are in tune with policy.The report concludes: ""Whilst the promotion of arms exports and the upholding of human rights are both legitimate government policies, the government would do well to acknowledge that there is an inherent conflict between strongly promoting arms exports to authoritarian regimes whilst strongly criticising their lack of human rights at the same time,  rather than claiming, as the government continues to do, that these two policies 'are mutually reinforcing'.""""Cryptography"" is a term that appears frequently in the arms licensing data.It appears to refer to technology which can be applied to a variety of tasks, encapsulating the ""dual-use"" problem - technology which can be used for peaceful purposes but which equally could have a security or military role.A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokeswoman said cryptography was ""a means of ensuring information security, ie preventing unauthorised access to data"". There was, she explained, ""a huge range of commercial applications that use cryptography, from public mobile telephony, online shopping and banking, through to providing secure networks for businesses and governments. Commercial applications account for the vast majority of licences under the cryptography category.""These commercial applications, she stressed did ""not raise any concerns with respect to internal repression or conflict""."

The US has said it is neither ""practical nor possible"" to delay the signing.The Bilateral Security Agreement also has to be approved by the Afghan parliament.The deal under discussion may see 15,000 foreign troops remain after 2014, although the US says it has not yet taken a decision on any presence.The soldiers who stay beyond 2014, when most foreign combat forces leave, would primarily train and mentor Afghan forces. Some special forces would stay to conduct ""counter-terror operations"".More than 2,000 elders have been taking part in the grand assembly of elders, or Loya Jirga, meeting behind closed doors in Kabul for the past four days.""Given the current situation in, and Afghanistan's need... the contents of this agreement as a whole is endorsed by the members of this Loya Jirga,"" a declaration reached at the end of the meeting said, quoted by AFP news agency.""The Loya Jirga requests the president to sign the agreement before the end of 2013.""Opening the meeting on Thursday, the Afghan president urged delegates to support the pact, but said he would not sign it until after the election scheduled for April 2014. The BBC's Karen Allen, in Kabul, says the vast majority of elders wanted the deal signed within a month. The assembly's chairman, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, said he will resign his official posts and leave the country if the security deal is not signed by the end of the year. The past few days have seen tense diplomatic telephone exchanges between US Secretary of State John Kerry and President Karzai, our correspondent says. Washington insists the deal - which has taken months to negotiate - must be signed before the end of this year in order to secure plans for how many troops will remain in Afghanistan beyond 2014. State department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: ""We believe that signing sooner rather than later is essential to give Afghans certainty about their future before the upcoming elections, and enable the United States and other partners to plan for US presence after 2014.""It is neither practical nor possible for us to further delay because of the uncertainty it would create.""Security has been tight for the meeting after a suicide bombing last weekend near the huge tent where it is being held.The Taliban has branded the meeting a US-designed plot, and has vowed to pursue and punish its delegates as traitors if they approve the deal."

The attacks by unmanned US aircraft have been a critical source of tension in the relationship between the countries and came up amid wide-ranging talks between the leaders in Washington.They are also deeply unpopular with the Pakistani public, and Pakistan has consistently stated that they violate its sovereignty.  The Pakistani government has responded to the report by repeating its opposition to US drone strikes""Whatever understandings there may or may not have been in the past, the present government has been very clear regarding its policy on the issue,""  the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement.""We regard such strikes as violation of our sovereignty as well as international law,"" it said, adding that they were also counterproductive.The documents obtained by the newspaper focus on at least 65 drone strikes in Pakistan over the last few years and were labelled as ""talking points"" for regular CIA briefings. Although they are marked ""top secret"" they are cleared for release to Pakistan, the paper reports. The Washington Post says the documents provide a detailed timeline of the CIA drone programme ""tracing its evolution from a campaign aimed at a relatively short list of senior al-Qaeda operatives into a broader aerial assault against militant groups with no connection to the 11 September 2001 attacks"".A spokesman for the Pakistani embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper and the CIA also declined to comment.  Correspondents say the files expose the explicit nature of the arrangement between the countries in the period when neither acknowledged that any drone programme even existed.In 2010 the controversial whistleblowing site Wikileaks released numerous documents relating to Pakistan which showed the Pakistani military and other arms of the government had ""quietly acquiesced"" with drone strikes even though they had publicly condemned them. In August 2008 then Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is reported to have said: ""I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people. We'll protest in the National Assembly and then ignore it.""But this latest cache includes documents which appear to refer to a direct Pakistani role in the selection of targets, with the newspaper referring to one 2010 entry describing  hitting a location ""at the request of your government"". There is also a reference to a ""network of locations associated with a joint CIA-ISI targeting effort"".The number of civilian casualties in drone strikes has long been a source of dispute.Local claims of civilian deaths are almost impossible to prove.  One reason is the restricted media access in the region. The other is the militants' tendency to cordon off the targeted sites and conduct quick burials.Earlier this week, Amnesty International released a report which said that CIA drone attacks in Pakistan were responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes. The rights group named several victims who, it says, ""posed no threat to life"".Amnesty said it reviewed nine of 45 recent drone strikes in the volatile tribal region of North Waziristan where many strikes have hit, and found a number of victims had been unarmed.The US has defended its drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere. On Tuesday the White House said it took ""extraordinary care"" to ensure they complied with international law and that they were a ""course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life"". A recent UN report also found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. Estimates by other groups such as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism calculate that between 407 and 926 civilians have been killed in Pakistan. The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says that the general impression one gets from talking to elders and correspondents from the tribal area is that drone strikes are for the most part accurate, causing fewer civilian casualties than some reports suggest.  Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived more than two years ago when US special forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in north-west Pakistan, without giving the Pakistani government advance warning.But in their meeting on Wednesday,  Mr Sharif said the US and Pakistan ""have travelled together as friends and allies in defence of freedom and the pursuit of international peace and security"".

It's his life.""""He came to our territory without invitation. And we weren't his final destination... But the moment he was in the air... our American partners, in fact, blocked his further flight,"" he said.""They have spooked all the other countries, nobody wants to take him and in that way, in fact, they have themselves blocked him on our territory.""Mr Snowden has been stuck in the transit area of Sheremetyevo airport - reportedly staying at the airport's Capsule Hotel - since arriving from Hong Kong on 23 June.The American has sent requests for political asylum to at least 21 countries, most of which have turned down his request. However, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Venezuela have indicated they could take him in.But he is unable to leave the transit zone without asylum documents, a valid passport or a Russian visa - he reportedly has none of these.And some European countries are likely to close their airspace to any plane suspected of carrying the fugitive.At a news conference on Friday, Mr Snowden said he was seeking temporary asylum in Russia before he could safely travel to Latin America. However, Moscow officials say they have so far received no such request.Mr Snowden's leaking of thousands of classified US intelligence documents has led to revelations that the National Security Agency is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data.The documents have also indicated that both the UK and French intelligence agencies allegedly run similarly vast data collection operations, and the US has been eavesdropping on official EU communications."
16424	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22244539	News	0	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"As Boston mourns, as Massachusetts holds a minute's silence, the Marathon bombing has reignited a fierce political debate.It is a hugely sensitive tussle over the nature of Islamist terrorism, Islam itself and how America responds to terrorism and a religion it doesn't truly understand.In many ways it is a replay, a reflection, and occasionally a distortion of the major disagreement between supporters of George W Bush and Barack Obama.    President Obama's opponents portray him as reluctant to use the word terrorism, overly sympathetic towards Islam, and insufficiently focused on the dangers of violent expressions of militant Islam. On the fringes, some accuse him of being a willing sympathiser.But, more generally, there is a feeling on the right that liberals are too willing to bend over backwards to disconnect the religion from the violence. This makes liberals hot under the collar. They see it as sheer bigotry, and point out that there is in fact no connection between millions of peaceful followers of a religion and a violent fringe. It is not a debate restricted to politicians. I, and I am sure other BBC colleagues, have received quite a lot of messages accusing us of, from one side, wilfully ignoring the role of radical Islam in this attack and, from the other side, saying we are fanning the flames of intolerance.Some of the attacks on Obama are crudely party political. He claimed that after the killing of Bin Laden and other major leaders al-Qaeda was ""degraded"" and by implication close to collapse. His enemies say that is untrue, and he has failed. They want to argue that the strong hand of al-Qaeda is behind every attack. As fundamental is the demand by leading Republicans that the suspect should be questioned as ""an enemy combatant"", even though he is an American citizen. The law allows this if a suspect is connected with al-Qaeda or similar organisations. In part, that argument is one that goes back much further than Islamist militancy  - to John Adams' defence of the British soldiers responsible for the Boston massacre, and all the way back to Magna Carta.   It is about whether hard-won rights for those accused of crimes can be abandoned when a government or a people feels under threat; if they are a civilised nicety, like good manners, that can be jettisoned in wartime, when the crime is too dreadful.  But it is also about how America looks at acts of terrorism. Many I spoke to in the last week regard attacks like the one at the Boston Marathon as a disgusting, horrific part of modern life. One man queuing to go into the Red Sox game on Saturday specifically told me the British had got used to living with a threat because of the IRA. He felt America was moving into that phase.Some think that is defeatist. For them America is at war. That forgotten phrase ""war on terror"" may come back into fashion.They argue the country has grown forgetful and flabby since 9/11, and that the country should lead a global campaign against an existential threat. President Obama will resist this. It is alien to his world view and distracts from his domestic agenda.

The report alleges that in areas they control, ISIS forces had committed numerous serious rights abuses, including some that amount to war crimes, such as abductions, arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment, and unlawful killings.Ten former detainees interviewed by an Amnesty researcher in the past month recounted ""a shocking catalogue of abuses"", the report said, including being flogged with rubber generator belts or cables, tortured with electric shocks or forced to adopt a painful stress position in which their wrists were secured together over one shoulder.Some of those held by ISIS were suspected of theft; others of ""crimes"" against Islam, such as smoking, alcohol consumption or sex outside marriage, the report added. Others were seized for challenging ISIS's rule or because they belonged to rival rebel groups.Amnesty said it was told that several children had received severe floggings. Two detainees described how they had seen a 14-year-old get more than 90 lashes during interrogation at Sadd al-Baath, an ISIS prison beside a dam on the Euphrates river at al-Mansoura.Amnesty said the local Sharia court judge at Sadd al-Baath invariably appeared wearing an explosives belt and had ""instituted a reign of terror over its detainees"".Former detainees accused him of presiding over grotesquely unfair trials lasting no more than a few minutes, and of handing down death penalties which were subsequently carried out.""After years in which they were prey to the brutality of the Assad regime, the people of Raqqa and Aleppo are now suffering under a new form of tyranny imposed on them by ISIS, in which arbitrary detention, torture and executions have become the order of the day,"" Mr Luther said.Raqqa, a city sheltering around a million people, is under the full control of ISIS.Smaller but better funded than other rebel groups, it has historically been made up of foreign jihadists from Arab countries - particularly Iraq, but also Libya, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia - Russia's north Caucasus, and Europe.But activists from Raqqa told the BBC's Newsnight that it was now attracting more and more Syrian recruits. In the past few months, ISIS has made significant advances, largely at the expense of rebel brigades affiliated to the Western-backed Free Syrian Army, and controls a wide swathe of northern Syria close to the Turkish border.Amnesty called on the international community to help to block the flow of arms to Isis and other armed groups implicated in war crimes and serious rights abuses.It also renewed its appeal to the Syrian government to ""end its violations of human rights and international law, including the use of torture in its own detention centres"". The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. More than nine million others have been forced from their homes."

On the federal form, applicants are asked to state under oath that they are US citizens, on penalty of perjury.But Arizona argued such assurances were not enough in their state, which borders Mexico. The state's 2004 law added a requirement that applicants provide a US birth certificate, passport or other proof of citizenship.Justice Scalia said the federal law ""precludes Arizona from requiring a federal form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself"".Immigrant rights groups, who said the law put an undue burden on naturalised citizens, hailed the decision.The ruling ""sends a strong message that states cannot block their citizens from registering to vote by superimposing burdensome paperwork requirements on top of federal law,"" said Nina Perales of the Mexican American Legal Defence and Education Fund.Part of the concern was that while the regular form can be mailed in, federal law prohibits copying naturalisation documents for proof of citizenship, forcing those citizens to apply in person.Two of the court's more conservative members, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented.The US constitution ""authorises states to determine the qualifications of voters in federal elections"", Justice Thomas wrote in his dissent.Kathy McKee, who led the push to have the requirement enacted into law, said the ruling would make it harder to combat voter fraud.""To even suggest that the honour system works, really?""

""So this is a just war - a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defence.""He added: ""And yet as our fight enters a new phase, America's legitimate claim of self-defence cannot be the end of the discussion. To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance."" Declaring America at a ""crossroads"" in its efforts to combat militancy, Mr Obama also said his administration would be willing to accept increased oversight of drone strikes outside war zones like Afghanistan.Human rights groups have long condemned the use of unmanned drones to carry out killings.Mr Obama warned that a ""perpetual"" US war on terror, whether through drone strikes, special forces operations or troop deployments, would be ""self-defeating"".As the president addressed efforts to close the detention centre at the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, he was interrupted by a protester shouting about the current hunger strike at the prison.""I'm willing to cut the young lady who interrupted me some slack because it's worth being passionate about,"" he said.Mr Obama told his audience: ""Guantanamo has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.""The president had made shutting the prison a top priority at the beginning of his first term, but his effort foundered amid strong opposition in Congress.Calling on Congress not to block his efforts to transfer the facility's inmates to American high-security jails, he added: ""No person has ever escaped from one of our super-max or military prisons in the United States.""Mr Obama said he was appointing envoys from the defence and state departments to negotiate transfers of detainees to other countries, and said he would lift a moratorium on transfers to Yemen.After the speech, Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss told reporters Mr Obama was wrong to lift the Yemen moratorium because Yemeni authorities could not be trusted to ""handle them"".""We've got 166 of the meanest, nastiest killers in the world located at Guantanamo Bay today,"" he said. ""If we were to transfer them to Yemen, it would be just like turning them loose. We should try those individuals at Guantanamo in the courtrooms and then make a decision about what to do with them."" Meanwhile, Yemen welcomed the move, a spokesman at the country's Washington embassy said.Mr Obama's speech coincided with the signing of new ""presidential policy guidance"" on the use of drone strikes, the White House said. The policy document curtails the circumstances in which drones can be used in places that are not overt war zones, such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.In an outline of the new policy released to the news media, the administration said it preferred to capture terrorist suspects, with drone strikes used only amid a ""continuing, imminent threat"" to the US.Reports suggested that the military would assume greater control over the drone programme, which is currently led in most areas by the CIA.However, it was also reported that the CIA would maintain control of the programme in Pakistan, where most strikes have been carried out.Beyond that, the administration listed criteria for the approval of a drone strike:""Near certainty"" the target was present and that civilians would not be injured or killedCapture would not be feasibleAuthorities of the country in question could not or would not address the threatNo other reasonable alternatives were availableOn Wednesday, the US disclosed that four Americans had been killed in drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan since 2011, marking the first formal public acknowledgement of the US citizen deaths in drone strikes.In a letter to the Senate judiciary committee, US Attorney General Eric Holder defended the targeted killing in 2011 of Anwar al-Awlaki, whom he described as a ""senior operational leader"" of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.Awlaki, who was born in the US state of New Mexico, was killed in a missile strike from an unmanned plane in Yemen in September 2011 along with Samir Khan, a naturalised US citizen who produced an online al-Qaeda magazine.Awlaki's 16-year-old son Abdulrahman, born in Colorado, was killed in Yemen a month later.Mr Holder also confirmed Jude Kenan Mohammad, a North Carolina resident, had been killed in a drone strike. He is thought to have died in a strike in November 2011 in Pakistan's South Waziristan region.Mr Holder said only Awlaki had been ""specifically targeted and killed"", and that the other men ""were not specifically targeted by the United States""."

The letters read: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance,"" according to US media citing intelligence sources.They were reportedly signed: ""I am KC and I approve this message.""The contents of the letter intended for President Obama were being sent to an accredited laboratory for further analysis, the FBI said, with results expected in 24 to 48 hours.Earlier, police questioned a man in the area who had a backpack containing sealed envelopes, but he was not taken into custody.Reports of suspicious packages and envelopes also led to areas within two Senate office buildings being cleared temporarily. Meanwhile Democratic Senator Carl Levin said an aide had received a suspicious-looking letter and that the authorities were investigating.  All congressional mail has been sorted and tested off-site since letters laced with anthrax were posted to two senators in 2001. A spokesman for the Secret Service, which protects the US president and his family, said it was liaising with the US Capitol Police and the FBI to trace the origins of the letters.Ricin, extracted from castor beans, is 1,000 times more toxic than cyanide.It can be fatal when inhaled, swallowed or injected, although it is possible to recover from exposure."

""We are going to be exceptionally vulnerable.""In a press conference after the briefing with Gen Alexander, House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers said officials hoped to make public next week the details of terror plots supposedly thwarted by information gained from the programmes. Mr Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said further disclosures would reassure Americans about the scope of US surveillance efforts, including phone records.""There are no American names in that lockbox,"" he said. ""There are only numbers in that lockbox.""He added if there were a ""reasonable suspicion"" that a phone number was tied to a terrorist organisation, it would be turned over to the FBI for further investigation.Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the committee, said at least 10 attacks had been thwarted by the programmes.Senators leaving a separate closed-door briefing with Gen Alexander also defended the programmes.Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska said: ""It is misunderstood that American private information, emails and phone calls are being rummaged through by the government - that is not true. ""Only when there is probable cause given with a court order of a federal judge can they go into the content of phone calls and emails in order to be able to disrupt a terrorist plot.""But despite the defence of the programmes by President Barack Obama and politicians of both parties, some remain sceptical.Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall said they had seen no evidence NSA programmes had produced ""uniquely valuable intelligence"".""Gen Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection programme helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods,"" the senators said in a joint statement.In the House, Representative John Conyers, the intelligence committee's top Democrat, said he feared the US was ""on the verge of becoming a surveillance state""."

It comes after recent leaks detailed the extent of surveillance programmes. ""We understand that governments have a duty to protect their citizens. But this summer's revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide,"" the group said in an open letter published on its website.""The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favour of the state and away from the rights of the individual - rights that are enshrined in our Constitution. ""This undermines the freedoms we all cherish. It's time for a change,"" it added.The move by the eight firms comes after whistle-blower Edward Snowden leaked information about surveillance carried out by the US government. Mr Snowden, an ex-US intelligence contractor, leaked documents to the media highlighting the various methods used by agencies to gather information.The leaks have pointed to agencies collecting phone records, tapping fibre-optic cables that carry global communications and hacking networks.Members of the group said the revelations indicated that the extent of surveillance needed to be controlled. ""Reports about government surveillance have shown there is a real need for greater disclosure and new limits on how governments collect information,"" said Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, the world's biggest social networking firm.""The US government should take this opportunity to lead this reform effort and make things right.""The scandal first came to light in June this year after the UK's Guardian newspaper published the first leaks by Mr Snowden.Since then, there have been concerns over how much user data firms have been asked to share with the agencies. In an attempt to allay such fears over data security, companies have called for permission to publish details of data requests. ""Governments should allow companies to publish the number and nature of government demands for user information,"" they state.""In addition, governments should also promptly disclose this data publicly.""Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google and Facebook have all confirmed they have complied with orders to hand over data relating to ""national security matters"" to the US authorities, but have been forbidden from saying exactly how many requests they had received or details about their scope.Larry Page, chief executive of Google, said that security of users data was ""critical"" for firms, but added that the same had been ""undermined by the apparent wholesale collection of data, in secret and without independent oversight, by many governments around the world"".

16490	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22839913	News	1	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"As it is revealed that former CIA technical worker Edward Snowden was the source of a series of leaks about US phone and internet surveillance, BBC News looks at some of the most significant information leaks in recent US history.Daniel Ellsberg was a military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers on the Vietnam war in 1971. The papers contained a secret study by the US Department of Defense of US involvement in Vietnam, showing that the government had knowledge, early on, that it was unlikely the war could be won, and that continuing it would merely lead to more casualties.The papers, the publication of which the Richard Nixon administration tried to stop, also revealed that the previous Lyndon Johnson administration had lied to Congress and the American people about the state of US involvement in Vietnam.Ellsberg sent portions of the report to the New York Times and other newspapers, which published the papers. Perhaps the most significant leak in US history came with the Watergate affair, and the supply of information by ""Deep Throat"" - later revealed to be FBI Deputy Director Mark Felt - to US reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post. The affair began in 1972 with the arrest of five people after a break-in at the Democrat National Committee HQ at the Watergate complex in Washington DC. The FBI connected the burglars to then President Nixon's re-election campaign, and a US senate committee was convened in 1973 to look into the circumstances of the robbery.The investigation by the two journalists revealed the full extent of the cover-up over the burglary which eventually led to Nixon's resignation in 1974. He stepped down rather than face impeachment and possible conviction over what he knew about the scandal.Mehdi Hashemi was an Iranian Shia cleric who in 1986 revealed the Iran-Contra affair in which the US, under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, sold arms illegally to Iran, with the help of Israel - despite an arms embargo and despite the fact that the US still supported Iraq in their war against Iran.The proceeds from the sales were used to help the Contra guerrillas fighting against the left-wing Sandinista revolutionary government in Nicaragua. Hashemi was executed in 1987 by the Iranian government.In 2003, journalist Robert Novak reported that Valerie Plame, the wife of prominent US diplomat Joseph Wilson, was in fact an undercover CIA agent, ending her career as a covert operative and leading to her resignation from the intelligence agency. The revelation sparked an investigation into how the information had made its way to Mr Novak.It was alleged by critics that senior White House aides had revealed the information as revenge against Ms Plame's husband for an article in which he debunked some of the justification for invading Iraq. White House aide Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby was subsequently found guilty of lying to the FBI by a grand jury and sentenced to 30 months in prison. He avoided actually going to jail as his sentence was commuted by President George W Bush.The allegations of abuse of detainees by US personnel at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison had been reported in the media at the beginning of 2004.But it was only when the photos of the ill-treatment of prisoners were supplied to the 60 Minutes current affairs programme and to investigative journalist Seymour Hersh that the abuse turned into a full-blown military scandal.The pictures showed naked prisoners being sexually humiliated and physically abused, and they made front-page news around the world. Eleven US soldiers were convicted of abusing prisoners. The scandal also highlighted the death of detainee Manadel al-Jamadi while being interrogated in US custody.As an intelligence analyst in the US army, Pte Bradley Manning was given access to a large amount of highly sensitive information, and is said to be behind the largest-ever leak of secret US government documents.He has been charged with several offences relating to stealing secret information, and his military trial has been under way since early June.Among the thousands of documents he is accused of handing over to Wikileaks is the video footage of an Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007. Pte Manning is said to have become frustrated with a military career that appeared to be stagnating, and downloaded thousands of classified documents from military servers.He has not denied his role in the leak, and faces up to life in prison if convicted of aiding the enemy.Earlier this year, Pte Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 charges against him related to the leaks, but not to the most serious charge."

Just as predictable as the changing seasons is Pyongyang's reaction to the annual military exercise between South Korea and the US, known as Foal Eagle. The US says it has detected no signs that North Korea is actively preparing to go on the offensive - there has been no large-scale mobilisation of forces, for example.  Pyongyang's threats are usually conditional - if there is a real danger of a US attack, there will be a response, or a pre-emptive strike. The tension usually goes down when the exercises end - until the next round of theatre and threats. But the possibility of an accident provoking a military confrontation is always real.North Korea has been a vexing problem for Washington for years, and so far the Obama administration has also failed to successfully engage Pyongyang and break this cycle - or curb its nuclear programme.This year, the threats emanating form North Korea have sounded even more bombastic for several reasons. There's a new young leader sitting in Pyongyang who's still asserting himself domestically and consolidating his power. And South Korea has just elected its new president, Park Geun-hye - the country's first female leader. So, Kim Jong-un is - no doubt - testing her too. The US reaction has remained mostly the same - with a few variations, officials in Washington repeat the line that North Korea's actions are not helpful and only further isolate the reclusive nation. There seem to be no creative ideas on the horizon. During the Clinton administration, the US repeatedly cancelled military exercises to assuage Pyongyang's fears and defuse tension. But more recently, Washington has matched the intensity of Pyongyang's rhetoric with a display of hardware. After a deluge of 20 threats in a just a few weeks, the Obama administration also dispatched B-2 stealth bombers over the Korean peninsula. The move was also meant to decrease pressure on South Korea to take unilateral action to sound tough in the face of its northern brethren. But every attempt by the US and the international community to hold Pyongyang accountable, with sanctions for example, leads to even more erratic behaviour by the North Koreans. And every time the US ignores Pyongyang's pleas for attention, responding with a resolve to continue military exercises, the North Koreans are further infuriated - partly because their thinking is driven by a different rationale.They perceive US-South Korean defensive military exercises as potentially offensive, and analysts say the North Koreans believe their nuclear weapons are the only thing keeping them safe from a US attack.President Obama spoke at the start of his first term about his willingness to extend a hand if America's foes were willing to unclench their fist. Efforts to restart the six-party talks, which stalled in 2009, have failed. And Pyongyang's behaviour makes it difficult for Mr Obama to be bold and engage in open, direct talks with the North Koreans without risking being lambasted by critics for caving in to threats and legitimizing Kim Jung-un. Administration officials did travel to North Korea on secret missions last year in an effort to persuade the newly-anointed leader to moderate his foreign policy. One of the trips took place in April 2012 and was led by Joseph DeTrani - a North Korea expert who then headed America's National Counter-Proliferation Center. Mr DeTrani, who is now president of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, an industry group, would not openly confirm to the BBC that he had been on a mission to Pyongyang.But he spoke about the need for diplomacy while indicating that the American approach had been rebuffed. ""The North Koreans know the US and China are available in the six-party talks. Their rhetoric is over the top and puts them in a difficult position."" Mr DeTrani added that the US was handling the situation well and that it was up to North Korea to break the cycle.US policy towards North Korea is partly driven by Washington's support for Japan and South Korea and efforts to show that the US remains in lock-step with allies in the face of North Korea.  Diplomacy with North Korea takes place mostly through the six-party talks, which also involve Japan, China, South Korea and Russia. Denuclearisation is always the stated end goal of every discussion. Because of North Korea's fears, justified or not, this often undermines the basis of the talks.  Over the past four years, the Obama administration's posture on North Korea was also dictated by former South Korean president Lee Myung-bak's hardline stance towards the North. But Christopher Nelson, an Asia expert and vice-president of Samuels International Associates, points out that while the new South Korean leader has responded with tough words to Pyongyang's rhetoric, she has also indicated that if the North Koreans are willing to resume North-South talks, denuclearisation would not have to be the state end goal. Mr Nelson said there are indications from the North Korean team at the UN that Pyongyang is now willing to engage. While this still needs to be tested, what's unclear is whether the US is ready to go along with this approach. In public, and for now, it's unlikely that the US will signal any easing of its policy towards North Korea.But if Mrs Park persists with her offer, the US could say it respects its ally's choice and will support the approach. There will be many opportunities to explore this and other diplomatic options in policy towards North Korea. The South Korean foreign minister is in Washington this week. The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, will be heading to Asia next week for his first trip to the region in the new job - with stops in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul. And President Park herself will meet President Obama in Washington in May."

Many expected the missiles would be in the air by now. Instead the attack has been put on hold for at least 10 days.It may not impress those who habitually accuse him of dithering, but at least members of Congress are, this time, unlikely to complain. He is likely to win the vote, going by the public expressions of members of Congress in the last few days. Clearly he thinks he will. But then so did his mate, David Cameron. The humiliation of the British prime minister played directly into his decision. The shock made some advisers even more averse to letting Congress have a say. But its real impact was perverse. It led to the recall, according to White House insiders. In the past, Britain has been accused of being America's poodle. This time MPs clamped their teeth into the seat of Mr Obama's trousers, ripping a hole in his argument of the obvious virtue of action. The forcible removal of America's oldest enemy (John Kerry pointedly referred to the French on Friday as ""our oldest ally - they were helping the Americans fight the British from 1778-83) from the world stage meant Obama needed some more moral support for his case. Protesters in the US who start arguing, ""But even Britain…"" can be answered with, ""But Congress has…""Presuming they do vote in favour, that is. Some will say this shows Obama is weak. Rather, it shows his hand is weak. He was elected to end America's wars, and in reaction to the fallout of the invasion of Iraq.Many of his own supporters want him to focus on what he calls ""nation-building at home"". But he is trapped within his own red lines and, perhaps, the need to send a signal to Iran and North Korea. A recent poll indicated 80% of Americans thought Congress should vote before any military action.Taking action that is unpopular, with an uncertain international coalition and domestic reluctance, is not a strong position to be in.  But it is sensible to make sure the responsibility for unpopular action is shared with other politicians, as Caesar's assassins knew.It is also canny for domestic reasons to keep a very sour Congress sweet. Some might even argue in a democracy it is the right thing to do."

But with heavy rain, security and transport issues, and the fact that Tuesday was not declared a national holiday, areas of the 95,000-capacity stadium remained empty.Introducing the proceedings, the master of ceremonies, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that Mr Mandela's ""long walk is over... and he can finally rest"".Current South African President Jacob Zuma made the keynote address but was booed in some parts of the ceremony.He said Mr Mandela was ""one of a kind... a fearless freedom fighter who refused to allow the brutality of the apartheid state to stand in way of the struggle for the liberation of his people"".Mr Zuma announced he was renaming the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where Mr Mandela will lie in state, as the Mandela Amphitheatre.Earlier Mr Obama delivered his address, carried on the White House web site, to huge cheers. He said: ""It is hard to eulogise any man... how much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation towards justice.""He said Nelson Mandela had taught the world the power of action and the power of ideas, and that it had taken a man like Mr Mandela to free not only the prisoner but also the jailer. Mr Obama said: ""We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. While I will always fall short of Madiba (Mr Mandela's clan name), he makes me want to be a better man.""On his way to the podium, President Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro, an unprecedented gesture between the leaders of two nations that have been at loggerheads for more than half a century.A White House official later said the two had not planned to meet.""This wasn't a pre-planned encounter,"" the official said, quoted by AFP news agency. ""Above all else, today is about honouring Nelson Mandela, and that was the president's singular focus at the memorial service. We appreciate that people from all over the world are participating in this ceremony.""In his address, Mr Castro paid tribute to Mr Mandela as the ""ultimate symbol of dignity and the revolutionary struggle"".Under his brother, Fidel, Cuba was a staunch critic of apartheid, and Mr Mandela had expressed gratitude for that support.In his speech, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said there was ""sorrow for a mighty loss and celebration of a mighty life"".He said: ""South Africa has lost a hero, it has lost a father... He was one of our greatest teachers. He taught by example. He sacrificed so much and was willing to give up all he had for freedom and democracy.""The first speaker, friend and fellow Robben Island inmate Andrew Mlangeni, said Mr Mandela had ""created hope when there was none"".Many people stood in the rain waiting for several hours to get into the stadium, the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports from the scene. She says the crowds were in high spirits - singing and dancing, stomping their feet - and the stadium had the feel of a political rally. Rather than seeing the rain as a dampener, many in South Africa have welcomed it.Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said: ""It's a blessing from the ancestors welcoming a son of the soil.""One of those attending, Shahida Rowe from Johannesburg, told the BBC: ""The core of Mandela's life was humanity. That is why I am here today and the world is celebrating.""Thanks to him, I was recognised as a human being.""Mr Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, arrived at the stadium to huge cheers as she was shown on the big screen.There were cheers too of ""Winnie! Winnie!"" for ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who hugged and kissed Graca Machel.Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Chinese Vice-President Li Yuanchao, President Hifikepunye Pohamba of Namibia and Indian President Pranab Mukherjee also made speeches.The ceremony was closed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who asked the crowd to rise to their feet for a final tribute.The BBC's Mike Wooldridge in Johannesburg says the line-up of world leaders is a sign of how South Africa has seen its partners and place in the world since Nelson Mandela became president.But, he adds, today is as personal as it is political - a recognition that there are lessons for the wider world in everything Nelson Mandela sought to achieve. British Prime Minister David Cameron attended Tuesday's memorial, along with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Labour leader Ed Miliband and former British Prime Ministers Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major.Three former US presidents, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, were also there, as were Francois Hollande of France, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe.Other mourners in attendance were Oprah Winfrey, Bono, Sir Richard Branson and Peter Gabriel.Mr Mandela's body will lie in state in Pretoria on the following three days.The state funeral takes place on Sunday in his home village of Qunu in Eastern Cape province.

""With John's 25 years of experience at the Agency, our extraordinary men and women of the CIA will be led by one of their own.""Mr Brennan was President Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser and he had long appeared to hold enough votes to win confirmation.But a final vote was held up by both Sen Paul's marathon speech, known as a filibuster, and by requests from an intelligence panel to see White House documents laying out the legal basis for drone strikes on US citizens in anti-militant strikes overseas.Mr Brennan was confirmed on Thursday by a 63-34 vote.Sen Paul - a critic of the use of drones - had demanded a pledge from either President Obama or Mr Holder that drones would not be used in the US to kill US citizens.As Mr Obama's top counter-terrorism adviser, Mr Brennan helped oversee the drone programme.Sen Paul began the Senate floor filibuster about noon on Wednesday, a day after Mr Brennan's nomination was approved by the Senate intelligence committee. Also on Wednesday, Mr Holder testified in front of a separate committee and was pressed on the drone programme.Sen Paul said Mr Holder's responses in that hearing had come close to assuring him the government would not attack Americans with drones in the US, but he said he was ""alarmed"" by the difficulty of getting the White House to define clearly what qualified as a legitimate target.On Thursday, Mr Holder sent a 43-word statement to Sen Paul: ""It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the president have the authority to use a weaponised drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?'""The answer to that question is no.""Sen Paul claimed victory and the Senate proceeded to a vote.Mr Brennan's nomination was the latest in a series of tough confirmation battles as Mr Obama rounds out his second term-leadership team.But Mr Brennan largely avoided a personally bruising nomination process like that experienced by Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel.Mr Hagel was confirmed in a 58-41 Senate vote after Republicans stalled his nomination for more than a week, questioning his past positions on Israel and Iran and his qualification for the job."

But in Friday's decision, Judge Pauley, of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, said ""the balance of equities and the public interest tilt firmly in favour of the Government's position"".In his 53-page ruling, he concluded: ""The right to be free from searches and seizures is fundamental, but not absolute.""He also noted: ""Every day, people voluntarily surrender personal and seemingly-private information to trans-national corporations, which exploit that data for profit. ""Few think twice about it, even though it is far more intrusive than bulk telephony metadata collection.""There is no evidence that the Government has used any of the bulk telephony metadata it collected for any purpose other than investigating and disrupting terrorist attacks.""Judge Pauley dismissed a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which told the BBC it would appeal.""We are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government's surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,"" said the civil rights organisation's deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer. The Obama administration, which has been on the defensive over the NSA revelations, welcomed the ruling.""We are pleased the court found the NSA's bulk telephony metadata collection program to be lawful,"" US Department of Justice spokesman Peter Carr told the BBC. Friday's ruling contradicts that on 16 December by Washington DC federal Judge Richard Leon, who said the NSA's surveillance was ""indiscriminate"" and an ""arbitrary invasion"".His 68-page decision backed a conservative activist's legal challenge on the merits of the Fourth Amendment, the clause in the US constitution barring unreasonable search and seizure by the government.Judge Leon suspended his ruling pending an appeal by the justice department, enabling the programme to continue for now.The NSA's snooping was leaked in June by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the agency. He fled to Russia, which granted him temporary asylum.Under the programme, America's electronic surveillance agency orders Verizon - one of the largest phone companies in the US - to hand over its metadata. This includes telephone numbers, times and dates of calls, calling card numbers and the serial numbers of phones, from millions of calls Verizon processes in which at least one party is in the US.The disclosures about the NSA's tracking of the communications by ordinary citizens as well as world leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, have dismayed civil rights activists and diplomats.In his end-of-year news conference, President Barack Obama hinted at a possible review of such snooping.In light of ""disclosures that have taken place"", there might be ""another way of skinning the cat"", he said earlier this week.Mr Obama is expected to announce next month whether he will act on a White House-appointed panel's advice to rein in the NSA.Among the task force's sweeping recommendations were that the spy agency should no longer store the data."

But on Sunday Bild newspaper quoted US intelligence sources as saying NSA head Keith Alexander personally briefed the president about the covert operation targeting Mrs Merkel in 2010.""Obama did not halt the operation but rather let it continue,"" the newspaper quoted a senior NSA official as saying.Her number was still on a surveillance list in 2013.Germany is sending its top intelligence chiefs to Washington in the coming week to ""push forward"" an investigation into the spying allegations, which have caused outrage in Germany.The documents seen by Der Spiegel give further details about the NSA's targeting of European governments.A unit called Special Collection Services, based on the fourth floor of the US embassy in Pariser Platz in Berlin, was responsible for monitoring communications in the German capital's government quarter, including those targeting Mrs Merkel.Germany's Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Bild that running such an operation on German soil would be illegal under German law, and adds that those ""responsible must be held accountable"".  Similar listening units were based in around 80 locations worldwide, according to the documents seen by Der Spiegel, 19 of them in European cities.If the existence of listening stations in US embassies were known, there would be ""severe damage for the US's relations with a foreign government,"" the documents said.Mrs Merkel - an Americophile who was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 - is said to be shocked that Washington may have engaged in the sort of spying she had to endure growing up in Communist East Germany."
16627	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23918390	Opinion	1	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The US has evidence that the chemical nerve agent sarin was used in a deadly attack in Damascus last month, Secretary of State John Kerry says.The US blames the Syrian government for the 21 August attack. President Barack Obama has called for military action to be taken against Syria and says he will seek congressional authorisation for intervention.Here, American readers react to Mr Obama's announcement and discuss their views on a potential US-led missile strike on Syria.The US should have done something about the Syrian crisis much sooner than now.The world reacts by talking, while the people of Syria react by crying and burying their family members.I think whatever party or religion you belong to, I don't feel comfortable watching people getting massacred and not doing anything about it.By leaving the decision to Congress, and if it goes against Obama, then he can blame Congress for not going in to Syria. It's the most cowardly move I have ever seen in my life.A lot of countries depend on the US for leadership and for the stand we take on issues. But if we don't do something, no one else will.I do not agree with the president that he ought to take punitive action against Syria.His action to seek authorisation from Congress is a sham. He knows well that punishing Assad is not going to stop the conflict, nor is it going to stop any future chemical weapon attacks.Also, the USA cannot afford to spend money in this manner when our economy is not very sound at this time. Historically, our past military interventions in the Middle East have been extremely costly.Sadly, they have not achieved any good political results either.I expect Congress to veto any US punitive action in Syria.The best solution to stemming the inhumane actions in Syria is for Arab states to discuss the present situation and then advise the UN to take military and/or economic sanctions against that country's leader. Grudgingly, I agree with a brief, muscular action in Syria. But I am quite sure that there will be some reaction and serious consequences from some Arab states.President Obama has no escape route. He placed himself in a corner with the words ""crossing the red line"" [over the use of chemical weapons]. He has already made his mind up and is just going to Congress to pacify the ""doves"", justify the intervention and make it legal.Of course, he is going to get the approval of Congress. When in distress, right or wrong, we Americans agree with our leaders. Look at World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia and 9/11.Syria is the most difficult situation ever encountered by the US and its allies. It is a case of ""damned if you do and damned if you don't"".While an attack on a military installation in Syria might seem like a simple response to a terrible action, I think the United States is already over-involved in expensive Middle East disputes that it cannot easily extricate itself from. We should not add one more that we know in advance will have no practical impact and risks escalation of our involvement in the area.  Instead, I would like to see us embarrass and ""punish"" China and Russia for supporting al-Assad after his regime's brutality on his own people.  Further, I would like to encourage the countries in the Middle East to step up to the plate and clean up their neighbours' mess.It is easy to make the case on moral grounds.  It is far more difficult to find an intervention that will make things better rather than worse.  We all know what happens when we jump in with good intentions.Blowing up Syrian installations that would reduce the pain and suffering in Syria is hard for me to imagine.A delay is good at this point - give the Russians time to deal with the evidence for sarin gas. It's possible that if the UN comes forward with a clear report on the use of sarin gas then the Russians may moderate their stance.The best development at this point would be for Russians to reduce support for Assad, and join the effort to find way to begin to wind the violence down.  If a little time could pass maybe the Russians will come around.I am vehemently opposed to Obama's military threat against Syria with or without the approval of the UN Security Council, Nato, international allies, and/or the US Congress.  Overall, US military force cannot solve the problem of the mass murder of innocents with chemical or other weapons.We do not kill people to save people from being killed. Another debauched USA war against an Arab nation can lead only to chaos. A diplomatic, political solution is the way forward towards peace. The US must lead a multilateral and meaningful peace process that engages leaders of all nations involved directly or indirectly in the Syrian conflict.   "

The letters read: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance,"" according to US media citing intelligence sources.They were reportedly signed: ""I am KC and I approve this message.""The contents of the letter intended for President Obama were being sent to an accredited laboratory for further analysis, the FBI said, with results expected in 24 to 48 hours.Earlier, police questioned a man in the area who had a backpack containing sealed envelopes, but he was not taken into custody.Reports of suspicious packages and envelopes also led to areas within two Senate office buildings being cleared temporarily. Meanwhile Democratic Senator Carl Levin said an aide had received a suspicious-looking letter and that the authorities were investigating.  All congressional mail has been sorted and tested off-site since letters laced with anthrax were posted to two senators in 2001. A spokesman for the Secret Service, which protects the US president and his family, said it was liaising with the US Capitol Police and the FBI to trace the origins of the letters.Ricin, extracted from castor beans, is 1,000 times more toxic than cyanide.It can be fatal when inhaled, swallowed or injected, although it is possible to recover from exposure."

Mr Amash said: ""My amendment blocks funding of NSA's collection of personal data if that data does not pertain to a person under investigation.""A vote on the amendment will take place on Wednesday.Even if it passes the House, the measure is seen as unlikely to become law, as Mr Obama's Democratic Party controls the Senate.House Democrats John Conyers and Jared Polis supported the move, which they said ""makes sure that innocent Americans' information isn't needlessly swept up into a government database"".However, the White House said the measure would deprive the intelligence agencies of a key tool in preventing terror attacks.""This blunt approach is not the product of an informed, open or deliberative process,"" said spokesman Jay Carney.""We urge the House to reject the Amash amendment, and instead move forward with an approach that appropriately takes into account the need for a reasoned review of what tools can best secure the nation.""NSA head Gen Alexander held separate, closed-door sessions with Republicans and Democrats on the eve of the vote in an attempt to persuade them to vote against.Afterwards he told CNN: ""What you can see is that everybody wants to ensure we protect civil liberties and privacy and defend this country.""We have that responsibility, and the issue is, how do we do that? How do we take care of our people and protect our civil liberties and privacy? This is a tough issue.""The issue has split the main parties, with Democrats and Republicans lining up on both sides of the debate.Meanwhile it is thought possible that Russia will announce whether Edward Snowden has been successful in his application for temporary asylum in the country.He has been in limbo in a Moscow airport for weeks, but his lawyer Anatoly Kucherena says Wednesday is the deadline for the Federal Migration Service to rule on his request.A number of Latin American states say they are willing to offer the former intelligence systems analyst asylum, but he says he first needs Russian asylum in order to be able to travel, since the US has cancelled his passport.The US has charged Mr Snowden with leaking classified information.Mr Putin has refused to hand him to US authorities, but says he can only stay in Russia if he stops leaking secrets about US surveillance schemes."
16680	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23800031	Opinion	0	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"A year ago President Barack Obama gave a speech saying that if the Assad regime used chemical weapons, that would cross a red line and change his calculations.Has that red line now been crossed?The simple answer is that we don't yet know. While a White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, has said the US is ""appalled"" by ""horrifying"" reports from Syria, it doesn't seem Mr Obama is inclined to pronounce. Mr Earnest called on the Assad government to co-operate with the UN inspectors in full. But asked if reporters would hear from the president while he is on a bus tour about lowering the cost of higher education, he said, ""as we're weighing these domestic policy decisions, and as we're weighing these foreign policy decisions, the president puts the interest of the United States of America first.""And I think the fact that we are doing this bus tour is an indication that the president has his priorities straight"" I think that means no, the president does not want to talk about Syria.We've lost another opportunity to find out more about the administration's approach.The president's main military adviser has cancelled a planned news conference. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Martin Dempsey was due to answer questions at the foreign press centre.Perhaps he's had to call it off because he is busy planning what happens next in Syria.Perhaps not.He seemed pretty clear in a recent letter to a congressman that military action was undesirable.""Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides,"" Gen Dempsey said. ""It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favour. Today, they are not.''But President Obama clearly has a problem, and will be accused of inaction and dithering. Senator John McCain says Mr Obama blurred his own red lines earlier in the summer by not responding militarily to reports of attacks and so encouraged this latest incident. Sen McCain has just issued another statement: ""Our friends and enemies alike, both in the Middle East and across the world, are questioning whether America has the will and the capacity to do what it says. ""This dangerous development impacts the national security interests of the United States and our closest allies, and if we continue to sit by passively while Assad continues to use chemical weapons against his own people, we only provide encouragement to other brutal governments in their use of harsh measures against their own people. ""It is time for the United States to come to the assistance of the Syrian people.""Our own Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen is forthright that this is a critical moment and Iran will be watching careful to see if Mr Obama sticks to his threat of military action.But my strong feeling is that Mr Obama will not rush to action. His whole philosophy warns him against intervention in the Middle East. Domestic politics suggest Americans don't want to get involved.Getting embroiled would rather undermine his boast to be the president who brought the troops home.Then there is Gen Dempsey's point -  whom would the West support if it did take action, and would that further its overall interests?There may be a tipping point when moral outrage grows too strong. I would again caution that while that may be the mood in the UK and France, it is not here. The fears on Capitol Hill are not reflecting any sense of fury in America.I am certain there are plans for the discreet use of special forces to secure chemical weapons - but it is not clear what the trigger would be.In either case, Mr Obama is likely to insist on going the full UN route to gather the maximum possible support for any action - and that means waiting for the inspector's report on earlier incidents at the very least.I could be very wrong. The bombers could be in the air by this afternoon. But at the moment all Mr Obama plans for today is a talk about the cost of college education and ""a better deal for the middle classes"". I suspect his red line is very thick indeed. "

But in Friday's decision, Judge Pauley, of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, said ""the balance of equities and the public interest tilt firmly in favour of the Government's position"".In his 53-page ruling, he concluded: ""The right to be free from searches and seizures is fundamental, but not absolute.""He also noted: ""Every day, people voluntarily surrender personal and seemingly-private information to trans-national corporations, which exploit that data for profit. ""Few think twice about it, even though it is far more intrusive than bulk telephony metadata collection.""There is no evidence that the Government has used any of the bulk telephony metadata it collected for any purpose other than investigating and disrupting terrorist attacks.""Judge Pauley dismissed a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which told the BBC it would appeal.""We are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government's surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,"" said the civil rights organisation's deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer. The Obama administration, which has been on the defensive over the NSA revelations, welcomed the ruling.""We are pleased the court found the NSA's bulk telephony metadata collection program to be lawful,"" US Department of Justice spokesman Peter Carr told the BBC. Friday's ruling contradicts that on 16 December by Washington DC federal Judge Richard Leon, who said the NSA's surveillance was ""indiscriminate"" and an ""arbitrary invasion"".His 68-page decision backed a conservative activist's legal challenge on the merits of the Fourth Amendment, the clause in the US constitution barring unreasonable search and seizure by the government.Judge Leon suspended his ruling pending an appeal by the justice department, enabling the programme to continue for now.The NSA's snooping was leaked in June by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the agency. He fled to Russia, which granted him temporary asylum.Under the programme, America's electronic surveillance agency orders Verizon - one of the largest phone companies in the US - to hand over its metadata. This includes telephone numbers, times and dates of calls, calling card numbers and the serial numbers of phones, from millions of calls Verizon processes in which at least one party is in the US.The disclosures about the NSA's tracking of the communications by ordinary citizens as well as world leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, have dismayed civil rights activists and diplomats.In his end-of-year news conference, President Barack Obama hinted at a possible review of such snooping.In light of ""disclosures that have taken place"", there might be ""another way of skinning the cat"", he said earlier this week.Mr Obama is expected to announce next month whether he will act on a White House-appointed panel's advice to rein in the NSA.Among the task force's sweeping recommendations were that the spy agency should no longer store the data."
16726	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22274770	News	0	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"The Boston Marathon bombings suspects were quickly identified after investigators picked them out on CCTV footage. Does that mean Americans need to depend more on CCTV? Before they were Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, they were Black Hat and White Hat - two young faces in baseball caps, identified in grainy video footage as the prime suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings. From footage totalling hundreds of hours, investigators singled out the two men from a sea of marathon spectators, then followed their movements before and after they allegedly planted the two bombs.Those bombs would kill three people and wound more than 200, and Black Hat and White Hat were identified soon after their images were released. A day later, one was dead and the other in hospital.The crucial role that video footage played in this case has many Americans re-evaluating the role of CCTV and other surveillance tools in public spaces.While the US never embraced state-sponsored CCTV the way the UK has, it has nevertheless used surveillance as a national security and law-enforcement measure for years.""As the Boston bombing demonstrated, we are pretty well surveyed,"" says Ioannis Pavlidis, a professor of computational physiology at the University of Houston. That surveillance comes from a mix of private and public video cameras. Pavlidis, who worked in the private sector before turning to academia, says his projects were funded both ways. ""Part of our funding [into surveillance technology] was coming from a government agency who was interested in developing more of this kind of technology,"" he said. ""There was government interest, but at the same time there was private interest. And they coincided.""  For the most part, surveillance in the US has been led by private citizens. In the 1980s, video technology became cheap enough for individual businesses and citizens to install their own home security systems. By the '90s, that technology improved, leading to more digital footage with better quality.Private video footage has been used in public security, in cases such as the Rodney King beating, where a citizen caught police assaulting King on tape.Then came the attacks on the World Trade Center.""The thing that was really prompted by 9/11, on top of the general trend, is the introduction of the police-run cameras,"" says Jay Stanley, a police analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union.New York City boasts an impressive system designed not just to identify criminals after the fact but catch them in the act. ""All of these cameras feed back into a command centre that has very significant analysis capabilities on the back end, including real-time video analytics on the feed,"" says Dan Verton, editor of Homeland Security Today.""A bag left unattended would be automatically picked up by the system.""Police can then be deployed to troubled areas caught on film, allowing the force to do more with fewer officers. ""The mission is to have just a few officers being able to cover arguably the entire city wherever there's a camera, and redirect resources - police on the street - to areas where they are needed as opposed to having to blanket the street with officers,"" says Verton.New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has been outspoken in his support of surveillance cameras after the Boston bombing.""The people who complain about it, I would say, are a relatively small number of folks, because the genie is out of the bottle,"" Kelly said on MSNBC television. ""People realize that everywhere you go now, your picture is taken.""Indeed, most experts predict more surveillance in the years to come. ""That's the way of the world and where the technology is going,"" says Pavlidis, who cites the introduction of Google Glass. ""That will be one more surveillance mode in everyone's face. Social media, phones with cameras everywhere... there's no escape."" For privacy advocates like Stanley, however, there is a big difference between footage taken by private citizens and collected by the police in an emergency - and footage taken by police as part of a larger blanket campaign.When large-scale surveillance systems like the ones in New York are in place, he says, ""You can track individuals through time and space in a way that you can't when cameras are privately owned.""""You can collect [private] video quickly and easily if you need it, but it doesn't allow for the many abuses we fear if you turn all of our public spaces into centrally monitored ones,"" he says.Americans have proven resistant to such measures in the past. The use of drones as a surveillance measure has been roundly criticised, says Verton, with several planned programmes put on hold due to privacy fears. A recent poll showed that only 40% of Americans supported more cameras in the name of public safety - and only 12% wanted fewer cameras.And yet, more cameras are coming. Police officers in Denver, Phoenix, Chicago and other cities are relying more on surveillance video to help fight crime.For Ioannis Pavlidis, the technology is inevitable. But it is also neutral. ""It's the interpretation that makes the difference,"" he says. ""If democratic institutions work well and it is used judiciously, it can make us safer.""And if not? Privacy advocates are like Stanley are watching the watchers, hoping to stem back the tide. "
16731	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22839913	News	0	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"As it is revealed that former CIA technical worker Edward Snowden was the source of a series of leaks about US phone and internet surveillance, BBC News looks at some of the most significant information leaks in recent US history.Daniel Ellsberg was a military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers on the Vietnam war in 1971. The papers contained a secret study by the US Department of Defense of US involvement in Vietnam, showing that the government had knowledge, early on, that it was unlikely the war could be won, and that continuing it would merely lead to more casualties.The papers, the publication of which the Richard Nixon administration tried to stop, also revealed that the previous Lyndon Johnson administration had lied to Congress and the American people about the state of US involvement in Vietnam.Ellsberg sent portions of the report to the New York Times and other newspapers, which published the papers. Perhaps the most significant leak in US history came with the Watergate affair, and the supply of information by ""Deep Throat"" - later revealed to be FBI Deputy Director Mark Felt - to US reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post. The affair began in 1972 with the arrest of five people after a break-in at the Democrat National Committee HQ at the Watergate complex in Washington DC. The FBI connected the burglars to then President Nixon's re-election campaign, and a US senate committee was convened in 1973 to look into the circumstances of the robbery.The investigation by the two journalists revealed the full extent of the cover-up over the burglary which eventually led to Nixon's resignation in 1974. He stepped down rather than face impeachment and possible conviction over what he knew about the scandal.Mehdi Hashemi was an Iranian Shia cleric who in 1986 revealed the Iran-Contra affair in which the US, under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, sold arms illegally to Iran, with the help of Israel - despite an arms embargo and despite the fact that the US still supported Iraq in their war against Iran.The proceeds from the sales were used to help the Contra guerrillas fighting against the left-wing Sandinista revolutionary government in Nicaragua. Hashemi was executed in 1987 by the Iranian government.In 2003, journalist Robert Novak reported that Valerie Plame, the wife of prominent US diplomat Joseph Wilson, was in fact an undercover CIA agent, ending her career as a covert operative and leading to her resignation from the intelligence agency. The revelation sparked an investigation into how the information had made its way to Mr Novak.It was alleged by critics that senior White House aides had revealed the information as revenge against Ms Plame's husband for an article in which he debunked some of the justification for invading Iraq. White House aide Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby was subsequently found guilty of lying to the FBI by a grand jury and sentenced to 30 months in prison. He avoided actually going to jail as his sentence was commuted by President George W Bush.The allegations of abuse of detainees by US personnel at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison had been reported in the media at the beginning of 2004.But it was only when the photos of the ill-treatment of prisoners were supplied to the 60 Minutes current affairs programme and to investigative journalist Seymour Hersh that the abuse turned into a full-blown military scandal.The pictures showed naked prisoners being sexually humiliated and physically abused, and they made front-page news around the world. Eleven US soldiers were convicted of abusing prisoners. The scandal also highlighted the death of detainee Manadel al-Jamadi while being interrogated in US custody.As an intelligence analyst in the US army, Pte Bradley Manning was given access to a large amount of highly sensitive information, and is said to be behind the largest-ever leak of secret US government documents.He has been charged with several offences relating to stealing secret information, and his military trial has been under way since early June.Among the thousands of documents he is accused of handing over to Wikileaks is the video footage of an Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007. Pte Manning is said to have become frustrated with a military career that appeared to be stagnating, and downloaded thousands of classified documents from military servers.He has not denied his role in the leak, and faces up to life in prison if convicted of aiding the enemy.Earlier this year, Pte Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 charges against him related to the leaks, but not to the most serious charge."
16756	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22860239	News	0	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Squaring secrecy and accountability is not a new challenge. But the information that Edward Snowden has put into the public domain has raised serious questions about how open the state should be when it comes to surveillance.UK Foreign Secretary William Hague was forced to respond to allegations about a secret US spy programme Prism and the idea that Britain's GCHQ had used it to evade the law.  There is no doubt that GCHQ and America's National Security Agency enjoy a close, even intimate relationship.Information is shared as a matter of course in a way that does not happen between MI6 and the CIA, their counterparts in the human intelligence world.    Mr Hague tried to deal head on with concerns that this relationship had been used to swerve the law, but he did so without mentioning Prism or providing any real details, other than a blanket assurance that no laws had been broken and the system of accountability and oversight was strong. In other words, the public was asked to take his answers on trust. The foreign secretary said GCHQ operated under a legal framework.  When I asked one official to explain the legal framework they pointed me to two pieces of legislation - the Intelligence Services Act of 1994 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. But when I then started to ask how those two pieces of legislation (written in the early days of the internet age and long before Twitter and social media) applied to the different forms of modern communication, they said they could not go any further.In other words a legal framework exists, but how it is interpreted and applied by government remains secret.A similar issue exists in the US. There are sweeping powers under the Patriot Act and other pieces of legislation to gather information. But the way in which these are actually used is not public. So for instance when the government requests that telecoms company Verizon passes on huge volumes of call data on Americans, it is done through a secret order the public would not have known about without Edward Snowden's revelations.Governments and intelligence agencies say this has to be the case because too much information about what communications they are intercepting can tip off hostile actors such as terrorists who will then modify their behaviour. Some analysts already claim that is happening now. ""Jihadists are now actively sharing the reporting from the Washington Post and Guardian on Prism and recommending increased security measures in their operations,"" according to IntelCenter, which monitors jihadist communications. ""Among the recommended measures are ceasing the use of services listed in the Washington Post and Guardian reports, increased use of encryption tools and other operational security and tradecraft measures designed to significantly impede efforts by intelligence agencies to identify and monitor their activities.""Against the argument that the revelations damage national security, though, is the counter-argument that the public have a right to know what is done in their name by institutions they pay for and which are supposed to be accountable to them. Especially if those actions might involve surveillance of the domestic public itself.Members of the public do not have much idea what the state is able to do when it comes to surveillance. And the state in the past has wanted to keep it that way. But the downsides of this are now becoming more apparent. When the UK's Communications Data Bill emerged (known to critics as the ""snoopers' charter""), there was outrage in some quarters at the idea that the government was seeking information about people's phone calls and emails (although not the content). What many did not realise was that the government already had this power and used it extensively (half a million requests in 2011 were made for communications data) and the new bill was simply a way of expanding it into new forms of online communication and mandating that certain types of information was kept by companies. Similarly with Prism, some people were shocked that the state might be getting information from companies like Google and Microsoft and did not realise the state could already do this using court orders and warrants.The lack of information in the public domain may well have suited the state in the past, but the consequences now in terms of public trust could be serious, particularly when faced with a partial release of certain documents by a whistleblower keen to make his point. Governments in the UK and US will now have to look at whether the potential loss in capability by talking more about the activities of the state is nonetheless necessary in order to ensure public confidence - not just in the intelligence services, but the democratic system as a whole."
16774	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22812922	News	1	National Security	None	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	bbc.co.uk	"What is more troubling - governments that apparently disregard the privacy of our phone calls and online activity in the interests of national security, or governments that seem to put a higher priority on hi-tech inward investment than on protecting national security?In the past 24 hours, we have had alleged examples of both.There have been the reports in the Guardian that America's National Security Agency (NSA) has been secretly collecting customer phone records by the million from the telecoms giant Verizon and that it has direct access to the systems of Google, Microsoft, Apple, Skype, Facebook and YouTube, inter alia. (More on this from technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones.)Although many are outraged by what they see as a Big Brother impingement on citizens' right to privacy, for others it is a ""dog bites man"" story.We might loathe the idea, but we probably expect our security services to be eavesdropping and trampling on our civil liberties.Which is certainly not to downplay the significance of the NSA trawling through big data on all of us. There is an important question about whether fundamental freedoms are threatened (though no one seems to be suggesting that the US government is breaking the law).Perhaps the more surprising revelation on Thursday was by the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee, chaired by the former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind - because it revealed a mixture of complacency and extraordinary bungling by the British government over the purchasing of what the committee calls ""critical national infrastructure"" from a Chinese telecoms giant with ""perceived links to the Chinese state"".The infrastructure is BT's telecoms network, which was upgraded a few years ago as part of what was called the 21st Century Network Project. As part of this massive investment, BT bought transmission and access equipment, including routers, from China's Huawei, the world's second largest telecoms equipment company.As the committee says, it is the alleged links between Huawei and the Chinese state that are ""concerning"", as they ""generate suspicion as to whether Huawei's intentions are strictly commercial or are more political"".The committee also points out that ""20% of detected cyber attacks against UK interests demonstrate levels of sophistication which indicate they are more likely to be state-sponsored"" and ""China is suspected of being one of the main perpetrators of state-sponsored attacks"".Now the committee does not prove that Huawei has unhealthy links to the Chinese government. It points out that Huawei itself categorically denies direct links with China's government or military. But the committee regards these denials as surprising and can't verify them, so says that the British government should be vigilant, in case the links are real.What the committee argues is that the UK government has been anything but vigilant.  Although BT first told government officials in 2003 of Huawei's interest in the network contract, it wasn't till 2006 that civil servants informed ministers - and that was a year after the contract had been signed.As the committee says, ""there is no proper process of ensuring ministers are informed or consulted"" which is ""extraordinary given the seriousness of the issue"".And, the committee adds, there is ""a surprising lack of clarity as to which minister would be responsible for such decisions"". In the event, the Home Secretary was eventually informed about the security implications, although the body that provided technical advice reports to the foreign secretary and the formal powers seem to rest with the culture media and sport secretary. It is a muddle.Nor is it clear whether the government has the formal power to intervene, should it choose to do so.Anyway, what's done is done. The provision of equipment by Huawei has been made.And, what's more, it seems to have been a stepping stone to a significant £1.2bn research investment by Huawei in the UK - which, in the light of Britain's economic woes, has been welcomed by the government.But the question remains whether British national security is at risk as a consequence of the Huawei contributions to BT's network. Again, the committee is not reassured or reassuring - even though one of Britain's intelligence agencies, GCHQ, said that it has confidence in BT's management of the network. The committee said: ""The software that is embedded in telecommunications equipment consist of 'over a million lines of code' and GCHQ has been clear from the outset that 'it is just impossible to go through that much code and be absolutely confident you have found everything'.""In 2010, the UK government raised its security concerns with Huawei, which agreed to establish a Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, called the Cell - which is supposed to verify that there are no security risks when Huawei equipment is sold to British businesses.However, the committee has a number of concerns about the Cell, namely that it has taken too long to be fully functional, that it is run by Huawei and it is staffed by Huawei people, albeit vetted by the British security services.The committee says ""we remain concerned that a Huawei-run Cell is responsible for providing assurance about the security of Huawei products... A self-policing arrangement is highly unlikely to provide, or to be seen to be providing, the required levels of security assurance"".There is a wider issue here for the committee, which is that there have not existed robust arrangements in government to vet procurement by private sector companies of all manner of equipment relating to critical national infrastructure projects.As the committee puts it, ""where there is a privately owned company answerable to shareholders, many of whom may be based abroad, there will almost certainly be a tension with national security concerns"".Or to put it another way, the imperative for a British public company will be to buy the best equipment at the lowest price. But the cheapest equipment may be the kit that is most vulnerable to cynical exploitation by a foreign government or other overseas interests with malign intentions. So the committee calls on the government to set up an effective early warning system for when there is foreign investment in critical national infrastructure and a procedure for assessing the immediate and longer term risks, As it happens, the government claims it has now developed just such a set of processes. But the committee caustically concludes that ""whether these processes are sufficiently robust remains to be seen""."

A search of his computer yielded no evidence he had researched how to make the toxin, the agent said.In a news conference outside the courthouse on Tuesday, Mr Curtis thanked his family, friends, Jesus, Sen Wicker and Mr Obama.Referring to investigators' questions, he said: ""I thought they said rice and I said, 'I don't even eat rice.'Mr Curtis, a musician and Elvis impersonator who also said he was a certified reflexologist, added: ""I love my country and would never do anything to pose a threat to [Mr Obama] or any other US official.""I would like to get back to normal, which for me means being the best father that I could be for my children and entertaining through my music.""He was already well known to Sen Wicker because he had written to the Republican senator and other officials.Mr Curtis' lawyer Christi McCoy, whom Mr Curtis described as a blonde, blue-eyed angel sent by God, told reporters she believed the FBI agents who had arrested and charged her client had ""acted in good faith"".Ms McCoy said she was unsure what new information prosecutors had but that the plot to frame her client was ""very, very diabolical"".According to an FBI affidavit released on Thursday, the letters read: ""Maybe I have your attention now even if that means someone must die. To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.""The letters were signed: ""I am KC and I approve this message.""As the case against Mr Curtis appeared to collapse on Monday and Tuesday, another man in nearby Tupelo, Mississippi, told the Associated Press authorities were searching his home in connection with the ricin letters.Everett Dutschke said he was innocent, and the Associated Press reported agents from numerous law enforcement agencies had established a mobile crime lab near his home.""I don't know how much more of this I can take,"" Mr Dutschke said. No charges have been filed against him nor has he been arrested.The search team also combed through an area of woods and ditches about a block from Mr Dutschke's property.  Mr Dutschke said he and Mr Curtis had had a dispute, cutting off contact in 2010, after he threatened to sue Mr Curtis for saying he was a member of Mensa, a group for people with high IQs.""I'm a patriotic American,"" Mr Dutschke, who unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Mississippi House of Representative in 2007, said. ""I don't have any grudges against anybody. I did not send the letter."" Ricin, extracted from castor beans, is 1,000 times more toxic than cyanide.It can be fatal when inhaled, swallowed or injected, although it is possible to recover from exposure."

This is not mere obstructionism - many Republicans disagree with his whole view of terrorism.So Mr Obama is not just making excuses.

There are new rules too for Guantanamo. The ban on sending prisoners back to Yemen would be lifted and there would be a new effort to send prisoners to trial. If the right will not go along with this, the left will not be particularly happy either. A heckler challenged him in the hall and outside protesters told us that he was still at war.There is something very familiar about all this.Indeed, it goes straight to the heart of what, to me, is the central mystery of the president's second term.He calls on Congress to help, knowing full well they won't. This is not mere obstructionism - many Republicans disagree with his whole view of terrorism.So Mr Obama is not just making excuses. No-one should doubt his commitment to close Guantanamo Bay prison - it was one of the very first orders he signed on the day he took office.But he cannot point to any reason the old promise might now become a reality after five years of failure."

He said they came ""extremely close"" to a deal at the weekend in Geneva. But he said the rest of the world had to be certain that Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapons programme.Three days of negotiations ended without a breakthrough, but diplomats will meet again on 20 November.""We were very, very close actually, extremely close,"" Mr Kerry said.Speaking to the BBC's State Department correspondent Kim Ghattas, Mr Kerry reaffirmed that it would ""take time to work through differences"" between the US and Iran.""We haven't been speaking for 35 years,"" he said. ""We just talked more in 30 hours than we have in those prior 30 years.""Iran says that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only, but world powers suspect it is seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capability.Some reports said the latest talks failed because France had wanted to place tight restrictions on Iran's heavy-water plant being built in Arak.However, US diplomats have said the Iranian government's insistence on formal recognition of its ""right"" to enrich uranium had been the major obstacle.Mr Kerry said it was critical to be certain that Iran does not have a nuclear weapons programme, and that negotiations about enrichment were ongoing.""They have to see that there is a standard by which they might be able to do something - provided they meet certain standards in order to do it,"" he said.Iran backed out of a deal on the last day of talks, Mr Kerry added.""We had a unity on Saturday in a proposal put in front of the Iranians... but they felt they had to go back.""Representatives from Iran and the P5+1 - the US, UK, France, Russia and China plus Germany - will meet again in Geneva later this month to resume discussions.Meanwhile Iran has reached an agreement with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), over its nuclear programme. The deal opens the way for UN inspectors to gain better access to two key nuclear sites in Iran. Experts say progress between Iran and the IAEA is a vital parallel track to the talks between Iran and the major powers."

The sacking was not linked to the operation of the nuclear arsenal, which was safe, the officials insisted.On Wednesday the US Navy announced an admiral overseeing nuclear weapons forces had been sacked from the role.That was due to illegal gambling activities, officials said.Michael Carey is a two-star general in the 20th Air Force and was responsible for maintaining intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at three bases across the US - a total of 450 missiles.In a statement, the Air Force said Lt Gen James Kowalski, the commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, had made the decision.It read: ""Kowalski made his decision based on information from an Inspector General investigation into Carey's behaviour during a temporary duty assignment.""The allegations are not related to operational readiness or the inspection results of any 20th AF unit, nor do they involve sexual misconduct.""Gen Kowalski said: ""It's unfortunate that I've had to relieve an officer who's had an otherwise distinctive career spanning 35 years of commendable service.""Gen Kowalski oversees all Air Force nuclear weapons, including aircraft-delivered.The vice commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, Maj Gen Jack Weinstein, is temporarily replacing Gen Carey.The Air Force's biography of Gen Carey says he is in charge of 9,600 people at three operational wings and served in operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. It lists 13 major awards he has received.On Wednesday the Navy announced that Vice-Adm Tim Giardina had been removed as second-in-command of US Strategic Command.His job was to oversee the nation's nuclear weapons forces.He is accused of using counterfeit gambling chips in ""a significant monetary amount"" at an Iowa casino.Adm Giardina was demoted to a two-star admiral and is being reassigned pending outcome of an inquiry.The two sackings follow several other incidents affecting the US military's nuclear establishment.In August, a nuclear missile unit at Malstrom Air Force base in Montana failed a safety and security inspection, after which a senior security officer was relieved of duty. In May, it was reported that 17 officers in charge of maintaining nuclear missiles were sidelined over safety violations at Minot Air Force base in North Dakota."

16858	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22812922	News	0	National Security	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"What is more troubling - governments that apparently disregard the privacy of our phone calls and online activity in the interests of national security, or governments that seem to put a higher priority on hi-tech inward investment than on protecting national security?In the past 24 hours, we have had alleged examples of both.There have been the reports in the Guardian that America's National Security Agency (NSA) has been secretly collecting customer phone records by the million from the telecoms giant Verizon and that it has direct access to the systems of Google, Microsoft, Apple, Skype, Facebook and YouTube, inter alia. (More on this from technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones.)Although many are outraged by what they see as a Big Brother impingement on citizens' right to privacy, for others it is a ""dog bites man"" story.We might loathe the idea, but we probably expect our security services to be eavesdropping and trampling on our civil liberties.Which is certainly not to downplay the significance of the NSA trawling through big data on all of us. There is an important question about whether fundamental freedoms are threatened (though no one seems to be suggesting that the US government is breaking the law).Perhaps the more surprising revelation on Thursday was by the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee, chaired by the former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind - because it revealed a mixture of complacency and extraordinary bungling by the British government over the purchasing of what the committee calls ""critical national infrastructure"" from a Chinese telecoms giant with ""perceived links to the Chinese state"".The infrastructure is BT's telecoms network, which was upgraded a few years ago as part of what was called the 21st Century Network Project. As part of this massive investment, BT bought transmission and access equipment, including routers, from China's Huawei, the world's second largest telecoms equipment company.As the committee says, it is the alleged links between Huawei and the Chinese state that are ""concerning"", as they ""generate suspicion as to whether Huawei's intentions are strictly commercial or are more political"".The committee also points out that ""20% of detected cyber attacks against UK interests demonstrate levels of sophistication which indicate they are more likely to be state-sponsored"" and ""China is suspected of being one of the main perpetrators of state-sponsored attacks"".Now the committee does not prove that Huawei has unhealthy links to the Chinese government. It points out that Huawei itself categorically denies direct links with China's government or military. But the committee regards these denials as surprising and can't verify them, so says that the British government should be vigilant, in case the links are real.What the committee argues is that the UK government has been anything but vigilant.  Although BT first told government officials in 2003 of Huawei's interest in the network contract, it wasn't till 2006 that civil servants informed ministers - and that was a year after the contract had been signed.As the committee says, ""there is no proper process of ensuring ministers are informed or consulted"" which is ""extraordinary given the seriousness of the issue"".And, the committee adds, there is ""a surprising lack of clarity as to which minister would be responsible for such decisions"". In the event, the Home Secretary was eventually informed about the security implications, although the body that provided technical advice reports to the foreign secretary and the formal powers seem to rest with the culture media and sport secretary. It is a muddle.Nor is it clear whether the government has the formal power to intervene, should it choose to do so.Anyway, what's done is done. The provision of equipment by Huawei has been made.And, what's more, it seems to have been a stepping stone to a significant £1.2bn research investment by Huawei in the UK - which, in the light of Britain's economic woes, has been welcomed by the government.But the question remains whether British national security is at risk as a consequence of the Huawei contributions to BT's network. Again, the committee is not reassured or reassuring - even though one of Britain's intelligence agencies, GCHQ, said that it has confidence in BT's management of the network. The committee said: ""The software that is embedded in telecommunications equipment consist of 'over a million lines of code' and GCHQ has been clear from the outset that 'it is just impossible to go through that much code and be absolutely confident you have found everything'.""In 2010, the UK government raised its security concerns with Huawei, which agreed to establish a Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, called the Cell - which is supposed to verify that there are no security risks when Huawei equipment is sold to British businesses.However, the committee has a number of concerns about the Cell, namely that it has taken too long to be fully functional, that it is run by Huawei and it is staffed by Huawei people, albeit vetted by the British security services.The committee says ""we remain concerned that a Huawei-run Cell is responsible for providing assurance about the security of Huawei products... A self-policing arrangement is highly unlikely to provide, or to be seen to be providing, the required levels of security assurance"".There is a wider issue here for the committee, which is that there have not existed robust arrangements in government to vet procurement by private sector companies of all manner of equipment relating to critical national infrastructure projects.As the committee puts it, ""where there is a privately owned company answerable to shareholders, many of whom may be based abroad, there will almost certainly be a tension with national security concerns"".Or to put it another way, the imperative for a British public company will be to buy the best equipment at the lowest price. But the cheapest equipment may be the kit that is most vulnerable to cynical exploitation by a foreign government or other overseas interests with malign intentions. So the committee calls on the government to set up an effective early warning system for when there is foreign investment in critical national infrastructure and a procedure for assessing the immediate and longer term risks, As it happens, the government claims it has now developed just such a set of processes. But the committee caustically concludes that ""whether these processes are sufficiently robust remains to be seen""."

Some experts have also questioned Prism's real power. Digital forensics professor Peter Sommer told the BBC such access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"", with intelligence agencies able to tap into servers only to collect intelligence on a named target.According to leaked documents from GCHQ published by the Guardian, the UK was tapping fibre-optic cables carrying global communications and sharing the data with the NSA, its US counterpart.The documents showed that GCHQ was able to access 200 fibre-optic cables, giving it the ability to monitor up to 600 million communications every day.The information on internet and phone use was allegedly stored for up to 30 days in order for it to be sifted and analysed.GCHQ declined to comment on the claims but said its compliance with the law was ""scrupulous"".In June 2013,  Italian weekly L'Espresso published claims that GCHQ and the NSA had targeted three undersea cables with terminals in Italy, intercepting commercial and military data.The three cables in Sicily were named as SeaMeWe3, SeaMeWe4 and Flag Europe-Asia.Then in October, the Washington Post published claims the  NSA had hacked into fibre-optic cables and other network equipment connecting servers operated by Google and Yahoo.According to the leaks, the agency had obtained and sifted through a wide range of material, including ""metadata"" - which records who sent or received e-mails and when - text, audio and video, in an operation run in conjunction with British counterpart GCHQ.Google, which has a number of US and overseas data centres - consisting of thousands of miles of cables and computers stored in warehouses - has said it is now working to encrypt its cables.In June 2015, documents leaked by WikiLeaks purported to reveal US spying on three successive French presidents, as well as cabinet ministers and the French ambassador to the United States.Recordings of phone conversations by Francois Hollande, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Jacques Chirac were collected by the US National Security Agency (NSA), according to the documents, which date to 2012.The spying was ""unacceptable"", said Mr Hollande. The leak echoed similar revelations October 2013, when German media reported that the US had bugged German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone for more than a decade - and that the surveillance had only ended a few months earlier.Der Spiegel magazine, again quoting documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, claimed a listening unit was based inside the US embassy in Berlin.Investigative journalist Duncan Campbell explained in his blog how windowless areas on the outside of official buildings could be ""radio windows"". These external windows - made of a special material that does not conduct electricity - allow radio signals to pass through and reach collection and analysis equipment inside.According to security experts, standard mobile phone encryption systems can be vulnerable because their scrambling system is, in software terms, separate from the program used to create a message.It is possible for an eavesdropper to position themselves between the message-making software and the encryption system at either end of a conversation and see information before it is scrambled or after it is unscrambled.End-to-end encryption, now adopted by many, closes this gap by having the message-making software apply the scrambling directly. In addition, many of these systems run a closed network so messages never travel over the public internet and are only decrypted when they reach their intended recipient.How encryption systems workAs well as the bugging of the chancellor's phone, there are claims the NSA has monitored millions of telephone calls made by German and French citizens along with the emails and phone calls of the presidents of Mexico and Brazil.The Guardian later reported that the NSA had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by another US government official. Again, Edward Snowden was the source of the report.Der Spiegel magazine published claims in June that the NSA had also spied on European Union offices in the US and Europe.The magazine said it had seen documents leaked by Edward Snowden showing that the US had spied on EU internal computer networks in Washington and at the 27-member bloc's UN office in New York.The files allegedly suggested that the NSA had also conducted an eavesdropping operation in a building in Brussels, where the EU Council of Ministers and the European Council were located.Then, in July, the Guardian published claims in further leaked documents that a total of 38 embassies and missions had been ""targets"" of US spying operations.Countries targeted included France, Italy and Greece, as well as America's non-European allies such as Japan, South Korea and India, the paper said.EU embassies and missions in New York and Washington were also said to be under surveillance.The file is said to have detailed ""an extraordinary range"" of spying methods used to intercept messages. They included bugs, specialised antennae and wire taps.In January 2014, the Guardian newspaper and Channel 4 News reported that the NSA collected and stored almost 200 million text messages per day across the globe.NSA programmes codenamed Dishfire and Prefer extracted location information, contacts and financial data from SMS messages, including automated texts, such as roaming charge alerts, the newspaper said. According to The Guardian, this was an untargeted collection of people's messages, rather than being aimed at known surveillance targets. However, the NSA told the BBC the programme stored ""lawfully collected SMS data"" and any implication that collection was ""arbitrary and unconstrained is false""."

But the US Olympic Committee swiftly rejected the idea.Wednesday's hearing in Washington DC was one of the most searching on US government surveillance since the 9/11 attacks, correspondents say.Questioning became heated as congressmen said the scope of the snooping made it vulnerable to government abuse. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican, said: ""That's exactly what the American people are worried about.""That's what's infuriating the American people.

The US government faces mounting criticism over its surveillance operations after the leaks of US whistle-blower Edward Snowden.The court, whose rulings are normally kept secret, said the NSA may have violated US law for collecting as many as 56,000 emails on an annual basis between 2008 and 2011. But intelligence officials speaking to reporters anonymously say the scooping of emails was unintentional, blaming it on a technological problem. The NSA was unable to separate out emails between Americans with no direct connection to terrorism, so the agency was collecting tens of thousands of ""wholly domestic communications"" every year, the court documents said. In the ruling, Judge John Bates criticised the NSA over the breach of privacy, marking it as ""the third instance in less than three years in which the government has disclosed a substantial misrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection programme"".The court found that the data gathering violated the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution, prohibiting ""unreasonable searches and seizures"".The court's opinions, which are usually kept secret, were revealed by the government in response to a Freedom of Information request.

President Obama's opponents portray him as reluctant to use the word terrorism, overly sympathetic towards Islam, and insufficiently focused on the dangers of violent expressions of militant Islam. On the fringes, some accuse him of being a willing sympathiser.But, more generally, there is a feeling on the right that liberals are too willing to bend over backwards to disconnect the religion from the violence. This makes liberals hot under the collar. They see it as sheer bigotry, and point out that there is in fact no connection between millions of peaceful followers of a religion and a violent fringe. It is not a debate restricted to politicians. I, and I am sure other BBC colleagues, have received quite a lot of messages accusing us of, from one side, wilfully ignoring the role of radical Islam in this attack and, from the other side, saying we are fanning the flames of intolerance.Some of the attacks on Obama are crudely party political. He claimed that after the killing of Bin Laden and other major leaders al-Qaeda was ""degraded"" and by implication close to collapse. His enemies say that is untrue, and he has failed. They want to argue that the strong hand of al-Qaeda is behind every attack. As fundamental is the demand by leading Republicans that the suspect should be questioned as ""an enemy combatant"", even though he is an American citizen. The law allows this if a suspect is connected with al-Qaeda or similar organisations. In part, that argument is one that goes back much further than Islamist militancy  - to John Adams' defence of the British soldiers responsible for the Boston massacre, and all the way back to Magna Carta.   It is about whether hard-won rights for those accused of crimes can be abandoned when a government or a people feels under threat; if they are a civilised nicety, like good manners, that can be jettisoned in wartime, when the crime is too dreadful.  But it is also about how America looks at acts of terrorism. Many I spoke to in the last week regard attacks like the one at the Boston Marathon as a disgusting, horrific part of modern life. One man queuing to go into the Red Sox game on Saturday specifically told me the British had got used to living with a threat because of the IRA. He felt America was moving into that phase.Some think that is defeatist. For them America is at war. That forgotten phrase ""war on terror"" may come back into fashion.They argue the country has grown forgetful and flabby since 9/11, and that the country should lead a global campaign against an existential threat. President Obama will resist this. It is alien to his world view and distracts from his domestic agenda. But if the rest of the year turns into the rehashing of a debate that had largely been buried, he will have lost. "

The letter was detected during a routine inspection of mail and did not reach the US Capitol or Senator Wicker's office, a Senate leadership aide was quoted as saying.Senators were informed of the letter at a closed-door briefing by FBI Director Robert Mueller and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano about the Boston Marathon bombings, the aide added.The BBC's Jane Little in Washington says there is a heightened sense of alert in the capital after the attacks in Boston but there is no indication so far of any connection between the two incidents.It is also not clear why the letter was sent to Senator Wicker.The Senate's chief security office told Reuters: ""The exterior marking on the envelope in this case was not outwardly suspicious, but it was postmarked from Memphis, Tennessee.""All mail sent to members of Congress has been screened off-site since letters laced with anthrax were sent to Capitol Hill in 2001.In 2004, three Senate office buildings were shut after tests found ricin in letters that had been sent to the Senate majority leader's office.Ricin was the poison used for the infamous murder of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov in September 1978.He was waiting at a bus stop near Waterloo Bridge, London, when a stranger jabbed him in the leg with an umbrella. The umbrella injected a tiny ricin-filled pellet into Mr Markov's leg and he died three days later in hospital."

Under intense fire, it is said that Sgt Carter made another run for ammunition at great risk to his own life.According to the citation, the enemy then began firing rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), forcing the men to take refuge in a Humvee military vehicle. One RPG hit the vehicle and three servicemen, including Sgt Carter, were wounded by flying shrapnel.About half an hour into the battle, the soldiers decided to move location and join the other members of B Troop.The official narrative says that Sgt Carter, along with another soldier, Sgt Bradley Larson, volunteered to give covering fire to their comrades as they tried to move back. In the process, one member of the group was killed on the spot.Enemy fire intensified, resulting in several casualties, but it is said that Sgt Carter and Sgt Larson were able to kill two enemy fighters and wound another, prompting the attackers to retreat as they were about to overrun the position.As intense fighting continued, Sgt Carter killed four more attackers and helped prevent the south side of Combat Outpost Keating from being taken, the official narrative says.He is also said to have run through a hail of bullets to staunch the bleeding of a wounded soldier and carry him back to a safe place before returning to the fight. Sgt Carter, a cavalry scout with the 4th Infantry Division, was eventually able to bring his injured comrade to an aid station five hours after he was injured.Later in the day, under cover of darkness, the soldier was flown to a hospital where he died of his wounds.Sgt Carter's citation reads: ""Carter's remarkable acts of heroism and skill... exemplify what it means to be an American hero.""During the ceremony, Mr Obama said he wanted to honour Sgt Carter for the ""other battle he has fought"" - coping with PTSD.The president said: ""To any of troops or veterans who are watching and struggling: look at his man, look at this soldier… he's as tough as they come, and if he can find the courage and the strength to not only seek help but to speak out about it [PTSD], to take care of himself and stay strong, so can you."""

Mr Ho said he believed the official was acting on the orders of the Beijing government. He added that his client was given assurances that he would be allowed to leave freely.

Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.The Obama administration is desperate to get its hands on Mr Snowden before he reveals any more secrets, says the BBC's Paul Adams in Washington.Mr Snowden's leaks have led to revelations that the US is systematically seizing vast amounts of phone and web data under an NSA programme known as Prism.US officials have defended the practice of gathering telephone and internet data from private users around the world.They say Prism cannot be used to intentionally target any Americans or anyone in the US, and that it is supervised by judges.

The US DoD has about 600,000 smartphone users, said Col Pickart, about 470,000 of whom were using Blackberry handsets. The remainder was split between people using both Google Android and Apple phones in a series of trials to assess whether the devices could be used securely. According to one report on Federal News Radio, the approval of other handset makers is part of a US DoD plan to more than double the number of secure mobile devices used by its armed forces by 2014. Alongside this will be built a secure system to manage all these devices and their associated app stores. Commercial bids to provide this are currently being assessed.Blackberry handsets dominate within the US military because, before now, it was the only make to meet the Department's stringent security demands. Samsung phones were among the first to win approval because of work done on a hardened version of the Android operating system called Knox that also met those security requirements. Gadgets that run Apple's iOS 6 operating system as well as other Android phones are currently undergoing testing by the Defense Information Systems Agency and are expected to be approved by the end of the month.At the same time Samsung won approval, Blackberry 10 smartphones and Playbook tablets were also ruled safe to use on military networks.

It is not clear if security talks with the US, which he had suspended in protest over the office, will resume.Mr Karzai said the opening of the building contradicted earlier US security guarantees to his government.'Contradictory' The Taliban premises in Qatar opened on Tuesday, on the same day that Nato handed over security for the whole of Afghanistan to the Afghan government for the first time since the Taliban were ousted in 2001.Mr Karzai said in a statement on Wednesday that the office was ""totally contradictory to the guarantees that were made by the USA to Afghanistan"".His officials said he objected to a Taliban flag flying from the building, and also the name given to the building - the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.He said Afghan negotiators would stay away from the Qatar talks until ""foreign powers"" allowed the process to be run by Afghans - and also stay away from the latest round of security talks with the US on the American presence in Afghanistan after Nato leaves in 2014.But Mr Karzai's spokesman now says Mr Kerry has informed the Afghans that the Taliban office is removing the flag, and that the sign designating the building as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will be replaced by one saying Bureau of Peace Talks.The official added that President Karzai told Mr Kerry that once he saw Afghan and international networks showing evidence that these changes had been made, he would ""be ready to keep the wheels rolling"" on the process.

Materials provided by Mr Snowden to the media allege the US has conducted widespread and illegal surveillance of its citizens and other nations. The BBC looks at how the affair has developed since it broke in June.6 June 2013: Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald reports the US National Security Agency (NSA) is collecting the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers under a top secret court order granting the government unlimited authority to obtain communications data for a three-month period.7 June: The Guardian and Washington Post report the NSA is accessing the systems of US internet giants including Google and Facebook, and collecting data under a previously undisclosed surveillance programme called Prism. The programme allows officials to collect material including emails, live chats and search histories.8 June: US President Barack Obama says the government surveillance programmes strike ""the right balance"" between security and privacy and are closely overseen by Congress and the courts.9 June: Edward Snowden, 29, is named as the source of the intelligence leaks. Speaking from Hong Kong, he explains why he went public.10 June: Mr Snowden checks out of his Hong Kong hotel and his whereabouts remain unknown as it is rumoured the US is pursuing a criminal investigation against him.11 June: The EU demands US assurances that Europeans' rights are not being infringed by the newly-revealed surveillance programmes. Mr Snowden's employer, defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, says it has fired the infrastructure analyst for violating its ethics code.12 June: Mr Snowden tells the South China Morning Post from a secret location in Hong Kong that he will fight any attempt to extradite him. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives John Boehner describes him as a traitor. The UK assures US and British citizens their intelligence agencies are operating within the law.13 June: Mr Snowden says the US government has been hacking computers in mainland China and Hong Kong for years.

It comes after recent leaks detailed the extent of surveillance programmes. ""We understand that governments have a duty to protect their citizens. But this summer's revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide,"" the group said in an open letter published on its website.""The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favour of the state and away from the rights of the individual - rights that are enshrined in our Constitution. ""This undermines the freedoms we all cherish. It's time for a change,"" it added.The move by the eight firms comes after whistle-blower Edward Snowden leaked information about surveillance carried out by the US government. Mr Snowden, an ex-US intelligence contractor, leaked documents to the media highlighting the various methods used by agencies to gather information.The leaks have pointed to agencies collecting phone records, tapping fibre-optic cables that carry global communications and hacking networks.Members of the group said the revelations indicated that the extent of surveillance needed to be controlled. ""Reports about government surveillance have shown there is a real need for greater disclosure and new limits on how governments collect information,"" said Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, the world's biggest social networking firm.""The US government should take this opportunity to lead this reform effort and make things right.""The scandal first came to light in June this year after the UK's Guardian newspaper published the first leaks by Mr Snowden.Since then, there have been concerns over how much user data firms have been asked to share with the agencies. In an attempt to allay such fears over data security, companies have called for permission to publish details of data requests. ""Governments should allow companies to publish the number and nature of government demands for user information,"" they state.""In addition, governments should also promptly disclose this data publicly.""Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google and Facebook have all confirmed they have complied with orders to hand over data relating to ""national security matters"" to the US authorities, but have been forbidden from saying exactly how many requests they had received or details about their scope.Larry Page, chief executive of Google, said that security of users data was ""critical"" for firms, but added that the same had been ""undermined by the apparent wholesale collection of data, in secret and without independent oversight, by many governments around the world"".

But he's pretty clear what it might be and what it won't be. Speaking to PBS Newshour, he said any action would be ""tailored"", ""limited"" and intended to send a signal to the Syrian government to discourage them from using chemical weapons again.But he also said he had decided against ""direct military engagement"", adding: ""I have no interest in any kind of open-ended conflict in Syria"" and spoke of ""not getting drawn into a long conflict, not a repetition of Iraq"".There is no doubt that is not just Mr Obama's view - it is a heartfelt plea by a military involved in 10 years of war. But it raises a lot of questions. What action sends a message to Bashar al-Assad, but does not loosen his grip on power? A couple of cruise missiles? Three days of air attacks? The destruction of air bases?  The most obvious response, on the chemical weapons bases themselves, has apparently been ruled out by most experts because it would simply disperse the deadly agents far and wide.It is obvious that when President George W Bush declared war on Afghanistan he didn't expect troops to still be there more than a decade later. Yet it happened. The slope to war is very slippery. Of course in one sense it is relatively easy for Mr Obama not to get dragged in. He could order one attack and refuse to do any more. But that could leave him looking weak, his action a hollow symbol. There could be retaliation. Mr Assad could be more determined than before. By declaring that he will avoid a long conflict Mr Obama could be unintentionally signalling to him that this is a one-off punishment, not a response that could escalate to match the regime's actions.One source, deeply involved, told me an important part of the discussions was exactly that: ""Something needs to be done, but what is the impact? What is a surgical strike for? If Assad does it again what do you do? What is the ultimate action? ""Big question mark.""It is indeed."

""I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations and I have not provided false information to this or any other committee.""Oversight committee chairman Darrell Issa, a Republican, has accused Ms Lerner of providing ""false or misleading"" information to the IRS about its practices.But when Mr Issa asked her to reconsider her decision to invoke the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, which protects against self-incrimination, Ms Lerner said, ""I will not answer any questions or testify about the subject matter of this committee's meeting.""Ms Lerner, whose office processes applications for tax-exempt status, was excused nine minutes after she began speaking.Mr Issa said he might consider recalling her if she could be granted immunity.Even before the matter came to light this month, congressmen had asked tax officials whether conservative groups were being treated unfairly, after lawmakers received complaints from constituents.But IRS officials denied any targeting was going on.Two top IRS officials have tendered their resignations over the matter and the FBI has launched a criminal probe.It has also emerged that White House chief of staff Denis McDonough was aware the US treasury department had launched an inquiry into the matter, but did not inform the president.In 2010-12, the IRS says it was inundated with new applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status, after the US Supreme Court loosened restrictions on political spending by organisations unaffiliated with candidates' campaignsUnder US tax law, ""social welfare"" groups may apply for tax-exempt status but cannot engage primarily in political activity.Staff members at an IRS office in Cincinnati, Ohio are understood to have compiled a list that included keywords such as ""Tea Party"" and ""patriot"" to select organisations for extra scrutiny from the large number of applications.The Tea Party is a loosely organised movement of anti-tax conservatives, and in the American political lexicon ""patriot"" can indicate a conservative orientation.The US treasury department's inspector general for tax matters said his investigation found no evidence the IRS had acted under political pressure from the White House, and officials have said the practice was an effort to handle the heavy workload."

Currently the Senate is controlled by the Democrats, while the Republicans control the House of Representatives.This legislative conflict has led to the current gridlock and subsequent partial shutdown of government, the first for 17 years.With the US political system seemingly in legislative paralysis, is American politics broken? Experts give their views below.The problem with American politics is that Tea Party activists have taken over the Republican Party. They come from small, rural districts and now are demanding that House Speaker John Boehner practises extremist politics. Boehner could end this stalemate today by allowing a continuing resolution to go to the floor for a vote without repealing Obamacare. It would pass and this crisis would be resolved. However, conservatives have warned that if Mr Boehner allows a floor vote without their support, they will depose him and elect another Speaker. This crisis is not so much a governability problem as a war within the Republican Party. It won't be resolved until prominent Republicans demand that the House takes action.""Broken"" is a very strong word. In one way American politics is working exactly how the founding fathers intended when they created the separation of powers.But they always assumed that at times of need, the ""energy"" of government would overcome the separation of government. They never anticipated that there would be this polarisation of politics.We're now in a situation where the intentions of the founders are being overcome by the nature of the political parties and the lack of middle ground between them, so you could say American politics is broken.I don't think it's irreparable but you now have to have a supermajority [60 out of 100] in the Senate [to pass legislation], and the Republicans showed in 2009-10 how the lack of 60 Democrats in the Senate could be exploited to tie up the work of the upper house. I don't imagine the Democrats will lie down and play dead even were the Republicans to become the single party of government in 2016.Charges that America is broken are a longstanding trope of the US Christian Right. Such charges harken back to a fictitious 1950s shared cultural values. Employing this measure, changes of the last 60 years indicate that American is ""broken"". But that fictitious narrative fails to include those on the socio-economic margins eg women, African-Americans, Latinos, and LGBTs, who are now moving at pace into the mainstream. For these benefactors of change, America is not broken - it is increasingly realising its potential as a representative democracy based on justice and equality. Change has left those previously occupying places of privilege outraged. With more states allowing same-sex marriage, the working class accessing affordable healthcare, immigration reform afoot and a black man in the White House, the Tea Party has had enough. This government shutdown is not the culmination of their outrage, it is only a beginning.There's no doubt that the federal budget process is broken, and there is wide acceptance of that. The federal budget system doesn't work. Congress hasn't passed a regular budget in many years now, [instead] they've appropriated money based on continuing resolutions and other special procedures.The instability caused by the Obamacare health law is because it was passed in 2010 on a wholly partisan basis. Not a single Republican voted for the law in either the House or the Senate.In recent decades the most enduring federal legislation has been bipartisan. So I would blame President Obama for ramming through legislation that only his party supported.The battle over Obamacare is unique and has been poisoned, initially by President Obama. That said, it used to be that both parties had both liberal and conservatives. But over the last few decades the Republican Party has become more conservative and the Democratic Party has moved far to the left.In the UK, where you have a parliamentary system, if the prime minister's party loses a floor vote in parliament you have to have a new election - it's a vote of no confidence.In the US, we have a situation where the administration's proposed policies can be blockaded by a minority in either House of Congress - and that can bring the government to a standstill.The unusual thing in this case is that this radical faction, the Tea Party, have chosen to use the national budget [and] are demanding that the healthcare programme be modified or abandoned in return for funding government.It's a form of political extortion. It is broadly unacceptable to the American people, and the Tea Party will be hurt by it.The system is stretched, the system is challenged. But the system itself is not broken. Eventually public pressure will come to play on the Republicans and will force them to accept some compromise solution. Both sides must find a face-saving way through this conundrum.The House Speaker, Mr Boehner, has chosen not to confront the radical minority in his party, but rather to accommodate them.A stronger or more principled House leader would've said ""enough is enough"". But he hasn't done that. So another reason the system is not broken is because it is a personality in a critical position who is not doing his job properly.I don't think the system is broken, the system works. The problem right now is that the two political parties, who are fairly evenly matched in political support across the country, are having a crucial argument about the direction of the country.This is not unusual; there have been prior times in American history where there have been substantive and critical fights over different issues. We have an out of control federal budget, we have a gigantic deficit, and we're having a critical debate over what to do about those problems. I don't think there is a serious structural problem in the US political system, we've just come to a fork in the road about the direction that the country should move in. The system is handling it, we're just at loggerheads over what to do about it - in particular where we should go with the growth and size of the federal government. The [shutdown] goes to the basic structural problem in the US constitution. It's a separated system with separate institutions sharing in power, so that means that each of the major institutions of national government can exercise a veto against any decision they don't like - and that's exactly what's happening.Historically compromise has usually been available. [But] now you have an extremist group in the Republican Party holding the system to ransom.What you have seen over the last 20 years in Congress is a kind of procedural arms race, and this is the latest example of it - one party, and it's usually the Republicans, finding some procedural device, [and] attaching this rider to a resolution to throw a spanner in the works and stop the government working.I wouldn't say it's at breaking point but we've seen an escalation of the use of veto points. The ""arms race"" has been escalating and the parties have become increasingly polarised."

Democratic President Barack Obama has denounced the practice as unacceptable and Attorney General Eric Holder has said the FBI has launched a criminal inquiry.The hearing in the House ways and means committee came at the end of a difficult week for the White House, which has also faced new questions about a deadly assault on the US diplomatic mission in Libya and fended off attacks on the seizure of reporters' phone records. Friday's was the first in a series of congressional hearings on the tax affair - correspondents say Republicans hope to use it to discredit Mr Obama just months into his second term.""I want to apologise on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service for the mistakes that we made and the poor service we provided,"" Mr Miller told the panel.""Partisanship - and even the perception of partisanship - has no place at the Internal Revenue Service.""J Russell George, the treasury department inspector general for tax administration, told the committee that he had not seen evidence IRS officials were under political pressure to target conservative groups.But leading Republicans on the committee said the misconduct was not a mere management lapse.""The reality is this is not a personnel problem. This is a problem of the IRS being too large, too powerful, too intrusive and too abusive of honest, hardworking taxpayers,"" House ways and means committee chairman Dave Camp said at the opening of Friday's hearing.The Michigan Republican said the affair appeared to be just one case of a ""culture of cover-ups"" in the IRS.""It seems like the truth is hidden from the American people just long enough to make it through an election,"" Mr Camp said.While Mr Obama's Democrats have been reluctant to defend the tax agency, the senior Democrat on the committee, Sander Levin, warned his colleagues not to allow legitimate inquiries into problems at the IRS to devolve into a political brawl.For his part, Mr Obama attempted to refocus on the economy with a trip to Baltimore, Maryland in which he said lawmakers should spend their time on helping people get back to work. ""Our focus cannot drift,"" Mr Obama said. The IRS has acknowledged that beginning in 2010, staff in a Cincinnati, Ohio, branch office delayed the filings for tax-exempt status of groups that had words such as ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their names or that otherwise indicated their conservative orientation.Mr Miller testified on Friday that while the practice of maintaining a list of keywords that flagged conservative groups for extra review was ""intolerable"", it was a mistake and had merely been put together by civil servants trying to work more efficiently. The practice of extra screening began in response to a Supreme Court ruling that loosened campaign finance rules, Mr Miller said. During questions, the outgoing IRS head said the agents did not use search words associated with liberal causes - like ""progress"" or ""organising"".The number of applications from so-called ""social welfare"" groups seeking tax-exempt status nearly doubled from 2009-2012 to 3,300 a year, Mr George's report found. Under US tax law, the groups were entitled to a tax exemption so long as campaigning was not their ""primary activity"". Amid reports some of the groups were violating that threshold, the IRS deemed some level of review appropriate.The list of watch words was assembled by a ""determinations unit"" based in Cincinnati, and there seemed to be little or no supervisory review of the list, inspector general Mr George told the committee.""The determinations unit requested unnecessary information because of a lack of managerial review, at all levels,"" Mr Russell said.""We concluded that determinations unit specialists lacked knowledge of what activities are allowed.""The IRS is an independent agency within the treasury department.Mr George's investigation, revealed this week, found that 296 groups had been subjected to additional auditing. In those cases the IRS may have asked for lists of donors, the groups' positions on a range of issues, and whether the groups' senior members intended to run for public office.Many of the applicants faced considerable delays in obtaining tax-exempt status, but none were turned down, he added.In addition to Mr Miller, Joseph Grant, commissioner of the IRS's tax-exempt and government-entities division, said on Thursday that he was stepping down within a month."

They also have a difference of opinion on one particular phrase.""Exceptional."" It was one word toward the end of President Barack Obama's address to the American people on Tuesday night, used to rally support for a possible military strike in Syria.""When, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act,"" said Obama. ""That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional.""Two days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin spent a paragraph in his New York Times opinion piece responding to Obama's use of the word: ""I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States' policy is 'what makes America different. It's what makes us exceptional.' ""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.""American commentators and politicians were quick to respond. ""History teaches us that a strong and engaged America is a source of good in the world,"" wrote Republican Senator Marco Rubio in the National Review. ""No nation has liberated more people or done more to raise living standards around the world through trade and charity than the United States. We remain a beacon of hope for people around the world."" ""America is not exceptional because it has long attempted to be a force for good in the world, it attempts to be a force for good because it is exceptional,"" Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal. But what is ""American exceptionalism"", and where did it come from? It depends on whom you ask. The Washington Post's Dana Milbank writes that ""exceptional"" doesn't mean better, it just means different: ""Americans aren't better than others, but our American experience is unique - exceptional - and it has created the world's most powerful economy and military, which, more often than not, has been used for good in the world.""Others have looked into the history books for the roots of the term, and the results may be surprising to Putin. Terrence McCoy of the Atlantic, in a March 2012 article, notes that the term was first used by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to describe unco-operative American communists. Citing author Ted Morgan's biography of Jay Lovestone, A Covert Life, McCoy writes: ""In 1929, Communist leader Jay Lovestone informed Stalin in Moscow that the American proletariat wasn't interested in revolution. Stalin responded by demanding that he end this 'heresy of American exceptionalism'.""Joshua Micah Marshall, editor of the website Talkingpointsmemo, acknowledges the Soviet origins of the term, but credits its spread with post-World War II American historians such as Louis Hartz, Daniel Boorstin and Richard Hofstadter, who were trying to understand America's recent economic and social successes: ""How and why was it able to avoid all the bloodletting and conflict which beset Europe (obviously this was a particularly glaring contrast in the late 40s and early 50s). The key seemed to come down to the absence, or relative absence, of class conflict.""Marshall notes: ""In this sense, these 1950s academic intellectuals agreed with those Communists having their obscure discussion in the 1920s. They just saw as a good thing what the Communists saw as a bad thing… That's what 'exceptionalism' meant - that the US got a pass on certain laws of history that applied to the rest of the world - as though a particular person got a pass on insecurity and sadness.""The term fell into disuse in the ensuing decades, but the concept returned to prominence with the rise of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. His references to America as a ""shining city on a hill"" - a nod to John Winthrop and the early Puritan settlers of Massachusetts - embraced the idea of America as a unique example of freedom and hope.Now, ""American exceptionalism"" has become a regular talking point among conservative politicians and commentators, a product of American patriotism, faith in God and the wisdom of the Founding Fathers. They howled when Obama said in a 2009 interview: ""I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.""  (In the full quote, Obama endorsed American exceptionalism, but in his opponents' eyes, the damage was done.)""What makes American exceptionalism different is that we are the only people I know of in history to say power comes directly from God to each one of you,"" Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told a South Carolina audience in 2011. With Obama's recent use of the word, and Mr Putin's stern rebuke, ""American exceptionalism"" - whatever it means - is here to stay.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook"

Correspondents say the laws are in part an effort to close the state's only abortion clinic, in the town of Fargo.The measures, which take effect on 1 August, make no exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the mother.Gov Dalrymple said: ""Although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question, this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v Wade.""In that landmark 1973 case, the US Supreme Court ruled abortion was legal until the foetus could survive outside the womb.The governor said that the court has allowed states to adopt stricter abortion measures, and has never before considered a measure like this one - leaving the constitutionality of the bills an ""open question"".Gov Dalrymple added the state should put money aside to pay for legal challenges to the laws.Under the North Dakota bills, women would not be prosecuted for having an abortion after a foetal heartbeat could be detected, but doctors could face five years in prison and a $5,000 (£3,300) penalty.Pro-choice advocates vowed to challenge the legislation.Sarah Stoesz, president of Planned Parenthood, said: ""This sweeping package of bills will not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.""But as a result of North Dakota's leaders' disregard for women's health, the state will endure months and years of drawn-out litigation costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.""In addition, North Dakota's Republican-dominated legislature last week set up a voter referendum for November 2014 which seeks to amend the state constitution to define life as beginning at conception.The amendment would grant full legal protection to embryos and foetuses and could outlaw some forms of birth control, stem-cell research and possibly in vitro fertilisation. Earlier in March, the Republican-controlled legislature in the state of Arkansas enacted tough abortion laws, banning the procedure after 12 weeks of pregnancy.Scientists generally agree that foetuses become ""viable"" or able to survive outside the womb at about 22-24 weeks."
17358	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22098224	other	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Animal rights activists in the US have told the BBC that so-called ""ag-gag"" laws could be copied in other countries including the UK.The laws are designed to limit undercover investigations on factory farms by campaigning groups.Around a dozen states have passed or are proposing legislation banning these activities. Supporters say they are designed to protect the privacy of farmers and agriculture businesses. Large, intensive factory farms have shown significant growth in the US over the past 20 years. Between 2002 and 2007 the total number of livestock on the biggest of these farms grew by more than 20%.But concerns over the conditions in which cattle, pigs and poultry are raised and slaughtered have prompted many animal welfare groups to mount undercover investigations. Because there is no single US federal law that protects animals, welfare investigators have played a significant role in bringing public attention to inhumane practices. In 2008, a distressing video of staggering cattle secretly recorded at a California slaughter plant led to the biggest meat recall in US history. Last year a recording from a pig farm in Wyoming was used to secure convictions against a number of workers for cruelty.However in Utah and Iowa the undercover recording of videos like these is now illegal.  Several other states including Indiana, Arkansas and Pennsylvania are considering similar laws. Other provisions in these bills require prospective farm employees to disclose any link to animal welfare groups.These regulations are already having an impact, says Cody Carlson, a former investigator who has documented inhumane activities on farms in several US states. ""When I applied for a job in Iowa in 2009 and they asked me if I had any affiliations to animal protection groups, I would have had to say yes, I wouldn't have gotten the job and I wouldn't have been able to expose the conditions that raised questions about the egg industry there,"" he told BBC News. ""It is exactly what these industries want - they want to shut down the conversation that's going on about what is happening with the animals we raise for our food.""In California an animal welfare bill, doesn't appear to be as restrictive as many of the others under consideration. It is supported by the California Cattlemen's Association and it requires anyone who records video or other evidence of cruelty to turn it over to the authorities within 48 hours. But campaigners are highly sceptical, arguing that requiring the handover of material so quickly would undermine an investigation and prevent the collection of wider evidence of inhumane behaviour.""They've done a clever twist on it,"" Charity Kenyon from the Slow Food Movement told BBC News. ""They want to make it look like their concern is animal abuse, but it is all part of the same deal which is to prevent ongoing investigations of the type that ended in the largest recall of beef in the history of the US,"" she said.Welfare groups say that the American Legislative Exchange Council is the moving force behind these laws. This group supports conservative causes and promotes legislation to limit the role of government.  They have described animal rights campaigners as terrorists. They support the laws because they believe investigators are threatening the privacy rights of individuals and businesses.  However they declined to be interviewed by the BBC for this article. While the ""ag-gag"" laws are primarily designed to have impact within the US, many feel they will also have an impact outside the country.""As factory farming spreads like a plague around the world,"" said Matt Rice from Mercy for Animals,  ""international agribusiness interests will certainly attempt to import America's ag-gag laws along with its tainted meat and animal abuse. ""The UK and other nations should be on high alert.""In the UK, Peta the animal welfare charity said these US laws were ""shameful"". ""Such atrocious public policy sets a dangerous precedent for UK industry, as does the introduction of US-style mega-farms,"" said Peta's Ben Williamson. ""Legislators should instead be passing laws to require cameras in all abattoirs and factory farms in order to catch animal abusers,"" he said.Others are concerned that if these laws are passed, consumers around the world will no longer be able to trust that exports of US agricultural products are produced without cruelty.""A significant amount of meat, dairy and eggs produced on US factory farms goes to foreign countries,"" Matt Dominquez, from the Humane Society of the US told BBC News. ""Anyone who consumes animal agricultural products imported from the US should be scared. This prevents them from knowing what's going on - it blocks an entire industry from transparency.""Follow Matt on Twitter."

The court said that acid should be sold only to people who show a valid identity card.Buyers will also have explain why they need the chemical and sales will have to be reported to the police. There will also be more compensation for victims. There are an estimated 1,000 acid attacks a year in India. The victims, who have to live with terrible disfigurements, are mainly women and are often targeted by jealous partners, correspondents say. In Thursday's ruling, the Supreme Court ordered that acid should be not be sold to anyone under the age of 18. It also ruled that there should be no bail allowed for the offence. In addition, victims of acid attacks will be entitled to more financial help from state governments - the court said compensation of at least 300,000 rupees (£3,320; $5,000) must be paid to help rehabilitate them after their ordeal. The Indian government has been accused of being too slow to deal with the issue of acid attacks. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court strongly criticised the government for failing to formulate a policy to reduce such attacks.It says it wants to see these new measures enforced within the next three months. Campaigners hope it will lead to a fall in the number of crimes committed, as happened in Bangladesh when it bought in restrictions on acid sales. Acid attacks are a problem throughout South Asia, with cases also reported in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.Campaigners say women who reject boyfriends, husbands or employers are often targeted by men using easily available and cheap chemicals. Earlier this year, India introduced tough new legislation to counter violence against women.The legislation contains harsher penalties for rapists, including the death penalty, and up to 10 years in jail for acid attacks.

Activists banged drums, held banners and chanted anti-fracking messages. Police guarded the secured site and a helicopter hovered overhead.Campaigners chanted: ""This is what democracy looks like,"" and also shouted: ""There are many, many more of us than you.""After the protesters began to disperse from the Cuadrilla site on Sunday evening, Sussex Police thanked them for their conduct.Supt Lawrence Hobbs said there had been a ""carnival atmosphere"" among the demonstrators during the afternoon.""They have shown that upwards of a thousand people can make their point passionately, but peacefully, and I sincerely hope that it has set the tone for the next few days,"" he said.He said three people had been arrested over the weekend in ""isolated incidents"" that were ""away from the day's events"". Two men were arrested in relation to public order offences allegedly committed last week. One, a 23-year-old, was charged, while the other was bailed until next month. A woman was also arrested, on suspicion of trespassing on the railway at Balcombe station.Speaking about its plans for Monday, the No Dash for Gas group said more than 800 people were forming ""civil disobedience plans"", details of which remained ""top secret"".A spokeswoman said protesters had filled out ""matchmaking"" forms to put people into groups. Campaigners used the forms to indicate to what extent they were willing to risk arrest, how mobile they were, and what activities they were most interested in.Listed activities included climbing things, standing one's ground, getting through or over fences, looking after people, providing entertainment, or documenting action, she said.BBC reporter Roz Upton said: ""Protesters at the camp have been doing tripod training. ""They have got tripods made out of three pieces of metal that allow them to get to a height, and they climb to the top of that.""The campaigners fear the oil drilling could lead to fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - a technique designed to recover gas and oil from shale rock.There are concerns the process contaminates groundwater and causes earth tremors, but supporters say fracking is safe if done properly.Cuadrilla is drilling a 3,000ft (900m) vertical well and a 2,500ft (750m) horizontal bore, at a site south of Balcombe. The firm said fracking for shale gas there would require fresh permission.Camp organisers said about 600 people were at the site on Sunday afternoon, and the camp kitchen had fed about 800 people on Saturday night.Last week, Balcombe Parish Council issued an open letter warning campaigners not to carry out illegal activity. The council said direct action was likely to include an attempt to enter the site.Cuadrilla suspended drilling on Friday but said work would resume at the site as soon as it was safe.On Friday, The BBC's John Moylan said the company had made the well safe, secured the site with a reinforced fence and gone into ""lockdown mode"".Sussex Police has endorsed the energy firm's decision to stop drilling.The force said: ""Given the health and safety risks associated with it being an industrial site if access is gained by trespassers, we believe their decision to be a wise one.""Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said: ""I think the threat is to access the site and to potentially damage equipment on the site.""He said the firm had concerns for the safety of its workers and anyone who went on the site.""We strongly request people not to do that because it's not safe to do it."""
17472	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25227501	News	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"President Barack Obama has called for action to remedy what he described as profound income inequality and a lack of social mobility in the US.He called for a rise in the minimum wage and for stronger collective bargaining laws, among other measures.He also said his embattled healthcare overhaul would ease one part of American families' financial struggle.Mr Obama's approval ratings have plummeted in recent weeks amid that law's botched rollout.While acknowledging the political difficulty of passing any such government action with a divided and acrimonious Congress, Mr Obama's speech in Washington DC gave a broad overview of economic themes for the rest of his term, analysts say.The US president said the country had accepted higher levels of economic inequality than other developed nations because Americans ""were convinced that America is a place where even if you're born with nothing, with a little hard work you can improve your own situation over time"".But Mr Obama, a Democrat, said rising income inequality had been accompanied in recent decades by diminishing opportunities for social mobility. He faulted tax cuts for wealthy Americans, declining investment in schools and infrastructure, and laws that have weakened labour unions, compounded by broad structural changes in the global economy.""The combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream, our way of life, and what we stand for around the globe,"" he said.""The idea that so many children are born into poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth is heartbreaking enough. The idea that a child may never be able to escape that poverty because she lacks a decent education or healthcare, or a community that views her future as their own, that should offend all of us and it should compel us to action.""The US president argued rising inequality was eroding trust in institutions and reducing civic and community involvement. And he said the ""growing gap"" was as much about class as it was about race.To remedy the growing income inequality, Mr Obama called for a rise in the national minimum wage, currently $7.25 (£4.43) - as low as it was during the administration of President Harry Truman in the 1950s in terms of spending power, Mr Obama said.Several states and cities have raised their own minimum wages, most recently New Jersey and Washington DC.A proposal is currently being floated in the Senate to increase the national minimum wage to $10.10 in three steps and tie further increases to changes in the cost of living, but its path even through the Democratic-controlled Senate is unclear.He also suggested targeted programmes for cities and regions hardest hit by the 2008 recession and other sea changes in the US economy, universal preschool education for young children, a shoring-up of the US pension and social safety net schemes, and laws to make it easier for workers to organise into labour unions.Mr Obama also pressed Congress to extend unemployment benefits to 1.3 million people who have been unemployed long-term, set to expire toward the end of December.Additional weeks of benefits have been approved since 2009, but on Tuesday, a senior Republican congressman, Representative Tom Cole, said his party opposed an extension.Also, Mr Obama said US government policy must remain relentlessly focused on strengthening the economy.""It may be true that in today's economy, growth alone does not guarantee higher wages and incomes,"" he said.

""They go a critical step further, by imposing dangerous conditions on prostitution; they prevent people engaged in a risky - but legal - activity from taking steps to protect themselves from the risks.""Under the ruling, the Canadian parliament has 12 months to rewrite the legislation or it will be withdrawn.Anti-prostitution laws will continue to be enforced in the meantime.Canadian Justice Minister Peter MacKay said the government would reflect on ""this very complex matter"".""We are reviewing the decision and are exploring all possible options to ensure the criminal law continues to address the significant harms that flow from prostitution to communities, those engaged in prostitution and vulnerable persons,"" his statement said.A Canadian women's rights group condemned the court's decision, saying it was a ""sad day"".""We've now had confirmed that it's OK to buy and sell women and girls in this country,"" Kim Pate, executive director of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.""I think generations to come - our daughters, their granddaughters and on - will look back and say, 'What were they thinking?'"" A constitutional challenge by three women with experience in the sex trade, Terri-Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch and Valerie Scott, prompted the case.In March, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a ban on communicating for the purpose of prostitution, a decision which Ms Bedford challenged.The federal and Ontario governments appealed against two other parts of that decision: striking down the law against brothels; and limiting the ban on living off the avails of prostitution.The Canadian authorities argued that they should be entitled to legislate against prostitution as they ""see fit"".Lawyers for the Ottawa government reportedly claimed ""if the conditions imposed by the law prejudice [sex workers'] security, it is their choice to engage in the activity, not the law, that is the cause"".But the Supreme Court ruled it was not a choice for many.""Whether because of financial desperation, drug addictions, mental illness, or compulsion from pimps, they often have little choice but to sell their bodies for money,"" Justice McLachlin wrote."

Supporters say they are designed to protect the privacy of farmers and agriculture businesses. Large, intensive factory farms have shown significant growth in the US over the past 20 years. Between 2002 and 2007 the total number of livestock on the biggest of these farms grew by more than 20%.But concerns over the conditions in which cattle, pigs and poultry are raised and slaughtered have prompted many animal welfare groups to mount undercover investigations. Because there is no single US federal law that protects animals, welfare investigators have played a significant role in bringing public attention to inhumane practices. In 2008, a distressing video of staggering cattle secretly recorded at a California slaughter plant led to the biggest meat recall in US history. Last year a recording from a pig farm in Wyoming was used to secure convictions against a number of workers for cruelty.However in Utah and Iowa the undercover recording of videos like these is now illegal.  Several other states including Indiana, Arkansas and Pennsylvania are considering similar laws. Other provisions in these bills require prospective farm employees to disclose any link to animal welfare groups.These regulations are already having an impact, says Cody Carlson, a former investigator who has documented inhumane activities on farms in several US states. ""When I applied for a job in Iowa in 2009 and they asked me if I had any affiliations to animal protection groups, I would have had to say yes, I wouldn't have gotten the job and I wouldn't have been able to expose the conditions that raised questions about the egg industry there,"" he told BBC News. ""It is exactly what these industries want - they want to shut down the conversation that's going on about what is happening with the animals we raise for our food.""In California an animal welfare bill, doesn't appear to be as restrictive as many of the others under consideration. It is supported by the California Cattlemen's Association and it requires anyone who records video or other evidence of cruelty to turn it over to the authorities within 48 hours. But campaigners are highly sceptical, arguing that requiring the handover of material so quickly would undermine an investigation and prevent the collection of wider evidence of inhumane behaviour.""They've done a clever twist on it,"" Charity Kenyon from the Slow Food Movement told BBC News. ""They want to make it look like their concern is animal abuse, but it is all part of the same deal which is to prevent ongoing investigations of the type that ended in the largest recall of beef in the history of the US,"" she said.Welfare groups say that the American Legislative Exchange Council is the moving force behind these laws. This group supports conservative causes and promotes legislation to limit the role of government.  They have described animal rights campaigners as terrorists. They support the laws because they believe investigators are threatening the privacy rights of individuals and businesses.  However they declined to be interviewed by the BBC for this article. While the ""ag-gag"" laws are primarily designed to have impact within the US, many feel they will also have an impact outside the country.""As factory farming spreads like a plague around the world,"" said Matt Rice from Mercy for Animals,  ""international agribusiness interests will certainly attempt to import America's ag-gag laws along with its tainted meat and animal abuse. ""The UK and other nations should be on high alert.""In the UK, Peta the animal welfare charity said these US laws were ""shameful"". ""Such atrocious public policy sets a dangerous precedent for UK industry, as does the introduction of US-style mega-farms,"" said Peta's Ben Williamson. ""Legislators should instead be passing laws to require cameras in all abattoirs and factory farms in order to catch animal abusers,"" he said.Others are concerned that if these laws are passed, consumers around the world will no longer be able to trust that exports of US agricultural products are produced without cruelty.""A significant amount of meat, dairy and eggs produced on US factory farms goes to foreign countries,"" Matt Dominquez, from the Humane Society of the US told BBC News. ""Anyone who consumes animal agricultural products imported from the US should be scared. This prevents them from knowing what's going on - it blocks an entire industry from transparency.""Follow Matt on Twitter."

They said the MoD had failed to properly equip the tanks and to give soldiers adequate training.The MoD had argued that there was ""combat immunity"" where troops in action were concerned and it was not ""fair, just or reasonable"" to impose a duty of care on the MoD when soldiers were on the battlefield.But during Wednesday's hearing, the Supreme Court justices ruled that immunity did not apply in this case.Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ""I am very concerned at the wider implications of this judgement, which could ultimately make it more difficult for our troops to carry out operations, and potentially throws open a wide range of military decisions to the uncertainty of litigation.  ""We will continue to make this point in future legal proceedings as it can't be right that troops on operations have to put the European Convention on Human Rights ahead of what is operationally vital to protect our national security.""Debi Allbutt, the widow of Cpl Stephen Allbutt, told the BBC she was pleased with the outcome, but that the families' fight would continue.She said: ""We want combat immunity thrown out of the rulebook, so instead of soldiers having to sue the Ministry of Defence, the equipment and the training will be in place to stop things like this happening again.""Susan Smith, mother of Pte Phillip Hewett, described the judgement as ""absolutely brilliant"".""They can no longer treat soldiers as sub-human with no rights,"" she said.""Phillip's dead. Nothing is going to bring him back, but this might help save lives in the future.""Lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, who is acting for the Snatch Land Rover families, said the MoD ""can't be given a carte blanche to fail to equip our troops"".She said: ""I think what they have established is what seems to many families is common sense - that soldiers have human rights, and they do remain within the jurisdiction of the UK, and they don't lose those because they are on the battlefield.""The families' claims will now be able to proceed to trial to determine if the MoD owes damages."

Big aluminium users in the US say banks are using their ownership of warehouses to keep prices artificially high.The hearing comes amid renewed scrutiny of the role of banks in the commodities markets.Last week, the US Federal Reserve announced it would look again at rules that allow deposit-taking banks to get involved in commodities.Banks such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley all have business interests that include storage of commodities such as metals and oil, as well as in trading.But businesses that use a lot of aluminium say banks are storing the metal at their warehouses and intentionally passing it on to customers at the slowest rate possible. ""Just imagine a warehouse with a big garage door marked 'in' and the small front door of your house marked 'out'. A lot more metal goes into the warehouse than comes out,"" Timothy Weiner, global risk manager in commodities and metals at MillerCoors, said in written evidence submitted before the hearing.This, he said, allowed banks to claim a rental income for storing the aluminium, as well as creating bottlenecks in supply that keep prices artificially high.""What's happening is that the aluminium we are purchasing is being held up in warehouses controlled and owned by US bank holding companies... who are members of the LME [London Metal Exchange] and set the rules for their own warehouses.""These bank holding companies are slowing the load-out of physical aluminium from these warehouses to ensure that they receive increased rent for an extended period of time. ""Aluminium users like MillerCoors are being forced to wait in some cases over 18 months to take physical delivery due to the LME warehouse practices, or pay the high physical premium to get aluminium today.""""The current system does not work,"" Mr Weiner concluded.The LME has opened a consultation into plans to force warehouses to increase the amount of metal they deliver if they have waiting times of more than 100 days.Although the banks were not present at the hearing, while it was happening Goldman Sachs issued a statement denying that it deliberately caused aluminium shortages to increase prices.""Recent news reports have inaccurately accused Metro of deliberately creating aluminium shortages and incorrectly asserted that Metro moves aluminium from one warehouse to another in order to earn more rent fees,"" the bank said in a statement on its website."

This is because known ""inefficiencies"" in different parts of the system mean not all the energy supplied through the laser is delivered to the fuel.But the latest achievement has been described as the single most meaningful step for fusion in recent years, and demonstrates NIF is well on its way towards the coveted target of ignition and self-sustaining fusion.For half a century, researchers have strived for controlled nuclear fusion and been disappointed. It was hoped that NIF would provide the breakthrough fusion research needed.In 2009, NIF officials announced an aim to demonstrate nuclear fusion producing net energy by 30 September 2012. But unexpected technical problems ensured the deadline came and went; the fusion output was less than had originally been predicted by mathematical models.Soon after, the $3.5bn facility shifted focus, cutting the amount of time spent on fusion versus nuclear weapons research - which was part of the lab's original mission. However, the latest experiments agree well with predictions of energy output, which will provide a welcome boost to ignition research at NIF, as well as encouragement to advocates of fusion energy in general.It is markedly different from current nuclear power, which operates through splitting atoms - fission - rather than squashing them together in fusion.NIF, based at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is one of several projects around the world aimed at harnessing fusion. They include the multi-billion-euro ITER facility, currently under construction in Cadarache, France.However, ITER will take a different approach to the laser-driven fusion at NIF; the Cadarache facility will use magnetic fields to contain the hot fusion fuel - a concept known as magnetic confinement.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter"

The county of Kerry, hugging the rugged and windy south-west coast of Ireland, is known for its mountains, its rural scenic beauty and its winding country lanes. Mr Healy-Rae told The Journal the people he thought could apply for the permits ""are living in isolated rural areas where there's no public transport of any kind, and they end up at home looking at the four walls, night in and night out, because they don't want to take the risk of losing their licence.""""I see the merit in having a stricter rule of law for when there's a massive volume of traffic and where there's busy roads with massive speed. But on the roads I'm talking about, you couldn't do any more than 20 or 30 miles per hour [30-50km/h] and it's not a big deal. I don't see any big issue with it.""Mr Healy-Rae said the current drink-driving rules were forcing an older generation to stay at home.""All the wisdom and all the wit and all the culture that they had, the music and the singing, that's all being lost to the younger generation because these older people might as well be living in Japan and Jerusalem because the younger generation don't see them at all any more.The council will now call on the justice department to implement the change.But the move was condemned by the mayor of Kerry, who told Irish broadcaster RTE:  ""It is incredibly dangerous. I don't know how anybody can be allowed to say: 'You've had two pints, so you're justified to drive'.""I don't know what expertise one would have to look at someone in a bar to give them a permit to drive a car after any alcohol.""Conor Cullen of Alcohol Action Ireland told the BBC: ""Almost one in three crash deaths in Ireland is alcohol-related. Even in small amounts, alcohol impairs driving ability - any amount of alcohol increases the risk of involvement in a fatal crash.""He said tougher measures against drink-driving in Ireland over recent years had seen road deaths fall by 42% between 2008 and 2012. ""Those in rural areas who may be suffering from isolation will not benefit from putting their lives and the lives of the other members of their community at risk by drinking and driving,"" Mr Cullen said. ""Also, it should be noted that the link between alcohol use and suicide has been well established and drinking alcohol will exacerbate not alleviate any mental health difficulties that a person may be struggling with, such as depression or anxiety.""In 2011, the maximum blood-alcohol limit in Ireland was reduced from 80mg per 100ml of blood - the same as the UK legal limit, one of the highest in the world - to 50mg for most drivers.While the level of alcohol in the blood depends on the driver, for many the new law means a single drink could push them over the limit.Learner, novice and professional drivers in Ireland are now limited to a maximum of 20mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood."

Ms Rose QC represented former Guantánamo Bay detainee, Binyam Mohamed in his case against the British intelligence services.In 2011, 16 terror suspects, including Mr Mohamed, received a multimillion-pound pay-out after they claimed they had been mistreated by US and British security and intelligence officials.The Justice and Security Bill would create a mechanism allowing court evidence to be heard in secret where there is a need to keep information from the public on grounds of national security.The government has introduced safeguards to the legislation, currently being scrutinised by Parliament, ensuring judges and not ministers decide when so-called closed material proceedings are used.But this was no enough to satisfy Lib Dem members at the conference.Speaking at the podium, Ms Shaw resigned from the party, describing ""secret courts"" as ""shoddy logic"".She told her leader: ""It's not me Nick; it's you.""Ms Shaw said the leadership had ""abandoned liberal values for the privileges of power"".""The Lib Dem leadership have decided that civil liberties is not a red line issue,"" she said. ""I am today resigning from the Liberal Democrats. I am a liberal and I am a democrat and we are against this sort of thing.""But justice minister Lord McNally warned blocking the legislation, which would allow for courts to sit in secret in some civil cases, would mean there was less scrutiny of the security services.They would continue to pay compensation rather than disclose sensitive information in public, causing serious ""reputational damage"".The vote in favour of the emergency motion came shortly ahead of Mr Clegg's closing speech, which argued the Lib Dems were no longer a ""party of protest"" but one of government.But the courts issue has alienated many members, worried the Justice and Security Bill will undermine the openness of justice.Last week, Lord Neuberger, the UK's most senior judge, warned any lawyer or member of the judiciary ""worth his salt"" would be ""troubled"" by the changes.The bill was given its third reading in the Commons, but is expected to face strong opposition in the Lords."

Speaking in London, Mr Kerry said he understood Syrians wanted results from the summit and promised it would not just be a talking shop. He has held talks with PM David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague. Syria's opposition has said it will not attend the Rome talks because of ""the world's silence"" over Syrian violence.  After his talks in London Mr Kerry had a telephone discussion with Syrian Opposition Council President Moaz Al-Khatib, encouraging him to attend the Rome talks, but no more details of the conversation were released. Mr Hague said the UK was preparing to ""significantly increase"" its support for Syria's opposition.Mr Kerry, who succeeded Hillary Clinton, is on an 11-day tour of Europe and the Middle East, and will meet Syrian opposition members and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Berlin on Tuesday. ""The Assad regime has rained down rockets on the people of Aleppo"" in the last few days, said Mr Kerry, as he condemned the ""indiscriminate killing of civilians"".He said such attacks were further evidence that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should go.Mr Hague said 70,000 people had been killed and he was ""frustrated"" at the lack of an international political solution, despite efforts at the UN.Earlier, the Syrian foreign minister said his government was ready for talks with its opponents, even armed rebels. Mr Kerry said the US would continue with its policy of not taking a position on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.  Argentina claims the territory - which it calls the Malvinas - and says it will not recognise a forthcoming referendum organised by the islanders on how they want to be governed.  Mr Kerry said he would not comment on the referendum.""The United States recognises de facto UK administration of the islands, but takes no position on the question of party's sovereignty claims thereto,"" he said.  ""And we support co-operation between UK and Argentina on practical matters and we continue to urge a peaceful resolution of that critical issue.""A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron and Mr Kerry ""reiterated their shared determination to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran"" and discussed ""the challenges posed by fragile states around the world"". The top US diplomat said Britain and the US remained implacably opposed to the prospect of Tehran obtaining nuclear weapons, saying an Iran with a nuclear weapon was ""simply unacceptable"". ""The window for a diplomatic solution simply cannot by definition remain open forever,"" he told a news conference. ""But it is open today.""There is still time but there is only time if Iran makes the decision to come to the table and negotiate in good faith. We are prepared to negotiate in good faith, in mutual respect in an effort to avoid whatever terrible consequences could follow failure.""The choice really is in the hands of the Iranians. And we hope they will make the right choice,"" said Mr Kerry. The prime minister's spokesman said Mr Kerry did not ask about Britain's possible future exit from the European Union but he and Mr Cameron did discuss a free-trade agreement between the US and the EU and the possibility of making progress at the next G8 summit in Northern Ireland in June.In all, Mr Kerry will visit nine countries, stopping off in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Ankara, Cairo, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha.The British government is pleased that Mr Kerry made London his initial port of call on his first official trip abroad, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall. His itinerary stands in marked contrast to his predecessor, Hillary Clinton, who rather pointedly went to Asia first, our correspondent says. Though the Middle East peace process will be on the agenda when he visits Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Mr Kerry will not visit Israel or the Palestinian Territories. However, our correspondent says Mr Hague would like to see a renewed effort from the US to engage the different parties in the peace process and is hopeful that Mr Kerry's visit will herald a new enthusiasm. Mr Kerry, former Massachusetts senator and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, has spent almost three decades in the US Senate as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee."

This is because known ""inefficiencies"" in different parts of the system mean not all the energy supplied through the laser is delivered to the fuel.But the latest achievement has been described as the single most meaningful step for fusion in recent years, and demonstrates NIF is well on its way towards the coveted target of ignition and self-sustaining fusion.For half a century, researchers have strived for controlled nuclear fusion and been disappointed. It was hoped that NIF would provide the breakthrough fusion research needed.In 2009, NIF officials announced an aim to demonstrate nuclear fusion producing net energy by 30 September 2012. But unexpected technical problems ensured the deadline came and went; the fusion output was less than had originally been predicted by mathematical models.Soon after, the $3.5bn facility shifted focus, cutting the amount of time spent on fusion versus nuclear weapons research - which was part of the lab's original mission. However, the latest experiments agree well with predictions of energy output, which will provide a welcome boost to ignition research at NIF, as well as encouragement to advocates of fusion energy in general.It is markedly different from current nuclear power, which operates through splitting atoms - fission - rather than squashing them together in fusion.NIF, based at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is one of several projects around the world aimed at harnessing fusion. They include the multi-billion-euro ITER facility, currently under construction in Cadarache, France.However, ITER will take a different approach to the laser-driven fusion at NIF; the Cadarache facility will use magnetic fields to contain the hot fusion fuel - a concept known as magnetic confinement.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter"

Pilots will be notified through routine announcements about where drones are being flown.The FAA said in a statement that its decision followed a 10-month process involving proposals from 24 states.The agency said it had considered geography, climate, location of ground infrastructure, research needs, airspace use, aviation experience and risk.The sites chosen are:A set of locations proposed by the University of Alaska in seven zones with varying climates, from Hawaii to OregonGriffiss International Airport in central New York state will test how to integrate drones into the congested north-east airspace North Dakota Department of Commerce will test the human impact of drones and also how the aircraft cope in temperate climatesThe state of Nevada will concentrate on standards for air traffic and drone operatorsTexas A&M University plans to develop safety requirements for drones and testing for airworthinessVirginia Tech university will research operational and technical areas of risk for dronesThe biggest chunk of the growth in the commercial drone industry is currently expected to be for agriculture and law enforcement. Police and other emergency services could use them for crowd control, taking crime scene photos or for search and rescue missions.It can cost a police department hundreds of dollars an hour to deploy a helicopter, while an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be sent into the skies for as little as $25.Farmers, meanwhile, might find it easier to spray crops or survey livestock with the pilotless aircraft. The FAA estimates as many as 7,500 aircraft could be in the air five years after widespread airspace access is made legal.However, the commercial use of drones has drawn criticism from both conservatives and liberals.   In a report last December, the American Civil Liberties Union said that giving drones access to US skies would only ensure ""our every move is monitored, tracked, recorded and scrutinised by the authorities"".But lawmakers from winning states were delighted with the selections. ""This is wonderful news for Nevada that creates a huge opportunity for our economy,"" said Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada.An industry-commissioned study predicted more than 70,000 jobs  - including drone operators - would develop in the first three years after Congress loosens drone restrictions on US skies.The same study, conducted by the Teal Group research firm, found that the worldwide commercial drone market could top $89bn in the next decade.

Ms Williamson worked there for two days a week and in London for three days a week. Taxpayers paid for her travel to London and hotel costs between 2008 and 2012.Mr Bacon said: ""Because they are partly a perk, it's been recognised for many years that people get taxed on their company cars and it's surprising that shouldn't be the same in the public sector.""The HMRC doesn't seem to have a problem working out which is which when it comes to the private sector and when it comes to private citizens.""I think the point is that everyone should be treated in the same way, like cases should be treated like.""What we don't want is this sort of sense that there's a small number of people that are treated differently to everyone else, and that's what this starts to smell of in certain cases.""HMRC said more widely 20,000 employees had payments made on their behalf by their employers, most in the private sector.A spokesman said in a statement: ""We can't discuss individual cases. However, cars provided by an employer that are available for employee use are a benefit in kind for the employee and are taxable. These rules have been in place for 37 years.""Employers may choose to pay the tax due on the benefit. If so any such payment will constitute an additional benefit - which will also be taxable on the employee.""This is quite a common practice by employers and is a matter between employer and employee. HMRC makes sure all the tax due is paid.""Dave Penman, general secretary of the First Division Association, the trade union for senior civil servants, told the BBC that the use of government cars had fallen because of recent cuts.Their use ""was not a perk"", but essential for senior staff doing ""demanding jobs"", requiring them to be on call seven days a week.Earlier this week, it emerged that central government spent more than £500m on consultants and short-term staff last year despite a crackdown on the practice.The Times reported that the figure was nearer £800m when ""off payroll"" staff were included - at the same time £287m was spent on staff redundancies.Also this week local councils urged the government to become as ""efficient"" as them at collecting taxes, arguing this could make Whitehall an extra £20bn a year."

The men he once sat next to treated him as an ideological enemy with views that are repugnant. Some were also trying to settle personal scores with a man they regard as a turncoat.  In attacking him, they are also seeking to define Mr Obama - portraying his policies as defeatist and disloyal.Mr Hagel had been under attack for claiming ""the Jewish lobby"" had too much influence on America's politicians. So he went out of his way to stress that he had always been a ""strong friend"" of Israel - underscoring the fact for some Republicans, any criticism of Israel's government is unacceptable. A fellow Vietnam veteran, Senator John McCain, said he had fundamental questions about his one-time friend, who broke ranks with his party over Iraq. He said he questioned Mr Hagel's judgment and his world view. He tore into the nominee for suggesting, at the time, that the Iraq surge was a potentially disastrous policy. Sen McCain wanted only ""yes"" or ""no"" answers, not explanations. It is interesting that both men assumed the surge was beyond criticism. While it is unarguable that it was a military success, it is at least possible to contend it has had little long-term impact. 'Gotcha'Repeatedly the senators insisted he gave a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" to complex questions. These are old men who hold themselves in high regard, but seem to see serious examination of difficult problems as a personal affront. They desperately want to play ""gotcha"", but haven't the self-restraint to design effective questions. They love the sound of their own voices too much to trap their opponent. Mr Hagel was equally unimpressive, almost unprepared, for a level of hostility that had been signalled long in advance. Neither smart, nor humble, his tactic seemed to be a kind of bumbling blandness. The exception, in style if not ideology, was Ted Cruz, a new senator from Texas. Razor sharp, he ripped into the nominee with all the skill honed as a Texas solicitor general, playing sequences from al-Jazeera where Mr Hagel appeared to agree America behaved like a bully in the world and that Israel was guilty of war crimes.Rather than defend the views he expressed, the former senator suggested he hadn't understood the questions on the TV show. ""Highly troubling,"" was Sen Cruz's verdict. That could be a verdict on the whole process, which has been used not to examine a candidate's fitness for high office, but to underline the rather obvious fact that the Obama administration does not share the world view of Republican senators, and they don't like their former colleague joining it."

The alarm sends out information about its owner and where they were when they were attacked. Other staff nearby will also be alerted so they can start to take action to help anyone in distress.Civil Rights Defenders wants people to sign up to monitor the bracelets of individual rights workers via social media. It hopes the global involvement will act as a deterrent to anyone planning attacks on aid workers. ""Most of us, given the chance, would like to help others in danger,"" said Civil Rights Defenders' executive director Robert Hardh.

The state senator, a Democrat elected in 2001, represents Bath County.He ran unsuccessfully in 2009 against current Republican Governor Bob McDonnell. Four years earlier he lost to Mr McDonnell in a tight race for state attorney general.Shortly after the gubernatorial campaign, Mr Deeds and his wife, Pam, were divorced.He remarried last year but police said there was no-one else in the house at the time of the incident.Governor McDonnell said in a statement: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Deeds family.""He added: ""Creigh Deeds is an exceptional and committed public servant who has always done what he believes is best for Virginia and who gives his all to public service.""Local politician David Toscano told the Washington Times that Tuesday's incident was ""a terrible tragedy"".""Senator Deeds was very close to his son Gus, and has taken herculean efforts to help him over the years,"" said Mr Toscano.

Despite this, some sex workers are having unprotected sex - and taking antiretroviral drugs afterwards to cut the infection risk. How reckless is this?""Let me tell you the truth about why many of us don't use condoms,"" says Sheila who has been a prostitute in Nairobi's Korogocho slum for six years. ""We don't have money, and when you meet a client who offers to give you more money than you usually get, you have sex without protection even when you don't know his HIV status.""Sheila says she and other prostitutes can go to a clinic the next morning to get emergency antiretrovirals - drugs which suppress the virus, if taken within 72 hours of infection, and in many cases stop its progression.""We use this medicine like condoms,"" she says. The type of antiretroviral in question is known as post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP.It is intended to be used in emergencies. For example, it is given to victims of rape if their attacker is thought to be HIV-positive, or to medics who have been pricked by a potentially infected needle.There are no definitive figures to show how well PEP works. It's far better, experts say, to prevent exposure to the virus in the first place, by using condoms.Some clinics will only give clients one course of PEP a year. They worry that if they hand the drugs out too freely, prostitutes will stop using condoms altogether. This hasn't stopped 24-year-old sex worker Pamela using PEP four times in the past year. ""I had unprotected sex when I was very drunk one night and the following morning I didn't go to the same clinic where I got the first PEP tablets... I went to a different clinic where they don't have my records, and lied that I was forced into unprotected sex,"" she says.She didn't finish the full course because of the side-effects. ""You feel bad, like vomiting, dizziness, and generally you just feel sick,"" she says. ""So I stopped taking them.""Peter Godfrey-Faussett, senior science adviser with UNAIDS, says there is a place for antiretrovirals among sex workers, but only when used in the right way. ""We know that despite fairly high rates of condom use in many sex-work communities, we still have very high rates of HIV so we need additional tools as well as what's already happening,"" he says.However, emergency use of PEP is not the best way to go about it, he says. Instead it would be better for prostitutes to take a type of antiretroviral designed to be taken before exposure to HIV - known as Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).These are taken daily, and contain fewer drugs than PEP, so there are fewer side effects. But Godfrey-Faussett stresses that they must be used as part of a wider package, including regular HIV testing to make sure that the patient is on the correct medication.There are plans to run a pilot programme with sex workers in Kenya to see if it could be practical for them to use PrEP as an extra layer of defence.The drugs are not cheap, though.In the US, PrEP costs around $14,000 (£8,700) a year at the full price, although people on low incomes can get it much cheaper, or even free. In developing countries, where generic copies of the drugs are used, the cost may be about $150 (£93) a year.Godfrey-Faussett stresses that the cheapest line of defence is, in this case, the strongest.""Condoms are the single most effective way of preventing HIV, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy,"" he says. ""PrEP is not a silver bullet that will suddenly take away all those other issues.""Additional reporting by Alison Gee in London.

So how is he trying to convince them?In some eyes, it's not just the future of Syria and the region that rests on two votes being held next week.The political future of the president also lies in the hands of the 100 senators and 435 members of the House of Representatives he has asked to support him in launching a ""limited"" attack on targets in Syria. Many are sceptical that responding in this way to the alleged 21 August chemical weapons attack is in US interests. So what is President Obama doing to persuade them?From the lawn of the White House, the president made a direct plea not just to Congress but to a deeply divided American nation and to the wider world.""Ten days ago, the world watched in horror as men, women and children were massacred in Syria in the worst chemical weapons attack of the 21st Century. ""All told, well over 1,000 people were murdered, several hundred of them were children - young girls and boys gassed to death by their own government. This attack is an assault on human dignity.""Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham swung behind the president after a private meeting at the White House on Monday. They lead the so-called Republican hawks who believe limited strikes are not enough, but their comments when they emerged left little doubt they are now in tow.On Tuesday it was the turn of House Speaker John Boehner to get a private audience, along with other chairmen and ranking members from the national security committees. Afterwards Republican Boehner, for the first time publicly, gave his support.Expect more waverers to be given the Oval Office treatment in the days ahead, says Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.""Every moderate Republican who is smart enough to let it be known publicly that he or she is wavering will dangle that in front of the White House.""But how impressed they are by the aura of the office and the glamour of a personal audience depends on who they are, he says. ""If in the moderate, middle group then an Oval Office audience - or lunch or breakfast - might make a difference, because they like to go back and say 'the president really listened to me.'"" The vote on Syria will be a free vote and the leadership in both Republican and Democratic parties backs Obama, but there's still work for the whips. ""The Democrat whips will be whipping for the president,"" says Sabato. ""The Republican whips will be supplying their leadership with the numbers, because Boehner and Cantor will want more information on who they want to sway. ""They could send certain people [who would vote against a strike] out for coffee during the vote or say, 'take a walk'.""There are certain discreet inducements that could be offered to Congressmen and women yet to make up their mind.These could be Syria-specific, such as an agreement to provide humanitarian help or limit the action to a short time period, says Shaun Bowler, a professor of political science at California Riverside. Broader rewards could be provided by the mid-term elections in 2014 - a Joe Biden fundraising dinner or help buying television adverts, Bowler adds. ""Or perhaps, 'you oppose us now and don't look for help in 2014.'""Buck McKeon, the Republican chairman of the House armed services committee, said he is ""still open"" on the issue as he urged the administration to halt cuts in military spending.A senior administration official has described the strategy in pitching the president's message to Capitol Hill as ""flooding the zone"" - bombarding members of Congress with calls and briefings. The overriding message to Democratic waverers will be simple, says Sabato - do not emasculate your president. ""The most important thing in one of the most polarised Congresses ever is pure partisan appeal.""President Barack Obama, Vice-President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough all made calls on Sunday to individual lawmakers and again hit the phone lines on Monday. John Kerry also held a conference call with more than 100 House Democrats and administration officials, to brief them on the intelligence and describe this as America's ""Munich moment"" - a reference to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler in 1938. Secretary of State John Kerry, Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the case before the Senate foreign relations committee on Tuesday. ""This is not the time for armchair isolationism,"" said Kerry. ""This is not the time to be spectators to a slaughter.

But it goes on to question whether £15,000 of public money should be spent on having a Youth Commissioner at all - suggesting if the post is indeed necessary then ""more diligence"" should have been shown during the recruitment process.The Guardian carries a piece by blogger Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, who believes the controversy raises a wider issue about social media.  Young people do not distinguish as much as older generations between their online lives and the things they are doing when they are not on their computers, she explains.""The internet is making teenage life much more public than it would have been in the school corridor.""Elsewhere, the Daily Telegraph suggests on its front page that the price of a first class stamp could rise to £1 within three years if the Royal Mail is privatised.  The warning comes from the campaign group Save Our Royal Mail, which believes the price hike would be likely because a privatised service might no longer be allowed to be exempt from VAT - due to European competition law.  The paper's leader concludes that ""it would be naive to pretend that prices will not go up"" in the event of privatisation, which it believes is ""long overdue"".The Daily Mail is highly critical of advice from the Equalities and Human Rights Commission that minority groups such as druids and vegans should be given special treatment at work.  ""What an insult to Christians"", is the headline. And the paper's editorial is furious: ""So much for the government's promise to stop the quangocrats strangling business with onerous new obligations.""That sense of outrage is shared by the Daily Express.  ""These rights are all wrong,"" it argues, going on to suggest that, at first glance, the idea that druids and pagans will be allowed time off work to celebrate sacred rites ""looks like some kind of April fool"".According to the Independent, an advertising campaign against plans in Scotland to sell cigarettes in plain packages has caused anger among anti-smoking groups.

The paper says the trips - once seen as the preserve of elderly people - are coming back into vogue, partly due to the fact that times are tight. One coach tour operator tells the paper that ""this is not a renaissance, but there is a re-invention. We sell the experience, not the mode of transport""."

""The second that we stepped on the property, I knew it was where I was going to get married and we were jumping up and down and giddy,"" gushed bride-to-be Natasha.  So when she found out that the bohemian ghost town would be closed for her big day, she was crushed. ""I immediately had a nervous breakdown and started crying at work, it was awful. I had no idea what to do.""With family and friends flying in from places as far as Taiwan, postponing the wedding was not an option. Unable to get a refund, Juliao and Coughlin, a nursing assistant and production co-ordinator, were nearly out of time and money to find an alternative. Then, through a stroke of fate and a stranger's kindness, Natasha managed to put together a new wedding in two days. The owner of Wooden Nickel Ranch, two hours away from their original venue, found out about the couple's story in local media and then discovered she had a cancellation for the same Sunday. Feeling for the couple's misfortune, she knocked down the starting price by 90%. Still a bit shaky from the entire ordeal, Natasha praised her wedding day hero: ""She was really an angel for us.""Hoping to create an intimate setting for their families' first encounter, Drake Lucas and Zach Kouwe spent  more than a year poring over Pinterest, planning a low-key wedding in California's Yosemite National Park. ""Ironically,"" Drake noted, ""we chose it because we thought it would be stress-free."" But with the park closed, the Brooklyn couple are scrambling to put together a plan B wedding in San Francisco, a five-hour drive away. From the flowers to the venue, everything has to be found in less than a week, which means nothing will be quite as they envisaged.In the midst of her hectic attempts to salvage her big day, Lucas, a grant-writer at Human Rights Watch, has some words of wisdom for Congress. ""If I can just share a little of the advice I've been given during my engagement, I might be able to help us all out. It's called compromise. ""I hear you have to do a lot of it in marriage, and it seems to me that you should have to do a lot of it in your job, too. You can't just give up if you don't get your way. ""And you have to pay your bills on time. Because we are in this for the long haul and there are enough real problems we will have to weather - there is no need to create ones you can prevent.""""I never thought I'd hike in a wedding dress.""As an endurance athlete, Genevieve Jeuck knew how to push through in tough situations. But when she found out that her Grand Canyon dream wedding would be off limits, she stopped in her tracks. ""I got the call Thursday night. I cried. I was freaking out, and then I thought I was turning into a 'Bridezilla.'"" Jeuck, a violinist, and her fiance Michael Sallemi, a Harley Davidson salesman, hadn't connected the dots between the government shutdown and the national parks closing. And with less than six days until the 2 October wedding, all options were on the table. But then the New Jersey couple were able to relocate to Sedona, Arizona, and the last-second wedding included an unexpected hike in the white dress.  Though she never cared for politics before, the new bride has spent her honeymoon closely following the effects of the shutdown throughout the country. Angry and impassioned, Jeuck has vowed that her days of apathy are over. ""Now, I'm sorry I'm following and I'm voting and I'm doing everything I can to have a say.""MaiLien and Michael - wedding Saturday, Washington DCMaiLien Le and Michael Cassesso had planned a romantic wedding at the Jefferson Memorial, where they met for their first date more than four years ago. Having worked in politics, the couple are no stranger to Capitol Hill antics, but that didn't soften the blow as their wedding became a casualty of the latest Washington crisis. ""It's gut-wrenching, frustrating, aggravating, disheartening to have our wedding turned upside down like that,"" says Cassesso, a legislative analyst.  Le, a project co-ordinator at an executive search firm, had a more intuitive reaction, with an expletive.As strangers started donating to their wedding gift registry, Cassesso and Le directed the funds to The Covenant House, a charity for homeless young people, a group the couple think will be adversely affected by the shutdown.They have found another venue for Saturday's wedding in Washington DC, and he says the ordeal has a silver lining. ""Throughout all this there was no fighting, no arguing,"" Cassesso says. ""It confirmed for me even more than I already knew that this is going to last, this is the right choice."""

18307	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25410915	Opinion	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Michael Bloomberg has overseen the transformation of New York City during his 12 years as mayor. But as he prepares to leave office the billionaire businessman's political legacy is contested.In a city that favours large and flamboyant personalities, Michael Bloomberg is hardly the sort to light up a room. He is a data-driven technocrat, an entrepreneur with vast personal wealth but lacking comparable charisma.At a valedictory appearance at a school in Harlem earlier this month the departing mayor revealed his strengths and weaknesses. Delivering an update on a major snowstorm about to hit New York, the 71-year-old appeared to be going through the mayoral motions: performing one of the basic, but essential, functions that seem almost to bore him. However, when he talked about the subject at hand, the provision of free wi-fi internet in what has traditionally been one of New York's most rundown neighbourhoods, he was animated and engaged. The project, he claimed, would reduce the digital divide, provide a much-needed economic boost, and make Harlem more liveable.New York used to be assailed for its dysfunction, high crime rates and ungovernability. It could have suffered decades of decline like Detroit. But during his 12 years in charge Mike Bloomberg has tried to turn the city into a laboratory for civic renewal and reform. Coming to office shortly after the attacks of 9/11, which ripped the heart out of the Lower Manhattan, he was fearful of an urban exodus that would starve New York of tax revenues and dull its vibrant character. The early emphasis was on recovery. During his second and third terms, it has been on transformation.Globally, he is best known for his smoking ban in restaurants, bars and parks, a policy mimicked around the world. Calorie counts are now mandatory on menus at restaurant chains, so that customers are equipped to make healthier choices about what they eat. He has banned trans-fat food additives, which are known to clog the arteries. Partly as a result of Bloomberg's public health initiatives, life expectancy is now at a record high in New York. A child born today can expect to live 80.9 years, which is 2.2 years above the national average. New York has changed in other ways, too, whether it is in the proliferation of bike lanes, the introduction of a bike sharing scheme, or the redevelopment of large swathes of the city. Some 40,000 new buildings have been constructed since he took office. A third of the city has been ""re-zoned,"" easing the path for developers.  Bloomberg looks upon New York's once neglected waterways as the city's ""sixth borough,"" and the shoreline of Brooklyn is unrecognisable from when he took office. Stylishly landscaped parkland has replaced semi-derelict wastelands. Landmarks like The Highline, where a disused raised railway line has been turned into an elegant greenway, has become popular with New Yorkers and tourists alike. Small wonder. It is stunning. Though Bloomberg does not deserve all the credit, he helped make it happen. Former aides, like Bill Cunningham, who served as Bloomberg's communications chief, says that he brought the skills of a successful CEO to the mayor's office. ""Mike believed you hire people and then you give them the authority to run their agencies. 'Here's your budget. You know the issues. I've hired you. I'm gonna back you up. Now go do a good job.'""""And generally, the last words he would say to somebody after he swore them in was: 'Now don't mess it up.' But he didn't say 'mess'."" Rather than being overbearing and autocratic, says Cunningham, Bloomberg delegated a lot of authority.Others, however, bemoan what they claim is an imperious approach.  Ronna Texidor became a community activist because of Bloomberg's support for a redevelopment in Greenwich Village where she lives. She can't wait to see the back of him. ""He just makes pronouncements. Edicts!"" she exclaims. There have also been notable setbacks. Bloomberg was unable to bring in a congestion charge, his preferred solution to the problem of rush-hour gridlock. His battle to ban over-sized fizzy drinks, a key part of his public health drive, was deemed unlawful. Then, there are the areas where his legacy is bitterly contested. Tough policing policies, known as stop-and-frisk, may have contributed to a fall in homicide rates. Murders are down 65% since he came to office. Shootings are down 53%. However, civil liberties groups have campaigned against stop-and-frisk, complaining that the policy unfairly discriminates against minorities. A US district court judge deemed the policy, which allows the police to stop and search anyone if they believe a crime is about to occur or to have occurred, to be unconstitutional. Waterfront neighbourhoods, like the hipster haven of Williamsburg, have become ridiculously fashionable, but long-time residents complain they have also become ridiculously expensive. The broader criticism is that the business-friendly mayor has presided over a city where the divide between the super-rich and the rest has becoming a gaping chasm. The recent mayoral election demonstrated how polarised the city has become. The conventional wisdom going into the campaign was that a Bloomberg-lite candidate - a politician who would carry on his reform agenda with mild modifications - would emerge victorious. Instead, the winner, the Democrat Bill de Blasio, cast himself as the anti-Bloomberg. De Blasio's tale of two cities - of how the rich had benefited under the billionaire mayor, but the middle class and poor had been left behind - had resonated powerfully. Even admirers, like Professor Steven Cohen, the Executive Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, think Bloomberg probably overstayed his welcome. After serving two terms, he successfully lobbied the City Council to amend its charter so that he could seek a third. ""I think people are going to look back on his administration very positively. I think he will be ranked among the great mayors of the city along with [Fiorello] La Guardia. But I think you know that by year 10,11,12 it's just, a lot of exposure and people were tired of him and so they were looking for the un-Bloomberg.""So what does a former mayor think? David Dinkins, who served between 1990 and 1993, was the first and so far only African-American to occupy the office. Overall, he's been a fan of Bloomberg. ""I think that he accomplished a lot and his motivation is, I think, a good one, a positive one. Some of us seek to be involved in government and politics because we want to see our names in lights, but I don't think that's the case with respect to Mike Bloomberg.""""How did he change New York?"" I ask. ""For the better,"" replies David Dinkins. ""Period.""Because the mayor has set in motion so many long-term projects, his successors will be performing ribbon-cutting duties for decades to come. But the argument over his contribution to New York life is sure to outlive the man himself."

You know it has few redeeming merits beyond the entertainment value of witnessing humanity at its worst. The characters fling themselves from one gratuitous hysterical crisis to the next, barely pausing to reflect on the folly of their ways. No remorse, is one of the rules.Some will blame the Tea Party, some the president, others the system. There'll be plenty of time to reflect on whose fault it is over the next few days, and I will certainly do so.But for now it seems likely that the latest plot line of DC dramas may be nearing a conclusion. The leaders of the Republicans and Democrats seem to have almost struck a deal.It would raise the debt ceiling and reopen the Government until the new year. Before Christmas there would be a big conference on the budget.  There may be a few, very minor, changes to Obamacare.  The leaders of the two parties wouldn't agree to something they didn't think they could sell. The president has said little, but one can assume he approves of what is on the table. But that doesn't mean it will have an easy passage in the Senate. The House is likely to be even rougher. They are more than capable of squeezing another cliffhanger or two out of it. They could miscalculate and go over the edge into the unknown by mistake. But if they don't and a deal is done, some will celebrate this as American democracy doing its job - raw and messy but vibrant, forcing compromise where there was none to be had. Perhaps. The American public don't seem that impressed.  The world scratches its head in bewilderment. But it has consequences that go beyond the United States. Lurching from crisis imperils the world's economy on an annual basis. That's bad enough. But it gives democracy itself a bad name, making it look like a system that is not fit for purpose in a modern world. That is truly dangerous.

And on Thursday, a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed it, ruling the Texas law could take effect on Friday while an appeal is argued in the coming months.Mr Abbott, a Republican, is expected to run for governor of Texas against Democratic State Senator Wendy Davis, who has been an outspoken opponent of the new abortion restrictions. The legislation also bans abortions at the 20th week of pregnancy and requires doctors to perform abortions at special surgical facilities.After the law passed in July, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers in the state sued, arguing the law would force many to close.In his ruling on Monday, Mr Yeakel found the admitting privileges provision ""places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable foetus and is thus an undue burden to her"".In overturning his decision, the court of appeals found the state had provided ""a rational basis"" for the physician hospital privilege requirement, including offering evidence it ""fosters a woman's ability to seek consultation and treatment for complications directly from her physician, not from an emergency room provider"".""This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women,"" Mr Abbott said.Women's health advocates have argued the law will require women in some areas to travel several hours on two days to obtain abortions.""This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion state-wide,"" Planned Parenthood Foundation President Cecile Richards said.""This fight is far from over.""At one clinic near the Texas-Mexico border on Friday, women who had arrived for an initial consultation for abortions on Saturday were told by an administrator they would not be able to go ahead with the procedure.The Associated Press reported some women stayed in the hope that something would change. The clinic's doctor, Dr Lester Minto, said the law's hospital admitting privilege provision prevented him from performing abortions.He said he feared some of the women might ""do drastic things"" if he was unable to terminate their pregnancies.One woman at the clinic told the Associated Press she had already had several children with her husband and the pregnancy was not planned. ""I just can't afford to have another one,"" the woman said, on condition of anonymity."

Pierre Servan-Schreiber, the Hopis' French lawyer, bought one mask for 13,000 euros and also intended to return it to the tribe.Responding to news of the Annenberg Foundation's purchase, Sam Tenakhongva, a Hopi cultural leader, said: ""This is a great day for not only the Hopi people but for the international community as a whole.""The Annenberg Foundation set an example today of how to do the right thing.

As a result, the FAA has reduced the work schedules of nearly all of its 47,000 employees by one day every two weeks.The staff include air traffic controllers and technicians who keep airport towers and radars working. President Barack Obama would now sign the bill, said White House press secretary Jay Carney, even though it fell short of broader action needed to address sequestration.""Ultimately, this is no more than a temporary Band-Aid that fails to address the overarching threat to our economy posed by the sequester's mindless, across-the-board cuts,"" said Mr Carney.President Obama had favoured wider action that would ease the budget cuts for federal agencies.The legislation would end the unpaid leave and allow for enough funding to prevent the closure of towers at small airports around the country.But correspondents say it is not clear how quickly services will be restored to normal.Thursday's Senate vote followed many hours of closed-door negotiations and the departure of several lawmakers - who had apparently given up hope of a deal - for a week-long recess.A small group of senators insisted on reaching an agreement before the holiday, amid warnings of political repercussions from continued airport delays.Airlines and unions representing airport employees have been pushing for a resolution in Congress.Robert Isom, head of operations at US Airways, said the FAA furloughs were like a ""wildcat regulatory action"".""In the airline business, you try to eliminate uncertainty,"" he said.

Days earlier, Mr Duffy accused Mr Harper's office of wielding ""bribery, threats and extortion"" in an effort to cover up a growing expenses row.Mr Duffy said Mr Harper's office sought to force him to repay taxpayer-reimbursed expenses that Mr Duffy believed were properly claimed.Ms LeBreton challenged the allegation: ""The story that Senator Duffy spun in this place is not based in facts and it certainly leaves open to question what he was talking about and what he was thinking.""She said Mr Duffy spoke a ""blatant falsehood"" in order to avoid being expelled from the Senate over the expenses matter.On Wednesday, Mr Harper denied involvement in the affair, telling the House of Commons he had been unaware of Mr Duffy's activities.Canadian senators are appointed by the governor general of Canada - the Queen's representative - on the advice of the prime minister. They typically join either the government caucus or the opposition caucus, or sit as independents.Mr Duffy has been accused of seeking reimbursement for living expenses associated with a home in Ottawa, thought that, rather than a cottage in his home province of Prince Edward Island, was his primary residence.He has argued the expense claims were within government guidelines for the reimbursement of senators who live outside Ottawa but must maintain a second home there.Mr Duffy has said Mr Harper ordered him to repay the government after months of negative publicity. But he declined, arguing that to pay back money to which he was entitled would damage his reputation.He then accused Mr Harper's office of ""bribery, threats and extortion"", and said Mr Harper threatened to force him from his Senate seat in order to cover up the row.Mr Duffy's lawyer says the prime minister's office sought a way to repay the 90,000 Canadian dollars ($86,336; £53,292) it said Mr Duffy owed the taxpayers in order to put an end to the potentially damaging row.  Mr Duffy reportedly agreed in order to avoid an audit.Mr Harper's chief of staff Nigel Wright said in May that he provided the money to Mr Duffy, prompting an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.Mr Wright later resigned his post.""Any assertion that I was in any way consulted or had any knowledge of Mr Wright's payment to Mr Duffy is categorically false,"" Mr Harper later told the media.

Ms Rolnik says her recommendation is for the policy to be suspended.She rejected most of the criticisms made by Mr Shapps, although she did apologise for referring to the policy as the bedroom tax, telling the BBC she had done so because that was ""what everyone has been calling it since I got here"".Under the government's benefit changes social tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced since April.Ministers say private sector renters do not get spare rooms free, and argue the change will save around £500m a year and free up much needed larger properties.Ms Rolnik told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she had received ""hundreds of testimonies"" and said there was a ""danger of a retrogression in the right to adequate housing"" in the UK.She cited examples of disabled people, or grandmothers who were carers, and said the measure seemed to have been designed ""without the human component in mind"".She said her recommendation was ""that it should be suspended"" to allow time to better assess the human rights implications, and so it could be redesigned.Ms Rolnik, who is producing a report on adequate housing around the world for the UN human rights council, says she was in the UK for two weeks at the government's invitation.Her visit included trips to London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Manchester.Mr Shapps, responding to her comments on Today, said that she had not been invited by ministers and ""she has clearly come with an agenda"".""It is completely wrong and an abuse of the process for somebody to come over, to fail to meet with government ministers, to fail to meet with the department responsible, to produce a press release two weeks after coming, even though the report is not due out until next spring, and even to fail to refer to the policy properly throughout the report.""That is why I am writing to the secretary general today to ask for an apology and an investigation as to how this came about.""He also said that she came from a country, Brazil, ""that has 50m people in inadequate housing"".In his letter to UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon, Mr Shapps urged the claims to be withdrawn and said: ""By referring to the policy as the 'bedroom tax' and posing for photos receiving 'dossiers' from those opposed to ending the Spare Room Subsidy, I believe that Ms Rolnik has shown political bias.""We would have hoped that Ms Rolnik would have taken the necessary steps to ensure that her report was based on all the information available to her from the Government before she declared her conclusions less than two weeks after her 'mission' began.""The Department for Work and Pensions later confirmed that Ms Rolnik, the UN special rapporteur on housing ""had one meeting with a senior official at the DWP"".On Tuesday there was a further meeting ""at which the findings were presented by the rapporteur"". A spokesman said that at the start Communities Secretary Eric Pickles ""popped in - it would be pushing it to call it a meeting"".Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said the policy should be dropped and said what was ""shocking"" was that the Conservatives were pushing ahead with ""hated"" changes which he said were primarily hitting disabled people.Labour has not committed to scrapping the policy if it wins the next election. Mr Byrne told the BBC that he had to demonstrate it would have the money to reverse the changes: ""I am working very hard... to show how and why this tax should be dropped.""Plaid Cymru welcomed the report, suggesting the benefit changes were one of the ""most toxic policies for decades"".""The UK is a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,"" said Hywel Williams MP""This means that Ms Rolnik's findings should carry weight within the British justice system and prompt the government to abandon this most inhumane of policies."""

He reaffirmed that clear evidence that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons would be a ""game changer"", but that any response would not be rushed. Earlier Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the US was no longer ruling out arming the rebels.Meanwhile, US media reports are quoting unnamed US officials as saying Israel has conducted an air strike in Syria.They say the attack probably happened on Thursday or Friday, but Israeli aircraft did not enter Syrian airspace. The report say the target was likely to be an arms depot or a weapons shipment en route to Hezbollah in Lebanon. There has been no confirmation from the US or Israeli governments.Mr Obama told reporters in Costa Rica on Friday that as a commander-in-chief he could rule nothing out ""because circumstances change"".But he added he did not foresee a scenario in which ""American boots on the ground in Syria"" would be good for either America or Syria.He also said he had already consulted with Middle Eastern leaders and they agreed with him. Mr Obama reiterated that there was evidence that chemical weapons had been used in Syria, but that ""we don't know when, where or how"".He stressed that if strong evidence was found it would be ""a game changer for us"" because ""there is a possibility that it (weapons) lands in the hands of organisations like Hezbollah"" in neighbouring Lebanon.On Thursday, Mr Hagel became the first senior US official to state publicly that Washington was reconsidering its opposition to supplying weapons to rebel forces.""Arming the rebels - that's an option,"" he told reporters.""You look at and rethink all options. It doesn't mean you do or you will. These are options that must be considered with the international community.""With no appetite for direct military intervention, many US officials increasingly feel that arming the rebels is now the least-worst option, the BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says.US allies such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia are already providing weapons to various groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.The pressure to act has intensified in recent days after emerging evidence that Syria has used chemical weapons such as the nerve gas sarin.'Pools of blood'Mr Obama spoke after more than 40 people were reportedly killed by government troops in north-western Syria on Thursday.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Violations Documentation Centre in Syria said the incident occurred in al-Bayda, near the port of BaniyasAn online video appears to show seven bodies in pools of blood. State media blamed the incident on ""terrorists"".It also reported that ""a number of terrorists"" had been killed when government forces captured a cache of arms and ammunition in the area.Al-Bayda is reportedly a predominantly Sunni Muslim village located in an area inhabited largely by members of President Assad's Alawite sect, a heterodox offshoot of Shia Islam. More than 70,000 people have been killed since fighting between government forces and rebels erupted in March 2011."

In practice, the 46-strong Republican minority voting together can block nearly any measure.Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said senators in his party would seek to ban filibusters through a simple majority of 51 votes, instead of the 67 currently needed to change the chamber's rules.This was known as the ""nuclear option"", creating a precedent for any future Senate majority to curtail the rights of the minority group of senators.But after a three-hour, closed-door session with all but two of the 100 senators, lawmakers from both parties signalled a deal was at hand.As he left Tuesday's meeting, Republican Senator John McCain told reporters it was ""probably the hardest thing I've been involved in"", but said the proposal was ""an important step forward"". Max Baucus, a Democrat, told the Washington Post the gathering had been helpful for overall relations in the Senate.The Montana senator said: ""There should be many more meetings like that, frankly.

But the president's performance was not about winning an agreement but playing the blame game.The automatic and deliberately harsh spending cuts have come because the politicians are so far apart they cannot agree to a sensible way of balancing the books.Their dispute is simple and as old as the division between left and right.Mr Obama wants to deal with the deficit, in part, with tax rises (or to be precise, by closing tax loopholes). The Republican leader, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, insisted leaving the meeting that the president got his ""tax hikes"" in January, so now it was the time for spending cuts. Mr Boehner has a point - some Republicans pointed out at the time that they had thrown away their best bargaining chip. But Mr Boehner's low-key comments will hardly make headlines. The president's will. He claimed that he had won the election on this very argument and even Republican voters said that the rich should pay more.He said it was time for Republicans in Congress to catch up with their own voters and the American people.That is not how the American system works. But Mr Obama was as insistent today as he has been ever since 6 November - his election victory gives him a moral mandate and deprives the Republicans of theirs.He is determined to keep painting them as intransigent, uncaring and out of touch.Several conservative commentators seem delighted to help him out, portraying these deep cuts as rather a fine thing. The president's stated aim is to encourage public pressure on Congress and so free up moderate Republicans to do a deal. This would, by definition, deepen splits in a fractious and demoralised party only just beginning a debate about its own future.  He seems determined to define the Republicans before they can re-define themselves.Mr Obama may not have Jedi powers, but he knows how to kick a man when he is down.*It seems likely the president was getting the impressive mental powers of the Star Wars Jedi knights confused with the Vulcan mind meld in Star Trek. Mr Obama is sometimes compared to Star Trek's emotionless and hyper-rational protagonist Mr Spock, and I can imagine him, hand gripped to the head of an alien humanoid of a startling orange hue. Or would that be a Vulcan death grip? But perhaps the scoffers are wrong and the president is an ultra nerd, and was referring to the Jedi battle mind meld mentioned in several Star Wars novels."

It remains unclear whether Congress can agree a deal in time to avert the economic calamity in the US and across the world that economists say could result.The US House of Representatives would vote on Tuesday night on its bill to reopen the government and avoid default, said Republicans.Meanwhile, Fitch credit agency placed the US AAA rating under review for a downgrade.The Senate plan, outlined on Monday evening, would fund the government through mid-January and raise the debt ceiling until February, creating room for negotiators to agree a longer-term budget.The House plan largely mirrored the Senate timeline until Representative Devin Nunes said on Tuesday afternoon it had been amended to fund the government only until 15 December.The California Republican said the revised House plan also dropped earlier attempts to delay a medical device tax used to pay for healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.The House plan would also eliminate healthcare subsidies for the president, vice-president, members of the president's cabinet, and members of Congress and their staff.The health law passed in 2010, was subsequently validated by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 presidential election, which Mr Obama won handily. Many key provisions have already taken effect, and more begin next year.On Tuesday, Mr Obama rejected what an aide described as Republicans' attempts to extort ""ransom"" while the government remained shut and the threat of a debt default loomed.""Unfortunately, the latest proposal from House Republicans does just that in a partisan attempt to appease a small group of Tea Party Republicans who forced the government shutdown in the first place,"" said White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage, referring to a faction of hardline conservatives who hold significant sway in the House.Later, Republican House Speaker John Boehner said that both parties were trying to find a way forward and that Tuesday morning's House plan was focused on ""fairness for the American people under Obamacare"".""There have been no decisions about exactly what we will do,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. ""There are a lot of opinions about what direction to go.""But following a meeting with Mr Boehner and GOP moderates on Tuesday Republican representative Charlie Dent told the media his ""best estimate is that there aren't the votes to pass it"".House and Senate Democrats immediately joined Mr Obama in denouncing the House Republican proposal.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the plan was ""an extreme piece of legislation and it's nothing more than a blatant attack on bipartisanship"". He said it would never pass the Democratic-controlled Senate.Mr Obama is scheduled to meet House Democrats on Tuesday afternoon as the clock ticks to Thursday's debt ceiling deadline.Even if a deal is reached in the Senate, it is unclear whether Congress could act in time to pass legislation that would avert the 17 October default deadline.Hardline conservatives such as Texas Republican Ted Cruz could use Senate rules to stonewall a vote.In the House of Representatives, the Senate deal could meet fierce resistance from the Tea Party-aligned Republicans.One of those conservative hardliners, Kansas Representative Tim Huelskamp, was quoted by the New York Times as labelling his upper chamber colleagues ""the Senate surrender caucus"".""Anybody who would vote for that [Senate deal] in the House as Republican would virtually guarantee a primary challenger,"" he said.Republicans have taken the brunt of blame for the latest fiscal cliffhanger to cripple Capitol Hill, according to opinion polls. A Washington Post/ABC News survey on Monday found 74% of voters were unhappy with congressional Republicans' handling of the standoff, compared with a 53% disapproval rating for President Obama.Some in the party have voiced concern that the affair could damage its prospects in next year's midterm elections.The US Treasury has been using what are known as ""extraordinary measures"" to pay its bills since the nation reached its current debt limit in May. Those methods will be exhausted by 17 October, it has said.Meanwhile, the government remains partially shut down because Congress failed to agree on funding by a 1 October deadline.The impasse has closed a swathe of federal services and left hundreds of thousands of employees out of work.

The US is expected to hit its $16.4tn (£10.2tn) statutory borrowing limit in mid February unless lawmakers act.The Republican move is designed to force the Democratic-controlled Senate to put forward a long-term budget plan.In the ongoing debate over how to rein in the $1.1tn US federal budget deficit, Republicans demand dramatic cuts in federal spending, while Democrats led by President Barack Obama seek what they call a balanced approach that includes new tax revenue.Republicans had previously threatened not to pass an increase in the debt limit unless it was paired with spending cuts. Democratic President Barack Obama, meanwhile, demanded they pass an unconditional debt limit increase and warned them they would not ""collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the economy"".""We are going to pursue strategies that will obligate the Senate to finally join the House in confronting the government's spending problem,"" House Speaker John Boehner told lawmakers at a Republican retreat in Virginia on Friday.""The principle is simple: `no budget, no pay.""'On Friday, the White House appeared cautiously to welcome the move but withheld comment on the ""no pay"" condition.""We are encouraged that there are signs that Congressional Republicans may back off their insistence on holding our economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare, education, and programmes middle class families depend on,"" spokesman Jay Carney said.Congress has not passed a budget since 2009. The US has instead maintained the government's spending through a series of stop-gap bills, the latest of which is set to expire on 27 March.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Senate Democrats had yet to decide how they would respond to the measure, but said it was ""reassuring to see Republicans beginning to back off their threat to hold our economy hostage"". The current fight over the debt limit comes less than three weeks after Congress and the White House struck a last-minute deal to prevent the so-called fiscal cliff of sharp spending cuts and tax increases.The last debt ceiling battle between Congress and Mr Obama ended in July 2011, after bringing the nation close to default on its debt and resulting in a credit rating downgrade as well as financial market turmoil."

Legal aid costs taxpayers about £2bn every year - half goes on criminal defence and the rest on civil cases including mental health, asylum and family law involving domestic violence, forced marriage or child abduction.Government proposals include cutting fees in complex, high cost cases by 30%, and in other crown court work by up to 18%.  Treasury Counsel said the ""entirely obvious and predictable outcomes will be lost quality and reduced supply of criminal advocates"".Meanwhile, the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, accused the government of putting ""cuts before justice"".Maura McGowan QC, chairwoman of the Bar, told BBC Radio 5 live there was clear evidence that standards were at risk.""The fees that are paid to people who do these cases have been reduced by almost as much as 40% already, before the planned reductions,"" she said.""It will drive people of quality out of the system and will mean those who depend on publicly funded representation run the risk of getting a lower standard. ""So to say that they're making these cuts because they want to protect those who most need help, cannot be right.""The Law Society, which represents some 130,000 solicitors in England and Wales, said it had some concerns about proposals for flat fees in magistrates' courts and the crown court and a single national fixed fee for police station work.Law Society President Nicholas Fluck said: ""To maintain quality, it is vital that we have the most diverse range of solicitors possible in the system within the boundaries of long-term financial viability. ""The current proposals for a single national fixed fee for police station work will have a disproportionate effect on firms in high-cost areas where the cost of doing business is greater.""It is unwise to risk tarnishing the respect in which our justice system both domestically and internationally is held by an apparent incentive to plead guilty, which could jeopardise the relationship of trust between clients and solicitors.""The MoJ said the cut in high cost cases was to ensure it would impact high earners and not junior barristers, and denied other cuts were unjust.An MoJ spokeswoman said: ""We have tried to ensure our proposals have more impact on high earners - 70% of criminal barristers contracted to Very High Cost Cases receive fee incomes of over £100,000, which is why we targeted the largest fee reductions at this type of work.""Nor do we accept our proposed rates for more routine work are unjust. The minimum a QC would be paid for such a case is £306 each day.""At around £2 billion a year we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world and even after our changes would still have one of the most generous.""We agree legal aid is a vital part of our justice system and that's why we have to find efficiencies to ensure it remains sustainable and available to those most in need of a lawyer.

Ministers want to extend the scope of the law to enable a prosecution to be brought against anyone whose dog injures someone or acts aggressively in a private place where they are permitted to be, such as a home. There have been eight fatal attacks in private residences since 2007, most recently in March, when teenager Jade Anderson was mauled to death in Wigan when she visited a friend's house.Police have no plans to prosecute anyone in relation to her death, saying there is no evidence a crime has been committed and that they are bound by the law.The cross-party committee said existing laws had ""comprehensively failed"" to deal with the threat from dangerous dogs and welcomed the proposed extension - which could also see maximum penalties increased from a six-month jail sentence to two years. The government's plans would also criminalise attacks on assistance dogs while exempting homeowners from prosecution in the event of an attack on a trespasser.However, the MPs questioned whether they would apply in cases where someone had trespassed with ""innocent intentions"" - such as a child recovering a ball from a neighbour's garden.The committee also expressed concerns about how incidents on surrounding land, such as gardens or paths, and outside dwellings such as sheds would be treated in law. It said the courts should be allowed to take into account the actions of responsible homeowners who took ""reasonable precautions"" to stop their animals from causing harm, such as putting up warnings outside properties and securing fences, as opposed to those behaving ""negligently"".The committee also said homeowners ""needed assurance"" that they would be protected in the event of attacks on trespassers when they were not at home.It was the police's view, the MPs said, that the public felt a dog left on its own had a role in protecting the property and this should form the basis of a legal defence when attacks occurred during owners' absence.On the issue of preventing future attacks, the committee said there was a lack of action and the proposals would actually limit council powers to stop animals from entering certain areas.It is calling on ministers to reconsider the case for Dog Control Notices - introduced in Scotland in 2011 - which give local authorities powers to tackle all aspects of dog-related crime such as illegal breeding and the ownership and training of so-called ""status dogs"".The committee argues that ministers must ""provide law enforcers with tailored powers to tackle aggressive dogs before they injure people and other animals"".Other recommendations include licensing for dog breeders producing a minimum of two litters - as opposed to five now - and a code of practice covering online sales of animals.The British Veterinary Association echoed the MPs' concerns that the proposals ""did not go far enough"".""Instead of making more mistakes with hastily made legislation we are asking the government to think again and reconsider introducing Dog Control Notices,"" its president Peter Jones said.And Steve Goody, of pet charity the Blue Cross said that without Dog Control Notices ""enforcement officers will remain powerless to tackle irresponsible owners and antisocial behaviour with dogs before attacks take place"". A government spokesman said it was taking ""urgent action"" to protect the public from dangerous dogs. ""We are changing the law so that owners can be prosecuted for dog attacks on private property and our anti-social behaviour reforms will give the police and local agencies more effective powers to deal with owners who fail to take responsibility for their dogs."""

But what is royal protocol and is it necessary?Barack Obama was probably not aware that he was doing anything unusual when making a toast ""to the Queen"" and then continuing with a short speech.  According to protocol, however, he should have stopped after the toast. The band, taking its cue from the word Queen, struck up with the national anthem leaving the president struggling to make himself heard.What happens when the Queen is toasted is all part of protocol, an elaborate set of customs and rules that govern interactions with the British royal family.Some fuss was also made during a previous visit by the Obamas, when Michelle put her arm around the Queen, another protocol breach.Mrs Obama's action echoed similar slip-ups by Australian prime ministers. In 2000, John Howard appeared to have put his arm around the Queen, but that was as nothing compared to the furore caused by Paul Keating when he put his arm around the Queen during her 1992 tour of Australia, and was dubbed ""the Lizard of Oz"".When meeting a royal, there are rules about who can speak first, where to look, what to call them, how you should stand and when you should sit. It is a mysterious business to the uninitiated. But it stems from a time when monarchs were accorded an almost divine status and had to be treated accordingly.""From medieval times, monarchs were divinely appointed to rule by God, so they were kind of seen as gods, so they demanded to be treated as gods,"" says Dr Kate Williams, a historian at London's Royal Holloway university.""They are treated as people set apart from the rest of us, so primarily what it is creating is distance and grandeur.""In short, says Dr Williams, ""you don't kiss them, you don't touch them, you bow - over and over again.""But in an era when a woman with ancestors who worked in the coal mines can become a princess, does royal etiquette really matter?The reaction to Mrs Obama touching the Queen in 2009 would suggest it does to some people. ""Meeting the Queen may never be the same again after an extraordinary show of affection with Michelle Obama,"" wrote Andrew Pierce in the Daily Telegraph in 2009.For David Miller, director of Debrett's, royal etiquette is a helpful set of instructions to show people how to behave in an unfamiliar social setting.""It's a code of conduct in terms of the way in which people behave at occasions and eventualities that they do not encounter on an everyday basis,"" he says.""Yes, it's wrapped up in history and tradition, but it's also practical, universal and there to avoid embarrassment.""Royal protocol can be viewed as an expression of respect for the Queen.William Hanson, a protocol expert who trained staff for the luxury liner Queen Mary II, says the Queen, with all she has been through, her unique perspective and position in the nation's history, deserves the respect she is afforded.""It's because we respect her and what she stands for - she stands for all that is great in British society,"" he says.But there is evidence that things are becoming more relaxed.Jennie Bond spent 14 years negotiating royal protocol as a part of her job as royal correspondent for the BBC.""I don't think that they are as hot on etiquette as most people think they are,"" she says.""They like people to curtsy, but you're always told at royal briefings that it's up to you. As a journalist, I never did.""All this thing about not speaking to the Queen unless you're spoken to, I don't believe that, I always used to tell her jokes.""Dr Williams says royal etiquette has adapted to reflect the shift in what we expect from our royal family.""I think it is changing, I think in the earlier period people wanted their monarch to be set apart from them, that's what they wanted, they wanted someone more powerful [to protect them],"" she says.""We're less and less engaged with the idea of a monarch being distant. For example, Princess Diana gained popularity because she was so much less formal.""But Mr Hanson believes etiquette still has a role to play, beyond royal circles as much as within them.""These things matter, especially when you're doing business with eastern countries such as China, where they take it even more seriously than Britain,"" he says.""The Japanese, the Chinese, the Middle Eastern countries, are more concerned with protocol day-to-day.""Mr Hanson sees a deeper importance behind the principles of etiquette.""If you get the little things right, all the other things fall into place. It's about respect and deference in society, and that is what we're lacking.""As for the recent faux pas by Mr Obama, Mr Hanson says: ""It's not going to spell the end of cordial relations between America and Britain, but it's always nice to get these things right."""

The two men are army generals.The decision put the lives of Salvadoreans under risk as it threatened the future of the non-aggression pact agreed last year, the gang leaders said.But they renewed their commitment to carry on with the ceasefire, provided it was backed by the security authorities.President Mauricio Funes says he disagrees with the ruling but will accept it.""I have no doubt that behind the arguments of the court is a very clear anti-military bias,"" said Mr Funes in his weekly radio address.He promised to appoint replacements in the next few days.LA gang cultureLeaders representing the Mara Salvatruchas (or MS-13) and 18 Street gangs said they hoped the new security minister and police chief would support the truce.MS-13 and the 18 Street gangs were created in the 1980s in Los Angeles in the US by poor, mostly illegal, immigrants who had escaped from the civil war in El Salvador.When the conflict ended, with a peace treaty signed in 1992, many of those already in jail in the US were expelled and deported to El Salvador, exporting LA's gang culture to Central America.El Salvador's neighbours, Honduras and Nicaragua, also saw an increase in gang violence.In March 2012 the two gangs agreed to a ceasefire, mediated by the Catholic Church, which has sharply reduced the number of murders in El Salvador.Murder rates have dropped dramatically since the gangs agreed to stop killing each other last year, the government says.The gangs continue operating in several American cities.Last year, the US Treasury designated MS-13 as a ""transnational criminal organisation""."

In a statement, President Barack Obama praised Ms Napolitano, saying: ""The American people are safer and more secure thanks to Janet's leadership"".Her resignation comes as Congress is debating broad immigration reform.The former Arizona governor had been an outspoken advocate for changing the US immigration laws, and replacing her could complicate an already tough path in the Republican-controlled House, analysts say.Ms Napolitano is only the third person to hold the top job at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), created in response to the 9/11 attacks. It includes 22 departments. The department's mandate is extremely broad, from immigration and deportations to airport screenings to disaster management.She will leave the department in early September.It is unclear who Mr Obama will nominate to replace her, but some names suggested for the post so far include former Senator Joe Lieberman, Senator Susan Collins and former Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen. New York Senator Chuck Schumer has recommended New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly for the job.  Mr Obama thanked the secretary for working ""around the clock"" during disasters over her tenure, including the 2011 Joplin tornado in Missouri and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

The family started a petition calling for the law ""to make dog owners accountable"". They asked for police to be able to prosecute dog owners if their animal attacks ""somebody on private property.""The government said in a May debate it was planning to extend police powers to deal with attacks on private property.The two met Environment Minister Lord de Mauley in Westminster alongside Bolton West Labour MP Julie Hilling to discuss their concerns.Mr Anderson, 34, said: ""It is about responsible dog ownership, as a dog owner you should be responsible for your dogs.""Something needs to be done about it, we are talking about saving lives and helping people.""The Andersons said there should be more early intervention with owners and more help for councils and police forces to deal with potential problem animals.Police officers investigating Jade's death said there was no evidence to prove a crime has been committed and no prosecutions are being sought ""at this stage"".The dogs involved in the attack, thought to be two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers, are not illegal breeds.The Dangerous Dogs (Amendment) Bill aims to remove the immunity from prosecution of dog owners whose animal attacks someone on private property.Under the plans for England and Wales, announced in February, a dog owner could be prosecuted if they fail to stop their dog attacking someone on their own, or someone else's property.Julie Hilling said: ""The biggest issue we want are preventative measures, so we can actually have dog control notices or similar so there can be early intervention so people are helped to be responsible owners.""She added the bill will be good for ""people who come to the attention of the police and the authorities"", but ""early intervention"" is also needed for dogs which show a potential danger to the community.Speaking last month, Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Minister David Heath said he was confident the proposed Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill would help tackle irresponsible dog ownership.A second reading for the bill in the House of Commons is set for 10 June."
19604	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21203235	other	1	None	None	Neutral	Negative	bbc.co.uk	"Bobby Jindal is warning that the Republicans must stop being the ""stupid party"".The Louisiana governor, a likely contender for his party's presidential nomination in 2016, said a number of Republicans had ""damaged the brand"" by making ""offensive and bizarre"" comments. He's talking of course about those remarks about ""legitimate rape"" and how rape can't lead to pregnancy. The Republicans who made those comments did seem to be going out of their way to back up John Stuart Mill's 1866 comment: ""I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative. I believe that is so obviously and universally admitted a principle that I hardly think any gentleman will deny it."" OK. That's the headline grabber. But it is hardly a revelation to point out that those who make weird noises during an election campaign should shut up.So it is worth looking at Gov Jindal's prescription in full. It is, after all, among the first contributions from a big name of the Republican party on how not to go down to defeat for a third time in a row. He's adamant the party shouldn't change its principles. Not on taxation or big government, of course. But not on abortion or gay marriage either. He rejects Mr Romney's apparent contention that 47% of voters were out of reach for Republicans, which was always, when you think about it, a counsel of despair. Gov Jindal identifies a core Republican problem: they are overwhelmingly white in a country that is becoming more of a melting pot day by day.""We must reject the notion that demography is destiny, the pathetic and simplistic notion that skin pigmentation dictates voter behaviour,"" he said.He's a good person to say this. His parents came to the US from India in 1970. It says a lot about the way America has changed that he has become the governor of a state that resisted civil rights and defended segregation to the bitter end. I don't want to underplay how important that is - but his speech doesn't say how Republicans can reach the fastest growing ethnic group - Latinos - without shifting their stance on immigration reform. Moreover, I am puzzled by what appears to be the core of his message. He rejects big government - but also seems to reject the fights about it in Washington. He calls not only the debates about gun control, but also those on the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling ""sideshows"". ""These are in reality sideshows in Washington that we have allowed to take centre stage in our country - and as conservatives, we are falling into the sideshow trap,"" he said. This is not an isolated point.""We seem to have an obsession with government bookkeeping,"" he says. ""We as Republicans have to accept that government number crunching - even conservative number crunching - is not the answer to our nation's problems.""Of course he's underscoring an inherent irony in conservatism - those politicians who dislike government put all their time and effort and will and money into becoming part of the government, so they can do away with much of it.Inevitably, they rather like being part of it, and stick around for years trying to slim down something they disapprove of, fanatical dieters insisting on eating at the best restaurants so they can better control the portion sizes. It is an irony, in that one can chuckle about it, but it is not a paradox. It is, I would have thought, pretty essential for conservatives who want to control government spending to have control of that government. His argument seems to be that Republicans should spend their time encouraging the ""real economy"" and leaving it up to the states to spend what little public money he deems necessary.Maybe this is merely a coded attack on those Republicans in the House of Representatives, who seem to think they won the election. If he is identifying them as a major part of the party's image problem, he is right, but he's not pointing a way out of their complex dilemma - the choice between being quislings to faithful Republicans or obstructionists in the mind of most Americans. So an ""A"" for effort, grabbing headlines, and identifying the obvious, but a ""C"" for a rather confused economic approach, which looks more like a desire to say something jolting than a serious contribution. I'm looking forward to hearing Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and, even more, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, describe the way ahead. But Gov Jindal has made a start confronting his shocked, and rather complacent, party. "

A search of his computer yielded no evidence he had researched how to make the toxin, the agent said.In a news conference outside the courthouse on Tuesday, Mr Curtis thanked his family, friends, Jesus, Sen Wicker and Mr Obama.Referring to investigators' questions, he said: ""I thought they said rice and I said, 'I don't even eat rice.'Mr Curtis, a musician and Elvis impersonator who also said he was a certified reflexologist, added: ""I love my country and would never do anything to pose a threat to [Mr Obama] or any other US official.""I would like to get back to normal, which for me means being the best father that I could be for my children and entertaining through my music.""He was already well known to Sen Wicker because he had written to the Republican senator and other officials.Mr Curtis' lawyer Christi McCoy, whom Mr Curtis described as a blonde, blue-eyed angel sent by God, told reporters she believed the FBI agents who had arrested and charged her client had ""acted in good faith"".Ms McCoy said she was unsure what new information prosecutors had but that the plot to frame her client was ""very, very diabolical"".According to an FBI affidavit released on Thursday, the letters read: ""Maybe I have your attention now even if that means someone must die. To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.""The letters were signed: ""I am KC and I approve this message.""As the case against Mr Curtis appeared to collapse on Monday and Tuesday, another man in nearby Tupelo, Mississippi, told the Associated Press authorities were searching his home in connection with the ricin letters.Everett Dutschke said he was innocent, and the Associated Press reported agents from numerous law enforcement agencies had established a mobile crime lab near his home.""I don't know how much more of this I can take,"" Mr Dutschke said. No charges have been filed against him nor has he been arrested.The search team also combed through an area of woods and ditches about a block from Mr Dutschke's property.  Mr Dutschke said he and Mr Curtis had had a dispute, cutting off contact in 2010, after he threatened to sue Mr Curtis for saying he was a member of Mensa, a group for people with high IQs.""I'm a patriotic American,"" Mr Dutschke, who unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Mississippi House of Representative in 2007, said. ""I don't have any grudges against anybody. I did not send the letter."" Ricin, extracted from castor beans, is 1,000 times more toxic than cyanide.It can be fatal when inhaled, swallowed or injected, although it is possible to recover from exposure."

I am at the rally of the defeated candidate in Virginia, watching the victorious Republican in New Jersey on the big screen in the hotel ball room. The loser in this race, Ken Cuccinelli, comes into the hotel ballroom to country music, cheers and waves.  Some think Republicans lost here because of him and his hard line. He's a social conservative accused by his opponents of wanting to bring back anti-sodomy laws and trying to make divorce more difficult. Backed by the radical right-wing Tea Party movement,  he fought this campaign against the background of a government shut down forced by his allies. And he's not apologising.In his speech, he promises that the battle is not over. After him, another Republican comes on promising that they will block everything their opponents want to do, and saying the elected governor has no mandate to act. Earlier, the head of the Virginia Republican Party makes a bitter little speech accusing the Democrats of running the dirtiest campaign he's ever seen, demonising decent men, who love their families, their country and their God. It is not exactly a sign of profound self-reflection. Another warns the country is in economic and spiritual decline. ""We can fix it by repealing Obamacare,""  he says. This is the Republican mood in this vital state, a state that is slipping through their grasp. For decades it voted solidly Republican in the presidential election. But in 2008  it voted for Obama. It voted for him again in 2012 in slightly bigger numbers. It is changing, becoming less white, less rural, with an important Hispanic population. In those respects, it is like much of the United States. You might think that when Chris Christie, victor in the traditionally Democratic state of New Jersey, where he crushed the opposition, appeared on the twin screens, thumping home a message of working together, of one America, of buckling down and getting the job done, they would have fallen silent and listened. They carried on chatting.But one group I spoke to afterwards said that it was what their party needed - a dose of moderation and compromise. But they were in a minority. More typical was the man who told me: ""Reach across the aisle and they'll bite your arm off.""Earlier at a farmers' market just outside Richmond, I spoke to voters, many wearing a badge proclaiming that they had been to the polls. On display were robust carrots, chocolate-coloured peppers, fresh young ginger and chicken fingers - the last for pets to chew on. The views were as varied as the produce, and Ken Cuccinelli divides opinions. ""I don't like him, he's a Tea Party plant and one scary dude,"" a man munching a kebab told me. A woman selling handmade soap said that ""Cuccinelli did stand up to the powers that be, saying he didn't believe in Obamacare, I applaud him for his opinion and standing up"".But this is a state where a quarter of the economy is linked to the federal government and last month's government shutdown was not popular.. One woman told me: ""I didn't vote Republican this time, I wanted to make a point. We have to work together and they just want to block things. I vote both ways but I'm shifting, I have to.""Another said: ""I don't believe in someone who has to tell a woman what she has to do, we are past all that, it is the 21st Century. Sometimes I've been a Republican but they've got all these Tea Party candidates, and the moderates are realising they are not all that great.""But there is a reason hardline Republicans stand firm. Many of their supporters want them to hang tough. One man, selling bread and vegetables, told me: ""I hope he wins, I don't want a Democrat in, the people in power now are extreme lefties, our country was founded on conservatism.""He does think the party needs to alter course, but not in the way most might mean. ""The Republicans need to change - but they've been going left for ages, with McCain and all that. They've left their base behind.""In the offices of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the big question is whether the Republicans will learn lessons from this defeat. Jeff Shapiro's been the newspaper's political commentator for 30 years.""They're going to have to take a very long and hard look at this changing electorate,"" he says. ""This is a state where for a long time the tensions tended to be black and white. Now it is a multi-hued electorate.""He says that is not easy. ""Some Republicans are going to have to make some unpopular and very risky choices, in which they will put their personal ambition on the line in the interests of advancing their party.""Are they prepared to tell the grassroots what they probably don't want to hear?""This is an interesting moment. The Republican party is not fighting about ideology or policy. The vast majority are conservative, pro-life, extremely worried by what they see as a growth of government and high taxation. But there is a big divide about strategy and mood. Many in the Tea Party furiously want to block everything the other side attempts, worried their country is changing beyond repair. Some in the leadership and the business community are concerned about this way of doing politics. But they also are the sort who prize loyalty and are hesitant about provoking civil war.  One of those who is not prepared to stay silent is former congressman Steve Latourette who runs the super-PAC (campaign group) Republican Mainstreet Partnership, which is close to the party's leadership,""You can't just go after angry 57-year-old white men below the Mason-Dixon line and build a national majority, you have to rely on Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, gay Americans, African-Americans, and God forbid women should want to vote for Republicans,"" he says.""That's the tension within the party and the Cuccinelli race will be sort of determinative, at least on our side, and people will say, 'Well I guess the more conservative thing didn't work so good today'. This is just the beginning of a long drawn-out battle.""He's right that that battle will take place eventually but I am not sure there will be much more than sporadic skirmishes for the moment. The leadership hasn't the stomach for it. What happened tonight in New Jersey could be a lesson about how to win in a state that may not look like natural territory, but they may not be ready to put victory above purity. This is a good night for Hillary Clinton - Virginia's new governor is a close ally in a key state that she probably needs to win to become president in 2016. You would think Republicans should start worrying about how they will stop that happening. They probably won't. "

In practice, the 46-strong Republican minority voting together can block nearly any measure.Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said senators in his party would seek to ban filibusters through a simple majority of 51 votes, instead of the 67 currently needed to change the chamber's rules.This was known as the ""nuclear option"", creating a precedent for any future Senate majority to curtail the rights of the minority group of senators.But after a three-hour, closed-door session with all but two of the 100 senators, lawmakers from both parties signalled a deal was at hand.As he left Tuesday's meeting, Republican Senator John McCain told reporters it was ""probably the hardest thing I've been involved in"", but said the proposal was ""an important step forward"". Max Baucus, a Democrat, told the Washington Post the gathering had been helpful for overall relations in the Senate.The Montana senator said: ""There should be many more meetings like that, frankly. We don't talk to each other enough.""Under the deal, President Obama will also be able to name two new nominees for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

However, Unison's Stirling branch said its local council had continued to proceed with plans for a pay cut.Balancing budgetsStirling Council said the pay offer had ""nothing to do with the national pay award"", and it was within the local section of the national local government contract meaning it was for individual councils to determine.A spokesman said: ""The national pay award, whatever is agreed, will of course be implemented in full in Stirling, as we are bound to do.""The council said it had to find savings of £24m in order to balance its budgets. It said this had followed substantial real terms reductions in local government funding from Scottish government over this year and the next three years, along with a council tax freeze.It added that despite the net reduction of 0.5% in pay, employees on the two lowest grades would see an increase in pay following the implementation of the Living Wage at £7.50 an hour."

The US faces another deadline on Thursday to raise its debt limit. If a deal is not reached by then, the US faces potential default, a prospect which has caused alarm both domestically and abroad. Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said the aim was to reach a deal on extending the debt limit before markets reopen on Monday.The talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell earlier on Saturday represented the first face-to-face meeting between the two since July, the New York Times reported.""The conversations were extremely cordial but very preliminary of course - nothing conclusive, but I hope that our talking is some solace to the American people and to the world,"" said Mr Reid.""We had a good meeting,"" said Mr McConnell, without elaborating.Mr Reid then went to the White House for talks with President Barack Obama.But he rejected a plan put forward by Republican Senator Susan Collins to allow the government to increase its debt limit until 31 January.Democrats have a majority in the Senate, but could not muster enough support to advance a proposal to lift the debt ceiling there.Talks between House Republicans and the White House had collapsed earlier.Republicans have refused to pass a new budget unless President Barack Obama agrees to delay or eliminate the funding of the healthcare reform law of 2010.Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been sent home as a result of the shutdown.The White House has repeatedly said it would not undermine the law, known as Obamacare, nor negotiate over larger budget matters, until Republicans vote to end the threat of default.It has also rejected a short-term deal over the debt limit.""It wouldn't be wise, as some suggest, to just kick the debt ceiling can  down the road for a couple of months, and flirt with a first-ever intentional  default right in the middle of the holiday shopping season,"" Mr Obama said."

It replaced a system where allegations and removals were held separately.It revealed that about 6% of claims had led to an investigation and 1.5% had resulted in removals.The committee said it was ""extremely concerned about the number of allegations that are made to the Allegations Management System that are not investigated. ""We recommend that all allegations are actioned and checked against national databases. It is incomprehensible that only 1.5 in 100 reports of illegal immigration result in someone being removed from the country.""Mr Vaz said there was a ""very poor record"" on removals, which did ""not give confidence to those who go out of their way to help the Home Office"".The committee's report revealed that between its introduction on 30 September last year and 30 June this year, the database had received 48,660 allegations - about 178 a day. It said the rates of investigation and removal risked undermining confidence in the system and ""could lead to reluctance to report such allegations if the public perceive that no action is being taken"".The MPs recommended that those who made allegations of illegal immigration be told the outcome of investigations, in an effort to improve public confidence. After a series of damning reports, Home Secretary Theresa May abolished the UKBA and replaced it with UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, which were brought back under the control of ministers.""There are still over 430,000 cases languishing in the backlogs, enough to fill Wembley Stadium almost five times over,"" Mr Vaz went on.""As we have said on numerous occasions, the backlogs must be cleared as a matter of priority. Only then will the Home Office be able to tackle the deeper problems in the immigration system.""Immigration minister Mark Harper said: ""The UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation since its formation in 2008 and its performance was not good enough. That is why we split the agency and brought its work into the Home Office under two distinct directorates.""He added: ""Our newly created UK Visa and Immigration directorate is focused on delivering a high-volume, high-quality visa service, while Immigration Enforcement is getting tough on those who break our immigration laws.""Mr Harper also said: ""We are building an immigration system that the public can have confidence in. We have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010.""But Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said the committee's ""damning report"" shows that ""for all the rhetoric Theresa May's Home Office is failing badly in tackling illegal immigration, backlogs of cases, and can only show progress by sleight of hand.""This out of touch government's response to real challenges has been to use taxpayers' money on ineffective and offensive gimmicks like the ad vans and 'go home' texts."" He added: ""The home secretary urgently needs to get a grip on the shambolic performance of the Home Office and make sure people are removed when they shouldn't be here, and sort out the backlogs that are increasing on her watch.""Under plans announced by the Home office last month, landlords would be asked to check the immigration status of their tenants.There would also be new powers to check driving licence applicants' immigration status and a reduction in the number of grounds for appeal against deportation decisions from 17 to four."

Big aluminium users in the US say banks are using their ownership of warehouses to keep prices artificially high.The hearing comes amid renewed scrutiny of the role of banks in the commodities markets.Last week, the US Federal Reserve announced it would look again at rules that allow deposit-taking banks to get involved in commodities.Banks such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley all have business interests that include storage of commodities such as metals and oil, as well as in trading.But businesses that use a lot of aluminium say banks are storing the metal at their warehouses and intentionally passing it on to customers at the slowest rate possible. ""Just imagine a warehouse with a big garage door marked 'in' and the small front door of your house marked 'out'. A lot more metal goes into the warehouse than comes out,"" Timothy Weiner, global risk manager in commodities and metals at MillerCoors, said in written evidence submitted before the hearing.This, he said, allowed banks to claim a rental income for storing the aluminium, as well as creating bottlenecks in supply that keep prices artificially high.""What's happening is that the aluminium we are purchasing is being held up in warehouses controlled and owned by US bank holding companies... who are members of the LME [London Metal Exchange] and set the rules for their own warehouses.""These bank holding companies are slowing the load-out of physical aluminium from these warehouses to ensure that they receive increased rent for an extended period of time. ""Aluminium users like MillerCoors are being forced to wait in some cases over 18 months to take physical delivery due to the LME warehouse practices, or pay the high physical premium to get aluminium today.""""The current system does not work,"" Mr Weiner concluded.The LME has opened a consultation into plans to force warehouses to increase the amount of metal they deliver if they have waiting times of more than 100 days.Although the banks were not present at the hearing, while it was happening Goldman Sachs issued a statement denying that it deliberately caused aluminium shortages to increase prices.""Recent news reports have inaccurately accused Metro of deliberately creating aluminium shortages and incorrectly asserted that Metro moves aluminium from one warehouse to another in order to earn more rent fees,"" the bank said in a statement on its website."

The measure, known as the ""nuclear option"", curbs the power of the upper chamber's minority party to use a blocking tactic known as a filibuster.Mr Obama cited Republicans' ""unprecedented pattern of obstruction"".Republicans vowed they would use the new rule against Democrats if they won back the Senate in the next election.Correspondents said Thursday's motion, which passed 52-48, would make American politics even more acrimonious. At the White House on Thursday, Mr Obama conceded that neither party had been blameless in filibusters.But he said it was unacceptable that nearly 30 of his nominees had been blocked from confirmation since he took office.The US leader called it an ""unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress"" to block qualified candidates.""A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the results of an election, is not normal,"" he said.Under the rule change, the party in control of the upper chamber of the US Congress now requires just 51 votes, instead of 60, to overcome a filibuster of White House judicial or executive nominations.Democrats currently have 55 seats in the Senate; Republicans 45.The motion does not affect Supreme Court nominations or regular legislation.It is viewed as the most significant rule change since 1975, when the requirement to end any filibuster on the Senate floor was decreased from two-thirds of all senators to the current 60.""This is a power grab,"" argued Senator Lamar Alexander. ""It's another raw exercise of political power to permit the majority to do anything it wants whenever it wants to do it.""Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his fellow Democrats - who control the chamber for now - had repeatedly warned they might ram through the motion.In July, Democrats set aside a threat to do so only after Republicans dropped their long-standing objections to several White House nominees.Earlier this week, Senate Republicans filibustered the nomination of a judge to a key appeals court, the third such move since October. Democrats could not muster enough votes to overcome the manoeuvre.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Democrats had themselves used the filibuster during the two terms of President George W Bush.Democrats used the filibuster tactic 38 times during Mr Bush's two terms, while Republicans used it 54 times in Mr Obama's first term, according to a June report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.""You may regret this a lot sooner than you think,"" Mr McConnell, the Senate's top Republican, said on the chamber floor.Republican Senator Chuck Grassley told the Washington Post earlier that if the motion passed, his party would retaliate if it regained control of the chamber.He said they would change the rules again to block any Democratic filibusters of Republican Supreme Court nominees."

The last Labour government agreed transitional controls on immigration from Bulgaria and Romania when the two countries joined the European Union in 2007, but these expire at the start of next year.The government has said it is impossible, under EU law, to keep the limits in place any longer.But ministers are coming under increasing pressure to act, from MPs concerned about the repercussions of any increase in arrivals for public services and commitments to cut net migration. According to newspaper reports, Downing Street is considering restricting access to public services for future migrants, as one of a number of potential responses.According to The Financial Times, options being considered included asking immigrants who had not found a job within three months or did not have necessary funds to support themselves for six months to leave. No 10 said it was is considering all options open to it, but a spokesman stressed there was a ""clear legal framework"" underpinning guarantees on the free movement of people within the European Union and ""we have to operate within that"".The spokesman played down suggestions Britain might try to deter Bulgarian and Romanian arrivals by launching an advertising campaign in those countries stressing the negative aspects of life in the UK, including the weather.But Mr Vaz, who is chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said any suggestion of spending money on ""advertisements and propaganda trying to stop Romanian and Bulgarians coming to Britain borders on the farcical"".""On the one hand, the Home Office doesn't want them in but on the other hand, the minister for Europe is saying there is freedom of movement,"" he said. ""The government is in danger of actually encouraging more people to come.""""These kinds of tactics have been used in the past and been found to be counterproductive.""He also suggested there were divisions in government about how to deal with the issue.Mr Vaz said the question of whether foreign workers should have guaranteed access to public services, including the NHS, should be looked at, but warned against ""singling out"" workers from individual countries.""Ministers would be better off working with their Romanian and Bulgarian counterparts and the EU to address the reasons migrants want to come here in the first place.""Migration figuresMinisters have warned against ""scare stories"" about a potential surge in numbers. But Mr Vaz said officials had failed to come up with an estimate of the number of arrivals expected, despite repeated requests.The think tank Migration Watch, which supports tighter immigration controls, has said about 50,000 people from Romania and Bulgaria will come to the UK each year until 2019 and that this will have ""significant consequences"" for housing and jobs.The government's own migration advisory committee says there is evidence Bulgarians would move to Britain because of its stronger economy, and it is ""plausible"" Romanians would come for the same reasons.Since 2007, Bulgarians and Romanians have been able to come to the UK as self-employed businessmen or women, or as students, provided they do not seek benefits or any other employment. But the end of existing controls will give Bulgarian and Romanians who want to work in the UK the same rights as foreign nationals from the other 24 EU nations.Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said ministers were ""utterly opposed"" to European Commission proposals which he claimed would allow future migrants - including those from Bulgaria and Romania - to claim benefits on ""day one"" after arriving. But a spokesman for the European Commission described the minister's claims as ""total tosh"" and said EU nations were not obliged to do so unless certain residency tests are met. "

Crime evolves and we must evolve with it.""In the last year alone, we have seen successful confiscation orders against people who have participated in all types of crime, including drug dealing, selling counterfeit goods, embezzlement, human trafficking and benefit fraud.""We will continue to use our experience and expertise to maximise disruption to criminal enterprises.""In the past financial year, more than £4.3 million was netted from those involved in the so-called ""black fish"" cases, relating to large-scale undeclared landings of fish in the north of Scotland.Confiscation orders totalling £4,314,290 were made last year against a number of vessel skippers, as well as Shetland Catch Ltd and Fresh Catch Ltd.Others whose wallets were targeted included James Mangan, 54, Robert Robb, 65, and Craig Hunter, 41, members of an organised crime network involved in importing Class A drugs, which was unearthed by Strathclyde Police's Operation Trust.The Civil Recovery Unit (CRU) will also recover £5.6m after Aberdeen-based drilling company Abbot Group Ltd accepted it had benefited from corrupt payments made in connection with a 2006 contract entered into by one of its overseas subsidiaries and an overseas oil and gas company. The money will be paid in three stages to the end of March 2015.The ownership and structure of Abbot is said to have changed significantly since that time.In another notable case, the home of gangland figure Kevin ""Gerbil"" Carroll, who was gunned down in a supermarket car park in 2010, was seized by authorities last year.Over the last 10 years more than £50m was netted by the SOCD, which deals with the confiscation of proceeds of crime following a conviction.The remaining £30.5m was secured by the CRU, which can recover proceeds of crime through the civil courts without the need for a criminal conviction.Last year confiscation orders amounting to £8,025,600 were secured by the SOCD and orders to the tune of £4,123,156 were granted following work by the CRU.Solicitor General Lesley Thomson QC, who announced the figures, said: ""By full use of the proceeds of crime legislation, law enforcement can strike at the very heart of criminality in Scotland to ensure that criminal networks big and small are disrupted and dismantled.""My message is clear - if you try to make a profit from crime, the Crown will use this legislation to the maximum to take that profit from you and ensure it is put it to a much better use in communities across Scotland through the Scottish government's CashBack scheme.""The initiative, CashBack for Communities, is a scheme which takes money recovered through proceeds of crime legislation and invests it in activities and facilities for young people at risk of turning to a life of crime.Since it began in 2007, more than £50m has been ploughed back into Scottish communities.Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said: ""Prosecutors and police are cracking down on organised crime and criminals have nowhere to hide.""More than £12m has been confiscated from criminals last year, hitting them where it hurts - their wallets.""Our communities are benefiting from the hard work of prosecutors and police putting ill-gotten gains to good use through our CashBack for Communities Programme, which invests crooks' cash in facilities and activities for our young people and their communities across the length and breadth of the country."""

The US DoD has about 600,000 smartphone users, said Col Pickart, about 470,000 of whom were using Blackberry handsets. The remainder was split between people using both Google Android and Apple phones in a series of trials to assess whether the devices could be used securely. According to one report on Federal News Radio, the approval of other handset makers is part of a US DoD plan to more than double the number of secure mobile devices used by its armed forces by 2014. Alongside this will be built a secure system to manage all these devices and their associated app stores. Commercial bids to provide this are currently being assessed.Blackberry handsets dominate within the US military because, before now, it was the only make to meet the Department's stringent security demands. Samsung phones were among the first to win approval because of work done on a hardened version of the Android operating system called Knox that also met those security requirements. Gadgets that run Apple's iOS 6 operating system as well as other Android phones are currently undergoing testing by the Defense Information Systems Agency and are expected to be approved by the end of the month.At the same time Samsung won approval, Blackberry 10 smartphones and Playbook tablets were also ruled safe to use on military networks.

""I hadn't prepared for anything, it was a case of winging it and making it up as I went along.""Mr Drummond, a father-of-three, said he had an ""extended honeymoon period"" with those outside the civic centre, but not some of the councillors he was working alongside. ""The public saw me as one of them and almost put a protective arm around me to support me through those early years. ""Getting the respect and credibility from councillors?  I probably haven't even got it from some of them now, but that was always going to be a challenge."" There was a ""huge shift"" in attitudes, Mr Drummond said, when he was re-elected in 2005 with a majority of more than 10,000.He looks back over his tenure with pride.""I've been quite overwhelmed by the support I've been given from people and the amount of people who have expressed their disappointment at what's happened,"" he said.""If all those people had voted in the referendum we might have had a different result.""The mayor insisted the result of the poll does not rankle with him personally as he would not have stood for a fourth term.""It's a shame that nobody else will get the opportunity to step into my shoes and bring a fresh pair of eyes to it and take it to the next stage,"" he said.""It's not really the system of governance that's important, it's about how the town fares and the decisions that are made.""Having one directly-accountable figurehead for the town has helped Hartlepool punch above its weight, Mr Drummond believes.""Hartlepool is like one of the biggest villages in the country. There's a strong community spirit and a lot of local pride here. ""To have somebody to be able to promote that on a regional, national and international basis is a big benefit.""Hosting the Tall Ships in 2010 gave the town a huge boost in confidence, the mayor said.""For us to bring the world to Hartlepool and see so many people smiling and enjoying themselves, that doesn't really happen that often.  ""Every day in this role you're always trying to improve things and make people feel better in their own lives. The Tall Ships did it perfectly.""Mr Drummond took a deep breath before describing the ""most challenging"" role of his life.Soon after joining Cleveland Police Authority, he found himself elevated to chair. ""Little did I realise the 12 months that lay ahead,"" he said.""I didn't realise the state the authority was in.  It was on the verge of government intervention because it was so poorly governed.""Operation Sacristy, a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption at the authority, began in May 2011, six months before Mr Drummond took over.The investigation continues and the former chief constable and deputy chief constable have been sacked for gross misconduct in recent months following separate misconduct hearings.""If it was a TV drama it would be quite hard to believe,"" Mr Drummond said.""In the fullness of time everything will be made available and people will make their own conclusions. All I can say is I wouldn't want to go through that again.""If Mr Drummond breathed a sigh of relief on leaving his police role, his wife Rebecca will be even happier when he leaves his current job.""She cannot wait for 6 May when I won't be elected mayor anymore.  She doesn't like the attention it brings and some of the publicity. She's really looking forward to it.""So what does the future hold? There are, Mr Drummond said, ""a couple of irons in the fire"".""I've had some interviews recently and I've been telling some of these tales and people have been flabbergasted.""From day one the whole thing has been unconventional. It's not a bad thing to have on your CV I don't suppose.  ""Whatever I do next I will always be banging the drum for Hartlepool.""That's in my blood now."""

They demand land and jobs for the poor, and ultimately want to establish a ""communist society"" by overthrowing India's ""semi-colonial, semi-feudal"" form of rule.In an editorial titled Act tough on red terror, the Hindustan Times says the attack ""must be condemned in the strongest possible terms"".""Doubts about the Maoists being engaged in anything short of a civil war should now be laid to rest. This is no longer just a battle between the Maoists and the police and paramilitary forces. ""It is an all-out war against the Republic of India. By attacking the political class in this manner the Maoists have made it clear that they will give no quarter and that the war will not stop until they are decimated,"" the paper says.The Times of India says the massacre of Congress leaders and workers in Chhattisgarh is ""a tragedy wrapped in complacency"".""Saturday's strike is a grim reminder that while Maoist onslaughts in states such as West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa have decidedly been blunted, Chhattisgarh continues to test the capacity of the centre and the [state's] BJP government to coordinate their counter-insurgency offensive,"" the paper says.""The relative calm in a few other states in the Red Zone appeared to have lulled the security forces into a strange complacency,"" it adds.The Indian Express describes the ambush as ""one of the most daring and vicious attacks"".""This [the attack] should dispel any romantic illusions about the Naxal cause. The fight is not for the greater welfare of the tribals on whose behalf they claim to be staging this revolutionary intervention, but for the destruction of the democratic state. The paper says the state must ""establish its presence in the dense wilds of Bastar and Dantewada, which have been virtually left to the Maoists. Writing in the Firstpost, security analyst Praveen Swami says India must make a fundamental choice: ""to decide if our democracy is worth killing for"". ""Large elements of India's elite don't have the stomach for a long and dirty war - which is what all insurgencies involve. For years, there's been a complicity with the killing - on the Left because of misplaced guilt over India's hideous failures to ensure equity for citizens; on the right, because of the misguided belief that geographical distance allows for apathy. ""It's been facilitated by the fact that police officers' lives are cheap, because the local Dalam [Maoist unit] commander can be bribed to let mines and factories run, and because Maoists aren't - yet - setting off bombs in our cities.""The Hindu, however, strikes a note of caution saying the killings should not be allowed to worsen the situation in Chhattisgarh.""Saturday's attack is likely to end up being used by sections of the political establishment to push for larger, more lethal operations by the paramilitary forces and the police... ""Violence must always be turned into an opportunity to push for peace, and never as an excuse to use the armed might of the state on hapless villagers living in fear of both the Maoists and the security personnel,"" it adds.

20237	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25410915	Opinion	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	bbc.co.uk	"Michael Bloomberg has overseen the transformation of New York City during his 12 years as mayor. But as he prepares to leave office the billionaire businessman's political legacy is contested.In a city that favours large and flamboyant personalities, Michael Bloomberg is hardly the sort to light up a room. He is a data-driven technocrat, an entrepreneur with vast personal wealth but lacking comparable charisma.At a valedictory appearance at a school in Harlem earlier this month the departing mayor revealed his strengths and weaknesses. Delivering an update on a major snowstorm about to hit New York, the 71-year-old appeared to be going through the mayoral motions: performing one of the basic, but essential, functions that seem almost to bore him. However, when he talked about the subject at hand, the provision of free wi-fi internet in what has traditionally been one of New York's most rundown neighbourhoods, he was animated and engaged. The project, he claimed, would reduce the digital divide, provide a much-needed economic boost, and make Harlem more liveable.New York used to be assailed for its dysfunction, high crime rates and ungovernability. It could have suffered decades of decline like Detroit. But during his 12 years in charge Mike Bloomberg has tried to turn the city into a laboratory for civic renewal and reform. Coming to office shortly after the attacks of 9/11, which ripped the heart out of the Lower Manhattan, he was fearful of an urban exodus that would starve New York of tax revenues and dull its vibrant character. The early emphasis was on recovery. During his second and third terms, it has been on transformation.Globally, he is best known for his smoking ban in restaurants, bars and parks, a policy mimicked around the world. Calorie counts are now mandatory on menus at restaurant chains, so that customers are equipped to make healthier choices about what they eat. He has banned trans-fat food additives, which are known to clog the arteries. Partly as a result of Bloomberg's public health initiatives, life expectancy is now at a record high in New York. A child born today can expect to live 80.9 years, which is 2.2 years above the national average. New York has changed in other ways, too, whether it is in the proliferation of bike lanes, the introduction of a bike sharing scheme, or the redevelopment of large swathes of the city. Some 40,000 new buildings have been constructed since he took office. A third of the city has been ""re-zoned,"" easing the path for developers.  Bloomberg looks upon New York's once neglected waterways as the city's ""sixth borough,"" and the shoreline of Brooklyn is unrecognisable from when he took office. Stylishly landscaped parkland has replaced semi-derelict wastelands. Landmarks like The Highline, where a disused raised railway line has been turned into an elegant greenway, has become popular with New Yorkers and tourists alike. Small wonder. It is stunning. Though Bloomberg does not deserve all the credit, he helped make it happen. Former aides, like Bill Cunningham, who served as Bloomberg's communications chief, says that he brought the skills of a successful CEO to the mayor's office. ""Mike believed you hire people and then you give them the authority to run their agencies. 'Here's your budget. You know the issues. I've hired you. I'm gonna back you up. Now go do a good job.'""""And generally, the last words he would say to somebody after he swore them in was: 'Now don't mess it up.' But he didn't say 'mess'."" Rather than being overbearing and autocratic, says Cunningham, Bloomberg delegated a lot of authority.Others, however, bemoan what they claim is an imperious approach.  Ronna Texidor became a community activist because of Bloomberg's support for a redevelopment in Greenwich Village where she lives. She can't wait to see the back of him. ""He just makes pronouncements. Edicts!"" she exclaims. There have also been notable setbacks. Bloomberg was unable to bring in a congestion charge, his preferred solution to the problem of rush-hour gridlock. His battle to ban over-sized fizzy drinks, a key part of his public health drive, was deemed unlawful. Then, there are the areas where his legacy is bitterly contested. Tough policing policies, known as stop-and-frisk, may have contributed to a fall in homicide rates. Murders are down 65% since he came to office. Shootings are down 53%. However, civil liberties groups have campaigned against stop-and-frisk, complaining that the policy unfairly discriminates against minorities. A US district court judge deemed the policy, which allows the police to stop and search anyone if they believe a crime is about to occur or to have occurred, to be unconstitutional. Waterfront neighbourhoods, like the hipster haven of Williamsburg, have become ridiculously fashionable, but long-time residents complain they have also become ridiculously expensive. The broader criticism is that the business-friendly mayor has presided over a city where the divide between the super-rich and the rest has becoming a gaping chasm. The recent mayoral election demonstrated how polarised the city has become. The conventional wisdom going into the campaign was that a Bloomberg-lite candidate - a politician who would carry on his reform agenda with mild modifications - would emerge victorious. Instead, the winner, the Democrat Bill de Blasio, cast himself as the anti-Bloomberg. De Blasio's tale of two cities - of how the rich had benefited under the billionaire mayor, but the middle class and poor had been left behind - had resonated powerfully. Even admirers, like Professor Steven Cohen, the Executive Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, think Bloomberg probably overstayed his welcome. After serving two terms, he successfully lobbied the City Council to amend its charter so that he could seek a third. ""I think people are going to look back on his administration very positively. I think he will be ranked among the great mayors of the city along with [Fiorello] La Guardia. But I think you know that by year 10,11,12 it's just, a lot of exposure and people were tired of him and so they were looking for the un-Bloomberg.""So what does a former mayor think? David Dinkins, who served between 1990 and 1993, was the first and so far only African-American to occupy the office. Overall, he's been a fan of Bloomberg. ""I think that he accomplished a lot and his motivation is, I think, a good one, a positive one. Some of us seek to be involved in government and politics because we want to see our names in lights, but I don't think that's the case with respect to Mike Bloomberg.""""How did he change New York?"" I ask. ""For the better,"" replies David Dinkins. ""Period.""Because the mayor has set in motion so many long-term projects, his successors will be performing ribbon-cutting duties for decades to come. But the argument over his contribution to New York life is sure to outlive the man himself."

Alerts can be sent manually by a rights worker if they feel under threat or are triggered automatically if the bracelet is forcefully removed. The alarm sends out information about its owner and where they were when they were attacked. Other staff nearby will also be alerted so they can start to take action to help anyone in distress.Civil Rights Defenders wants people to sign up to monitor the bracelets of individual rights workers via social media. It hopes the global involvement will act as a deterrent to anyone planning attacks on aid workers. ""Most of us, given the chance, would like to help others in danger,"" said Civil Rights Defenders' executive director Robert Hardh. ""These civil rights defenders are risking their lives for others to have the right to vote, or to practise religion or free speech.""Those who monitor bracelets can also help bring pressure to bear on governments to find or release people abducted or jailed.

Federal prosecutors said that during the 2002 mid-term election campaign, Mr DeLay's aides took $190,000 (£121,935) donated by corporate lobbyists to a campaign committee he controlled and gave it to an arm of the Republican National Committee. That group then distributed the funds to seven state legislative candidates.Six of those candidates won, giving the Republican Party control of the Texas House of Representatives, which later pushed through a redistricting plan that sent more Republicans to Washington in 2004, solidifying Mr DeLay's hold on power.Mr DeLay contended the swap was legal and that no corporate money was given to state-level candidates. He denounced the prosecution as a political vendetta.A Texas jury convicted him in November 2010. The following January he was sentenced to three years in prison but was allowed to remain free pending appeal.On Thursday, the appeals court ruled that the prosecution had ""failed in its burden to prove that the funds that were delivered to the seven candidates were ever tainted"".Mr DeLay's attorney, Brian Wice, told the Associated Press Mr DeLay felt vindicated.""He's ecstatic.

20390	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21203235	Opinion	0	Republican Scandals	None	Neutral	Negative	bbc.co.uk	"Bobby Jindal is warning that the Republicans must stop being the ""stupid party"".The Louisiana governor, a likely contender for his party's presidential nomination in 2016, said a number of Republicans had ""damaged the brand"" by making ""offensive and bizarre"" comments. He's talking of course about those remarks about ""legitimate rape"" and how rape can't lead to pregnancy. The Republicans who made those comments did seem to be going out of their way to back up John Stuart Mill's 1866 comment: ""I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative. I believe that is so obviously and universally admitted a principle that I hardly think any gentleman will deny it."" OK. That's the headline grabber. But it is hardly a revelation to point out that those who make weird noises during an election campaign should shut up.So it is worth looking at Gov Jindal's prescription in full. It is, after all, among the first contributions from a big name of the Republican party on how not to go down to defeat for a third time in a row. He's adamant the party shouldn't change its principles. Not on taxation or big government, of course. But not on abortion or gay marriage either. He rejects Mr Romney's apparent contention that 47% of voters were out of reach for Republicans, which was always, when you think about it, a counsel of despair. Gov Jindal identifies a core Republican problem: they are overwhelmingly white in a country that is becoming more of a melting pot day by day.""We must reject the notion that demography is destiny, the pathetic and simplistic notion that skin pigmentation dictates voter behaviour,"" he said.He's a good person to say this. His parents came to the US from India in 1970. It says a lot about the way America has changed that he has become the governor of a state that resisted civil rights and defended segregation to the bitter end. I don't want to underplay how important that is - but his speech doesn't say how Republicans can reach the fastest growing ethnic group - Latinos - without shifting their stance on immigration reform. Moreover, I am puzzled by what appears to be the core of his message. He rejects big government - but also seems to reject the fights about it in Washington. He calls not only the debates about gun control, but also those on the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling ""sideshows"". ""These are in reality sideshows in Washington that we have allowed to take centre stage in our country - and as conservatives, we are falling into the sideshow trap,"" he said. This is not an isolated point.""We seem to have an obsession with government bookkeeping,"" he says. ""We as Republicans have to accept that government number crunching - even conservative number crunching - is not the answer to our nation's problems.""Of course he's underscoring an inherent irony in conservatism - those politicians who dislike government put all their time and effort and will and money into becoming part of the government, so they can do away with much of it.Inevitably, they rather like being part of it, and stick around for years trying to slim down something they disapprove of, fanatical dieters insisting on eating at the best restaurants so they can better control the portion sizes. It is an irony, in that one can chuckle about it, but it is not a paradox. It is, I would have thought, pretty essential for conservatives who want to control government spending to have control of that government. His argument seems to be that Republicans should spend their time encouraging the ""real economy"" and leaving it up to the states to spend what little public money he deems necessary.Maybe this is merely a coded attack on those Republicans in the House of Representatives, who seem to think they won the election. If he is identifying them as a major part of the party's image problem, he is right, but he's not pointing a way out of their complex dilemma - the choice between being quislings to faithful Republicans or obstructionists in the mind of most Americans. So an ""A"" for effort, grabbing headlines, and identifying the obvious, but a ""C"" for a rather confused economic approach, which looks more like a desire to say something jolting than a serious contribution. I'm looking forward to hearing Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and, even more, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, describe the way ahead. But Gov Jindal has made a start confronting his shocked, and rather complacent, party. "

""The IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity. This report shows that some of its employees failed that test.""He spoke as a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) report found that senior IRS officials had told inspectors the decision to focus on Tea Party and other groups based upon their names or policy positions was not influenced by any individual or organisation outside the agency.But it found managers had allowed ""inappropriate criteria"" to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, resulting in ""substantial delays"" in processing applications for tax-exempt status, and requests for ""unnecessary information"", such as lists of past and future donors.Of the 296 total applications reviewed by TIGTA, 108 were approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicants, and 160 were still open, the report said. In response, the acting IRS Commissioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities, Joseph Grant, said: ""We believe the front line career employees that made the decisions acted out of a desire for efficiency and not out of any political or partisan view point.""Mr Obama's press secretary, Jay Carney, said earlier that no-one at the White House had known about the matter until lawyers were told several weeks ago TIGTA would publish a report.At least three Congressional committees are planning hearings into the matter.The House Ways and Means committee will hold a hearing on Friday. The Senate finance and investigations committees have also said they will hold hearings. ""This was a targeting of the president's political enemies, effectively, and lies about it during the election year so that it wasn't discovered until afterwards,"" senior Republican Congressman Darrell Issa told CBS on Tuesday.Two high-profile Republican governors called on President Obama to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether any laws were broken.""This is big brother come to life and a witch hunt to prevent Americans from exercising their first amendment [free speech] rights,"" Governors Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Scott Walker of Wisconsin wrote.Ahead of the 2012 presidential election, conservative groups complained to the IRS and to members of Congress that their applications for tax-exempt status were being held up.

20725	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24393350	News	0	Economy	Republican Scandals	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	bbc.co.uk	"A faction of the Republican Party believes it cannot lose the battle over raising the US government's borrowing limit - either they dismantle the Democrats' healthcare reform, or the country has to live within its means for a while. But will the rest of the party stick with them?It is a high-stakes gambit - the US has never before breached its authority to borrow money to fund its obligations, and most experts warn it could be catastrophic. But a group of hard-line conservatives in Congress think it is worth the risk. Dozens of Republican politicians, such as Steve King of Iowa, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, and Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, have suggested in interviews that the US government could prioritise its payments in the event of a debt limit breach, choosing to fund some government expenses - while drastically cutting others. ""If you don't raise the debt ceiling, what that means is you have a balanced budget,"" Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said on CNN last week. ""It doesn't mean you wouldn't pay your bills.""The strategy hinges on convincing President Barack Obama that conservatives are willing to break the debt ceiling and devastate the Democratic Party's government priorities, while assuring Republican big-business backers that this would not destroy the economy. It is a fine line, but conservative grass-roots groups think they have found the silver bullet to kill Mr Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law, which Republican Representative John Fleming of Louisiana called in typical remarks ""the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress"".If the debt limit is breached so that ""Obamacare"" can be destroyed and Americans be taught they can live with less government, so be it. ""Liberals might be so concerned about settling this issue because they do not want Americans to realize that we can survive just fine with a lot less government spending,"" Jeffrey Dorfman writes in Forbes. ""Perhaps we will be better off in the long run if government gets a little taste of what so many families have been experiencing for years: staying within a budget.""First-term Republican Representative Ted Yoho of Florida said in an interview with the Washington Post that hitting the debt limit would ""bring stability to the world markets"", as it would prove the country is serious about balancing its budget.Without the risk of a sovereign debt default, and with Democratic interests feeling the pain of a predicted 32% cut in overall government spending, the theory goes, Republicans would finally have a negotiating advantage. ""We hit the debt ceiling, and the world won't end,"" says Dean Clancy, vice-president of public policy for FreedomWorks, a conservative grassroots activism group. ""Once the public and Wall Street understand that default is not really a possibility, the president's leverage will be greatly diminished and a bipartisan compromise will be achievable.""Other Republicans counter that such a strategy is both impractical and dangerous. Even if the treasury department could figure out how to prioritise payments, the uncertainty created by such an action would devastate financial markets.""The issue here is honouring our debt obligations,"" says Bill Hoagland, a senior vice-president at the Bipartisan Policy Center who served as a budget aide to former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. ""It's stupid, and it's unbelievable we're even having this conversation.""Speaker of the House John Boehner, a reluctant recruit to the current budget fight over healthcare reform, has shown hesitation to take the plunge with the conservative caucus once more. Although he continues to assert that his party is united, there were reports in the media last week that he told nervous colleagues that he would not allow a default on the debt - even if that meant relying on Democratic support to pass a debt limit increase. Civil warAccording to Republican campaign strategist and pollster Matthew Towery, the hard-line conservatives will soon learn their plan is unworkable. As in the economic crisis of 2008, when Congress did not pass an economic rescue bill until the stock market took a 700-point drop, rank-and-file Republicans will turn once the financial markets show signs of stress, he says.""The president has blatantly stated that Wall Street should be concerned,"" Mr Towery says. ""He wants a drop, as he knows what that would do. They would have to take immediate action.""At that point, enough Republicans would come around to give Mr Boehner cover to bring a debt limit increase to a vote in the House. ""The [Republican] House majority has a pack mentality until things start to go wrong,"" Mr Towery says. ""Once that happens, Boehner not only will have the votes, he'll probably get a majority of the conference to go along with him."" As the debt limit approaches, what has been termed a Republican ""civil war"" between hard-line conservatives and the party establishment may be approaching its end game. The conservative caucus has proven it is willing to continue to escalate the standoff until it achieves unconditional victory. With strong backing from voters at home and a view the ""Obamacare"" healthcare reform is an existential threat to the country, compromise is not an option.At some point, however, the rest of the Republican Party may decide it is ready to get off this ride.""I think Republicans just want out of this mess altogether,"" Mr Towery says."
20726	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24388669	Opinion	0	Economy	Republican Scandals	SomewhatPositive	Negative	bbc.co.uk	"John Boehner has spent most of his House speakership trying to keep the various factions of his Republican majority together. With the recent government shutdown crisis, Boehner's ability to manage his caucus is once again being tested.On 26 September, the US was days away from a deadline to pass legislation funding the government. A small group of House Republicans gathered to plot strategy on a conference call with Texas Senator Ted Cruz.According to a report in the National Review, the congressmen - some of the most conservative in Washington - asked Mr Cruz for advice on how to respond to House Speaker John Boehner's proposal to keep the government open. They hoped to tie it to the uphill battle of defunding President Obama's health care reform. The first-term senator, a darling of the conservative Tea Party movement that gained prominence opposing Obamacare in 2010, told them to oppose it. The Republicans took the message to the floor of the House, and the speaker's plan died that evening without a vote. Five days later, Mr Boehner was throwing all his efforts behind the drive to end Obamacare, and the government was shuttered.House rank and file organising against a leadership position - conspiring with a junior member of the Senate, no less - would have been unthinkable in previous congresses. But this was only the most recent example of the ongoing problem Mr Boehner has had controlling his party caucus. The rebellious faction hails from solidly conservative, mostly rural areas across the country. They've been called the ""weird caucus"" by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the ""suicide caucus"" by Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, in reference to a disregard for their party's survival. They sometimes refer to themselves as ""wacko birds"", adopting as their own the derisive label given to them by Republican Senator John McCain. Time and again - in national security debates, immigration reform, disaster relief, defence authorisations, and even agriculture appropriations - Mr Boehner has found his position undermined by these rebellious legislators. Buoyed by the Tea Party, the backbenchers are unswayed by the kinds of carrots and sticks that kept their predecessors in line. This group includes Justin Amash of Michigan - who has voted against his party's leadership 126 times, more than any other Republican House member. At the end of last year, he was one of four Republican congressmen stripped of committee seats because of political apostasy. Undeterred, on 24 July he bucked leadership once again. He led efforts to curtail drastically the warrantless surveillance programme of the National Security Agency (NSA), which failed by only 12 votes. Steve King of Iowa is another thorn in Mr Boehner's side, working all year to round up votes to block a bipartisan immigration reform bill passed by the Senate - if it comes to the floor of the House. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana helped kill a leadership-backed agriculture bill because it contained funding for food stamps. Scott Rigell of Virginia was one of the first to demand that a reluctant Mr Boehner call the House back from recess in August to vote on strikes against Syria. Paul Broun of Georgia, who is currently running for a Senate seat, said he would not vote for legislation that ""does not fit the Judeo-Christian biblical principles that our country was founded on"". He has voted against House leadership 84 times, including on a January bill to provide disaster aid for Hurricane Sandy victims.""The thing that's different about these Republicans is their unwillingness to bargain,"" says Vanderbilt University public policy professor Bruce Oppenheimer. ""I'm not sure if it's because they lack government experience or they've made such strong promises to their constituencies, but they've put their feet in cement and can't or won't move.""Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker looked at their congressional districts and found that, wacko or not, these representatives are reflecting the will of the voters who sent them to Washington, a decidedly different demographic than America at large.They ""represent an America where the population is getting whiter, where there are few major cities, where Obama lost the last election in a landslide, and where the Republican Party is becoming more dominant and more popular,"" he wrote. ""Meanwhile, in national politics, each of these trends is actually reversed.""In effect, writes Philip Bump in the Atlantic, there is a third party - with Mr Cruz as its leader - forming in Congress to the right of the Republican Party. This has forced Mr Boehner to operate more like the tolerant head of a coalition government than an iron-fisted speaker of a past era, who could make or break a politician's career at will. These challenges to Republican leadership will likely continue as long as party members fear a primary opponent from their right more than general election defeat or punishment from the House leadership. Recent Republican-led reforms have limited the leadership's ability to dole out appropriations to reward loyalty, and the power of the Republican establishment to protect its chosen candidates has waned.The ""weird caucus"" is only a small segment of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, but it represents the spear tip of the restive Tea Party base. Its support, or approbation, can mean the difference between a clear field in the next round of primary elections or a battle for political survival.""Although very few Republicans have been defeated in primaries, there's always concern among some that if they don't at least toe the line, someone will fund a challenger,"" Mr Oppenheimer says. ""It's like a monster in the closet or under the bed for them. Of course, sometimes there really are monsters in the closet."""
20760	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24433182	Opinion	1	Economy	Republican Scandals	Neutral	Negative	bbc.co.uk	"On a very simple level, the closing of most of the American federal government can be pinned on the ambitions of one man, Speaker of the House John Boehner.There is little doubt that Mr Boehner, a Republican, could, whenever he wants, gather enough votes from moderate Republicans and most, if not all, Democrats to reopen the government.   But conventional wisdom says the Republican caucus would swiftly dethrone Mr Boehner. And, interestingly, conventional wisdom and punditry, in Washington at least, don't blame Mr Boehner one bit for holding the government hostage to his career aspirations. Thus is the cynicism of this town today.Why he is so attached to sticking with such a bruising job is another question. His caucus is balkanised and unruly. This Congress is held in the lowest public esteem since the invention of public opinion polls. And the Republicans are more disliked than the Democrats.  Once seen as a skilled dealmaker, Mr Boehner isn't able to make deals. Never seen as an ideologue, he has now relinquished control of the Republican policy agenda to the party's most ideological faction. Where's the fun? To put the question another way: Why can't the leader of the party in Congress control the party on the most important issues and votes?The answers apply equally to Democrats and Republicans. A series of self-inflicted errors by the two political parties over the past 40 years have left party leaders with no whip and little power.After Vietnam and Watergate, there was a reform spirit that wanted to open and democratise the process of selecting party candidates for office, as well as get special-interest money out of politics.The first part worked too well. Party candidates all came to be picked through open primary elections. In the process, the parties lost the ability to select loyal candidates in smoke-filled back rooms - they lost a source of power and persuasion.The campaign finance reforms, however, backfired entirely. The post-Richard Nixon idea was to stop party bosses from doling out money from local moguls, unions and corporations. Instead, the reforms deformed and opened the spigots for money to flow directly to candidates from all the old sources, bypassing the party machines. The quantities of money have grown to gargantuan proportions.By the 1980s, politicians were essentially free agents. They didn't need the parties to get nominated or to fund campaigns. Pollsters, advertising wizards and fundraisers replaced the party bosses. And the party leaders in Congress lost their leverage.At the same time, computers and marketing data gave political professionals new precision in drawing the map of congressional districts. Individual districts have become much more homogenous - overwhelmingly Democratic or Republican. It has never been easy to unseat an incumbent. But now, once candidates of the dominant party in these gerrymandered districts get the nomination, they are home free.So members of the Congress, especially in the House, mostly have safe seats and are immune from challenges by the other party. Their bigger challenges come from within their own parties and that tends to drive them further right or left. Voting patterns are as partisan now as at any time since after the Civil War.All that means the House is filled with increasingly ideological members who aren't especially worried about re-election and are impervious to the party whip and discipline. It is legislative chaos. John Boehner carries an extra burden as a Republican. From 1949 to 1995, the Democrats controlled the House except for two years in the 1950s. That is a long time to be in the political wilderness, with the Republicans effectively shut out of governing and legislative power. They developed a sort of frustrated minority party mentality, locked out of power and able only to toss bombs, make mischief and obstruct.Since the 1920s, Republicans have controlled the White House, Senate and House of Representatives at the same time only during parts of George W Bush's two terms. So modern House Republicans have had virtually no experience actually sharing the responsibility of governing. Their minority mentality lingers. And it shows.Republicans were led back to power in the House in 1995 by one of the most mischievous, incendiary party leaders ever, Newt Gingrich. He led the way to a government shutdown that year that was considered disastrous to Republicans.  But the Gingrich confrontation now seems far more rational than the Boehner shutdown. First off, back then Republicans also controlled the Senate and so had more leverage with the Democratic White House.And Mr Gingrich's Republicans were pushing for a broad set of coherent conservative changes to the budget. There were realistic grounds for negotiation. Mr Boehner's Republicans are pushing to repeal a sitting president's hallmark achievement a year after he was re-elected. There is no room for negotiation and no chance of success. It is purely a stunt, an act of guerrilla theatre.Mr Boehner was part of the House Republican leadership under Mr Gingrich. He was ousted in 1998, survived and was resurrected as party leader years later. One might have thought he had learned some strategic lessons from all that.It would have been great sport to watch if Mr Boehner had decided to gamble this time and take on so-called ""wacko bird"" conservatives. If he put together a coalition of more mainstream Republicans and Democrats, there would have been a classic intra-party feud, but there would not have been a shutdown.  It isn't written in stone that Mr Boehner would have lost his speakership after that battle. Perhaps a victory could have shifted the paralytic partisanship in the House today.  Ironically, chances are high Mr Boehner will have to cave eventually and team up with Democrats to avoid an economically irresponsible - and politically lethal - default on government debt obligations.  That will probably save his job, but it certainly won't make his job any more fun."

But he says he will not negotiate until Republicans agree to lift the dual threats of the government shutdown and the fiscal calamity looming if the US breaches the limit at which it is allowed to borrow money to fund its budget and debt obligations.On Tuesday, he said the Republicans were practicing ""extortion"" by demanding significant policy concessions, especially changes to his signature healthcare programme, in exchange for reopening the government and approving a rise in the debt ceiling.Leaders in the Republican Party, meanwhile, have attacked the president for refusing to negotiate.Following a meeting with Mr Obama on Wednesday, House Democrats, a minority in the chamber, reaffirmed their support for the president's demand that Republicans end the shutdown and raise the debt ceiling before negotiations take place.""We can talk while the government is open,"" Steny Hoyer told reporters. ""The government doesn't need to be shut for us to talk, and we can talk while we make sure that the government pays its bills."" Meanwhile House Republicans are reportedly considering a short-term increase in the debt limit as a means of breaking the political deadlock.Unnamed Republican officials told the Associated Press news agency on Wednesday the Party was exploring legislation to raise the debt ceiling for an undetermined length of time. No further details of the reported legislation were offered.As the ninth day of the partial government shutdown wore on, Democratic senators took to the US Capitol's steps to call on Republicans to reopen the government.The Senate's Democratic leaders have introduced legislation that would allow the US to borrow money through the end of 2014.But its path forward in the Senate is unclear, as the bill would have to attract several Republican votes to clear a procedural test vote, expected on Saturday.Complicating the political situation, a growing number of Republicans have questioned the extent of the economic damage if the US does breach the 17 October deadline without raising the borrowing limit.""I would dispel the rumour that is going around that you hear on every newscast that if we don't raise the debt ceiling we will default on our debt,"" Oklahoma Republican Senator Tom Coburn told CBS on Monday. ""We won't.""Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said that on 17 October the US will have exhausted its borrowing limit and will have only $30bn (£19bn) cash on hand to fund a government that can spend as much as $60bn on certain days.The IMF has warned a failure by Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling and US default would cause ""a worldwide shock"" to the economy.Also on Wednesday, the House, in a near-unanimous vote passed legislation to restore death benefits to families of fallen US soldiers. The defence department typically pays $100,000, tax-free, within three days of a soldier's death, but the shutdown left it no authority to pay.White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that Mr Obama was ""disturbed'' to learn a previous bill ensuring military members were paid during the shutdown did not cover the benefit, but that the administration hoped to find a resolution to the problem.Shortly after the House vote, Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel announced the Pentagon had struck a deal with the Fisher House Foundation, a private charity, to fund the benefits until the shutdown ends.""I am offended, outraged, and embarrassed that the government shutdown had prevented the Department of Defense from fulfilling this most sacred responsibility in a timely manner,"" Mr Hagel said."

Adult care, children and shared services such as libraries are all at risk.""Both keep their Cabinet jobs, but their decision means only three Conservatives remain on the 10-member Cabinet.Conservative group leader Fiona Ferguson, who voted for the freeze, said: ""If you stand as a Conservative candidate, people know you have certain principles and you try to stick by them.""On zero council council tax we have always been consistent, that's what we wanted to achieve if we could possibly do it.""Cuts include £855,000 from adult care and support, £723,000 from children, schools and families and £365,000 from shared services such as libraries.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Alex Folkes said: ""This budget will actually boost jobs numbers, not cut them.""We have said that the bulk of the savings should be made by transferring agency workers on to contract.""Conservative council leader Jim Currie, who supported the tax rise, called the freeze decision ""half baked"".""Everybody is in a state of shock but this is democracy, it's been done.""My job is to manage it and we'll try to make the best of it,"" he said."

He won 54% to 45%, and Ms Colbert Busch called to concede early in the evening.""The people have spoken, and I respect their decision,"" she said in a brief statement on Tuesday evening. Meanwhile, Mr Sanford was cheered by supporters as he said voters had sent ""a messenger to Washington DC on the importance of changing things in that fair city"".The race was competitive, though the district is seen as firmly Republican. No Democrat has represented the district since the early 1980s.The seat was left vacant when its previous occupant, Tim Scott, was appointed to a vacant Senate seat.Mr Sanford said ahead of the results he would retire from politics if defeated.""You can go back in and you can ask for a second chance in a political sense once,"" he said on Tuesday after voting. ""I've done that, and we'll see what the voters say.""The former governor, once considered a rising star in the Republican party, saw his political fortunes fall in 2009 when he acknowledged an extramarital affair.After telling his staff he was hiking the famed Appalachian Trail and disappearing for several days, the then-married governor returned to the state to admit that he had been in Argentina with a mistress.He was censured by the state legislature and fined $70,000 (£45,000) for the travel expenses - the largest ethics fine in state history. But Mr Sanford defied numerous calls to step down before his term ended in January 2011.He divorced his wife, Jenny, and is now engaged to the Argentine woman, ex-TV reporter Maria Belen Chapur. Ms Colbert Busch, 58, is a businesswoman and the sister of television political satirist Stephen Colbert, who raised money for her campaign.She gained the endorsement of The Post and Courier, a major newspaper in the area, which said she offered ""responsible leadership"" and was ""a welcome tonic"" for ""Sanford fatigue"".Ms Colbert Busch focused on her business experience during the race, initially refusing to make Mr Sanford's past an issue.But last week, she reminded voters during a televised debate that Mr Sanford had used taxpayer money to leave the state for personal reasons.The former governor's attempt at a political comeback was not entirely smooth.Three weeks before the special election, it was revealed that his ex-wife had filed a court complaint alleging he had entered her house in February without permission, a violation of their divorce agreement.Mr Sanford said he had been unable to get in touch with her and had been in the house to watch the Super Bowl championship football game with his youngest son. He is due in court on Thursday.The national Republican party pulled its support from the campaign after the complaint became public."

Federal prosecutors said that during the 2002 mid-term election campaign, Mr DeLay's aides took $190,000 (£121,935) donated by corporate lobbyists to a campaign committee he controlled and gave it to an arm of the Republican National Committee. That group then distributed the funds to seven state legislative candidates.Six of those candidates won, giving the Republican Party control of the Texas House of Representatives, which later pushed through a redistricting plan that sent more Republicans to Washington in 2004, solidifying Mr DeLay's hold on power.Mr DeLay contended the swap was legal and that no corporate money was given to state-level candidates. He denounced the prosecution as a political vendetta.A Texas jury convicted him in November 2010. The following January he was sentenced to three years in prison but was allowed to remain free pending appeal.On Thursday, the appeals court ruled that the prosecution had ""failed in its burden to prove that the funds that were delivered to the seven candidates were ever tainted"".Mr DeLay's attorney, Brian Wice, told the Associated Press Mr DeLay felt vindicated.""He's ecstatic. He's gratified. He's just a little bit numb,"" he said. ""I'm hoping with today's victory, he will be able to resume his life as he once knew it."""

The Human Rights Act incorporates the convention into British law.Meanwhile, the Mail on Sunday reported Home Secretary Theresa May is planning to pull Britain out of the ECHR, stripping the Strasbourg court of its right to be involved in UK cases. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Grayling alluded to the possibility of scrapping the Human Rights Act - which the Lib Dems are committed to defending - saying: ""Well, self-evidently, if we are going to create a new legal framework we are not going to be able to keep the framework we've got at the moment.""We've got a lot of work to do on the detail - [to] look at exactly how we best do that, how we deliver change.""Commenting on the Convention itself, the cabinet minister said: ""If anyone sits down and reads it as a document they would struggle to find a word they disagreed with. It is sensible balance of rights and responsibilities.""But, in the interview with the Pienaar's Politics programme, he added: ""The decision-making in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has moved, I think, that Convention further and further away from the original intentions of its authors.""Asked to respond to critics who have claimed that being a signatory to the Convention is proof that Britain is a modern, compassionate society, Mr Grayling said: ""I was a human rights campaigner. I chaired the Amnesty International Group when I was at university."" He stressed his view that human rights were ""about some of the appalling things happening around the world - people being brutalised for their political views, people being put in jail"".Responding to Mr Grayling's comments, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes told the BBC the ECHR was a ""benchmark of human rights around the world"".He said the justice secretary was clearly taking ""a very right wing position"" which pandered to ""an obvious anti-Europeanism"".Mr Hughes added that while some structural problems had built up within the system, ""the Lib Dems were committed to keeping the Convention"". A Lib Dem source also told the BBC: ""There is absolutely zero prospect of Britain leaving the European Convention on Human Rights while the Liberal Democrats are in government. ""The Tories can posture all that they want about what's in their manifesto next time around, but that is up to them.""Earlier, Mr Grayling was quoted in the Sunday Telegraph as saying he would expect a future majority Conservative government to scrap the Human Rights Act - which was introduced under the last Labour government.The cabinet minister's remarks come after an outcry among some Conservatives that the party is failing to connect with traditional blue-collar members - following its defeat in the Eastleigh by-election on Thursday.The Conservatives finished third in Eastleigh, in Hampshire - behind the Liberal Democrats and the UK Independence Party (UKIP).Conservative party vice chairman Michael Fabricant said the party had struggled to present a distinctive message, while UKIP managed to attract Tory voters on issues such as crime and immigration.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Prime Minister David Cameron responded to the warnings by insisting there would be no ""lurch to the right"" by the Conservatives."
