U.S. Immigration Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agents have expressed strong concerns over House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and other Representatives pushing for immigration legislation that would legalize the status of America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants. 
In a public statement that will be released Thursday morning but has been provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release, USCIS Council president Kenneth Palinkas warned that Goodlatte (pictured), House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-VA), House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) seem to be following the same pathway that Senate “Gang of Eight” members did, regarding how they are working on immigration legislation. 
“At every step, this administration places obstacles and roadblocks in front of our adjudication officers in their attempts to protect our nation’s security and the American taxpayer,” Palinkas said. “I documented these abuses on more than one occasion with the authors of Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven [S. 744] only to have them ignored. 


“I worry the House may be following a similar path. Media reports reveal that Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman Paul Ryan, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are working to advance proposals to open citizenship benefits to the majority of those here illegally, in combination with proposals to expand visa programs.”
Palinkas warned, too, that any group of “step-by-step” House immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee, at which point they would be combined with the Senate bill and sent to the president for his signature, and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty. That is exactly what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Gang of Eight members Sens. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republicans have said they want to do. 
“These plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency – USCIS – that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card, temporary visa and citizenship applications,” Palinkas said. “Advancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at USCIS would be to invite disaster.”

In his statement, Palinkas cited a recent MSNBC report where Gutierrez said he, Goodlatte, and others have worked on a “compromise” position. That MSNBC report also noted that Goodlatte and other Republicans are working with Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), another Democrat, on a plan to get to conference with the Senate bill. Palinkas stated that USCIS agents have been, like they were from the Senate conversations, excluded from all discussions among House leaders. “Why aren’t USCIS officers being consulted on this ‘compromise’ offer?” Palinkas asked. 
He further expressed concern over Cantor’s GOP DREAM Act, tentatively called the KIDS act. “I am also worried about the arguments being used to support the KIDS Act, one piece of the wider citizenship plan being drafted,” Palinkas said. “Legislators, including Mr. Cantor and Mr. Goodlatte, have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens. But if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?” 
He warned that the KIDS Act may lead down a slippery slope. “This seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries,” Palinkas asserted. “Should we just expect that the next Secretary at DHS will use the arguments we are hearing in the House to enact the next Deferred Action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty?”
Palinkas alleged that, under the Obama administration, USCIS has been riddled with nefarious activities. “At USCIS, our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics, and I hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the House,” he said. 
He finished off his statement by listing several immigration issues he hoped House Republicans would address but have thus far not been willing to: “USCIS adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits. This includes the inability to conduct in-person interviews, the failure of our software system, the lack of training and office space, and pressure to rubber-stamp applications. We have become an approval machine,” “Failure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits,” “Administrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who, under law, are not properly eligible,” “Approval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them,” “A management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals, not US citizens and taxpayers, as the customer. We believe in treating all with respect and always will, but our agency’s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the American people.”

Goodlatte, Ryan, and Cantor are not the only Republicans still pushing to pass an immigration bill in the House of Representatives. According to the Miami Herald, Rep. Steve Southerland (R-FL) said about immigration: “We have to address it. It’s a moral issue.”
In addition, according to Politico, House GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said she thinks immigration should be a top priority for House Republicans this year. 
This coming weekend on Univision, McMorris Rodgers will say that House Speaker John Boehner “over the last few weeks has continued to talk about the importance of the House moving forward on immigration reform. I believe that we have a window here between now and the end of the year and that this is a priority.”
McMorris Rodgers is the fourth highest-ranking member in the House GOP conference.

I’m sure Jeffrey Goldberg got it right. Whatever the reason the President leaked his unhappiness with Bibi to Goldberg just a few days before the Israeli election–whether in an effort to influence the vote against Bibi, serve payback to Bibi for a perceived preference for Romney, or because the President could simply no longer suppress his dissatisfaction–it must indeed be unnerving to be the most powerful man on earth and have the elected leader of a tiny Middle Eastern country defy you. Especially when that country, in your opinion, owes you so much! 
You are their only reliable friend who watches helplessly as that little nation continues to isolate itself through its self-destructive policies. According to Goldberg, Obama has “become inured to what he sees as self-defeating policies of his Israeli counterpart…Obama said privately and repeatedly, “Israel doesn’t know what its own best interests are… Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.”


If only Israel would recognize the President’s genius. If only it would stop building in Jerusalem and E1 and allow the President to sprinkle his magic peace dust, then Hamas would beat its rockets into ploughshares and Hezbollah would turn its bombs into pruning hooks. But no. Ungrateful to the last, Bibi insists on disobeying the President and claiming all of Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capitol.
No doubt the President is likewise mystified at the Israeli people as well. How could the polls show that they will this week re-elect the intransigent Prime Minister who is doing so much to harm their country? The most powerful man on earth is reduced to watching from the sidelines and complaining to journalists that he knows how to protect Israel far better than the Israelis themselves.
Such an ungrateful nation.

And yet, perhaps the Israelis have finally figured out that they are a sovereign people whom, while immensely grateful to America for its friendship and support, are still best qualified to judge their security needs better than anyone else. Perhaps they have come to understand that another Democratic president named Bill Clinton, whom noone would argue has a sincere love of the Jewish people and a Jewish son-in-law, still pushed Israel into the Oslo agreements that left a thousand Israeli civilians blown to bits. Perhaps they have come to understand that if Chuck Hagel, President Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, was correct that, as a legislator from Nebraska he was “not an Israeli senator. I’m a United States senator,” then the Prime Minister of Israel is the likewise the leader of the Jewish state who must put the security of the Israeli people even before a nod of approval from the President of the United States.
Over the past four years Bibi has grown into one of Israel’s greatest ever leaders. The country is booming economically and in terms of security. Cranes dot the skyline of expanding Israeli cities, terror incidents are negligible compared to the Clinton era, and unlike the anemic American economy, Israel is humming along at about four percent annual growth. And if President Obama is right that, in spite of this prosperity, Israel is isolated in world opinion, then it is arguably no more so than it has been in the past, and, besides, what is better, a popular Israel riddled with dead Jews or an unpopular Israel filled with living ones?
But what President Obama does not understand about Netanyahu is that the inflexibility he accuses him of is born not of a narrow-minded obstinacy but rather of a confident Jewish pride and deep-seated conviction that has been Bibi’s lifelong hallmark.
In my desire in 1990 to launch a robust response to anti-Israel speeches at the Oxford Union, I booked Netanyahu to lecture at the University. Bibi, just 41 years old, had already electrified the world as Israel’s most capable defender at the UN. Bibi agreed to come with a single stipulation: “If I’m already making the trip, then work me like a horse.”
We obliged.

We picked him up in a special branch police car and as we drove through the grandeur of Oxford’s ancient center, he commented on the majesty of British academia and its incongruence with some of the petty anti-Israel sentiment that is often expressed within its halls. Arriving at St. Antony’s College for a private forum with Oxford Middle East experts, Bibi put one foot on a chair and for the next 90 minutes held forth on the justice of Israel’s cause, surrounded as it was by nation’s sworn to its destruction. As he finished, the attacks came in fast and furious in what had to be one of the most hostile audiences he ever addressed. He did not blink, he did not flinch, he did not bend. When the last question ended, he turned to me to ask what next. After two more speeches, we took him to my home where we had arranged a dinner with Rhodes Scholars, many of them Jewish, most critical of Israeli policy. This time Bibi was softer in presentation but just as firm in conviction. Israel was a righteous nation, focused on maintaining democracy and human rights while facing existential threats on nearly every border. He spoke to the students of their responsibility to be proud defenders of their people and never bend in the face of opposition. The climax of the day was a lecture at the Union itself. Palestinian and Jewish protesters rallied outside in their hundreds with the rallying cry: “Net-an-ya-hu you should know, we support the P-L-O.” Bibi left his security bubble and walked over to the protesters. “Come inside and listen. Then you can protest. I’ll answer every question you ask.”
Many left their barricades and joined the large crowd inside. What followed was one of the great speeches I have heard, a mesmerizing presentation of the need for democracy across the Middle East and the liberalization of Arab governments that deny their citizens their God-given human rights. At its high point Bibi said, “Many of us in Israel have buried children and lost brothers, in fulfillment of a simple dream for Jews to finally live and prosper in a country of their own in peace.” He did not have to mention whom he was referring to as even his detractors knew of Entebbe and the hero-brother he had lost.
Again he was bombarded with hostile questions. He responded patiently but forcefully. When he finished he was given a standing ovation by most of the students in the hall. It was a night few of us would forget.
No Israeli Prime Minister has ever been as American as Bibi. And yet no Prime Minister has so successfully resisted the pressure from the leader of a country he loves so much for a country he loves even more. And the Israeli people, in supporting Bibi regardless of the absence of a stamp of approval from President Obama, are finally realizing that Israel cannot ultimately be protected from Washington but Jerusalem, especially when the current American Administration is not in step with the strong sympathy of the American people for a tiny and just nation fighting for its life.

When the trifecta of scandals first broke over the White House a few weeks ago, the media (who were literally blocking the truth from getting out about the IRS and Benghazi) were so caught off guard that for a couple of weeks they accidentally acted like real media and just reported the facts. Over Memorial Day weekend that all changed. 
It is fairly obvious that the media used the three-day weekend to gather themselves, talk to the White House, and coordinate talking points with one another. The result of this coordination has been apparent in the words “overreach,” “McCarthyism,” “disarray,” and “no GOP agenda” — all being uttered simultaneously across media platforms that are supposed to compete, not coordinate, with one another. 


The idea is for the media to revert to form. Rather than seek the truth, the media will go back to attacking those seeking the truth. Obama’s approval rating is going down, his left-wing agenda and legacy are in jeopardy, and the bleeding must be stopped. 
Another piece of coordination between media and Democrats reared its ugly head today in the most expected of places: Politico. No one takes more glee in savaging private citizens who dare not support Obama than Obama’s bullying thugs at Politico. 
During Tuesday’s testimony, Congressional Democrats attacked the private citizens brought before them to tell their individual horror stories. The witnesses were Tea Party groups and other conservative groups put through months of paralyzing harassment by an IRS that had intentionally singled them out based on their political beliefs. 

Democrats, however, did not care about the fact that these groups had been targeted, and they kept insinuating that these groups deserved the IRS scrutiny due to their political activity.  
Well, that is not the point and everyone knows it. Had the IRS put the same number of left-leaning groups through the same hyper-scrutiny as they did right-leaning groups, none of this would be happening. There would be no scandal.
But the idea here is to change the subject from the fact that the IRS singled out Obama’s political foes for paralyzing scrutiny in the run-up to Obama’s re-election campaign, to the supposed abuse of a tax exempt status by conservative political groups.  
The thinking goes that if Democrats can make the Tea Party look like tax cheats it will take the heat off of Obama and further damage his opponents. 
Well, right on cue, Politico arrives this morning like the cavalry with an appallingly dishonest (but expected) piece of reporting that falls right in line with what Congressional Democrats did yesterday. It is as pure a piece of coordination and left-wing propaganda as you will ever read. 

And this is the only kind of investigative reporting Politico ever does. Imagine if Politico poured these same resources into investigating the IRS’s connections to the White House or the shaping of the IRS talking points by the State Department. 
But today’s Politico piece is all about changing the subject. All it looks at is the political activity of yesterday’s Tea Party witnesses in order to make a case that they deserved scrutiny from the IRS. 
The Politico piece, however, intentionally ignores the fact that this is not the point of the scandal. The point is that these groups were singled out for harassment by their own government. 
The Politico piece intentionally ignores and chooses not to report on all the political activity of tax-exempt left-leaning groups (like Obama’s Organizing for America) — groups approved by the IRS, that are every bit as political as those on the right who were paralyzed by lengthy and intrusive questionnaires and  threats of perjury-those who had their information leaked to the media. 
Working directly with the Democrats, Politico is now putting in overtime to desperately steer subject away from and distract from partisan horrors committed by the IRS. 
The actual crime is no longer the story, according to Politico. No, the story is that the victims had it coming.

On Wednesday, President Barack Obama said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asked for and accepted the resignation of the acting Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Steven T. Miller. However, Miller’s  term as acting IRS Commissioner was up in a couple of weeks, and it is presently unclear whether he was forced to resign or was simply granting notice that his term was up.
Obama will face reporters on Thursday to answer questions about the IRS scandal that placed nearly 500 conservative organizations in the IRS’s crosshairs during the 2010 and 2012 elections. 
Beyond the classic question, “What did the Administration know and when did it know it?”, a myriad of questions remain unanswered.  Here are just a few:


Who inside the IRS hatched the plan to target conservatives and what, if any, connections do they, their associates, or superiors have to the Obama White House, campaign team, or other political organizations?
Who at the IRS leaked confidential tax documents to the progressive-leaning journalism group ProPublica, an action which the IRS official manual says can result in up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000?
Who are the two “rogue” individuals disgraced former IRS Commissioner Stevens said went “off the reservation” and acted “overly aggressive” and what, if any, connections do they have politically? If, as the Inspector General report alleges, political motivations were not driving the targeting of conservatives, then what was?  Also, what “discipline” did the two rogue agents receive?
Did IRS agents coordinate with Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) or his staff to “go after them [conservative groups],” as he told the New York Times, following Levin’s letters to then-IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman and Director Lois Lerner? 
Did Sen. Max Baucus (D-MO) or his staff communicate or coordinate with IRS agents after Baucus wrote this September 28, 2010 letter instructing then-Commissioner Douglas Shulman to have his “agency survey major 401(c)(4), (c)(5) and (c)(6) organizations to determine whether they are acting as conduits for major donors advancing their own private interests”?
What communications took place between IRS agents and the following senators and their staffs following the delivery of this jointly written letter demanding the IRS crack down on “abuse of the tax code by political groups focused on federal election activities”: Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO ), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Sen. Al Franken (D-MN)?
What communications existed between Obama reelection campaign co-chair Joe Solomonese, whom the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) alleges received its confidential tax returns, and IRS agents?
What portion of Obama’s 79% increase in audits of charities were of conservative groups?
If political motivations were not driving the selective targeting of 500 conservative organizations, then why were a similar number of liberal groups not harassed?
What role did IRS Rulings and Agreements Division Director Holly Paz, who in 2008 donated $2,000 to Obama, play in ratcheting up IRS investigations, as she promised she would in June 2012?

Whether reporters will ask and Obama will answer the critical questions that must be resolved remains to be seen.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a member of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight,” urged his Senate colleagues and members of the media at the immigration bill hearing to not tie the bill to the Boston terror attack bombings. After he made the request, he proceeded to do exactly what he asked others to not do. 
“Before I get to the bill, I’d like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in Boston or try to conflate those events with this legislation,” Schumer said.
But, after Schumer made that plea, he commented on immigration reform, including the specific Gang of 8 bill, in the context of the Boston terror attacks.


“In general, we are a safer country when law enforcement knows who is here, has their fingerprints, photos, et cetera, background checks,” Schumer said.

“In addition, both the refugee program and asylum program have been strengthened in the past five years such that we are much more careful about screening people in terms of who should and should not be coming into the country,” Schumer added. “If there are any changes that our homeland security experts tell us need to be made, I’m committed to making them.”
Schumer’s comments came after the committee’s Ranking GOP Member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) mentioned the Boston bombing earlier in the hearing. Schumer’s chastisement of his colleagues about mentioning the Boston attack appeared to be a response to Grassley.
“We also appreciate the opportunity to talk about immigration, particularly in light of all that’s happening in Massachusetts right now and over the last week,” Grassley said to open the hearing. “We are here trying to understand why these events have occurred. It’s hard to understand that there are people in this world that want to do Americans harm, so this hearing is an opportunity to refocus on the issues at hand and the importance of remaining vigilant and secure in our homeland.”

In the public relations push for his takeover of the American health care system, President Obama promised that those who like their insurance could keep it, premiums would decrease, and no one would lose their doctor. We know now those were all lies told repeatedly and never questioned by a media that is still looking the other way. Another promise Obama made was that ObamaCare would not fund abortions. LifeNews reports that this was also a lie:
The ObamaCare statute specifically requires the issuers of Exchange plans that cover abortion to “collect from each enrollee in the plan” a “separate payment” for the type of abortions for which funding is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment (which is all abortions other than in cases of life of the mother, rape, or incest) and a separate payment for all other services. [42 U.S.C. 18023(b)]. These separate payments are then to be deposited into separate accounts.


During the regulatory process, commenters questioned HHS on how this was to be implemented, and according to HHS, the commenters “recommended that HHS clarify . . . whether [Exchange plan] issuers may satisfy the separate payment provision by providing each enrollee with an itemized bill, and whether an enrollee’s coverage would be terminated for failure to comply with the separate payment provision.” Rather than doing so, HHS merely said that the comments would be taken into consideration in any future guidance. [77 Fed. Reg. 18430 (March 27, 2012)].
Now, despite the clear language of the ObamaCare statute, it appears that the separate check requirement is not going to be enforced by the Obama Administration. Gretchen Borchelt, director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center, told the Huffington Post that “we used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements, but that’s not the way it’s being implemented.” (Huffington Post, Sept. 3, 2013).
Likewise, a spokeswoman for Rhode Island’s Exchange told PolitiFact Rhode Island that “the customer is not billed a separate fee.” (Politifact, Oct. 2, 2013. The Rhode Island Exchange will handle the billing, not the plan issuers). As PolitiFact notes, “it turns out to be a hidden fee.”

There is nothing the media is willing to make Obama pay a political price for. Not even repeatedly lying to millions who are about to lose their insurance or forcing people to violate their conscience over the abomination of abortion.

The Department of Justice has summarily removed federal funding from two Louisiana youth programs because a local official refused to sign a pledge stating he would require the programs to ban mentions of God.
Julian Whittington, the sheriff of Bossier Parish, LA, told Fox News that Obama’s Justice Office of Civil Rights de-funded the Young Marines chapter and another youth program over mentions of religion. In the case of the Young Marine program, chartered in 1965, the funding was cut off because the group features an oath that mentions “God.” In the other case, it was because a program for at-risk youth featured a voluntary, student-led prayer session as one of its activities.
Sheriff Whittington says that the DOJ withdrew a combined $30,000 from the programs because the groups refused to remove God from their activities. The sheriff said this was evidence of the government’s “aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms.”


Whittington told Fox, “We were informed that these are unacceptable, inherently religious activities and the Department of Justice would not be able to fund the programs if it continued. They wanted a letter from me stating that I would no longer have voluntary prayer and I would also have to remove ‘God’ from the Young Marine’s oath.”
The oath from the Young Marine organization reads:

From this day forward, I sincerely promise, I will set an example for all other youth to follow and I shall never do anything that would bring disgrace or dishonor upon God, my Country and its flag, my parents, myself or the Young Marines. These I will honor and respect in a manner that will reflect credit upon them and myself. Semper Fidelis

Both the U.S. Army enlistment oath and its commissioning oath end with “so help me God.”

As to the at-risk youth program, Whittington said,”We’re not promoting any specific religion, this is just voluntary prayer, mention of God, how offensive and bad can that be?”
In response to the DOJ’s message insisting that he sign the anti-God pledge, Sheriff Whittington sent a letter of his own to LA Governor Bobby Jindal.
“As a Christian, Sheriff and American citizen, I am writing to express my frustration and concern over the persistent aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms which have been imposed upon the law enforcement grant programs, specifically related to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement,” wrote the Sheriff.
In cutting off the funding, the DOJ claimed it was a violation of Church and State rules for the government to fund any group that mentions God.
Fox’s Todd Starnes says that, “Both youth programs have been hailed as a successful way to reach at-risk young people. Since 2002 more than 1,000 young people have graduated from the program, directed by a Bossier Parish deputy who is a former U.S. Marine.”
Like Sheriff Whittington, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) was troubled by the DOJ’s actions.

“There is a very wide effort coming out of the administration that seeks to stamp out freedom of expressions – particularly religion and especially freedom of Christian expression,” Fleming said. “They are willing to throw the youth overboard and remove the funding just in the name of making this an atheist, agnostic, secular organization.”
“They (DOJ) don’t want anything to have any sort of religious support – even down to prayer,” Fleming said. “It’s sad and it’s inconsistent with the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.”

Sheriff Whittington is not taking this lying down. “When something is not right and you know it’s not right and you keep bowing down, nothing is ever going to change,” he said.

In a commencement address in Atlanta on Sunday to graduating seniors at Morehouse College, President Barack Obama told graduates to fulfill the “special obligation I felt, as a black man like you.” The all-male, historically black liberal arts college was also the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., among other famous graduates.
The president told the graduating students that their background meant they had a duty “to create greater justice both in your own community, but also across our country. To make sure everyone has a voice; everyone gets a seat at the table; to make sure that everyone – no matter what they look like or where they come from, or who they love – gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they want it bad enough.”


Obama cited his own life as an example several times during his speech, touting his success as a father while also acknowledging some “bad choices” he made in his youth–a veiled reference to his admitted past drug use, which Obama has often acknowledged in books, speeches and debates.
He also admonished Morehouse graduates who aimed to join the professions that they ought to serve the poor: 

So yes, go get that law degree. But ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and powerful, or if you can also find time to defend the powerless. Yes, go get your MBA, or start that business. But ask yourself what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood….Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too.

(Here, the president did not mention his own rather unique career path as an attorney, which included defending landlords in large urban housing developments who had evicted tenants in winter or failed to provide necessary services.)

In one portion of his speech, the president touted Obamacare–and encouraged the graduates to sign up for the new health insurance exchanges created by his signature legislation. 
Obama seems to have been carrying out the advice of Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, brother of Obama’s former chief of staff, who argued recently in the Wall Street Journal that young Americans would have to be targeted by a propaganda campaign if the system were not to be dangerously underfunded: “Every commencement address by an administration official should encourage young graduates to get health insurance,” Dr. Emanuel wrote.
Obama advised the graduating class that racism could no longer be leaned upon as a reason for failure: “We’ve got no time for excuses,” he said. He also acknowledged that the U.S. had become tolerant enough to elect a black president. And yet Obama described a nation in which discrimination is still rampant:

See, as Morehouse Men, many of you know what it’s like to be an outsider; to be marginalized; to feel the sting of discrimination. That’s an experience that so many other Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when someone asks where they come from or tells them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they’re stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work – she sure feels it.

The premise of Obama’s claim is at odds with recent global survey data, which indicates that the U.S. is among the least racist countries in the world. It is also at odds with the record of his own political career. In the recent past, President Obama has been guilty of many of the sins described above–touting deportations of illegal immigrants; opposing gay marriage until a year ago; moving Muslims out of campaign photographs for fear of arousing prejudice; and, most notoriously, paying women less than men in both his Senate and White House offices.
Overall, President Obama’s remarks repeated a pattern of recent graduation speeches in which he minimized individual achievement in favor of collective obligation. 
Curiously, he barely mentioned government, which he has been at great pains to defend in some recent addresses–speeches that have drawn wider criticism in the wake of recent scandals involving abuses of government power.
The word “government” appeared five times in his recent Ohio State commencement speech but not once in the Morehouse address, where the only mentions of government careers were his own presidency and the Atlanta mayoralty of Maynard Jackson.
Obama’s emphasis at Morehouse was on voluntary service to the community–a theme closer to the American philosophical tradition, albeit reformulated to suit the policies and prerogatives of the administration and the Democratic Party.

On Friday, a top political adviser to left-wing billionaire George Soros met with leftist organizations to form a new group called the Latino Victory Project, the Washington Post’s Matea Gold reports. The group is connected to Hollywood actress Eva Longoria, a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama’s political campaigns.
Gold notes that the Soros adviser and a network of about 30 other left-wing “donors, fundraisers and union leaders” met on Friday to develop “a strategy to make the [immigration] issue central in next year’s midterm elections if Congress does not pass a bill, identifying 10 House Republicans who would be vulnerable to pressure from Latino constituents.”  
“The meeting was attended by officials from several labor unions, including the National Education Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, as well as representatives of deep-pocketed backers of liberal causes, including a political adviser to billionaire George Soros,” Gold added.


The 10 Republicans they are targeting are Reps. Jeff Denham (R-CA), Buck McKeon (R-CA), Gary Miller (R-CA), David Valadao (R-CA), Daniel Webster (R-FL), Mike Coffman (R-CO), Scott Tipton (R-CA), Joe Heck (R-NV), Steve Pearce (R-NM), and Randy Weber (R-TX). These representatives are largely split on immigration efforts. 
Pearce, for instance, does not support the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” bill or anything like it. “You can’t get control of the borders if you tell people you can come here illegally and you can work until you work your way to the front of the line,” Pearce said in an interview with the New York Times‘ Ashley Parker in August. “The whole world would want to do it that way. Who would want to wait and do it properly?”
Weber, who represents the district of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), spoke at an anti-amnesty rally on Capitol Hill in June alongside Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and Steve King (R-TX). “The president has the authority to secure our border,” Weber said at the event. “He should do it today. In fact he should have done it yesterday.”

Denham, on the other hand, supports amnesty, at one point issuing verbal support for the Senate bill but backtracking after immense pressure from conservatives and constituents over the course of August. Since the congressional recess, Denham has come out to publicly endorse House Democrats’ amnesty plan, which was introduced by House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) earlier this month. Denham has also publicly claimed that House Speaker John Boehner promised that in the next “month or so” there would be a vote on immigration legislation in the House of Representatives. 
Boehner spokesman Michael Steel has not confirmed or denied these claims.
The group of left-wing donors that Soros’ top political aide attended was borne out of a fundraising committee called the Futuro Fund, which raised more than $30 million for Obama’s re-election campaing. “Led by actress Eva Longoria, Puerto Rico lawyer Andres Lopez and San Antonio businessman Henry R. Muñoz III, the fund represented the most robust demonstration yet of the Latino community’s ability to amass cash for U.S. political campaigns,” Gold wrote.
Cristobal Alex, a former program officer at the Ford Foundation, left his position there to lead the Latino Victory Project as the new group’s president. “What we want to do with the Latino Victory Project is build political power in the Latino community, so that the faces of Latinos are reflected not just in every level of government but in the policies that drive the country forward,” Alex said.
Moving forward, the Post noted, the group will agree to spend anywhere from $1 million to $2 million per target district. “The effort will begin in coming weeks with a campaign aimed at persuading the lawmakers to back an immigration measure this year,” Gold wrote. “If that fails, the group plans to run a barrage of radio and TV ads against them next year.”
The AFL-CIO’s immigration campaign manager, Tom Snyder, said each of these GOP lawmakers has a target on their backs. “There was agreement in the room that if we don’t see action in the House, we know who we’re going after,” Snyder said. “There’s a realization that we have to get back to basics. We’re at the point where if you don’t act, we’re going to have to make you pay at the ballot box.”
Amalia Perea Mahoney, a Chicago-area art gallery owner who the Los Angeles Times reported raked in between $200,000 and $500,000 for Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, said the group is “all very united” in its purpose. “I think it’s a pivotal moment,” she said. Mahoney is also an Obama appointee to an federal arts board. 
Soros has spent $100 million since 1997 backing what his Open Society Foundation calls “immigrant rights” groups and projects. Some of those projects, like Soros’ National Immigration Forum-backed Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT), were meant to create the illusion of grassroots support for amnesty where there was none. Recent polling data released by NumbersUSA, conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, shows that Evangelical Republican likely voters disagree with the push for amnesty despite the Soros group’s claims there is grassroots support among Evangelicals for the policy. 
Recently, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID), a supporter of immigration reform, withdrew from the House’s version of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” and announced his public opposition to negotiating with Obama and the Senate on immigration, saying such negotiations would be “crazy” for House GOP leadership to enter into. Labrador said House GOP leadership would not be smart to deal with these people because they are trying to “destroy” the Republican Party.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, suddenly an expert on the Constitution, said on Wednesday that she and Barack Obama are “honoring the Constitution” in their attacks on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Pelosi pontificated:
And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring, as the president does, the Constitution. When you pass a bill in the House, as we did with the health care bill, we made it iron clad constitutionally. You have a responsibility to honor the Constitution. In fact, we take an oath to do just that, and that is the oath that President Obama is upholding.


Attacking the GOP’s support for the Defense of Marriage Act, Pelosi whined:

We weigh equities. Congress passes a bill. It’s questionable in terms of constitutionality. There’s no question about your oath to the Constitution of the United States, and the behavior of the Republicans in the House of Representatives on this subject has been so irresponsible. First of all, why in this time would you pass a bill that increases discrimination? We’re going in the direction of the arc of Justice [Henry L.] Benning in favor of more justice, not more discrimination. Why would you do such a thing in the first place? And then when it is questioned in terms of its constitutionality to spend money in the tune of millions outside the regular order of how that money should be spent to defend increasing discrimination in our society, it’s just plain wrong. And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring, as the president does, the Constitution.
Pelosi boasted of her home city’s influence in the assault on traditional values, claiming that same-sex marriage is “inevitable.” She continued:
From our beautiful place in San Francisco, the city of St. Francis, we knew that it was inevitable that all of this would happen. It was inconceivable to others that it would, and it was our job to use whatever influence we could have to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable. And I think that’s what’s happening at the court because of many people’s courage, especially those directly, personally affected.

Nothing “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson said was anything close to anti-gay. It might have been characteristically blunt, but Robertson neither singled out homosexuals nor questioned the humanity of gay people. Robertson focused on sexual behavior, including the sexual behavior of heterosexuals. The major media are merely using Robertson’s quotes to advance their own anti-Christian bigotry by smearing Christian beliefs as de facto bigotry and launching a McCarthyist campaign to silence Christians. 
When you have major media outlets declaratively describing Robertson’s expression of his Christian beliefs as “anti-gay,” what you are really seeing is major media outlets outing themselves as anti-Christian. 


Politico. CNN. The Hollywood Reporter. Entertainment Weekly. Yahoo. Variety. And so on…
Robertson listed more than a half-dozen sins other than homosexual behavior, including a number of heterosexual behaviors, and “the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers”. 
It is certainly possible to try to disguise anti-gay bigotry as Christianity. Singling out gay people and not distinguishing between homosexuals as people and homosexual behavior are two of the most glaring examples. 

But Robertson did neither. What he did do was to speak a Christian truth about various sins, and the media know this. 
Anti-sin is not anti-gay. 
But because the media and left are desperate to toxify Christianity as bigotry and bully Christians into silence, Robertson’s remarks are seen as the perfect opportunity to do both. 
Of course it is an added benefit to the media to try to tarnish a culturally conservative mega-hit, and maybe drive it off the air. 
What we have here is nothing more than the media practicing McCarthyism and disguising it as tolerance. 

Notice how the media are not reporting on the most important thing Robertson said:

You put in your article that the Robertson family really believes strongly that if the human race loved each other and they loved God, we would just be better off. We ought to just be repentant, turn to God, and let’s get on with it, and everything will turn around.

Governor Sarah Palin put this exactly right when she said this is an attack on “all of us.” 
 

This post has been updated to add a correct Robertson quote about loving the human race.

“If Jesus were alive today, he would be more inclined to say, ‘you know, I didn’t know it all…'” – Rev. Oliver White, Sean Hannity Show, March 27, 2013

In general, most news outlets have provided awful coverage of the Supreme Court proceedings on same-sex marriage.  Covering the proceedings like they cover a political campaign or a sporting event, most of the analysis and commentary has been about political “wins” for one side or the other and the ramifications of the pending decision on homosexuals in our society, rather than the wide-ranging ramifications for society itself.  
Filling the void of thoughtful analysis has been talk radio.  Unlike the vapid and two-dimensional conversations repeated every ten minutes on cable, talk radio has been able to explore larger questions entwined in the same-sex marriage debate and have been able to challenge the politically correct orthodoxy presented in other media outlets where it comes to the religious side of the issue.  


Enter Sean Hannity whose Wednesday show featured a fascinating exchange with Terry Jeffrey, a news editor from CNS News Service, and Rev. Oliver White, a pro-same sex marriage pastor.   Because Hannity is not constrained by the limitations of a TV news schedule and the need to change subjects every 5 minutes, as is so often the case on cable news, he was able to allow the on-air debate over the scriptural basis for marriage to naturally unfold to the point where the lack of scriptural foundation for same-sex marriage was laughingly evident.  
This exchange in particular was the most glaringly infuriating as White, a proponent of same-sex marriage who angered his own congregation recently because of his adamant belief that Christianity supports such a practice, went so far as to agree that Jesus Christ was wrong about His position on marriage being defined as one man and one woman, and if Jesus were alive today he would, in fact, support gay marriage.  


In this segment, the good minister is quizzed further on his unique and ever-morphing interpretation of scripture by Hannity and it’s revealed for the audience that his understanding of sin and morality is quite pliable and able to bend to meet any modern need:  



Finally, Rev. White is able to admit that he does draw moral lines with regard to sexuality, but those lines are rooted less in God’s law but in the current popular practices of the times we live in:  

This is the kind of exchange, full of thoughtful and challenging questions that force the guests and the listener to re-examine what they believe and what they espouse can only happen in a medium like talk radio and new media where hosts are able to take positions and not pretend to be objective. We know there is no real objectivity when Don Lemon or Anderson Cooper are conducting an interview on this topic. Cooper would probably never have Rev. White on in the first place, because he would make the pro-same sex marriage side look bad.  And, if he did have a minister on to discuss the biblical basis for same-sex unions, there is no chance that Don Lemon would be able to pose questions for their guest in the way that Hannity and Jeffry did.   
In general cable and network news have not served the public interest in exploring these complicated and important issues because, in many cases, the hosts and anchors assigned to the topic are just not equipped or are completely unwilling to have both sides of the issue get a fair and through hearing.  
Congratulations to Sean Hannity for taking advantage of his medium and shedding light on an angle of this story that’s been neglected by his TV counterparts.

In a game-changer for the legal fight over same-sex marriage that gives credence to opponents’ “slippery slope” arguments, a federal judge has now ruled that the legal reasoning for same-sex marriage means that laws against polygamy are likewise unconstitutional. 
In his 91-page opinion in Brown v. Buhman, on Dec. 13, U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups struck down Utah’s law making polygamy a crime. In so doing, he may have opened Pandora’s Box. 
As a condition for becoming a state in 1896, Congress required Utah to outlaw polygamy, which is marriage between three or more persons. This case involved a family of fundamentalist offshoots of nineteenth-century Mormonism. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints disavowed polygamy in 1890, and again in 1904, but some splinter groups continue the practice. 


Waddoups’ opinion would not only cover such groups, however, but also Muslims or anyone else who claims a right–religious or otherwise–to have multiple-person marriages. He notes that the Supreme Court ruled against polygamy in its 1878 case Reynolds v. U.S., but said he cannot simply rest upon that decision “without seriously addressing the much developed constitutional jurisprudence that now protects individuals from the criminal consequences intended by legislatures to apply to certain personal choices.” 
In its 2003 Lawrence v. Texas case, the Supreme Court overruled previous sexuality precedents by declaring unconstitutional laws that made homosexual sodomy a crime, holding that although the Constitution says nothing about sex or marriage, there is nonetheless a right to consensual sexual activity between adults that government cannot regulate. This was over the vigorous dissent of conservative justices, who said that the Constitution commits such questions of marriage and morality to the states and the democratic process, and that therefore federal courts have no power to impose their own moral judgments.
The Lawrence case lays the foundation that has been cited for a decade now in court to make the case for a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. If government cannot forbid homosexual conduct, this argument goes, then neither can it deny those who define themselves by homosexual behavior to officially recognize any such relationship as a marriage. It began a political, religious, and philosophical debate in America between two different definitions of marriage and family. 

For over 5,000 years of recorded human history, marriage laws worldwide were about providing a social structure for producing and raising children. These laws simply acknowledged the biological reality that only sex between a man and a woman can produce a baby, and that, correspondingly, that every child born into the world has two parents, one of which is a man, the other a woman. 
Marriage laws were designed to secure parental rights for that man and woman over the child they had created, and also imposed strict duties and obligations on each of them for raising that child. As part of that, those laws also bound the man and woman to each other, imposing obligations of sexually exclusivity, mutual care, and support. 
Those laws were created for the nurturing of those children, and assign the gender role of demanding the man’s protection and support of the woman during pregnancy and once the children were born. They were designed primarily for the protection of children, and secondarily for the support of women. 
A man and woman would form a new family to act as a single unit in society, and care for any children resulting from their monogamous sexual relationship. Thus, marriage has been defined as the union of one man and one woman. More precisely, it is the union of (1) two consenting persons, (2) of opposite biological sex, (3) who are not close blood relatives. 
The new conception of marriage, rooted in the proliferation of no-fault divorce laws in the 1970s and the sexual revolution, is that marriage is about personal happiness and fulfillment. People should be free to form whatever relationships they find personally satisfying and to follow whatever their personal sexual inclinations are to engage in whatever form of sexual behavior they find gratifying. 

If, therefore, you have a right to officially recognize those homosexual relationships through redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, then there is no reason to say it cannot include more than two people, so long as everyone is a consenting adult. 
This lawsuit is the brainchild of Prof. Jonathan Turley at George Washington University. He’s designed a two-step strategy, piggybacking on same-sex marriage: first, decriminalize polygamy, then assert a right to official recognition of polygamy. 
As Turley explained in previous court filings, he believes there is a “right to self-determination of private relations and family matters free of government intrusion.” He noted that many oppose polygamy, and goes on to assert that polygamists “are entitled to protection from such majoritarian animus and bias vis-à-vis their private lifestyles and relations. Their status under domestic law is a civil rights issue deserving the same protections afforded to homosexuals and other minority groups.”
The exact legal arguments for same-sex marriage equally apply to multiple-person marriages. Turley acknowledges that marriage laws that do not include both are “a tool for the imposition of a uniform moral agenda or tenets on citizens.”
Turley then goes on to make clear he is not only arguing for the form of polygamy technically called polygyny, which is one man with multiple women. In other words, he also argues for a right to polyandry (one woman with multiple men) and polyamory (multiple men with multiple women). 
Waddoups concluded that Reynolds has been overtaken by Lawrence and other recent legal developments. While keeping in place for now the Utah law against issuing multiple marriage certificates for polygamous marriage (the second step of the Turley strategy), he invalidated the criminal law against multiple adults cohabiting together as a family, which is the core of the laws against polygamy. 
This case will likely now go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver.

The approximately 500 “Justice For Trayvon” protesters in Washington, D.C., on Saturday heard calls from progressive speakers for specific boycott actions they want to use force Florida and other states to eliminate “Stand Your Ground” laws.  
Even though such self-defense laws were not used in George Zimmerman’s defense, comedian and veteran progressive activist Dick Gregory argued at the rally outside the federal courthouse in Washington on Constitution Avenue that people should fight against them. Gregory also praised protesters who staged a sit-in until they could meet with Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who has agreed to meet with the protesters but continues standing strong on Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. Gregory called for protesters to join musician Stevie Wonder in boycotting Florida.
We say thanks to brother Stevie Wonder. For all of his gigs he pays $100,000 tax. So you see what he’s giving up. We sit around arguing about so and so is not doing this, reverend is not doing this, I don’t hear you talking about Stevie. He didn’t have to huddle with nobody. He didn’t have to go to New York and huddle with white agents and say “Can I do this?” So what can we do to help Stevie? We don’t have to ask the First National Bank. We don’t have to ask Congress. We can make our decision when we leave here today because that governor of Florida said last night, “Hear me, hear me!” He said “I’ll meet with them but nothing is going to change.” And he met with them and he said if the deal was passed again, he would sign it. Well, we got a message for you.
Some members of the crowd jumped in and started shouting, “Boycott Florida! Boycott Florida!”


Gregory made the argument that supporters of Trayvon Martin should take action by not acting. “Whoa. Hang on,” he said. “Let me say something. Let me say something. See that’s what you mean. Some of y’all ain’t been to Florida in your life and ain’t going. And all you got to do is get Florida to come to you. Now what do I mean by that? They got oranges that they can’t afford to have you not buy because they will rot.” 
“You leave here now and you get on the phone and you call people and tell them to call people,” he continued. “I said to my grandmother, ‘We not going to boycott Florida orange juice because Florida orange juice is sold under different names. We going to boycott orange juice.’ And when them orange growers start running in to take that governor and he knows he can’t stand his ground with them. This is who we are. Starting thinking about Christmas. You know it’s hard to get us to do something.”
Gregory called for people to boycott Disney as well, since it is based in Orlando, Fla. “How many of y’all have been to Disneyland to see a rat?” Gregory said, referencing Mickey Mouse, to laughter from the several hundred in attendance. “But haven’t walked down the street to see King’s tomb? Had he not died, you wouldn’t be welcome in Orlando. So we not asking you to do anything that costs you. We just say save your money. Don’t spend it. And when they understand who you are, then things will stop happening.” Disneyland is located in Anaheim, CA. Disneyworld is located in Orlando, FL.

Gregory was not the only speaker at the rally; E. Faye Williams, the chair of the National Congress of Black Women, opened her remarks to the crowd by saying, “We stand with our queen sister Sybrina Fulton.”
Williams then began advocating the crowd to take action through various tactics against those who support Stand Your Ground laws. “So we say to you my brothers and sisters, don’t feel like somebody else has to do it,” she said. “Everybody can do something.”
“If you haven’t registered to vote yet, you can register to vote,” she said. “If you haven’t helped somebody else register to vote, you can help them register to vote. If you haven’t given a dime to the Trayvon Martin foundation so we can carry on this work, give a dime, give your time or give something.”
Williams said Stand Your Ground laws “are disproportionately unfair to young black men.”
“We have to be there [where states are implementing these laws],” she said. “We have to keep on pulling our money back. I did it. When I heard about Stand Your Ground and how the American Legislative Exchange Council is going around the country getting states to enact Stand Your Ground laws. I pulled my money out of Bank of America. I pulled my money out of State Farm insurance.”

George Zimmerman was back in court today for a hearing on the start date for his trial on murder charges. Zimmerman, of course, was the Hispanic neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Florida, who trailed a young black man named Trayvon Martin after calling 911, got into an altercation with Martin in which Martin ended up pounding Zimmerman’s head into the pavement, and then ended up shooting Martin in the chest. The media used the Zimmerman case as an opportunity to bully Americans over their supposed racial intolerance. Even the President of the United States weighed in in the midst of an election cycle, suggesting that if he had a son, he’d look like Trayvon Martin.
Breitbart News had the opportunity to sit down for a one-on-one interview with George’s brother, Robert, in Los Angeles. Excerpts of that interview played tonight on Fox News’ Hannity.


Robert didn’t pull any punches about President Obama’s role in raising the threat level to his brother – and to his family. “We do feel that we’re threatened,” Robert told Breitbart News. “There’s not been a legal resolution in this matter. And even the day that there is legal resolution in this matter, the day that happens I don’t think that every single fear of some kind of retribution will simply just go way, but we’re coping as bets we can, day by day.”


Robert saved especially harsh criticism for President Obama, who inserted himself in the Zimmerman case, even inviting race-baiter Al Sharpton to the White House shortly after Sharpton threatened the town of Sanford over the Police Department’s decision not to arrest Zimmerman originally. When the President was asked about the Zimmerman case in the Rose Garden, Robert said, “Here was this president, from the backdrop of the Rose Garden, making comments about someone based on his skin color. I think we felt bullied, we were a little let down initially, and that disappointment grew because if you don’t have the support of at least the law on your side, of the most powerful man in the Western Hemisphere reminding the world that it is entitled to watch, reminding Americans that the world is watching and that we will get through this with due process, but instead bringing up statements about his skin color … it was alarming to say the least.”
Robert went further: “I don’t think a white president would have been able to get away with the same thing from the Rose Garden in an election season.”

The fallout to the Zimmerman family has been extreme. According to Robert, they often require security for everyday tasks. They have had to move around to avoid targeting. And now, George faces a trial in a case where many legal observers agree there is no evidence to support the prosecutor’s second degree murder charge. No matter what happens, George Zimmerman will, thanks to the President and the media, remain a racist in many Americans’ minds. “If you can’t rebut assertions of racism,” said Robert, “the noise kind of drowns you out. You’re really left defenseless, and you have no other choice but to go into hiding.”

Gregory called for people to boycott Disney as well, since it is based in Orlando, Fla. “How many of y’all have been to Disneyland to see a rat?” Gregory said, referencing Mickey Mouse, to laughter from the several hundred in attendance. “But haven’t walked down the street to see King’s tomb? Had he not died, you wouldn’t be welcome in Orlando. So we not asking you to do anything that costs you. We just say save your money. Don’t spend it. And when they understand who you are, then things will stop happening.” Disneyland is located in Anaheim, CA. Disneyworld is located in Orlando, FL.

Gregory was not the only speaker at the rally; E. Faye Williams, the chair of the National Congress of Black Women, opened her remarks to the crowd by saying, “We stand with our queen sister Sybrina Fulton.”
Williams then began advocating the crowd to take action through various tactics against those who support Stand Your Ground laws. “So we say to you my brothers and sisters, don’t feel like somebody else has to do it,” she said. “Everybody can do something.”
“If you haven’t registered to vote yet, you can register to vote,” she said. “If you haven’t helped somebody else register to vote, you can help them register to vote. If you haven’t given a dime to the Trayvon Martin foundation so we can carry on this work, give a dime, give your time or give something.”
Williams said Stand Your Ground laws “are disproportionately unfair to young black men.”
“We have to be there [where states are implementing these laws],” she said. “We have to keep on pulling our money back. I did it. When I heard about Stand Your Ground and how the American Legislative Exchange Council is going around the country getting states to enact Stand Your Ground laws. I pulled my money out of Bank of America. I pulled my money out of State Farm insurance.”

Moments after President Obama made his briefing room statement about race and Trayvon Martin, CNN’s BREAKING NEWS graphic swirled, faded, and cut to anchor Brooke Baldwin, who was visibly flushed with excitement. Brooke announced, “Wow, what a surprise we have all witnessed, if you have been tuned in the last half-hour, we were watching THE President surprise everyone…” 
She went on to describe Obama’s statement as “very, very personal; very heartfelt.” Baldwin then assured her audience that Obama had “not used a teleprompter,” because he had “given much thought and much time to making this message VERY personal.”


The CNN anchor then went to a video clip saying, “But FIRST, here’s the president, making this personal.” 
Apparently, Baldwin thought Obama’s statement was personal. 
After the clip, Breathless Brooke returned with her panel: Candy Crowley, Sonny Hostin, Jessica Yellin, and Gloria Borger. 

After another “Wow!”,  Baldwin (who looked like she might have been trembling) turned things over to Chief White House Correspondent, Yellin. 
If you hadn’t known what she was talking about, based solely on Yellin’s awe-inspired melodramatic rhetoric, you would think that something had happened on the level of the first man walking on the moon. Barely able to contain herself, Yellin described Obama’s statement as something “as personal and as bluntly as I have ever heard him speak about racism in America and his own experience of racism in his life.”
Yellin later added that this was “an important moment for this president, and an important moment for America.” 
After again reminding us of how “incredibly personal” Obama was, Baldwin then turned things over to Candy Crowley. 
As excited as the rest, Crowley jumped right in to tell us that Obama is a “thoughtful guy” and the “sort of person who thinks these things through.” 

Crowley obviously missed Obama’s “acted stupid” racial debacle. 
Crowley closed her comment by pointing out that Obama has just “elevated the discussion.” 

Sonny Hostin, the only legal analyst in the country who was shocked by the Zimmerman verdict,  was left a little speechless due to the “so many thoughts she had running through her mind. After mentioning that she was the mother of a “young, brown boy,” she then put those thoughts together and used Obama’s words to trash our country and judicial system as racist. 
Finally, it was political analyst Gloria Borger’s turn, and she started out with some hysterical nonsense about how Obama didn’t want this conversation to be about him — even though this is the second time he has chosen to interject both himself and his race into a local crime that had nothing to with him or racism. Borger found this, “stunning.”
Borger than narrowed her eyes and talked about how Obama came to the podium as an “African-American male and reflected soberly about some important issues we have to discuss in this country.” Borger was in awe over how Obama “distilled ” all of these complicated issues one statement. 

My favorite part of the discussion, though, was Borger’s non sequitar. Baldwin had a good moment when she said that she wanted to make clear that the “Stand your Ground” law had nothing to do with Zimmerman’s defense. 
Borger then jumped in to say, “But it is the law in thirty states.” 
Huh?
Bottom line: For almost fifteen minutes it was hard to tell if you were watching a cable news network, or a slumber party-cam with five breathless Beliebers after a Justin Bieber concert. 
The gushing was as non-stop as the criticism and intelligent insight was non-existent.
Throughout the segment, Obama was constantly referred to as an “African-American.”
Like George Zimmerman, Obama has one white parent. 
CNN, however, only refers to Zimmerman as a “white Hispanic.”
UPDATE: 90 minutes later, CNN is still at it.

On Monday, in response to my piece on 17-year-old Darryl Green of Chicago, who was found shot to death after refusing to join a gang at school, Jamelle Bouie of The Daily Beast claimed that “black-on-black crime” is a myth. “There’s no such thing as ‘black-on-black’ crime. Yes, from 1976 to 2005, 94 percent of black victims were killed by black offenders, but that racial exclusivity was also true for white victims of violent crime–86 percent were killed by white offenders. Indeed, for the large majority of crimes, you’ll find that victims and offenders share a racial identity, or have some prior relationship to each other,” wrote Bouie. Bouie added, “Nor are African-Americans especially criminal. If they were, you would still see high rates of crime among blacks, even as the nation sees a historic decline in criminal offenses. Instead, crime rates among African-Americans, and black youth in particular, have taken a sharp drop.”

That, of course, is not the point. Of course the vast majority of murdered whites are murdered by other whites. That’s why there’s no national outrage when a white person is killed by a black person: it’s not evidence of some underlying black violence problem directed against white people. But when a white Hispanic kills a black man (a far less common occurrence than a black person killing a white person), that’s taken as evidence of a deeply racist America requiring a media tsunami. And when a black person kills a black person, the media ignores it completely.

African-Americans aren’t especially criminal, of course; for Bouie to impute such notions to those who are concerned about black-on-black crime is insidious and vile. But the notion that we don’t see “high rates of crime among blacks” is sadly untrue. The numbers are coming down, but black Americans still commit a disproportionate amount of crime. Blacks represent 13.1 percent of the American population, but 49 percent of the murder victims. More than half of those victims were in their teens or twenties. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, “The percentage of black offenders [in sexual violence cases] increased from 18% in 1994-1998 to 27% in 2005-2010.” Thankfully, crime across the board is dropping, including in the black community. But that does not mean that the black community is not still plagued by black-on-black crime that far surpasses the problem of white-on-white crime by percentage, and absolutely dwarfs the problem of white-on-black crime.

Bouie’s real point is that statistics should not matter – disproportionate black-on-black murder is the result of white racism anyway. “And while it’s true that young black men are a disproportionate share of the nation’s murder victims, it’s hard to disentangle this from the stew of hyper-segregation (often a result of deliberate policies), entrenched poverty, and nonexistent economic opportunities that characterizes a substantial number of black communities,” Bouie wrote. Let’s assume all of that’s the case, for the sake of argument. That still does not justify the media’s disproportionate attention to a problem that does not heavily plague the black community — white (or white Hispanic) on black crime – even while ignoring the sort of crime that destroys black communities day in and day out, in the name of liberal policies and political correctness. The longer those on the left continue to ignore real problems in the black community, the more Darryl Greens will be murdered.

(AP) – Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that Arizona Sen. John McCain probably would have beat his boss in the 2008 presidential election had the economy not collapsed.
Biden’s comment about McCain and President Barack Obama came during the opening dinner of an annual forum among the Red Rocks of Sedona in northern Arizona. He and McCain, a Republican, touched on the gun control debate following the Newtown shootings and the bombings in Boston, but made no mention of Syria. Just as the night came to a close, Biden turned to the grueling nature of presidential campaigns.


“The truth of the matter is, Barack knows it, I know, had the economy not collapsed around your ears, John, in the middle of literally — as things were moving — I think you probably would have won,” Biden said. “But it would have been incredibly, incredibly, incredibly close. You inherited a really difficult time.”
The forum is part of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a program formed by McCain as a way to debate foreign affairs. This year’s theme for the Sedona Forum is “How can we promote freedom and democracy effectively?”
Rather than a discussion between McCain and Biden, the two sat on stage together with McCain posing questions to his former Democratic adversary on gun control and whether background checks are necessary, human rights abuses at the hands of the United States and the recent bombings at the Boston marathon.

McCain and Biden both said that despite their disagreements, they’ve never lost respect for one another.
On gun control, Biden said it’s never been a simple issue, but that Congress has miscalculated how deeply the public feels about it and has failed to stand up to groups like the National Rifle Association, particularly after the shootings in Newtown. He said the public is looking to Congress to be mature enough to figure out a way to diminish the chance it will happen again.
“For the first time ever, you have people who are for gun safety, for increasing background checks,” Biden said. “Two out of three of them say it will be a major determining factor in how I vote. That’s the political dynamic that has changed. So I think we’re going to get this anyway. I think this will pass before the year is out, within this Congress.”
In responding to a question about the vulnerabilities of the United States when it comes to terrorist attacks, Biden said that the radical, lone wolves have been the most difficult to catch. But he said America shouldn’t change its values, how it treats people abroad or people coming into the United States. Nor should America adopt policies that keep people from freely walking down the street without being frisked by police or carrying identification cards, he said.
“The moment we change any of those things, that’s when they win,” Biden said. “Because they don’t see how you can have a society that is not ordered and regimented and wedded to an orthodoxy that is theirs. That’s the point that bothers them most about us.”
McCain followed up by saying that those who tortured U.S. prisoners, in violation of the Geneva convention, should be exposed and be held responsible to prevent repeated abuses.
Biden agreed with the man once held as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. He said the internal debate in Congress and at the White House is how things got to that point, but it’s not yet resolved.
“I think the only way you excise the demons is you acknowledge what happened, straightforward,” Biden said.

How big of a wake-up call are the Obama scandals, especially the ones surrounding the seizing of phone records from the Associated Press and the IRS’s targeting of conservatives? So big that two of the media’s most shameful and shameless gun control advocates — Joe Scarborough and Piers Morgan — have finally conceded that arguments made by pro-Second Amendment activists against the expanding of background checks might not be so ridiculous. 
In a roundtable discussion on Friday’s “Morning Joe,”  Scarborough said that because of the IRS scandal, “My argument is less persuasive today because of these scandals.” He added: “People say, ‘Hey, if they do this with the IRS, asking people what books you read, then how can I trust them with information about my Second Amendment rights?'”


Mika agreed completely: “That is a really, really good point.” Even the Huffington Post’s Sam Stein agreed. 
Andrew Johnson at NRO grabbed the video:

Scarborough added that, when it comes to both background checks and immigration reform, the IRS scandal is “devastating,” because both of those pieces of legislation ask us to trust the kind of government that would seize the media’s phone records and use the IRS to target a president’s political foes.
Also courtesy of NRO, here is no-less than Piers Morgan conceding he was wrong to ridicule gun-rights activists (including our own Ben Shapiro) for making the argument that a legitimate fear of government tyranny is what makes the Second Amendment so crucial:
—


—
Though I was appalled by the media’s relentless and shameless push last month to pass the Toomey-Manchin bill that would have tightened background checks, I did support its passage, and said so many times while criticizing the media for their disgusting behavior. But this chilling reminder of how corrupt the federal government is has changed my mind completely. 
Moreover, our government is not only corrupt, it is vigorously protected by a media that is just as corrupt (NEVER forget the media ignored, dismissed, and even defended the IRS targeting conservatives). The government and media can scream all they want that background checks won’t be used to create a backdoor registry…
But the government and media are liars.

Recently uncovered government documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) unmanned Predator B drone fleet has been custom designed to identify civilians carrying guns and track cell phone signals.
“I am very concerned that this technology will be used against law-abiding American firearms owners,” said founder and executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation, Alan Gottlieb. “This could violate Fourth Amendment rights as well as Second Amendment rights.”

The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) obtained a partially redacted copy of Homeland Security’s drone requirements through a Freedom of Information Act request; CNET uncovered an unredacted copy.


Homeland Security design requirements specify that its Predator B drones “shall be capable of identifying a standing human being at night as likely armed or not” and must be equipped with “interception” systems capable of reading cell phone signals.
The first known domestic use of a drone to arrest a U.S. citizen occurred last year in the small town of Lakota, North Dakota when rancher Rodney Brossart was arrested for refusing to return six of his neighbor’s cows that had wandered on to his property. Critics say the fact that domestic drones are being used in such minor matters raises serious concerns about civil liberties and government overreach.
“That drone is not just picking up information on what’s happening at that specific scene, it’s picking up everything else that’s going on,” says drone expert and Brookings Institution senior fellow Peter Singer. “Basically it’s recording footage from a lot of different people that it didn’t have their approval to record footage.” 

Others, like progressive author Naomi Wolf, have warned that domestic drones may soon be weaponized. The military version of the Predator B drone carries 100-pound Hellfire missiles, but the Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) says the 10 drones in its domestic fleet are unarmed.
Last month, NBC News uncovered a confidential 16-page Justice Department memo that concluded the U.S. government may execute a drone strike on an American citizen it believes to be a “senior operational leader” of al-Qaeda or “an associated force.” 
The Obama Administration defended the use of drones to kill Americans thought to be working with terrorists.  “These strikes are legal, they are ethical, and they are wise,” said White House press secretary Jay Carney.

An abortion supporter, Katie Heim, wrote a poem likening her vagina to a gun which was read into the Texas Senate record as the Senate debated the bill outlawing abortion after twenty weeks. The poem, titled, “If My Vagina Was a Gun,” went like this: 

If my vagina was a gun, you would stand for its rights, 

You would ride on buses and fight all the fights. 

If my vagina was a gun, you would treat it with care, 
You wouldn’t spill all its secrets because, well, why go there. 

If my vagina was a gun, you’d say what it holds is private 
From cold dead hands we could pry, you surely would riot. 
If my vagina was a gun, its rights would all be protected, no matter the body count or the children affected. 

If my vagina was a gun, I could bypass security, concealed carry laws would ensure I’d have impunity. 
If my vagina was a gun, I wouldn’t have to beg you, I could hunt this great land and do all the things men do. 
But my vagina is not a gun, it is a mightier thing, 
With a voice that rings true making lawmakers’ ears ring. 

Vaginas are not delicate, they are muscular and magic, 
So stop messing with mine, with legislation that’s tragic. 
My vagina’s here to demand from the source, 
Listen to the voices of thousands or feel their full force.
Some questions for Ms. Heim:

You do know that it should be “If My Vagina Were a Gun”?
If your vagina is “a mightier thing” than a gun, how do you plan to use it if confronted by a thug intent on robbing or brutalizing you? 
Fetuses, which Ms. Heim presumably references, reside in the uterus, not the vagina. Is she aware of this? 
Could Ms. Heim possibly do a worse disservice to pro-choice advocates than to read this nonsense into the legislative record?

Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has quietly added a slew of new measures to his self-sponsored gun control bill currently making its way through the Senate.
Schumer has been fighting to get his Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers Act of 2013 (S 374)–now called the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2013–passed into law, but one of the early problems with the bill was that it was essentially a shell or placeholder bill, incomplete at the time of introduction.
Ostensibly, Schumer’s bill is meant to change current laws to require that all firearm sales initiate a background check on the buyer before the sale is finalized. Currently, private citizens are exempt from performing background checks when they sell guns to other private citizens.


Though the original bill introduced was a shortened version, the New York Senator has since added  new amendments to his bill that raise concerns for gun rights advocates.

Schumer’s new Section 202 will make it illegal for an unlicensed person to transfer a gun to any other non-licensed person. The law would require that a licensed gun seller perform an NICS check and fill out a Form 4473 before a transfer would be legal.
Exceptions include transfers from husband to wife or immediate family, short-term transfers for hunting purposes (if the owner is present), or at a shooting range or for firearms instruction.
Section 202 also sets maximum fees for the paperwork and demands that the FFL keep the paperwork during the length of the transfer.
Section 203 is the more problematic section, as it requires that gun owners report the theft or loss of a firearm within 24 hours after discovering the loss. Unless a report is filed with the “Attorney General and to the appropriate authorities,” the gun owner faces five years of imprisonment.
Second Amendment supporters have been fighting to make sure these transfer records are not kept by the federal government in what would essentially become a national gun owner’s database.

The newest Obama scandal is seventeen months old. 
Welcome to Trayvongate, where the President of the United States used both the bully pulpit, the Department of Justice and sly media manipulation to gin up charges of racism in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin shooting. Now that the trial is almost finished and the only act of racism mentioned so far came from the victim–Martin called Zimmerman ‘a creepy ass cracker’ according to testimony–the cynical and repeated use of the race card by the White house is even more abhorrent. 

Judicial Watch revealed documents today that proved what Breitbart News reported in April, 2012: that Eric Holder’s Department of Justice took an active role in racially charged rallies in Sanford, Florida and that the Community Relations Service helped force the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee. That resignation made it appear that Sanford authorities were suspect and possibly complicit in covering up something. 


Some of my reporting at the time was based on interviews with numerous public officials in Sanford who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution from the Obama administration. They described a situation where the CRS team took over and forced decisions while clearing a path for protests and rallies that heightened the appearence of racial tensions. 
The CRS is a small unit within the Department of Justice and ostensibly it serves a legitimate purpose; attempting to cool down tense situation. As its website says:

The Community Relations Service is the Department’s “peacemaker” for community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race, color, and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, CRS is the only Federal agency dedicated to assist State and local units of government, private and public organizations, and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, incidents, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.

However, under the highly politicized Holder Department of Justice, the CRS has acted as ‘spies and muscle’ according to a source familiar with the unit. In the Zimmerman case, they ended up as doing nothing to facilitate ‘racial stability and harmony ‘, instead acting a heavy thumb on the scales of justice and helping to force events that gave the nation an impression that Martin’s death was racially motivated.
Not just George Zimmerman, but the police and the entire town were targeted in rallies that saw people being bused-in for protests. We now have proof via the Judicial Watch release that these rallies were facilitated by the Obama administration. They were also highly racially charged. Close Obama ally Al Sharpton, along with Jesse Jackson, led the charge. As CBS Miami reported: 


“We live in the middle of an American paradox,” Rev. Sharpton told the crowd. “We can put a black man in the White House but we cannot walk a black child through a gated neighborhood. We are not selling out, bowing out or backing down until there is justice for Trayvon.”

“This is not about a hoodie, it’s about racial profiling,” Jackson said. “We will use our marching feet, civil disobedience and every weapon in our non-violent arsenal until justice is served.”


However, much of the rhetoric surrounding the Zimmerman story was violent. Many will remember that the New Black Panther party actually offered a $10,000 bounty for the ‘capture’ of George Zimmerman. As the Orlando Sentinal reported:

New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”

The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, who shot Trayvon in a gated Sanford community on Feb. 26.

Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland — where the 28-year old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. He declined to say when the group would begin their search.


J. Christian Adams knows the New Black Panther Party well; he resigned his position at the DOJ over the refusal to prosecute the Panthers for the now infamous Philadephia voter intimidation actions during the 2008 election. Adams outlined the crimes committed by the NBPP in Sanford:

Let’s start with solicitation to kidnap.  In announcing a reward for the seizure of Zimmerman, the New Black Panthers may have violated Florida Code 787.01.  It makes it a felony to “by threat, confining or abducting, or imprisoning another person against his . . .  will without lawful authority with intent to . .  . terrorize.”

Merely soliciting someone else to do this is also a felony in Florida under Florida Code 777.04.  “A person who solicits another to commit an offense prohibited by law and in the course of such solicitation commands, encourages, hires, or requests another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such offense or an attempt to commit such offense commits the offense of criminal solicitation.”


That’s only part of the list. The New Black Panther’s outrageous, illegal call for vigilante justice happened on March 24th. According the records obtained by Judicial Watch, the Department of Justice deployed to Sanford the next day: March 25th, 2012. However, the DOJ did not go to Sanford to make arrests against the New Black Panthers. Instead, according the the written record, obtained by Judicial Watch, they “deployed to Sanford, FL, to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.”

 Once again, the Holder Department of Justice failed to prosecute the New Black Panther Party. They actually helped facilitate mass rallies against Zimmerman and the City of Sanford. 
These actions are made even more scandalous by the direct insertion of the President of the United States into the story. President Obama made his famous “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon” remark at the White House, but what got considerably less press was the fact that Obama had a prior relationship with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump. Obama worked with him on another racially charged case when he was a Senator. 
Breitbart News reported on the Obama connection to the 2006 story of Martin Lee Anderson. Attorney Crump said publicly that he was following the same media ‘playbook’ as the Anderson case. Tactics included using a photo of Anderson as a child, the same way the media used the Crump-supplied photo of Trayvon Martin as child. This story from 2006 shows the involvement of Senator Obama (who did not end up appearing at the rally), Sharpton and Jackson as well as other usual suspects from the far left.


A rally will be taking place in Tallahassee Friday, April 21 regarding the ongoing investigation into the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Anderson died Jan. 6 at a Panhandle boot camp after being kneed and punched by Bay County Sheriff’s boot camp guards.

Students from Florida State University, Tallahassee Community College and Florida A&M University have been involved in the planning and organization of the event at which Rev. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be making appearances.

Charlie and Martin Sheen, who donated $10,000 to the cause, are also reportedly planning to attend Friday, along with former TLC member Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Afeni Shakur, mother of the murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. According Samantha Greer, an FSU student and volunteer for the Coalition for Justice for Martin Lee Anderson, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois may also make an appearance. Greer stressed that the Coalition is still looking for volunteers and that anyone is welcome to join the cause.


What we saw in 2012 was the Obama administration using taxpayer resources to ratchet up racial tensions in a local crime case and literally creating key story points in the narrative, such as forcing the sheriff to temporarily resign. At the same time, the President himself made an emotional statement about the victim with direct reference to his race, without revealing that he had worked with the victim’s attorney a few years earlier in a similar case. At the same time, Obama media ally (and Sharpton employer) NBC outrageously edited the Zimmerman audio to make Zimmerman appear racist. All these manipulative and deceptive uses of the race card–pushed along by the Holder DOJ at taxpayer expense–happened just months before the 2012 presidential election. 
The only reason this isn’t a major scandal already is the media hasn’t ever done its job and declared it one.

Larimer County, Colorado Sheriff Justin Smith is one of nearly 30 Sheriffs who have signed their names on the dotted line of a lawsuit to overturn the latest slew of gun control laws passed by the Colorado legislature and signed by Governor John Hickenlooper (D).
The suit in which Smith is taking part specifically targets the laws that emerged from HB 1224 and HB 1229.
HB 1224 bans rifle and pistol magazines holding more than 15 rounds that “were acquired after July 1, 2013.” At the same time, it also bans many other magazines by prohibiting smaller magazines “designed to be readily converted.”


When Breitbart News spoke to Sheriff Smith on July 22, he explained:


The problem with this is that those who wrote the law don’t understand firearms or magazines. And many of the most popular firearms have magazines with removal floorplates — for instance, a Glock magazine. This law will effectively ban certain magazines even if they’re under the capacity limit, based solely on the fact that they are expandable or simply give the appearance of expandability. 

HB 1229 put background checks in place for every sale in the state–in store sales, online sales, private sales, and of course, sales at gun shows. Additionally, after forcing every sale to go through a Federal Firearms License (FFL), this law also adds a $10 fee for every background check.
Smith explained to Breitbart News that another asinine aspect of HB 1229 is that it incorporates a 72 hour rule; the law is written so that any time your gun is out of your possession for more than 72 hours you will have to do a background check before getting it back (which also means you will have to pay a $10 fee).

They’ve written the law in a way that the difference between legality and illegality are undefined. They simply stress that the gun has to be in your possession at all times. They’ve tried to clarify this to mean under or within your domain.
But let’s say you’re a Colorado resident in legal possession of gun you owned prior the the July 1, 2013 deadline. You have an automobile accident and while the ambulance takes you to the hospital, police find the gun in your vehicle. They hold the gun for you but you’re in the hospital longer than 72 hours. 
When you finally recover and leave the hospital you ask the police for your gun and they say you have to do a background check to get your own gun back because it’s been longer than 72 hours. Moreover, you have a 17 round magazine in that gun and those are now banned, and because it was out of your possession for longer than 72 hours you’ve forfeited it.  
This is a mess. 

The suit filed by Smith and his fellow Sheriffs is joined by numerous Colorado businesses and individual Colorado citizens. Said Smith: “We are a cantankerous bunch and this is our Alamo.”

The early voting in one of the two recall elections in Colorado is not looking very favorable for the incumbent. Senate
President John Morse is in danger of getting thrown out for
his support for strict gun control laws passed in the 2013 session.
Early voting began Thursday, continued through Friday and Saturday and will resume Monday. The election is on Tuesday.
The recall initiative was launched by gun rights activists against the Colorado Springs Democrat John Morse and Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo because of their votes for the gun laws that include limiting the size of ammunition magazines and requiring universal background checks.


The Denver Post reports that Republicans are dominating in the early voting in Morse’s district and Democrats will have a lot of votes to make up if they want to keep Morse in office.

The vote totals so far from the El Paso County clerk and recorder show that although Republicans only comprise 26 percent of Morse’s Senate District 11, they account for 41 percent of the early voting. 

Here are the figures:
VOTER REGISTRATION: 69,481
Unaffiliated: 26,725 or 37.81%
Democrats: 23,344 or 33.59%
Republicans: 18,174 or 26.15%
Libertarians: 716 or 1.03%
Green Party: 278 or 0.40%
American Constitution: 244 or 0.35%
TURNOUT SO FAR: 9,485
Republicans: 3,923 or 41.36%
Democrats: 3,081 or 32.48%
Unaffiliated: 2,351 or 24.7%
Other: 130 or 1.37%

Meanwhile, Democrats are dominating in the recall voting for the other Democratic senator, Angela Giron of Pueblo as it currently stands.

As the actual recall election goes into its seventh day Sunday, it’s Democrats – many of whom are likely Giron supporters – who continue to hold a sizable lead in voting.
Friday morning, Pueblo County election officials said 5,887 Democrats had voted during the week compared with 3,314 Republicans and 2,054 independents.
That gives Democrats nearly a 2-to-1 margin over Republicans.

In the public relations push for his takeover of the American health care system, President Obama promised that those who like their insurance could keep it, premiums would decrease, and no one would lose their doctor. We know now those were all lies told repeatedly and never questioned by a media that is still looking the other way. Another promise Obama made was that ObamaCare would not fund abortions. LifeNews reports that this was also a lie:
The ObamaCare statute specifically requires the issuers of Exchange plans that cover abortion to “collect from each enrollee in the plan” a “separate payment” for the type of abortions for which funding is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment (which is all abortions other than in cases of life of the mother, rape, or incest) and a separate payment for all other services. [42 U.S.C. 18023(b)]. These separate payments are then to be deposited into separate accounts.


During the regulatory process, commenters questioned HHS on how this was to be implemented, and according to HHS, the commenters “recommended that HHS clarify . . . whether [Exchange plan] issuers may satisfy the separate payment provision by providing each enrollee with an itemized bill, and whether an enrollee’s coverage would be terminated for failure to comply with the separate payment provision.” Rather than doing so, HHS merely said that the comments would be taken into consideration in any future guidance. [77 Fed. Reg. 18430 (March 27, 2012)].
Now, despite the clear language of the ObamaCare statute, it appears that the separate check requirement is not going to be enforced by the Obama Administration. Gretchen Borchelt, director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center, told the Huffington Post that “we used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements, but that’s not the way it’s being implemented.” (Huffington Post, Sept. 3, 2013).
Likewise, a spokeswoman for Rhode Island’s Exchange told PolitiFact Rhode Island that “the customer is not billed a separate fee.” (Politifact, Oct. 2, 2013. The Rhode Island Exchange will handle the billing, not the plan issuers). As PolitiFact notes, “it turns out to be a hidden fee.”

There is nothing the media is willing to make Obama pay a political price for. Not even repeatedly lying to millions who are about to lose their insurance or forcing people to violate their conscience over the abomination of abortion.

The First Amendment served us well for a time, but now it’s outdated.
Remember reading that England had arrested a guy for anti-Muslim Twitter postings in the aftermath of the Woolrich slaughter?  And remember thinking, “Well, this is America, that can’t happen here”?


Oh yes it can.  Obama’s Attorney for the Eastern district of Tennessee wants you to know that if you say something untoward about Muslims, the Federal government may imprison you.
Killian and Moore will provide input on how civil rights can be violated by those who post inflammatory documents targeted at Muslims on social media….Killian said Internet postings that violate civil rights are subject to federal jurisdiction. 
The posting he offers as a “for instance” is an egregious one.  And yet this country has long protected, absolutely, egregious speech, such as hardcore pornography, for a simple reason:  Either you are at liberty to say what you will or you are not.  If you are constantly double-thinking every word you might say, for fear of being prosecuted, you are self-censoring, in anticipation of a possible prosecution by the government.
Rather than having a system in which people were constantly worried about imprisonment for speech, our country has evolved a simple bright-line code:  Speech of all kinds, with a few exceptions that can be counted on three fingers, is absolutely protected.

Remember, the importance of this bright-line, no-exceptions rule of free speech was preached to us, even when some of us might not have liked it so much, as when hardcore pornography was afforded absolute protection under the First Amendment.  In the case of hardcore pornography, it was argued — successfully — that having each artist weigh the possibility of an obscenity prosecution was too much of a burden on his free speech rights, and would have, unavoidably, a chilling effect on speech.
That was the rule then, and that was the rationale.
But now comes the Obama Administration to tell you that Yes, you just might be imprisoned for something you say online, so you’d better Watch What You Say.
Remember when Ari Fleischer said that, without suggesting any kind of legal penalties?   Remember how the media freaked out?
But now comes the US Attorney for the Eastern district of Tennessee explicitly telling you that you may be imprisoned if a political appointee decides your political speech has crossed a line.
Somehow, I don’t think Tim Robbins will be portentously howling us that a “chill wind” is blowing across our rights of free expression this week.

As a precondition for “peace” talks with the Palestinians that will produce nothing, President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry demanded that Israel’s government release over 100 long-term convicted terrorists and murderers, many imprisoned for vicious crimes committed long before either intifada.
The “Elder of Ziyon” blog has compiled a list of those to be released–and their victims. Here is a sample:



Atiyeh Salem Musa: killed Isaac (Aizek) Rotenberg, 67, Holocaust survivor, 1994

Isaac Rotenberg was born to Natan and Miriam Rotenberg in Poland on 15 March 1927. A selektzia was held in his city following the outbreak of the Second World War, and his family was sent to the Sobibór extermination camp. With the exception of him, his younger brother, and his sister, his entire family perished. He was taken with his brother to a labor camp. When a revolt broke out, the two succeeded in escaping the camp, but they lost track of each other in the ensuing commotion. Isaac then made his way to the forest and joined the partisans.
In April 1947, Isaac reached the Land of Israel. He joined the IDF the next year, and fought in the War of Liberation in the north, near Kibbutz Manara.
Isaac was married to Riva, and they had two children, Tzipora and Pinhas. He worked as a plasterer, and was a founder of the city of Holon. Upon reaching retirement age, he decided to continue working a few hours per day to keep himself busy.
On 29 March 1994, during the Passover holiday, as Isaac was hunched on his knees, fixing a floor in his workplace in Petah Tikva, two of the Arab laborers on site attacked him and struck the back of his neck with axes. He was critically wounded, and entered a coma. Two days later, on 31 March, he died.


Hosni Faregh Sawalha–murder of Baruch Heisler, 24, 1990

On 2 December 1990, Yaacov missed his ride to his yeshiva [religious seminary] and instead boarded bus 66 from Petah Tikva to Tel Aviv. Three Arab terrorists boarded at the Pardes Katz stop, and immediately thereafter, at the junction of Ben Gurion Road and Jabotinsky Road in Ramat Gan, began stabbing passengers. Baruch Yaacov was murdered; three others were injured. 


Esmat Omar Mansour–accessory to murder of Haim Mizrahi, 1993

Hayim Mizrahi was born to Mazal and Pinhas Mizrahi on 8 December 1963. He grew up in Bat Yam and Holon with his sisters, Margalit and Asnat, and his brother, Itzik. As a child, Hayim belonged to the junior league soccer team of Hapoel Tel Aviv. Following is army service, he became religious, moved to Beit El, and married Iris.
On Friday, 29 October 1993, Hayim went to buy eggs from an Arab-owned farm near his home, as he was wont to do. He was greeted by terrorists who attacked him and fled in his vehicle after wounding him and stuffing him into the trunk. The terrorists proceeded to murder Hayim, then burned and abandoned the vehicle north of Ramallah.
Hayim was 30 at the time of his death. He was put to rest in Holon Cemetery. Hayim was survived by his pregnant wife, his parents, his sisters, and his brother. Half-a-year after his murder, his daughter, Tehilla, was born.



Obama and Kerry insisted on the release of the terrorists and murderers, and Israel–fearful of losing U.S. support at the UN and against Iran–complied. That is the heavy price demanded by an administration that prides itself as tough on terrorists–while arming them and Syria and releasing them in Israel.

577	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/01/02/Obama-Rendition-Press-Mum	News	1	National Security	Civil Rights	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

During the Bush Administration, mainstream media outlets hammered President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their “rendition” policy that allowed suspected terrorists to be detained overseas in foreign countries and interrogated at the direction of the US government.  Hollywood even made a movie about it, so you know it was important.  
Along with Guantanamo Bay, rendition was cited as an example of the un-constitutional Bush/Cheney dictatorship running rough-shod on the Geneva Conventions and basic human rights.  
As a candidate, Barack Obama indicated that he would reverse the policy in an article in Foreign Affairs.  



To build a better, freer world, we must first behave in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the American people… This means ending the practices of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries, of detaining thousands without charge or trial, of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.

Two days into his presidency, Obama quietly continued the evil rendition policy, and it has continued ever since.  Last week it was revealed that three new detainees were taken prisoner in the small African country of Djibouti and interrogated by American agents:


U.S. agents accused the men — two of them Swedes, the other a longtime resident of Britain — of supporting al-Shabab, an Islamist militia in Somalia that Washington considers a terrorist group. Two months after their arrest, the prisoners were secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in New York, then clandestinely taken into custody by the FBI and flown to the United States to face trial.
The secret arrests and detentions came to light Dec. 21 when the suspects made a brief appearance in a Brooklyn courtroom.

Other than a small handful of news reports, the continuing rendition has received little or no attention and absolutely no condemnation from opinion writers who were hysterical over the Bush-era policies.  
They could be criticizing Obama over his rendition policy, or they could be hammering him over his hypocrisy. They could be… if they were interested in truly speaking truth to power.  But, President Obama is their guy, so rendition is just fine under his watch.

Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who was beaten while marching for voting rights on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on “Bloody Sunday” in 1965, compared National Security Agency (NSA) leaker Edward Snowden to Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
In an interview with the UK Guardian that was published on Wednesday, Lewis said Snowden was following in the footsteps of others who engaged in non-violent civil disobedience. 


“In keeping with the philosophy and the discipline of non-violence, in keeping with the teaching of Henry David Thoreau and people like Gandhi and others, if you believe something that is not right, something is unjust, and you are willing to defy customs, traditions, bad laws, then you have a conscience,” Lewis said. “You have a right to defy those laws and be willing to pay the price.”

Lewis noted that is what “we did” during the civil rights movement and mentioned he “got arrested 40 times during the sixties. Since I’ve been in Congress I’ve been arrested four times. Sometimes you have to act by the dictates of your conscience. You have to do it.”
Lewis also said the federal government similarly spied on and targeted Martin Luther King. 
“We had that problem during the height of the civil rights movement,” Lewis said. “People spied on, and got information on Martin Luther King Junior, and tried to use it against him, on the movement, tried to plant people within different organizations–that probably led to the destruction of some of those groups.
As The Hill noted, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) also likened Snowden to Thoreau and Martin Luther King in June. 
“On deciding when you decide to become a civil disobedient–we’ve had famous ones in our career, but some of them only had to serve, like [Henry David] Thoreau only had to serve one day in jail, Martin Luther King served 30 days in jail,” Paul said then.

Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Fox News over the weekend that the Obama administration is telling individuals who were rescued during the deadly Benghazi attack last September to be quiet about what they know. 
Graham said he “had contact” with survivors and described their accounts as “chilling.” “The bottom line is they feel that they can’t come forth, they’ve been told to be quiet.”
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney refuted that the administration is gagging survivors, telling Fox News last week, “I’m sure that the White House is not preventing anyone from speaking,”


Graham does not buy it and is threatening to hold up all business in the upper chamber if the White House does not release the names of the survivors to Congress. Graham is urging his colleagues in the House to move forward and issue subpoenas of Benghazi survivors if the administration fails to release any information on them. 
“To our leadership in the House, you’re gonna have to up your game on Benghazi,” the South Carolina Republican said. 
Breitbart News first reported in December that Congressman Jason Chaffetz  (R-UT) was being stonewalled by the Obama administration from visiting the injured survivors of the Benghazi attack. 

Since then, Senator Graham has demanded the FBI turn over the interviews with the survivors to no avail. Graham, Senators John McCain (R-AZ), and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) all called for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi assault, while Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA) re-issued a second resolution to form a House Select committee to do the same. 
Wolf and Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA) demanded Sec. Kerry to hand over the contact information of all the State Department employees who worked at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred. Wolf’s resolution currently boasts over 60 co-sponsors.
Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, and Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA), chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee, are looking forward to hear from Benghazi survivors as well.
“We’ll get our chance to talk to Benghazi survivors and get the reports from the FBI. That will happen. I’m confident of that,” Chairman Rogers told Breitbart News. “We want to make sure people have a chance to heal first and we’ll have an opportunity to talk these people before this is over. I’m fairly comfortable this will happen,” he said.
Chairman Issa noted that Secretary of State John Kerry’s visit to a Benghazi survivor opened the door for Congress to question anyone who was on the ground and survived the Benghazi attack. “We expected to speak with all the witnesses and the Benghazi survivors,” he told Breitbart News. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees.” 
Any Benghazi survivor who talks to his committee would be protected from prosecution or job termination from the Obama administration, Rogers said. “We’ll make sure of that. That is whistle bower standard protection. If they’re fired for talking to us, there’ll be some hell to pay.”
Issa agrees, saying, “Any kind of retaliation against any of the witnesses we’ve already had would not be tolerated.” 
Four Americans were killed on site when the U.S. mission in Benghazi was attacked, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens. Questions remain, however, as to the physical health of those who were evacuated from the U.S. compound. Rogers cannot confirm if any evacuee later succumbed to their injuries while being treated at medical facilities.
The Michigan Republican explained, “Like I said, I don’t know. We’ll know before it’s over. My review is not over yet. We’re looking at all the information. We still have cables and emails that we still haven’t gone through one hundred percent yet. It’s voluminous.”  He added, “Were going through it painstakingly. I’m just an old FBI guy, so I’m going through it painstakingly to find to find the truth. My goal is to find the truth. And wherever those facts and leads takes us.”

On Friday, two prominent Republican backers of the Senate immigration bill hosted a conference call with reporters to reveal the “history” behind some organizations opposing the legislation. According to the speakers, a significant amount of the opposition to immigration reform is being led by liberals, environmentalists and pro-abortion and eugenics activists worried about population growth. 
“[T]he primary leaders and funders of the anti-immigration movement were drawn to it because they were also active organizers and supporters of, and contributors to, the population-control movement in the United States,” Mario Lopez, a speaker on the call, recently wrote. Lopez is President of the Hispanic Leadership Fund. Lopez was joined on the call by Josh Culling, with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform.
This ad hominem argument is both inane and irrelevant. People come into issues from all kinds of vantage points. I have no doubt that there active immigration reform opponents who are liberals or have overblown worries about population growth. Those views, however, don’t discredit what they may say on a different issue. Nor do those views discredit what people without those views believe on an issue. 


Friday’s call was a leftist tactic to discount what millions of Americans feel about an issue because some other people hold views with which they would disagree. It was reminiscent of the media’s attempt to smear the entire Tea Party movement because a handful of people said or did something stupid. 

Even if one were to cede the premise that an entire infrastructure to oppose immigration reform were built by population control activists, the fact is immaterial to the concerns many have about the legislation before the Senate. Even if you support expansive legal immigration, it is a bad bill. Its fatal flaw is that it doesn’t secure the border or increase enforcement in any meaningful way. One doesn’t have to be a population control zealot to see the fundamental problem with that approach. 
Surely, the speakers would hopefully acknowledge, there are many opposed to the Senate bill who don’t believe in population control. I would wager the overwhelming majority of Americans who have concerns about the bill are not advocates of abortion or eugenics to control the population. So, why are the views of a decided minority relevant to an issue with national implications? 
The richest irony of the call was that the speakers are allies of groups like SEIU and La Raza in supporting the specific Senate proposal. One could just as easily have a convened a press call to discuss the “history” behind these groups and why conservatives should be cautious about working with them. The speakers on the call, for example, acknowledged doing at least some work with the National Immigration Forum, which has received considerable funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute. Is that the proper alliance for a conservative?
No one should schedule such a call, however. Issues should be decided on merits, not ad hominem aspersions about someone else’s motives. The call was an attempt to smear all opposition to the Senate bill as arising out of the questionable beliefs of a few people. It was an attempt to quash, rather than foster, debate on the underlying merits of the proposal.
The call also perpetuated a dangerously false choice. Conservatives should either accept legislation largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer or be labeled as against reform. That our allies are forcing this choice is unconscionable.

After Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old suspected Boston Marathon bomber whose older brother was killed earlier in a shootout, was captured alive on Friday after a extensive manhunt, a dour President Barack Obama addressed the nation. While he was adamant that the American people do not hold these heinous acts against “entire groups of people,” he did not mention radical Islam at all.
In a stoic Friday evening address that was in contrast to the jubilant atmosphere on Boston’s streets, Obama spoke of the “resolve and determination” of those in Boston, sent his condolences to the family of the MIT police officer who was murdered on Friday by the suspects, and praised Boston’s police officers. 
He vowed to “determine what happened” and find “any associations these terrorists may have had.” Obama also said, “we’ve seen the character of this country” during this “tough week” and that the people of Boston refused to be intimidated and Americans “refuse to be terrorized.” 


He became most animated, though, when speaking about how Americans should not “latch on to any bit of information sometimes to jump to conclusions” before facts are “relentlessly” gathered. 
“That’s why we take care not to rush to judgement, not about the motivations of these individuals and certainly not about entire groups of people,” Obama said. 
Contrary to what Obama and the mainstream media may think, Americans do not “rush to judgment” without any evidence. In this case, there has already been plenty of pieces of evidence to suggest radical Islam may have influenced the suspected bombers, especially older brother Tamerlan.

In an interview with Russia Today, the mother of the suspects said the FBI “were scared of my oldest son” because “they always told me he’s a leader,” and they were “afraid of him because, you know, he is a leader, he talks about Islam a lot.”
She said her eldest son got involved in “religious politics” five years ago, and the FBI was scared of him because of the information he was getting from “extremist” websites. 
But the mother, perhaps like Obama, seemed to be in denial by claiming her sons could not be involved in Jihad and were “set up” by the FBI. The mother claimed the sons would have told her of the terrorist attacks if they really, in her mind, had intended to bomb the Boston Marathon.
On Monday evening, in his first address to the nation after the Boston Marathon bombings, Obama did not refer to the bombings as terrorism. Immediately after he spoke, the White House had to issue a statement that they considered the bombings an “act of terror.”
Obama had to clean up the mess on Tuesday and do damage control in what seemed like a press conference that was called just so Obama could say the words “act of terror” on camera. 
Robert Baer, a former CIA official, said on Friday that that there is a “cultural fight” between radical Islam and the West, and the older brother may have “identified with Jihadism” when “he found religion and wanted to defend Islam” because “it gave him meaning.” Even Piers Morgan, Even Piers Morgan, who is largely sympathetic to Obama and his agenda, discussed the suspected bomber’s potential ties to radical Islam on Friday evening. 
But the Obama administration consistently seems to be either oblivious to or dismissive of the threat of global Jihad. And while Obama has rightfully warned Americans not to make judgments without evidence, Obama has too often ignored evidence of radical Islam’s influence. 
For instance,  the Obama administration refused to call the Fort Hood massacre an act of terror, instead referring to it as “workplace violence.” He also took three days to address the nation after the attempted Christmas Day airplane bombing in 2009.

Next week, the Senate will vote on Obama’s nominee to Chair the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, David Medine. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, followed up the confirmation hearing with a list of questions for the nominee. (The complete questionnaire is posted below.)
In his answers to Grassley’s question about profiling for terrorism among foreign nationals, Medine wrote, “In general, profiling of foreign nationals based solely on their point of departure to the United States is inappropriate.” 
The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on February 28 of this year, approving the nomination of Medine. A vote will be held in the Senate next week. The other four nominees to the board have already been confirmed. They were asked to respond to the same questionnaire. 


The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) was created in 2004 after the 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of a board to safeguard civil liberties and oversee the new authorities granted to the security agencies. The PCLOB was slow to develop, holding its first meeting in 2006. The original chair of the board, Lanny Davis, resigned citing disagreements with the White House. In 2007, legislation updated the board’s statute and established the board as an independent agency within the executive branch. Subsequent nominees were stalled for months, until 2010 when Obama nominated two members and then three additional members in 2011. 

Medine’s opinion that constitutional protections against racial profiling should be extended to foreign nationals should raise serious red flags. “There may be intelligence regarding a plot being developed or partially implemented in a particular foreign country that could, under some circumstances, justify heightened scrutiny of visitors from that country linked to other information about the plot” answered Medine. 
It is important to point out, that eight out of ten fugitives on the FBI’s most wanted terrorists list are foreign-born.  
Medine did not answer questions about his views on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the PATRIOT Act. He is currently an attorney fellow at the SEC and prior that, he worked at the law firm Wilmer Hale.

Officials say that more than a dozen classified rulings have created a secret body of law that gives the NSA the power to gather massive information collections on Americans.  The data collection is not just restricted to terrorism suspects but “people possibly involved in nuclear proliferation, espionage and cyberattacks.”
According to officials who are familiar with these classified rulings, the court has expanded it’s role while assessing “broad constitutional questions” and establishing judicial precedents without any public scrutiny.  Some rulings are over 100 pages long. 


The role of the FISA court has changed over the years, originally approving case by case wiretaps.  In 2007, with greater judicial oversight of intelligence operations and other legislation, the FISA court “has quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court, serving as the ultimate arbiter on surveillance issues and delivering opinions that will most likely shape intelligence practices for years to come, the officials said.”
In particular the court has expanded the NSA’s surveillance authority under a legal principle called the “special needs” doctrine which allows, in cases of terrorism, “an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement of a warrant for searches and seizures.” This doctrine was originally established by the Supreme Court in 1989 when it found that a minimal invasion of privacy is acceptable in order for the government to combat an “overriding” public danger. FISA judges have used this more broadly to allow collecting communications data to track terrorism suspects that “does not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment.”
William C. Banks, a national security law expert said “It seems like a legal stretch.  It’s another way of tilting the scales toward the government in its access to all this data.”  

In one instance, intelligence officials were allowed to access an email attachment that was sent within in the United States  because there was suspicion that it contained the schematics of diagram that could have been connected to Iran’s nuclear program.
But this example of domestic surveillance is permissible because a 2008 law expanded the definition of “foreign intelligence” to include “weapons of mass destruction.”  And other secret findings have “eased access to data on espionage, cyberattacks and other possible threats connected to foreign intelligence.”

“The definition of ‘foreign intelligence’ is very broad,” another former intelligence official said in an interview. “An espionage target, a nuclear proliferation target, that all falls within FISA, and the court has signed off on that.”

In an interview with the New York Times, “current and former national security officials, discussed the court’s rulings and the general trends they have established on the condition of anonymity because they are classified. Judges on the FISA court refused to comment on the scope and volume of their decisions.”
The FISA Court only hears one side of the cases that come before it (the government’s side) and findings are almost never made public. There is a “Court of Review” in case of appeal, but that has only happened “a handful of times in the court’s history, and no case has ever been taken to the Supreme Court.”  
It may not even be possible for the communications companies who are turning over information to the government have a right to appear before the FISA court. 

The FISA court was created by Congress in 1978 in order to serve as a check on wiretap abuses by the government.  There are 11 judges who serve in 7 year shifts, ten were nominated by Chief Justice John Roberts.  Last year the courts heard nearly 1800 cases and according to sources no requests were denied.
FISA judges have had to “intervene repeatedly” when “Internet and phone companies…have raised concerns that the government is overreaching in its demands for records or when the government itself reports that it has inadvertently collected more data than was authorized, the officials said.”
The court has ordered the the NSA to destroy communications records when information has been collected improperly.  According to the New York Times’ sources, 

The judges have concluded that the mere collection of enormous volumes of “metadata” — facts like the time of phone calls and the numbers dialed, but not the content of conversations — does not violate the Fourth Amendment, as long as the government establishes a valid reason under national security regulations before taking the next step of actually examining the contents of an American’s communications.

In 2008, Congress passed new procedures in the FISA Amendment acts where “the collection of metadata must be considered “relevant” to a terrorism investigation or other intelligence activities.”  The courts hae indicated that while individual pieces of data may not appear relevant, “the total picture that the bits of data create may in fact be relevant.”
When pressed about informing the public about these issues, there has been push back. Reggie Walton, the FISA court’s presiding judge, said there could be a potential benefit but there are “serious obstacles.”  General Alexander, the NSA director responded in a public Senate hearing in June  “I don’t want to jeopardize the security of Americans by making a mistake in saying, ‘Yes, we’re going to do all that.’ ”  Alexander pledged to try and make decisions more public.

“If Jesus were alive today, he would be more inclined to say, ‘you know, I didn’t know it all…'” – Rev. Oliver White, Sean Hannity Show, March 27, 2013

In general, most news outlets have provided awful coverage of the Supreme Court proceedings on same-sex marriage.  Covering the proceedings like they cover a political campaign or a sporting event, most of the analysis and commentary has been about political “wins” for one side or the other and the ramifications of the pending decision on homosexuals in our society, rather than the wide-ranging ramifications for society itself.  
Filling the void of thoughtful analysis has been talk radio.  Unlike the vapid and two-dimensional conversations repeated every ten minutes on cable, talk radio has been able to explore larger questions entwined in the same-sex marriage debate and have been able to challenge the politically correct orthodoxy presented in other media outlets where it comes to the religious side of the issue.  


Enter Sean Hannity whose Wednesday show featured a fascinating exchange with Terry Jeffrey, a news editor from CNS News Service, and Rev. Oliver White, a pro-same sex marriage pastor.   Because Hannity is not constrained by the limitations of a TV news schedule and the need to change subjects every 5 minutes, as is so often the case on cable news, he was able to allow the on-air debate over the scriptural basis for marriage to naturally unfold to the point where the lack of scriptural foundation for same-sex marriage was laughingly evident.  
This exchange in particular was the most glaringly infuriating as White, a proponent of same-sex marriage who angered his own congregation recently because of his adamant belief that Christianity supports such a practice, went so far as to agree that Jesus Christ was wrong about His position on marriage being defined as one man and one woman, and if Jesus were alive today he would, in fact, support gay marriage.  


In this segment, the good minister is quizzed further on his unique and ever-morphing interpretation of scripture by Hannity and it’s revealed for the audience that his understanding of sin and morality is quite pliable and able to bend to meet any modern need:  



Finally, Rev. White is able to admit that he does draw moral lines with regard to sexuality, but those lines are rooted less in God’s law but in the current popular practices of the times we live in:  

This is the kind of exchange, full of thoughtful and challenging questions that force the guests and the listener to re-examine what they believe and what they espouse can only happen in a medium like talk radio and new media where hosts are able to take positions and not pretend to be objective. We know there is no real objectivity when Don Lemon or Anderson Cooper are conducting an interview on this topic. Cooper would probably never have Rev. White on in the first place, because he would make the pro-same sex marriage side look bad.  And, if he did have a minister on to discuss the biblical basis for same-sex unions, there is no chance that Don Lemon would be able to pose questions for their guest in the way that Hannity and Jeffry did.   
In general cable and network news have not served the public interest in exploring these complicated and important issues because, in many cases, the hosts and anchors assigned to the topic are just not equipped or are completely unwilling to have both sides of the issue get a fair and through hearing.  
Congratulations to Sean Hannity for taking advantage of his medium and shedding light on an angle of this story that’s been neglected by his TV counterparts.

Billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg defended President Barack Obama’s troubled Obamacare website HealthCare.gov in an interview with ABC News’ This Week in which he pushed for amnesty.
“You know, sometimes stuff doesn’t work when you want it to. We’ve certainly had plenty of mistakes and things that haven’t worked the way that we want to,” Zuckerberg said of Facebook’s website when asked by ABC News about Obamacare’s website failure. “The right thing here is just to keep on focusing on building the service that you think is right in the long term.”

In the interview, Zuckerberg attempted to frame granting amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal aliens as a “civil rights issue”–a talking point used by Attorney General Eric Holder earlier this year. 


“When you meet these children who are really talented, and they’ve grown up in America and they really don’t know any other country besides that, but they don’t have the opportunities that… we all enjoy, it’s really heartbreaking–right? That seems like it’s one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time,” Zuckerberg said. “There are a lot of misconceptions about that… and a lot of them came here because they just want to work. They want to help out their families and they want to contribute.”

Zuckerberg alluded in the interview that his goal in pushing for amnesty is to get tech workers from abroad for his company, rather than hiring Americans for jobs at Facebook.

“The future of our economy is a knowledge economy,” Zuckerberg said. “And that means that getting the most talented people into this country is the most important thing that we can do to make sure that the companies of tomorrow are founded here.”
Zuckerberg’s interview came as he and a group of illegal aliens last week conducted a “hackathon” to push for amnesty. 
“One of the things that the ‘dreamers’ here today show is that even if, you know, you’re a child of someone who came here who wouldn’t be considered one of the higher-skilled workers… you can be one of the entrepreneurs of tomorrow,” Zuckerberg said of the hackathon. “That’s the American dream.”

Zuckerberg was asked, too, about how thus far amnesty efforts have been stalled in Congress, despite all the money he has spent through FWD.us and other lobbyists have spent through their respective outfits pushing to create support in Washington for comprehensive immigration reform. He said he still thinks there is a possibility an amnesty could be passed into law.
“I’m fundamentally an optimistic person, as an entrepreneur,” he said. “The vast majority of Americans want this to happen.”
Zuckerberg has relaunched advertising efforts to push for an immigration bill out of the House this Congress.

It begins.
There is no question that rank-and-file gay couples of all political stripes are sincere in their desire to enjoy the benefits and status that come with marriage. There is no sinister agenda at work in the issue of same-sex marriage among the masses. But the same cannot be said of  the organized left who have always intended to use the issue of gay marriage as a vehicle to destroy the Christian Church and marginalize Christians. 


Faithfulness to the Bible and the Christian faith will very soon be declared bigotry by the media and a de facto civil rights violation by the State. 
What is currently happening to the Boy Scouts of America at the hands of the organized left is nothing more than a trial run for what is surely coming next against the Church. The small ball has already begun: lawsuits, harassment, and media campaigns against those who preach what the Bible says. The Big Leagues, however, don’t launch until the State lights the torchfor the witch hunt, and that has already happened in the state of Washington. 
Although America’s most protected right is freedom of religion, that didn’t stop the state attorney general from filing a suit against Baronelle Stutzman,  a florist who said it was a “violation of conscience” to service a same-sex wedding. 

JD Bristol, attorney for Arlene’s, said his client has many customers and employees who are gay and the claim that she is “discriminating on the basis on sexual orientation is nonsense.” 
“This is about gay marriage, it’s not about a person being gay,” Bristol said. “She has a conscientious objection to homosexual marriage, not homosexuality. It violates her conscience.”
According to the florist, in response to standing by her Christian beliefs, she has received hate mail and threats to burn down her business. 
This is not an isolated incident, either. Back in February a baker who wouldn’t provide a cake for a lesbian wedding not only faced protesters but  is (or was) under investigation by the Oregon Attorney General. Back in 2006, a Catholic adoption service in Boston had to shut down after the government demanded the religious entity service same-sex couples. 
For those skeptical of the organized left’s desire to destroy the Church; one question: is it really a leap to believe that the same government currently attempting to force the Church and other religious business-owners to pay for the abortion pill will soon use the same arguments and precedents to force same sex marriage on these institutions?

The newest Obama scandal is seventeen months old. 
Welcome to Trayvongate, where the President of the United States used both the bully pulpit, the Department of Justice and sly media manipulation to gin up charges of racism in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin shooting. Now that the trial is almost finished and the only act of racism mentioned so far came from the victim–Martin called Zimmerman ‘a creepy ass cracker’ according to testimony–the cynical and repeated use of the race card by the White house is even more abhorrent. 

Judicial Watch revealed documents today that proved what Breitbart News reported in April, 2012: that Eric Holder’s Department of Justice took an active role in racially charged rallies in Sanford, Florida and that the Community Relations Service helped force the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee. That resignation made it appear that Sanford authorities were suspect and possibly complicit in covering up something. 


Some of my reporting at the time was based on interviews with numerous public officials in Sanford who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution from the Obama administration. They described a situation where the CRS team took over and forced decisions while clearing a path for protests and rallies that heightened the appearence of racial tensions. 
The CRS is a small unit within the Department of Justice and ostensibly it serves a legitimate purpose; attempting to cool down tense situation. As its website says:

The Community Relations Service is the Department’s “peacemaker” for community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race, color, and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, CRS is the only Federal agency dedicated to assist State and local units of government, private and public organizations, and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, incidents, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.

However, under the highly politicized Holder Department of Justice, the CRS has acted as ‘spies and muscle’ according to a source familiar with the unit. In the Zimmerman case, they ended up as doing nothing to facilitate ‘racial stability and harmony ‘, instead acting a heavy thumb on the scales of justice and helping to force events that gave the nation an impression that Martin’s death was racially motivated.
Not just George Zimmerman, but the police and the entire town were targeted in rallies that saw people being bused-in for protests. We now have proof via the Judicial Watch release that these rallies were facilitated by the Obama administration. They were also highly racially charged. Close Obama ally Al Sharpton, along with Jesse Jackson, led the charge. As CBS Miami reported: 


“We live in the middle of an American paradox,” Rev. Sharpton told the crowd. “We can put a black man in the White House but we cannot walk a black child through a gated neighborhood. We are not selling out, bowing out or backing down until there is justice for Trayvon.”

“This is not about a hoodie, it’s about racial profiling,” Jackson said. “We will use our marching feet, civil disobedience and every weapon in our non-violent arsenal until justice is served.”


However, much of the rhetoric surrounding the Zimmerman story was violent. Many will remember that the New Black Panther party actually offered a $10,000 bounty for the ‘capture’ of George Zimmerman. As the Orlando Sentinal reported:

New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”

The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, who shot Trayvon in a gated Sanford community on Feb. 26.

Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland — where the 28-year old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. He declined to say when the group would begin their search.


J. Christian Adams knows the New Black Panther Party well; he resigned his position at the DOJ over the refusal to prosecute the Panthers for the now infamous Philadephia voter intimidation actions during the 2008 election. Adams outlined the crimes committed by the NBPP in Sanford:

Let’s start with solicitation to kidnap.  In announcing a reward for the seizure of Zimmerman, the New Black Panthers may have violated Florida Code 787.01.  It makes it a felony to “by threat, confining or abducting, or imprisoning another person against his . . .  will without lawful authority with intent to . .  . terrorize.”

Merely soliciting someone else to do this is also a felony in Florida under Florida Code 777.04.  “A person who solicits another to commit an offense prohibited by law and in the course of such solicitation commands, encourages, hires, or requests another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such offense or an attempt to commit such offense commits the offense of criminal solicitation.”


That’s only part of the list. The New Black Panther’s outrageous, illegal call for vigilante justice happened on March 24th. According the records obtained by Judicial Watch, the Department of Justice deployed to Sanford the next day: March 25th, 2012. However, the DOJ did not go to Sanford to make arrests against the New Black Panthers. Instead, according the the written record, obtained by Judicial Watch, they “deployed to Sanford, FL, to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.”

 Once again, the Holder Department of Justice failed to prosecute the New Black Panther Party. They actually helped facilitate mass rallies against Zimmerman and the City of Sanford. 
These actions are made even more scandalous by the direct insertion of the President of the United States into the story. President Obama made his famous “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon” remark at the White House, but what got considerably less press was the fact that Obama had a prior relationship with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump. Obama worked with him on another racially charged case when he was a Senator. 
Breitbart News reported on the Obama connection to the 2006 story of Martin Lee Anderson. Attorney Crump said publicly that he was following the same media ‘playbook’ as the Anderson case. Tactics included using a photo of Anderson as a child, the same way the media used the Crump-supplied photo of Trayvon Martin as child. This story from 2006 shows the involvement of Senator Obama (who did not end up appearing at the rally), Sharpton and Jackson as well as other usual suspects from the far left.


A rally will be taking place in Tallahassee Friday, April 21 regarding the ongoing investigation into the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Anderson died Jan. 6 at a Panhandle boot camp after being kneed and punched by Bay County Sheriff’s boot camp guards.

Students from Florida State University, Tallahassee Community College and Florida A&M University have been involved in the planning and organization of the event at which Rev. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be making appearances.

Charlie and Martin Sheen, who donated $10,000 to the cause, are also reportedly planning to attend Friday, along with former TLC member Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Afeni Shakur, mother of the murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. According Samantha Greer, an FSU student and volunteer for the Coalition for Justice for Martin Lee Anderson, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois may also make an appearance. Greer stressed that the Coalition is still looking for volunteers and that anyone is welcome to join the cause.


What we saw in 2012 was the Obama administration using taxpayer resources to ratchet up racial tensions in a local crime case and literally creating key story points in the narrative, such as forcing the sheriff to temporarily resign. At the same time, the President himself made an emotional statement about the victim with direct reference to his race, without revealing that he had worked with the victim’s attorney a few years earlier in a similar case. At the same time, Obama media ally (and Sharpton employer) NBC outrageously edited the Zimmerman audio to make Zimmerman appear racist. All these manipulative and deceptive uses of the race card–pushed along by the Holder DOJ at taxpayer expense–happened just months before the 2012 presidential election. 
The only reason this isn’t a major scandal already is the media hasn’t ever done its job and declared it one.

On Tuesday, William W. Taylor III, attorney for Lois Lerner, the IRS official at the center of the Tea Party targeting scandal who invoked her Fifth amendment rights before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on May 22, set forward his client’s hard line conditions to return and testify openly before the committee.
“They can obtain her testimony tomorrow by doing it the easy way … immunity. That’s the way to resolve all of this,” he told Politico.
Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH), a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was unimpressed. “We hope she comes in and gives us the truth and answers questions. If that doesn’t happen, then you cross the next bridge. … If she says, ‘No, I’m going to come in and assert my Fifth Amendment rights again and not going to speak,’ then you think about what the other options are.”


Legal experts have debated whether Ms. Lerner waived her fifth amendment rights when she delivered an opening statement declaring her innocence prior to invoking those rights. On June 28 in a 22-17 party line vote, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ruled that she did waive her Fifth amendment rights with that opening statement.

Should Ms. Lerner continue to insist that she will not testify without full immunity, the next step in this battle of wills and legal tactics could be a vote by the full House of Representatives to determine if Ms. Lerner is in contempt of Congress. If the full House determines she is in contempt, a criminal rather than civil charge, Ms. Lerner could face jail time.
Ms. Lerner’s attorney appears unphased by the possibility his client could face contempt charges. “[N]obody likes to be held in contempt of Congress, of course, but the real question is one that we’re fairly confident about, and I don’t think any district judge in the country would hold that she waived.”
Should the House hold Ms. Lerner in contempt, it would be the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, an employee of the Department of Justice, to prosecute the case. Since Attorney General Eric Holder, who runs the Department of Justice, has already experienced his own difficulties surrounding his testimony before the House of Representatives, it is unlikely, though not impossible, that the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia would pursue prosecution of any contempt charges coming out of the House.
The penalty for contempt of Congress is a fine of $1,000 and up to one year in jail.

An April 2013 email from a career Department of Homeland Security official released on Friday by the office of Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) stated that the Department of Homeland Security “absolutely gave special treatment” to green card visa applications filed by foreign national EB-5 investors in GreenTech Automotive, the company Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe served as chairman of from 2010 to 2012.
In the released email, the names of the sender as well as the recipient have been redacted, but both are described as “career DHS officials.” The text of the email also refers to a person called “D1,” which Senator Grassley’s office believes is US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Alejandro Mayorkas. President Obama nominated Mayorkas to become Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on June 27. 
Mr. Mayorkas testified before a Senate committee holding hearings on his nomination on July 25. The hearings were attended by only Democrats. Republicans did not participate because Mr. Mayorkas is the subject of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office.


The email, dated April 12, 2013, is from a “Senior USCIS Career Official” and is sent to “USCIS Career Officials.” It reads as follows:

We absolutely gave special treatment to GreenTech at the directive of D1. D1 was working directly with the RC’s [EB-5 Regional Center] atty, [name redacted]. Additionally, I would call a wholesale rewrite of the AAO’s [Administrative Appeals Office] decision by the front office special treatment. Look at the first draft in the attached email and the final version, attached.

Senator Grassley asked Mr. Mayorkas about an apparent inconsistency between this email and his earlier testimony in a letter he sent to Mr. Mayorkas on Thursday. Grassley wrote to Mayorkas that “you testified [on July 25]: ‘I have never ever in my career exercised undue influence to influence the outcome of a case.'” Grassley noted in his letter to Mayorkas that “D1 [mentioned in the April 12, 2013 email] is an apparent reference to you.” 
Grassley then cited Mayorkas’ testimony to the Senate committee on July 25:


Several documents call into question some of the statements you made regarding preferential treatment in your testimony at last Thursday’s hearing. For example, you were asked in the hearing about communications with Terry McAuliffe with respect to Gulf Coast Funds Management. You testified: “I was asked to attend a meeting with Mr. McAuliffe so that I could hear in person his complaints… two years ago… I heard those complaints, and that was the extent of the interaction… I moved on with my work.” (Emphasis included in Grassley letter)

But, Grassley wrote, “Contrary to the impression left by your answer, documents indicate that both before and after that meeting, you actually engaged in nearly a dozen contacts with Gulf Coast Funds Management between 2010 and 2013, including direct communications with Gulf Coast’s attorneys.” Grassley concluded, “That one meeting with Mr. McAuliffe was clearly not the extent of your interaction on that matter.”
The EB-5 foreign national investor program has come under intense scrutiny over the past several years. Under the program, enacted into law in 1990, foreign nationals may obtain temporary and permanent green card resident visas in return for investing a minimum of $500,000 in an American company.
The possibility that foreign nationals who have invested in GreenTech Automotive have been granted temporary green card visas due to the political influence of the principals involved is a key issue currently under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office. 
Terry McAuliffe, who was chairman of GreenTech Automotive during the period when political influence may have played a role in the granting of visas, is a friend and chief fundraiser for former President Bill Clinton. Anthony Rodham, brother of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is the President and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management, which the Department of Homeland Security designated the EB-5 Regional Center that works exclusively with GreenTech Automotive to help secure green card visas for its EB-5 investors.
Grassley’s letter to Mayorkas was one of two stories about GreenTech Automotive that made headlines on Friday. In a related story, GreenTech Automotive confirmed to Breitbart News on Friday that it has received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce company documents. According to the Washington Post, those documents were subpoenaed as evidence in the SEC’s investigation into claims made by GreenTech Automotive to its investors.

778	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/05/Obama-Verizon-phone	News	1	Civil Rights	Democrat Scandals	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"
According to a breaking report from the UK Guardian, Barack Obama’s National Security Agency has been collecting phone records of millions of domestic customers of Verizon under a court order obtained in April. The order requires Verizon to turn over phone records on an “ongoing, daily basis” to the NSA, both within the US and between the US and international sources. 
The Guardian reports: “The document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.” The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) handed over the order to the FBI on April 25, and gave them a three month blanket surveillance clearance. That means that numbers of both parties, location data, call duration, and time of all calls are subject to government surveillance. That makes the Obama administration’s oversight essentially unlimited.


The NSA, White House and Department of Justice all declined comment. The court order says that Verizon is forbidden to let customers know about the surveillance. Verizon also declined comment.

The order forces Verizon to turn over electronic versions of “all call detail records or ‘telephony metadata’ created by Verizon for communications between the United States and abroad” … or, more ominously, “wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls.” Every single day, Verizon must turn over that information.
The Guardian says that Verizon may not be the only cell-phone provider targeted with the order, and adds that “previous reporting has suggested the NSA has collected cell records from all major mobile networks.”
The law legalizing this sort of surveillance is 50 USC 1861, a provision of the Patriot Act allowing requests of business records. 

This sort of controversy arose in 2006 under President Bush under the auspices of the war on terror. President Obama essentially declared the war on terror over in April, at about the same point the administration received its blanket surveillance go-ahead from the FISA court.

The Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted for promoting their faith: “Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense…Court martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis…”. 
The statement, released to Fox News, follows a Breitbart News report on Obama administration Pentagon appointees meeting with anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein to develop court-martial procedures to punish Christians in the military who express or share their faith. 


(From our earlier report: Weinstein is the head of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, and says Christians–including chaplains–sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in the military are guilty of “treason,” and of committing an act of “spiritual rape” as serious a crime as “sexual assault.” He also asserted that Christians sharing their faith in the military are “enemies of the Constitution.”)
Being convicted in a court martial means that a soldier has committed a crime under federal military law. Punishment for a court martial can include imprisonment and being dishonorably discharged from the military. 
So President Barack Obama’s civilian appointees who lead the Pentagon are confirming that the military will make it a crime–possibly resulting in imprisonment–for those in uniform to share their faith. This would include chaplains–military officers who are ordained clergymen of their faith (mostly Christian pastors or priests, or Jewish rabbis)–whose duty since the founding of the U.S. military under George Washington is to teach their faith and minister to the spiritual needs of troops who come to them for counsel, instruction, or comfort.

This regulation would severely limit expressions of faith in the military, even on a one-to-one basis between close friends. It could also effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military, as it would not allow chaplains (or any service members, for that matter), to say anything about their faith that others say led them to think they were being encouraged to make faith part of their life. It’s difficult to imagine how a member of the clergy could give spiritual counseling without saying anything that might be perceived in that fashion. 
In response to the Pentagon’s plans, retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin, who is now executive vice president of the Family Research Council (FRC), said on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning: 
It’s a matter of what do they mean by “proselytizing.” …I think they’ve got their defintions a little confused. If you’re talking about coercion that’s one thing, but if you’re talking about the free exercise of our faith as individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, especially for the chaplains, they I think the worst thing we can do is stop the ability for a soldier to be able to exercise his faith.”
FRC has launched a petition here which has already collected over 60,000 signatures, calling on Secretary Hagel is stop working with Weinstein and his anti-Christian organization to develop military policy regarding religious faith. 
**UPDATE**
The FRC petition has now exceeded more than 40,000 signatures at the time of this update.

Former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino told Breitbart News that President Barack Obama was lying when he blamed the cancellation of White House tours on his former agency.
“The president’s absolutely not telling the truth when he said the Secret Service made that decision to cut [the White House] tours,” Bongino said. “That’s the core of it: he is not telling the truth.”


In an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, Obama said the decision, made as a part of sequestration, was not one “that went up to the White House.”
“But what the Secret Service explained to us was that they’re going to have to furlough some folks,” Obama said in the interview. What furloughs mean is–is that people lose a day of work and a day of pay. And, you know, the question for them is, you know, how deeply do they have to furlough their staff and is it worth it to make sure that we’ve got White House tours that means that you got a whole bunch of families who are depending on a paycheck who suddenly are seeing a 5% or 10%–reduction in their pay. Well, what I’m asking them is are there ways, for example, for us to accommodate school groups–you know, who may have traveled here with some bake sales. Can we make sure that- kids, potentially, can–can still come to tour?”
Bongino, who served 12 years in the Secret Service including five years working directly at the White House before leaving to run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Maryland, said Obama is lying because the Secret Service does not make such decisions.

“The Secret Service does not make political decisions,” Bongino said. “The Secret Service makes security decisions. His statement that it was a Secret Service decision internal budget decision–and keep in mind, I’m not speaking for the Secret Service, I’m speaking from experience of being with them. All he’d have to do is cancel one or two of his political trips and his Martha’s Vineyard vacation, which two years ago I was on and helped coordinate, he would save that money times ten. There was just no way this was a sound decision. To insinuate this is the first administration where the White House social office and the Executive Office of the President had no role in cancelling public tours at the White House, that he was the first president who was left out of the decision, is absolute nonsense.”
Bongino said he thinks the president is using “the Washington Monument strategy”–a ploy by a politician who tries to garner public opposition to spending cuts by eliminating popular public services first–in doing this to White House tours. “He wanted to inflict, there is no question in my mind, maximum pain upon the American people. But here’s the caveat: it had to be public pain. If you don’t see it, it doesn’t hurt.”
But Bongino said all the public pressure Obama has taken for the decision to cancel the tours caused the ploy to “backfire.” Regardless, the ex Secret Service agent who served three years at the George W. Bush White House and two years at Obama’s White House said Obama still will not admit he was wrong and is now trying to blame the Secret Service for his own behavior.
“Instead of coming clean and being honest with the American people that your office and likely you as well had a role in this, he’s again pulling the wool over your eyes just like he’s done on Benghazi, the immigration release [of thousands of illegal immigrants] where he said he didn’t know and Janet Napolitano said she didn’t know, this is nonsense,” Bongino said. “These are not security or budget decisions. These are strictly political decisions. Make no mistake about it.”
Bongino said the Secret Service is not correcting Obama because the agency has “a great, elite group of guys and they’re always going to take it on the chin.”
“I don’t speak for them but they’re obviously a patriotic group of men and women and they’re not lying when they say there will be overtime costs saved so it’s not like they’re being disingenuous,” Bongino said. “They’re trying to cover for this guy, I think, because they know it looks bad and they don’t want to get involved in the politics and I don’t blame them.”

Just as they did with the sequester, Democrats will try to blame Republicans for a potential government shutdown or cuts to the budget that may occur as part of a new debt deal this fall. 
Politico reported that, “President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies are eager to tag the GOP as the root cause of Washington dysfunction.” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Kelly Ward told the publication that Democrats are planning to highlight “the inability of Republicans to actually govern” and make that into a central “narrative” going into the 2014 midterm elections.
Even though the sequester idea originated in the White House, as Bob Woodward documented, Obama and Democrats tried to blame Republicans for the calamity that it would cause. Those tactics largely backfired, as a majority of Americans favored the across-the-board budget cuts.


Yet House Republicans and their advisers still remain fearful of Democrats and their tactics that have just recently failed, believing that a government shutdown over de-funding Obamacare or budget cuts would lose Republicans the House.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, said, “If you ask me what is the one thing that could reshuffle the deck on an otherwise stable mid-term environment in 2014, the answer is a government shutdown.” Brock McCleary, a GOP pollster and former NRCC deputy executive director, agreed, saying the “only way Republicans will lose the House is to shut down the government or default on the debt.”
The current continuing resolution to fund the government expires on Sept. 30, and the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit shortly after. Republicans have a 17-seat majority in the House and only four Republicans represent Districts that lean Democratic, which means Republicans will be more vulnerable from the right. Republican voters in most Republican House Districts want them to be more fiscally conservative and de-fund Obamacare. 
Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said his voters would “rather see Republicans veer more to the right” on fiscal matters, and Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, said, “the greatest risk for Republicans is for them to continue to disappoint their supporters. I don’t think they’ve inspired them or given them a reason to support them in quite a while.”
“At some point, they have to communicate to people there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats,” he told the publication.

Obama’s Debt Default Is on His Shoulders While We Shoulder His Impeachable Offenses
Apparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit. To suggest that raising the debt limit doesn’t incur more debt is laughably absurd. The very reason why you raise the debt limit is so that you can incur more debt. Otherwise what’s the point?


It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default. There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first. We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first. However, we don’t have enough money to continue to finance our ever-growing federal government (with our $17 trillion dollar national debt that has increased over 50% since Obama took office). That’s why President Obama wants to increase the debt limit. He doesn’t want to make the tough decisions to rein in government spending. So, he’s scaremongering the markets about default, just as he tries to scaremonger our senior citizens about their Social Security, which, by the way, is funded by the Social Security Trust Fund and is solvent through 2038.

It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense. A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill.

An investigation by Cincinnati Fox 19 reporter Ben Swann finds that Obama Administration claims that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting of conservative groups was the work of two “rogue” low-level employees in Cincinnati, Ohio, strain credulity and are “falling apart.”
Swann reports that so far six IRS agents working out of the Cincinnati office–which is the central hub for processing tax-exempt applications–have been identified as sending scrutinizing letters to conservative groups. These include: 

Mitchel Steele-IRS Agent
Carly Young-IRS Agent
Joseph Herr-IRS Agent
Stephen Seok-IRS Supervisor
Liz Hofacre-IRS Agent
Ms. Richards (full name unknown)-IRS Agent

These agents report to different managers, with a territory manager overseeing those managers.


Swann explains how the process works:


When an application for tax exempt status comes into the IRS, agents have 270 days to work through that application. If the application is not processed within those 270 days it automatically triggers flags in the system. When that happens, individual agents are required to input a status update on that individual case once a month, every month until the case is resolved.
Keep in mind, at least 300 groups were targeted out of Cincinnati alone. Those applications spent anywhere from 18 months to nearly 3 years in the system and some still don’t have their non-profit status. 300 groups multiplied by at least 18 months for each group, means thousands of red flags would have been generated in the system. 
So who in the chain of command would have received all these flags? The answer, according to the IRS directory, one woman in Cincinnati, Cindy Thomas, the Program Manager of the Tax Exempt Division. Because all six of our IRS workers have different individual and territory managers, Cindy Thomas is one manager they all have common. 
It turns out Cindy Thomas’ name is one we have heard before. The independent journalism group ProPublica says in November of 2012 they had requested information on conservatives groups that had received non-profit status. 

Cindy Thomas, says Swann, is the highest-ranking employee in the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Department in Cincinnati. 
Democrats unleashed a barrage of pointed questions to IRS officials on Wednesday in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) said if witnesses today are not more forthcoming and continue to stonewall the committee, “it will lead to a special prosecutor” in order “to get to the bottom of this.” He warned that “there will be hell to pay if that’s the route we go down.”
“It is possible that criminal activity may have occurred,” said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George.

On Friday, Pentagon officials informed a House committee that the President’s formal budget proposal wouldn’t be delivered to Congress until April 8th, more than two months past the statutory deadline. Under federal law, the President is required to submit his budget blueprint to Congress no later than the first Monday in February. President Obama has met that deadline only once. 
When asked at a press briefing Friday, White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest wouldn’t confirm the budget’s release. “I don’t have a budget date to announce to you,” he said. It is telling that the White House didn’t inform Congress of the delay, but left the task to budget staff at the Pentagon. 
A major part of a President’s job is to manage the Executive Branch and its numerous federal agencies. The President’s budget proposal is the Administration’s estimation of the resources it will need to meet its mission and priorities for the coming year. Historically, the President submits his budget before Congress gets to work on a final spending plan. 


This year, however, House and Senate Budget authors will unveil their spending plans weeks ahead of President Obama. Like many other legislative deliberations, Obama will be on the sidelines. 

Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sen. Jeff Sessions blasted the delay. “He will be submitting it after the House and Senate have produced a budget proposal and adjourned for Easter. So while the President speaks of his deep concern for American workers and families, he fails to even submit to Congress his financial plan to help those workers and families.”
Since Obama took office, the government has mostly been on auto-pilot. Senate Democrats have refused for the past four years to even bring a budget plan to the floor for a vote. This inaction has caused the government to run on a series of “continuing resolutions”, which simply extend all current spending, with modest increases, for a set period of time. 
As a result, there have been no real talks about prioritizing spending nor reducing or eliminating ineffective programs. It has allowed Obama and the Democrats to give lip-service to the need to cut spending, without having to provide any specific recommendations. It’s budgetary shadow-boxing. 
Obama is simply uninterested in the day-to-day workload required to successfully manage the federal government. He can’t even be bothered when federal law requires that he “show his work” to the nation.

With President Obama set to precipitate a constitutional crisis over the upcoming debt ceiling, Republicans in Congress must now stand up to the bullying commander in chief. 
Yesterday, after the fiscal cliff had been passed through Congress, President Obama claimed victory. “Just recently,” he told supporters, “Republicans in Congress said they’d never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. We’ve now raised those rates, permanently, making our tax code more progressive than it’s been in decades.”


But more important than Obama’s triumphalism was his insistence that he will not – repeat, will not – negotiate over the debt ceiling. At all. “While I will negotiate over many things,” Obama said, “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed.” Of course, Obama has racked up those bills, and it is he who refuses to pay the freight with any cuts whatsoever. But now he’s declaring the unilateral authority to avoid discussing the debt ceiling. “What the president was saying was, ‘I’m not going to play chicken with the debt limit,'” said Jen Psaki, Obama’s spokeswoman.

Under the Constitution of the United States, the House of Representatives has the power of the purse strings. It is Congress that decides whether or not to incur more debt, not the president. And yet Obama has essentially stated that he will not stand for any negotiation surrounding that Congressional power.
That’s tyrannical. But unlike in the past, the Democrats in Congress are willing to go along with such systemic perversion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has shown himself quite willing to give Obama unlimited power to raise the debt ceiling. 
So the question now is whether Republicans will stand strong against this unconstitutional aggression from President Obama. In 2011, Republicans in Congress caved, and ended up with the pathetic fiscal cliff proposal that set up massive tax increases and an across-the-board cut. Then they made that cave complete in order to avoid those default tax increases.
Now, however, they have a second chance to stand tall. But they will have to stand together, and they will have to hold Obama’s feet to the fire. The issue of the debt ceiling is about more than spending. It is about whether we have a Constitutional system worth preserving, or whether the President should be allowed to run roughshod over it. Speaker of the House John Boehner has been re-elected — and in achieving re-election, he has given himself a second bite at an apple he missed in 2011, during that disastrous debt ceiling debate. The time for compromise is finished. Our thug president ended it. Republicans must realize that, and act accordingly.

Breitbart News has learned that Tea Party Patriots is asking its members to pressure Congress to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the IRS’s targeting of conservative and Tea Party organizations. 
The organization is calling on Congress to conduct “substantive” investigative hearings in the wake of recent reports that senior IRS officials knew in 2011 exactly what was going on, despite initial claims that local “low-level” employees were the only ones involved in targeting conservatives.
Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin said that on Friday “we learned that the IRS lied to Congress and the American citizens when Douglas Schulman said there was ‘absolutely no targeting’ of Tea Party groups who applied for nonprofit status.” Martin was referencing Schulman’s March 2012 Congressional testimony.


Today we are learning that the IRS lied when they said that only “low-level employees” were to blame for outrageous and egregious overreach and abuse of power. The AP is reporting in June 2011, IRS division head Lois Lerner instructed employees to change the criteria for “flagging groups ‘immediately'” and in August 2011 “the IRS” Rulings and Agreements office “held a meeting with chief counsel so that everyone would have the latest information.”  
A Saturday report by the Associated Press, citing a draft of a forthcoming Inspector General report, found that “senior Internal Revenue Service officials knew agents were targeting Tea Party groups as early as 2011.” The AP notes that this report’s findings “seemingly contradicts public statements by the IRS commissioner.”
On Friday, the IRS admitted to targeting conservative and Tea Party groups and apologized for the behavior. But with this new information, Martin said her organization “rejects the apology from the Internal Revenue Service.”
“It appears the IRS committed crimes and violated our ability to exercise our First Amendment Right to Free Speech,” Martin said. “A simple apology is not sufficient reparation for violating the Constitutional rights of United States citizens.”

In the release, Martin said Tea Party Patriots is “encouraged to hear that Congress plans to investigate. Those responsible must be held accountable and must resign or be terminated for their actions.”  
Martin also asked conservative grassroots activists “around the country to help us with two things.”
First, she asked activists to help make sure “that the hearings in Congress are substantive and get to the bottom of this scandal to reveal how deep it runs, how many other lies the IRS has told related to the these tactics, and what will be done to insure no other group of citizens is so unfairly discriminated against solely because they are speaking out against rampant government.” She called on members to “call your Member of Congress and both of your Senators to let them know that we must get to the bottom of this scandal.”
Second, she said Tea Party Patriots needs to “hear from you if you or your local group has felt intimidated by the IRS actions over the last 4 years.” 
Are you part of a local group who applied for tax-exempt status? What is the status of that application?  Did you set out to form a group but were so intimidated by the IRS tactics that you abandoned that goal and wound up participating only as individuals rather than incorporating and coordinating activity with other groups?
Martin provided a website for conservatives to use to submit any stories of abuse, available here.

I have seen more powerful men than Barack Obama fall. I worked in South Africa during Thabo Mbeki’s presidency, when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) won 70% of the vote and earned the power to change his country’s constitution unilaterally. In 2005, I watched from the gallery as he told Parliament he was dismissing his deputy, Jacob Zuma, over allegations of corruption stemming from a lucrative arms deal.
Two years later, Mbeki was ousted by his party and forced to resign his presidency of the country. Zuma is now president, and the ruling party is both fractured by rivalries and weakened by the growing strength of the opposition Democratic Alliance. The growing current of dissent in South Africa is not, primarily, over principles or policies but over clashes over the spoils of power in a time of economic stagnation and turmoil.


President Obama holds unprecedented sway over his own party–and yet the first signs of internal tension are already bursting into the open. The news that he has turned his campaign into a permanent, non-profit organizing outfit to push for his policies has been greeted with frustration by members of the Democratic National Committee, who see the new “Organizing for Action” group as a competitor for fundraising dollars and power.

The Hill reports on the open dissatisfaction at the DNC: 

DNC members said they were caught off guard when the leaders of the president’s reelection team announced Obama for America was morphing into Organizing for Action (OFA), a nonprofit group that can take unlimited “soft money” donations….While the new group will seek to go toe to toe with GOP outside groups like Crossroads GPS, some Democrats aren’t pleased that Obama didn’t fold his powerful grassroots operation back into the DNC.

The looming fights over spending, deficits and debts also threatens the coalition that re-elected President Obama. The Obama administration designed a sequester whose non-defense cuts would scare as many voters and interest groups as possible. It expected that sequester to be canceled; now there is a strong chance that it may go through. If it does, interest groups and lobbies may find themselves fighting each other–and Obama.
Many of the president’s strongest backers were prepared to wait until the election was over to demand their money’s worth. Hollywood, for example, watched the defeat of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in frustration–and patiently waited for Obama to return to office. Now, having won its tax benefits in the fiscal cliff talks, it may revive SOPA again.
Yet it will have to compete with other interest groups in the Democrats’ coalition, who believe that the president was not aggressive enough in his first term and are no longer willing to accept the idea that compromise with Republicans is necessary. The rush to redeem promises made by Obama to each of these constituencies will likely increase friction within Democratic ranks–just as Republicans are pressing their case on debt.
That is why the most important opposition to Obama may come from within–some on matters of principle, such as the loose alliance of liberal and pro-Israel groups opposing Chuck Hagel’s nomination for Secretary of Defense; and others on pure self-interest. Republican opposition will still be critical, especially given the effective veto the House still holds. But it will likely be given a boost by Democrats’ own greed and impatience.

A new poll from NBC New York and Marist College says that disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY), who lied to the American public about tweeting pictures of his junk to random women around the country, is now running a hard second in a potential mayoral matchup. Christine Quinn, the current Speaker of the House in New York, runs first with 26 percent of the vote; Weiner follows with 15 percent. While Nate Silver of the New York Times suggests that this number is actually limp for Weiner, given his 100 percent name recognition, it still gives him a leg up on the rest of the crowd.

It’s no coincidence that Weiner is now preparing to get on his hands and knees before the public in New York. As USA Today reports, Weiner says “I think I’ll be spending a lot of time, here on out, saying I’m sorry.” 

Weiner and his wife Huma are plastered on the new cover of the New York Times Magazine. He still refuses to answer questions about his tweet scandal. But it’s clear he understands he’s got to get the monkey of the story off his back, or he’ll take a spanking at the ballot box. He says, “I have been excruciatingly honest, in letter by letter, detail by detail, with my wife. An embarrassing amount is in the public domain … But out of respect for the idea that I’ve laid it all out for her and out of some respect for the privacy of the people who were at the other end of these correspondences, who had their lives turned upside down, I am not going to go into the details of every bit of it.”

Respect for his own possible mayoral run is more like it. He’s relying on his new book, Keys to the City, to carry him to victory. According to Weiner, the penis apparently mightier than the rhetorical sword.

NBC will produce a miniseries based on the political career of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a project sure to polish her 2016 presidential aspirations. NBC’s programming is consistently left of center, and Bob Greenblatt, NBC Entertainment chairman, donated thousands to Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential bid.
Just casting the gorgeous Diane Lane in the lead role is bias enough.
The project will likely sugarcoat the Whitewater investigation, HillaryCare and TravelGate, but here’s betting the following five moments get left on the cutting room floor.


Those Imaginary chats with Eleanor Roosevelt – This one seems like a visual slam dunk, the sight of the First Lady having tea with a former First Lady–in her mind, at least. Imaginary conversations wouldn’t help Clinton’s image, so these chit-chats will have to go.
The Reset Button – The so-called smartest politician in the world reached out to Russia with a gimmick so silly Carrot Top would hurl it back into his prop trunk. She brought a red “reset” button to her meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as a way to distance herself from past negative vibes. Too bad she didn’t bring her English to Russian dictionary along since she bungled the translation. The moment wasn’t just embarrassing on the surface. Her button malfunction also signaled how she would undercut our allies in the region. 
“Under Sniper Fire” – Clinton tried to burnish her tough gal image with a fictitious story in which she was in danger from sniper fire during a 1996 trip to Bosnia. Clinton repeated the tale several times before admitting her landing reception wasn’t quite so deadly. 
“What Difference … Does It Make?” – Clinton’s infamous reaction to a line of questioning regarding the death of four Americans in Benghazi is a portrait of clinical indifference, and a quote that would haunt the rest of her political career had a Republican uttered it in that context.
“Vast Right Wing Conspiracy” – Clinton uttered this defense of her philandering husband, President Bill Clinton, as the Monica Lewinksy scandal was finding its legs. She blamed the rumor of her husband’s unfaithfulness on his political enemies, the so-called “vast right wing conspiracy” committed to ruining his career. This moment might make the final cut, if only put in the context of Republicans using her husband’s infidelities as a weapon against him. As if Democrats would do no such thing.

This week, the Daily Beast contacted and harassed private citizens who made contributions to Sarah Palin’s political action committee, SarahPAC. In doing so, the outlet attempted to also weaken her organization by smearing it in the eyes of those most responsible for ensuring Palin’s free-market populist message and conservatism is widely disseminated. 
During the first half of 2013, a political off-year in which there are few elections, Palin’s political action committee spent $35,000 more than it took in. The Daily Beast seized on that number and tried to convince donors to SarahPAC that Palin was defrauding them by spending money on expenses common to every political action committee.
As the Daily Beast conceded, Palin’s donors were not buying the Beast’s malarkey. 


Tim Crawford, the treasurer of SarahPAC, told Breitbart News that since 2013 is an off-year, the organization did not aggressively raise money, cognizant of the fact conservative donors were flooded with requests during the 2012 election cycle. 
“For the most part we gave our donors a break and didn’t fundraise aggressively at all. Very pleased with the results,” Crawford told Breitbart News. “It is an off year after a presidential election where every donor was bombarded with requests.”
As the Daily Beast mentioned, Palin’s PAC did make a $5,000 contribution to Jason Smith; the conservative Republican won a special election in Missouri’s Eighth Congressional District in June by a hefty margin, 67% to 27%. 

John Avlon, the co-founder of the anti-Tea Party “No Labels” group, was recently promoted to be the “Executive Editor” of the Daily Beast. Avlon oversees a publication that declared the Tea Party was dead earlier this year before conceding less than six months later that the movement has roared back to life. 
“No Labels” donors want to see the Tea Party destroyed, and Avlon’s group benefits financially and politically if the Tea Party and conservatives are weakened. Palin, coincidentally, is the political figure who former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint said had the most impact in Republican primaries. Furthermore, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) declared at this year’s CPAC that he would not be in the Senate were it not for Palin’s support in the Texas Republican Senate primary. 
Showing Palin’s strong grassroots support, the Daily Beast acknowledges that 75% of SarahPAC’s donations are from “small donors” who contribute less than $200. The Daily Beast admitted they reached out to a “number” of donors and got three on record, all of whom dismissed the outlet’s assertion that SarahPAC was wasting their money. 
One donor said, “I trust her judgment and her record.” Another said she has “done research” on Palin’s advisers and the ones that she uses are the “good” ones. Another donor mocked the Daily Beast for insinuating Palin was wasting their money, simply telling the reporter, “Come on, get real.”
The publication seems troubled that Palin, a figure whose star power is surpassed by few in American politics, paid North Star Strategies’s Jason Recher to organize and accompany Palin to events to ensure they went smoothly. To the Daily Beast’s surprise, Palin also has advisers, like Rebecca Mansour–who is mentioned in the piece–that are indispensable to any political figure, especially those like Palin whose time is in demanded like few others. 
Breitbart News has already systematically undercut Avlon’s assertion that Palin was being hypocritical for railing against Washington’s permanent political class while having political advisers who fight against it. Palin’s advisers are different, as Breitbart News reported:

They don’t hang “for sale” signs around their necks every election cycle to field a slate of candidates to butter their breads. They don’t go on television shows while not disclosing their business interests or allegiances when attacking other candidates. In fact, it is difficult to even think of the last time a Palin staff member actually went on a television program. Again, it is because these are people who work for Palin, are assembled for the long run, and put Palin’s interests ahead of their own. They don’t have a stable or roster of clients. 

In closing, the Daily Beast criticized Palin’s PAC for spending money on hotel rooms so that Palin could give a “commencement speech in the tiny town of Republic, Washington.” As Breitbart News reported, Palin gave that speech in a town elitist New York outlets like the Daily Beast so often dismiss, deride, and ignore.
The Daily Beast criticized Palin for paying her way–and not forgetting her roots–to speak at the high school graduation in Republic, Washington. Perhaps the outlet expected her to walk or drive to give that address. More disturbingly, though, the outlet harassed and pestered private citizens who donated to her political organization, trying to turn them off from supporting a political figure and organization that runs counter to the one co-founded by the Daily Beast’s Executive Editor. 
That is the type of permanent-political-class politics that Palin and her political action committee have always fought.

On Sunday, a 60 Minutes investigative report by veteran CBS reporter Steve Kroft and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer revealed how leadership PAC loopholes allow members of Congress to convert campaign cash into lavish lifestyle upgrades for themselves and their family members.  
“It’s another example, unfortunately, where the rules that apply to the rest of us, don’t really apply to the members of Congress,” said Schweizer on 60 Minutes.
The report, which contained selected material from Schweizer’s forthcoming book Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets, revealed embarrassing and outlandish instances of cronyism and self-enrichment by members of Congress. Despite the fact that funds from leadership PACs are supposed to go to help elect fellow members of one’s own political party, lax campaign laws allow lawmakers to turn their leadership PACs into private slush funds to fund just about anything.



Rep. Rob Andrews (D-NJ), for example, tapped his wife, a lawyer and an associate law dean at Rutgers School of Law-Camden, to be a PAC compliance officer for his leadership PAC. She approved the use of donor dollars to fly her, Rep. Andrews, and their two daughters to Edinburgh, Scotland for a wedding at a posh resort. Andrews’s leadership PAC paid $16,575 in airfare. His campaign committee picked up the rest of the tab, which was slightly under $14,000. Schweizer says Andrews’s leadership PAC even paid for the wedding gift, which was china from Bloomingdale’s. Andrews and his wife even merged a campaign event with their daughter’s graduation party, allowing them to combine the costs of the two events, even though the PAC did not pick up the entire bill.
When Kroft confronted the Democratic New Jersey congressman, Andrews said, “I think we should take a look at having clearer rules at what they can and cannot be spent for. I’d be for that.” Andrews claimed he could not speak more on the matter because of a pending House Ethics investigation, even though Kroft said the committee told him they were fine with Andrews speaking about the matter.

Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) attempted to use $6,230 in campaign funds to pay for a personal trainer. Meeks’s staff claimed using campaign money for a fitness instructor is a legitimate expense, because gym visits alleviate stress from Meeks’s “official duties.” The investigation also revealed that Meeks has used $35,000 from his leadership PAC on NFL games.
Sen. Saxby Chambliss’s (R-GA) leadership PAC dropped $107,752 at the Breakers resort in Palm Beach during the 2012 election cycle. That is over three times as much money as he gave the National Republican Senatorial Committee to get fellow Republicans elected. One year, Chambliss spent nearly one-third of his entire leadership PAC funds on golf, limos, and at least one private jet ride. His leadership PAC also picked up a $26,814 dinner tab at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse and $10,344 at Pebble Beach.
The 60 Minutes special also revealed how members of Congress exploit a self-loan loophole that allows politicians to loan their own campaigns money at high interest rates and then let the loans linger to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in passive streams of profit for themselves. 
Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) has bagged at least $294,245 since 1998 by loaning her congressional campaign money at interest rates up to 18%–a scheme that effectively funneled campaign contributor donations into her personal bank account. After numerous attempts to interview Napolitano, Kroft finally confronted her outside a Hispanic Caucus meeting.
“She told us that as a woman and a minority, banks wouldn’t lend her money, so she had to withdraw $150,000 from an investment account to lend it to her campaign,” said Kroft.

Kroft then questioned why she would charge 18% interest. “That’s what the Mafia gets,” he exclaimed.
“It isn’t like I’ve really profited,” said Napolitano. “I still live in the same house. I drive a small car. I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”

The 60 Minutes report also revealed that members of Congress are permitted to use leadership PAC money to hire their own family members. As Kroft and Schweizer point out, most corporations have nepotism laws that prevent the hiring of family members. And while congressional rules bar family members from serving on a congressman’s official staff, lawmakers are free to hire family to serve on their campaigns.
Former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) put his daughter, grandson, daughter’s mother-in-law, grandson-in-law, granddaughter, and another relative–six family members in total–on his campaign payroll. The Paul progeny received a combined $304,599.
Kroft also confronted retiring Rep. Rodney Alexander (R-LA) about actions Schweizer reports on in Extortion. Alexander paid his two daughters over $130,000 in combined expenses for working on his campaign, which he won with an overwhelming 78% of the vote. Kroft asked Alexander what his daughters did.

“They do everything that others do for other campaigns,” said Alexander. “Somebody has to do that work. I kept it with someone I can trust. If one can’t trust their daughter, then who can they trust?”
Kroft and Schweizer agreed that leadership PACs are hotbeds of cronyism and self-enrichment.
“The abuse is substantial and pretty widespread,” said Kroft. 
Schweizer agreed and said that is precisely how the Establishment likes it.
“We hear a lot about how there’s so much partisan fighting in Washington,” said Schweizer. “Here’s a great example of bipartisanship. Both sides like this current system.”
Sunday’s 60 Minutes report is just the tip of the iceberg. According to Schweizer’s publisher, next week’s Tuesday release of Extortion will include never-before-released documents and revelations on several top Democrats, Republicans, President Barack Obama, and Attorney General Eric Holder.

Beyond the media fawning over the spectacle of President Barack Obama and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sitting down for an interview together on 60 Minutes–old rivals, reunited!–there is a message that the president wants to send. Not just the fact that Vice President Joe Biden will not be his first pick for 2016, but also the signal that Republicans ought to forget about a revival in four years: liberalism is here to stay.
Republicans seem to have concluded that their overall revival depends on finding the right candidate to win. If so, they may be in for a long wait. Clinton is so popular right now–with Republicans as well as Democrats–that she is easily the favorite to win in 2016. Freshman Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) welcomed her during last week’s Benghazi hearings by telling her he had wished her to win the 2008 Democratic primary; even Paul Ryan suggested on Meet the Press that a President Clinton might have solved the debt crisis by now.


Clinton’s popularity is partly due to the fact that she is so different to Obama. She is not as hostile to opposition, and gives more direct-sounding answers to tough questions, even when she is being just as evasive. She once gave the impression of being more centrist, as well, famously voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War–a vote that her rival punished her for on the campaign trail in 2008, claiming he would have voted differently.

In truth, there is not much daylight between the Alinskyite pair. Clinton not only carried out the Obama administration’s awful foreign policy–she did so with enthusiasm. She lectured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 45 minutes over construction in Jewish parts of Jerusalem, for example, and launched an abortive “reset” in relations with Russia (a gesture that failed even in its theatrics; the button read “overcharge”).
Obama and Clinton are also closely bound together in the Benghazi failure, a scandal whose details are still being kept from the public, even though it is broadly clear that the White House chose not to intervene to save U.S. personnel, and at the same time engineered a cover-up in which both Obama and Clinton agreed to a fraudulent alibi that blamed the deadly attack on an anti-Islam video on YouTube that few had seen.
Yet the two have avoided accountability, since the media failed to pursue the Benghazi scandal before the election (or actively suppressed it), and now that the election is long gone, most have adopted the “what difference does it make?” attitude displayed by Clinton on Capitol Hill last week. She ought to be haunted by those words, and those four dead Americans, for the rest of her career; chances are, however, that she will not.
Obama’s joint interview was likely planned as a gesture of support and unity as the Benghazi scandal returned–however briefly–to the headlines. Yet it also serves a political purpose for the president, as he moves forward with an aggressive and confrontational agenda designed to divide and marginalize opposition and lay the foundation for radical changes, not just for the next four years but the in years beyond.
President Obama wants Republicans to know that the left’s moment is not fleeting; that the changes he makes today will be ratified by the electorate, through Clinton, in 2016 and possibly 2020; in short, that there is no hope for a resurgence and they may as well yield. Whether he succeeds may depend less on how Republicans rebuild themselves, and more on whether Biden–and other Democrats–disrupt the Obama-Clinton alliance.

The Huffington Post reports that NBC’s Chris Matthews, longtime host of MSNBC’s “Hardball,” took the opportunity at an event Thursday to publicly insult New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Responding to a question with a joke, Matthews said he felt bad for Christie’s wife. The obvious insinuation is that the overweight governor crushes her during sex:   
Two days after Election Day, Chris Christie has crushed his opponent. Is he gonna be the Republican …” began McGrath.


“The one I feel for is his wife,” Matthews cut in.
After a brief pause, some chuckled as McGrath asked, “Why’s that?”
“Did you just say, ‘crush?'” Matthews said. “I mean, use your imagination.”

The crowd erupted.
This is not the first time Matthews has publicly mocked Christie’s weight:
Matthews said during a “Q & A Cafe” event two years ago with Carol Joynt, “He must be 300-plus, and that’s something he’s just gotta deal with, because you’re not going to say, ‘I’m going to cut the budget,’ well, how about starting with supper?”
In their efforts to undermine a likely GOP presidential candidate, the mainstream media have taken issue with Christie’s weight in various ways, ranging from cheap shots to scare tactics. Earlier this week, Time Magazine declared Christie the “elephant in the room” on its cover. Earlier this year, CNN’s Jim Acosta warned Americans that Christie could die in the Oval Office. 
It is also no coincidence that Politico piled on today with a “serious” piece examining Christie’s weight. 
The media love Christie when he is hugging Barack Obama and trashing conservatives. But the media also know that he is about to threaten Hillary Clinton’s ascension to the White House. By laying the groundwork with the weight issue now, the media hope to turn Christie into a national fat joke as a way to undermine his candidacy.

On Saturday, the New York Times reported that Organizing for Action–the Obama for America presidential campaign structure recently re-organized as a 501 c 4 tax-exempt “issues advocacy” non-profit–is offering access to President Obama to any donors (individuals or corporations) who contribute $500,000 to the group. According to the Times, such contributions place “donors on a national advisory board for Mr. Obama’s group and [gives them] the privilege of attending quarterly meetings with the president, along with other meetings at the White House.” 
The Obama team’s brazen attempt to convert the assets of its political campaign into assets to promote the President’s political agenda and the electoral fortunes of his Democratic allies is unprecedented in American political history. It is clearly a violation of the intent of current federal election laws. 
The Obama team is betting that they’ve cleverly discovered a loophole, one that Republicans will fail to challenge legally. Even if the legality of this unprecedented and highly political attempt to circumvent the intent of federal election law is challenged, Obama’s team is further betting that their attorneys will argue their case successfully before regulators and judges. To date, the Obama tactic has caught Republicans flat footed.


Not only is the conversion of questionable legality, it also is in absolute contradiction to everything President Obama has ever said about the negative influence of large financial donations on the political process in America. In 2010, for instance, when the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision paved the way for SuperPACs that could accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations alike, President Obama was one of the Court’s harshest critics. But the President’s opinion on the evils of unlimited donations to political organizations–especially those that pretend to be “issues advocacy” groups–appears to have changed in the three years since that decision.
The expensive and valuable assets of Obama for America were quickly made available to Organizing for Action, which has already begun to use them extensively in Obama’s “permanent campaign,” hosting State of the Union listening parties and bombarding the internet with pro gun control emails. It is unclear if the new Organizing for Action entity has paid fair market value–or anything at all, for that matter–to the old Obama for America organization for these assets.
The assets include a sophisticated state-of-the-art analytics driven data base that holds extensive information on each of 2 million Obama for America volunteers, 17 million email subscribers,  22 million Twitter followers, and virtually every registered voter in the country. These assets will deployed by the same management team that ran Obama for America, headed up by former campaign manager Jim Messina. At Organizing for Action, Messina will use the technological infrastructure developed over several years at Obama for America to instantaneously deliver communications in multiple formats (email, text, facebook, tweets) using the same methodology to the same vast audience that received those very similar messages during President Obama’s presidential campaigns.

“Issues advocacy” social welfare non-profit groups organized under Section 501 c 4 of the Internal Revenue Service code, which Organizing for Action claims to be, are not subject to the same federal election laws that prohibit corporate donations and limit individual contributions to political candidates to $2,600 per election. In its new iteration, the organization that was until January 17, 2013 known as Obama for America and was governed by these strict campaign laws can now accept unlimited donations from both corporations and individuals. Better yet, it is not required to publicly disclose the names of these donors.

All this is happening while the Organizing for Action management team–and the Obama administration–are pretending and saying out loud with a straight face that it is not a political organization. In reality, it is nothing but a political organization, and its immediate purpose is to advance the President’s second term agenda and defeat Republican House and Senate candidates in 2014. With that accomplished, and Democrats in control of both the House and Senate there will be nothing to stop President Obama and his radical left wing agenda.
Even MSNBC’s Chuck Todd found the cash for access scheme unpalatable. “This just looks bad,” Todd said on Monday. “It looks,” Todd said “like the White House is selling access.It’s the definition of selling access. If you believe money has a strangle hold over the entire political system this is ceding the moral high ground.”
Todd is right. It looks bad because it is bad.
Bob Edgar, the president of the usually liberal advocacy group, Common Cause, agrees with Todd. “It just smells. The president is setting a very bad model setting up this organization,”he said.
White House press secretary Jay Carney tried to sell the administration line that Organizing for Action is just like any other 501 c 4, and this sort of thing is done all the time to the usually compliant White House press corps on Monday, but most of them could barely withhold their incredulity at Carney’s claims. Indeed, Carney became so frustrated at their skepticism that he abruptly curtailed the normal press briefing and walked off unceremoniously as unanswered questioned were left hanging in the air.

Arizona is once again embroiled in a fight against the federal government at the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court heard arguments on Mar. 18 in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona.
In earlier years people had to go to their county seat of government–typically the county courthouse–to register to vote in a system that made it very difficult to commit voter registration fraud. A federal commission is authorized by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA, or “Motor Voter”), which was pushed and signed by Bill Clinton, to develop a federal form for mail-in registration. 


Arizona passed a law requiring people registering to vote by mail to include proof of citizenship. It was designed as a modest attempt to prevent illegal voting by foreigners that could undermine the legitimacy of the election returns in the democratic process. 
The record in this case includes over 200 people who had submitted fraudulent voter registrations, who later swore under oath to a commission investigating this matter that they were not even U.S. citizens. They say workers from groups like the now-defunct ACORN–who were getting paid for each registration form they turned in–talked them into signing it, and that these individuals did not know it was a crime for them to do so. 
NVRA requires states to “accept and use” the federal form. Arizona argues it accepts and uses the form, and that adding the requirement for someone to attach proof of citizenship is allowed. The plaintiffs and the Obama administration argue that if you add anything to the federal requirements, you are not accepting and using the federal form. This case will turn in part on which side the justices take on that issue. 

Usually when federal law conflicts with state law, it is resolved under the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution, whereby federal law trumps state law under certain circumstances. Instead of the Supremacy Clause, this case will be decided under the Elections Clause in Article I of the Constitution. That provision says that states are primarily in charge of voting and elections, but “Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations …” 
There is a large body of Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Supremacy Clause. This case may turn on whether the Elections Clause works by the same rules, or instead if there is a different framework that determines when federal election law trumps state election law.
It is unclear which way this case will go, with some justices sending signals one way or the other. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, “Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled. And it was to be [signing the form where you declare you are a citizen, under] penalty of perjury.” She added she understands NVRA as saying, “each state must accept and use the federal form, period. That’s the end of it.” 
Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to fault Arizona for not making certain claims earlier in the litigation. But Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne explained that this lawsuit began under his predecessor Terry Goddard, who is a Democrat, and that Horne did not know why Goddard did not think to use a different strategy. 
Scalia also seemed sympathetic to Arizona’s argument. For example, he remarked that the federal form requires nothing to show the individual is a citizen except, “check off, ‘I am a citizen,’ right? So it’s under oath. Big deal. If you’re willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose you’re willing to violate the perjury laws.”
Going into yesterday’s argument it was possible that two justices, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, were swing votes in this case. We should find out by late June which side prevailed.

Tamara Keith of National Public Radio filed a story Tuesday on efforts by liberal non-profit groups to claim that they, too, were “targeted” by the IRS, just as conservative groups were. None of them, however, can claim that they were singled out because of their names or views–and many received approval before the 2012 election.
Keith notes that several “progressive” groups received extensive inquiries from the IRS when they applied for 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 status, including intrusive questions about their donors. Some complain that approval took nearly two years. Keith draws parallels between their experience and that of conservative groups.


But Keith notes that “everyone” agrees that what happened to groups with “Tea Party” and “Patriot” in their names was wrong–and could well have added that there are no parallels to some of the worst abuses that conservative groups endured, such as questions about the content of their prayers, or leaks of donor lists.

Keith’s report amplifies one of two narratives Democrats and the left have been spinning in the past several weeks to deflate the IRS scandal. One is that the IRS ought to be investigating political non-profit groups; the other, somewhat conflicting story is that the abuse conservative groups experienced was not unique.
The story was released on the day that Tea Party groups are gathering for an “Audit the IRS” rally in Washington to protest the agency’s conduct. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee continues its investigation of the IRS, as legislators debate calls for a special prosecutor into the scandal.
Update: As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn has noted, Democrats did not call any liberal non-profit groups to testify before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month when several of the Tea Party and conservative groups that had been targeted spoke to legislators about their experience of abuses by the IRS.

While conservatives grapple with Obama’s nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel to head the Defense Department, the Left is struggling with Obama’s decision to nominate John Brennan as the new CIA Director. Dubbed the “Assassination Czar” by the far-left program Democracy Now, Brennan was Obama’s original choice to head the CIA when he was first elected in 2008. An uproar from the left, however, caused Brennan to withdraw his nomination. With reelection safely behind him, though, Obama clearly feels emboldened to push again for Brennan. 
The left’s ire was particularly acute four years ago, because Brennan had been a high-level CIA official during the Bush Administration. At the time, the left was consumed with moral urgency to reverse many Bush anti-terror policies. Brennan was seen as a key player in the development of those policies.

Brennan spent years at the CIA and served as chief of staff to former director George Tenet during the creation of the post-9/11 detention and interrogation programs. The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer described him as a “supporter” of the programs, which included torture and the use of secret prison “black sites.”

After he withdrew his name for consideration for the CIA job, Brennan was appointed by Obama to be his chief counter-terrorism advisor. In that role, he has overseen a sweeping expansion of the drone program and adoption of a “kill list,” where the President can order targeted assassinations of terrorists. 



Brennan has helped construct and justify the Administration’s claim that it can kill people, including American citizens, abroad on its own authority, even when those people are not in countries with which we are at war. His speech in April was a sort of catechism, culminating in “targeted strikes are wise.” We have done it in Pakistan and Yemen; could we do it in London or Paris?

In the aftermath of Brennan’s nomination yesterday, the ACLU cautioned the Senate not to proceed with confirmation “until it assesses the legality of his actions in past leadership positions in the CIA during the early years of the George W. Bush administration and in his current role in the ongoing targeted killing program”. ACLU’s statement is telling, since the organization doesn’t usually take positions on nominees for the executive branch. 

Obama’s decision to forge ahead with Brennan’s nomination suggests he feels he has a personal political mandate following his reelection. Brennan’s legacy hasn’t changed in the four years since his name was first floated as CIA Director. If anything, the civil libertarian critique of his record has strengthened, given the increased use of drone strikes and targeted assassinations. 
Obama understands, however, that much of the left’s outrage directed against Bush wasn’t as much about his specific policies as his political affiliation. Obama has continued most of the Bush-era anti-terror policies, as even staunch leftists now wearily acknowledge. 

Although I actively opposed Brennan’s CIA nomination in 2008, I can’t quite muster the energy or commitment to do so now. Indeed, the very idea that someone should be disqualified from service in the Obama administration because of involvement in and support for extremist Bush terrorism polices seems quaint and obsolete, given the great continuity between Bush and Obama on these issues. Whereas in 2008 it seemed uncertain in which direction Obama would go, making it important who wielded influence, that issue is now settled: Brennan is merely a symptom of Obama’s own extremism in these areas, not a cause. This continuity will continue with or without Brennan because they are, rather obviously, Obama’s preferred policies.

A tiredness usually settles in during a President’s second term. Even the left gets weary of its moral outrage. While the usual suspects are expressing outrage over Brennan’s nomination, his confirmation fight will likely end with a whimper. As Greenwald notes, these are “obviously Obama’s preferred policies.”

Sarah Palin called on President Barack Obama to “pay his respects” to slain American hero Chris Kyle with “some gesture of condolence” before she, along with her husband, Todd, attended Kyle’s public memorial and funeral service in Dallas, TX Monday at Cowboys Stadium. The Palins became good friends with Kyle in the past two years. 
Kyle, the former Navy SEAL and author of American Sniper, a New York Times bestseller, was murdered on February 2 at a Texas gun range, allegedly by a former Marine suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) whom Kyle was trying to help. 
In a Facebook note, Palin wrote she found it “sad to see that flags aren’t flying at half staff for this American hero” and hoped Obama “pays his respects in some gesture of condolence” for someone who “sacrificed so much to keep him and all of us safe.”


Obama has publicly acknowledged people like Sandra Fluke and famous rappers, but he is not attending Kyle’s funeral and did not issue a statement after Kyle’s death. 

“We may never know to what extent Chris kept us free or how many lives he saved by his brave actions in the line of fire. But his fellow warriors know how important he was. My son Track couldn’t meet Chris when Todd and I first met him because Track was deployed to Iraq,” Palin wrote. “Then when we got to know Chris even better, our son was deployed in Afghanistan. We’ve met a lot of people in recent years, and Track has been privileged to meet them as well. But he said about Chris, ‘Mom, he’s the ONE person in the entire world I would be star-struck to meet. He’s it.'”
Palin first met Kyle during the premiere of Stephen K. Bannon’s “The Undefeated” movie in Pella, Iowa in 2011. Kyle was in charge of security for that event.
After attending the funeral, Palin suggested ways to honor and remember Kyle and, in another Facebook posting, wrote:

It was a beautiful memorial service for Chris Kyle at Cowboys Stadium this afternoon. What a celebration of a great life! All in all, is there a finer human being who has crossed the 50-yard line star in Texas than Chris Kyle? Please click on the following link for information on how we can help out the families of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. As patriotic Americans, this is a tangible way to show appreciation and support for good people. On a personal note, I thank you who’ve sent birthday greetings today, and it would be awesome if you’d join me in supporting the families of these heroes by helping them out!

The Palins got to know Kyle better when Todd Palin was on the show “Stars Earn Stripes” with Kyle. The Palins, along with the rest of the cast, spent a lot of time on set with Kyle’s family. Kyle was the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. 
“God bless this great warrior,” Palin said. “Let us keep his wife and children in our prayers, and may we never forget him or his sacrifice.”

Don’t look for a new Justice Department report about American gun violence to receive any serious media coverage over the coming days, or ever.  According to the report from the department’s Bureau of Statistics, every argument the media and the left are currently making to push for new restrictions on our Second Amendment civil rights, are made up of anti-science nonsense. This report not only proves the media wrong, it proves the NRA right. 
Between the years of 1993 and 2011, as the assault weapons ban expired, more Americans purchased guns, the Supreme Court overturned outright gun bans, and individual states not only loosed gun control restrictions but also issued concealed carry permits to private citizens, incidents of gun violence in America collapsed. 


Between 1993 and 2011, nonfatal gun crimes plummeted 69%; from 1.5 million to 467,300. Gun-related murders dropped 40%; from 18,253 to 11,101. Gun-related murders for black Americans plummeted by 51%.
The report also shows that the media-created hysteria over school shootings is wildly misleading. Between ’93 and ’11, the murder rate in schools dropped by almost a third; from 29 to 20. 
Background checks have also been exposed as another bogus narrative the media’s crafted out of thin air. This report proves beyond any doubt that closing the so-called gun show loophole will accomplish next to nothing.  Less than one-percent of state prisoners caught with a gun purchased it at a gun show.  Moreover, who knows how many of those criminals might have passed or did pass a background check. 

So-called assault weapons are also not a problem, Only “2% of state inmates and 3% of federal inmates were armed with a military-style semiautomatic or fully automatic firearm.” 
What this study clearly shows is that Obama, Democrats, and the media don’t give a damn about stopping gun violence. If they did, they would be focused on everything but the one and two-percent problems. 
What we have here is a yet-another culture war; nothing more nothing less — and one aimed at the type of law-abiding citizens who attend gun shows and enjoy these so-called assault weapons. In other words, Red State conservatives. 
What is especially crucial to keep in mind is that 2011 is not some kind of outlier. If you study the original report, you will see that these decreases are all part of an 18-year trend, not an outlier year or two. 
This report is extremely good news is you are the kind of person who gives a damn about human life. 

But if you are cynical, power-hungry Democrats more uncomfortable with the idea of human freedom than you are pleased with a decrease in human life, this report is bad news. Furthermore, if you are a dishonest member of the media who believes that delivering political wins to Democrats is more important than human life, this report is also bad news. 
There is just no question that an armed American populace is a safer American populace. This study also proves that smart policing and a willingness to award serious jail time to violent offenders (two areas  our criminal justice system have focused on over the last two decades) does a helluva lot more to decrease the rate of gun violence than purely symbolic gun-grabbing laws. 
Thanks to this study we also know for a fact now that the Newtown massacre is being exploited by the media only to demonize Obama’s political enemies.

As an “assault weapons” ban seems less likely to even make it to a floor vote, President Obama and Democrat lawmakers are increasingly looking to universal background checks as the piece of legislation they can push through the House and Senate.
Here’s the problem: Universal background checks are the most insidious of all the gun control measures pushed heretofore. They will rob of us of more freedom than an “assault weapons” ban and a “high capacity” magazine ban combined, all in the name of preventing another Sandy Hook shooting. Yet they will actually do nothing to prevent such a shooting. Nothing at all. 


As David Kopel so ably put it in his Jan. 30 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, universal background checks necessitate a gun registry if they are to be enforceable. 

Put simply, this means that once a universal background state statute is in place, the government will require you to register every gun you own–shotguns, rifles, and handguns–so that they can be sure you do not sell a gun privately. 
Which brings us to our second point: universal background checks will end private sales, period. No more sales to neighbors, no more sales between a father and his son or a mother and her daughter. No more sales between friends. 
Once guns are registered, and private sales have been ended, the door will be opened for taxes allocated per number of guns owned, forced liability insurance payable based on number of guns owned, and for outright gun confiscation. 
The NRA has warned about the confiscation that usually follows registration, historically speaking, and the Democrats themselves are already promoting per-gun taxes and liability insurance. 
The bottom line: Universal background checks represent the crest of the hill atop the slippery slope. We must contact our Reps. and Sens. and demand that they say no to this insidious gun control measure.
It has nothing to with Sandy Hook Elementary, but everything to do with helping Democrats realize their dreams of crushing the 2nd Amendment.

Barack Obama, in an attempt to appear sympathetic to gun owners’ concerns as he pursues a gun-banning agenda in the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting, recently bragged that he goes skeet shooting at Camp David “all the time.” 
Responding to the blowback from skeptics who doubted Obama was telling the unvarnished truth (Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) challenged Obama to a skeet shooting contest), the White House not only released a photo of Obama shooting skeet, but White House press secretary Jay Carney also tried to water down Obama’s statement. 


Carney claimed Obama had “never pretended to or suggested that he had grown up as a hunter or engaging in sports activities with weapons.” According to the White House spokesman, “[Obama] simply said that he had, and this is the truth, that he had enjoyed shooting at Camp David. That’s a fact.” 

He went on to explain why the photo had been released while continuing to assert that Obama’s comments about shooting had been entirely unplanned:
The fact is the president was asked a question–did not volunteer, but was asked a question about whether or not he had ever shot a weapon. He answered with the truth, which is that he has enjoyed shooting competitively with friends at Camp David on multiple occasions… there were persistent questions about this, and we decided to release a photo of the president shooting at Camp David.
Obama told The New Republic that he was a skeet shooter, stating, “Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time. Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.” 
When asked whether Obama liked skeet or trap shooting better, Carney replied that Obama “has gotten better” at shooting.

Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart spent last week mocking the GOP for opposing Obamacare, ignoring legitimate concerns Republicans raised about both the health care legislation itself and its bungled launch.
Turns out the funny man did hear the GOP’s complaints.
Stewart interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday’s edition of The Daily Show, and he proceeded to both mock and shred her attempt to talk up Obamacare. One almost could feel sorry for an Obama administration official forced to defend the president’s signature train wreck.


Stewart kept his clown nose on for the start of their chat to highlight Obamacare’s deeply flawed web component.


We’re going to do a challenge,” Stewart said at the start of the interview. “I’m going to try and download every movie ever made, and you are going to try to sign up for Obamacare — and we’ll see which happens first.

Ouch. It was almost as if Jay Leno were sitting in Stewart’s chair for a moment.
Stewart wasn’t finished.

If I’m an individual that doesn’t want [Obamacare], it would be hard for me to look at a big business getting a waiver and not having to do it and me having to,” Stewart said. “Because I would feel like … like you are favoring big business because they lobbied you this year, but you’re not allowing individuals that same courtesy.”
Sebelius ducked the question and repeated her talking points. She did that a few more times on his follow-ups, prompting Stewart to say, “Am I a stupid man?

No, just a comedian who too often defends the president for partisan reasons and mocks the one cable news station–Fox News–which holds Obama’s feet to the fire on the latest headlines.
Sadly, many young Americans say they get their “news” from Stewart’s Daily Show. If true, Millennials got a dose of stone cold reality last night.

Dozens of times (that we know of) over his campaign to pass ObamaCare and to win re-election, President Obama lied to the American people about being able to keep the health insurance they like. But that lie has only been replaced with another: the lie that these cancellations will be limited to the 5% of Americans in the individual marketplace — when the truth is that these cancellations have only just begun.
Over at National Review, in a piece appropriately titled “Lying About Lies,” Michael Tanner reports that the same ObamaCare formula currently wiping out the individual market is about to rain hell on the employer-based market. The result will be that tens of millions of policies will be wiped out. 


This is a secret that is and always has been hiding in plain sight. 
As far back as last March, the media dutifully reported that the CBO reported that these cancellations were coming. So the media knew Obama was lying during the campaign but never said a word to spread this truth — oh, except to call Mitt Romney a liar for telling the truth. 
All these Democrats and members of the elite media now pretending they don’t or didn’t know… Please. 

Just as the media knew Obama was lying about people in the individual market being able to keep their insurance, the media also know that the same apocalypse looms for the employer-based market. It is not conservatives making this estimate, it is the Congressional Budget Office. [emphasis mine]
But the same conditions that are causing the cancellation of individual policies will eventually result in the cancellation of millions of employment-based policies as well. The only reason that hasn’t happened yet is that the employer mandate was postponed for a year, so employer plans don’t yet have to be ACA-compliant. But they will. Even the Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as 20 million workers will lose their current employer-sponsored plans. Combine that with those losing individual plans, and more than 30 million Americans cannot keep their current insurance.
ObamaCare’s latest trick is the “junk plan hustle.” Over and over, we keep hearing about how our White House overlords are doing Americans a favor by canceling the insurance they like and replacing it with “appropriate” health plans. But most of those plans are not junk plans. That is just another lie the White House is telling, and the media are letting them get away with it. 
The media know the White House is lying about this junk plan nonsense because the ObamaCare guidelines for what isn’t a “junk plan” only includes 2% of the policies currently in existence. 
According to HealthPocket, a health-insurance consulting firm, fewer than 2 percent of individual plans on offer today meet all ACA requirements. The most frequent reason for noncompliance was not a failure to cover hospitalization, as the administration has suggested, but not providing pediatric care, including vision and dental care for children. A worthwhile benefit, perhaps, but if you are childless, it’s hard to see how lacking such a benefit makes your policy subpar.

This is why other serious think tanks believe that before this nightmare is over, up to 93 million people could lose the insurance Obama promised they could keep. 
In order to buy time, Obama, Democrats, and the media are trying to con the American people into believing that the rolling ObamaCare catastrophe is compartmentalized to just 5% of the population. This conspiracy of silence is all about trying to contain through a lie of omission what is a legitimate reason for the public to panic as soon as they realize that … they are next. 
Obama is not sorry for lying. And the media are not sorry for covering up that lie for three years. 
The phase we are in now is nothing more than a 2.0 version of that exact same lie.

More and more Americans are beginning to realize that they were sold Obamacare on false pretenses. What they are getting in the mail isn’t what they ordered. 
Those responsible for saddling the country with this law, including the law’s chief salesman, President Obama, are scrambling to dodge the hammer of growing public resentment over the bill of goods that they have sold the American people. They are coming up with “fixes”, but I caution the buyer, beware. 


The president, along with members of his party who are facing elections soon, are busy campaigning for proposals they say do what these architects of the law promised in the first place. But folks should think carefully about relying on the same people who repeatedly promised one thing and delivered something far different. Consumers who liked their health care plans are being forced to give them up. People who were told they would pay less for health care will be paying more. Even fans of Obamacare are upset with an archaic, ready-fire-aim website that took years and millions of dollars to develop, but, to put it mildly, is failing miserably. Will Americans again put their faith in the leaders who said the law had to be passed before it was understood? They shouldn’t.

In 2010 on the Senate floor, I warned that rules published in the Federal Register would guarantee that people who liked their health care would lose it. I warned that health care costs would go up. I warned that employers would be forced to cut back worker hours and jobs. I did more than warn this would happen, I offered senators a chance to prevent these calamities. Proponents of Obamacare rejected and ridiculed my legislation. 
These same folks now, fighting for their political lives, are offering patches for their program and excuses for why it isn’t working. However, these folks are the same people who created the problems in the first place. They simply don’t want you to be able to choose the health insurance you want unless it’s health insurance they think you should have. They never did. Their plan was and is for policy makers in Washington to make what the experts believe are the best choices for you. 
The Washington Post reported recently that the president said his administration could not in good faith allow people with inferior insurance plans to keep them. That’s not what he said dozens of times before the law passed and it doesn’t sound like a person ready to fix a problem. This isn’t about a fumbled roll-out or a computer glitch. This law’s problems are inherent within it. The way to get our country out of this bad situation is with the earnest help of people who recognize the benefit of individuals being able to make their own choices. 
I’m a cosponsor of Senator Ron Johnson’s (R-Wis.) “If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep it Act”. The House passed a bill that would allow insurers to continue offering policies that don’t meet the expensive Obamacare mandates. So far we haven’t received much positive feedback from the president or majority in the Senate. Instead, the president announced another exception to a law that is already riddled with them, while the Senate majority proposes more federal mandates to “fix” the mandates they already have imposed on America. But as the Wall Street Journal has pointed out, there is a real difference between letting people keep their plans by unshackling them from federal rules and working with state frameworks versus forcing insurers to comply with more new requirements.
My dad used to say that if you keep on doing what you’ve been doing you are going to end up with what you’ve got. I’ve heard the Senate majority leader say the definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Unless people demand a new approach to health care — bona-fide inclusion of ideas from those who want a new approach — then we’re going to end up with what we have now: broken promises. We can do better.

I love a defunding fight as much as anyone, but I really want to see ObamaCare get a stake through its heart via widespread civil disobedience. If people refuse to sign up for ObamaCare, the program collapses. Nothing would be more satisfying than to see ObamaCare go the way of Prohibition (without the violence): as something else that pushed the wonderfully unruly American people too far. 
Contrary to what the media are telling you, the shutdown is not helping ObamaCare. Again and again, conservatives have been taunted by the media with the cry of, “If you hadn’t shut down the government, we’d be covering the ObamaCare launch debacle.”
Huh? 


The media are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle, and the coverage is the Obama administration’s worst nightmare because the shutdown has made it impossible for the White House to come up with a plan that would instruct the media in how to mitigate the damage. 
You see, if there was no shutdown, the media coverage of the launch would not be anywhere as negative for the White House as it is now, and here is why…
1. The White House Can’t Do Damage Control – Right now the media and the White House are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle in stark, one-dimensional terms: It is an expensive, disappointing, big government  debacle. Both are too overwhelmed to figure out a way to make it look less worse, which we all know would happen if they had the time and resources. 

2. The White House Can’t Gameplan a Plan B – While the administration obviously bungled the launch, when it comes to cleaning up a mess, this White House can usually move pretty fast. This time the White House can’t. They and the media are too bogged down in the shutdown. With some breathing room, the White House might have been able to set up a massive call center staffed with volunteers — something, anything to get people signed up. But even if they do, there is just no media space available to spread the word. 
3. White House Can’t Reassure Anyone – If the shutdown wasn’t gobbling up White House resources and media space, the administration could fan out its supporters to reassure those interested in signing up for ObamaCare that things are going to get better and that the problems are aggressively being worked on. Instead, all potential enrollees are seeing is error messages and all they are hearing is bad news. 
4. White House Can’t Spin the Sticker Shock – If anything brings down ObamaCare, it will be sticker shock. For four years, Obama, Democrats, and the media have been lying to the American people about the cost of ObamaCare. On top of adding $2.6 trillion to our deficit, individuals are facing shockingly high premiums and premium increases. This, after being lied to again and again about cheaper premiums. I’m not sure how the White House and its media would spin their way out of this, but heaven knows if they had the time and resources, they would find a way. After all, this is the same media that turned Obama’s Libya debacle into a campaign problem for Mitt Romney. 
—
The bottom line to ObamaCare’s success or failure is the number of enrollees paying into the system. In its first year, ObamaCare needs seven million enrollees, three million of them healthy and under age 35. 

If those numbers aren’t met, the program is a failure, the disapproval ratings increase, and the chances of ObamaCare slowly being killed increase. 
ObamaCare is the president’s baby, his only significant accomplishment, his only hope for a legacy — it is burning down before his eyes and he is helpless to do anything to shape the all-important first impression. 
Throughout Obama’s time in the spotlight, this is the only time I have ever witnessed anything he has bungled receiving only harshly negative coverage. It’s a bloodbath because the shutdown is taking up all the space that would normally be used for spin and lies.

On Tuesday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) indicated on the floor of the Senate he was “open to having a vote” on Senator David Vitter’s (R-LA) amendment to eliminate the Obamacare exemption for members of Congress, according to a Breitbart source on Capitol Hill. Today, however, he and his Democratic colleagues are singing a different tune, and the lyrics come straight from that timeless phrase used by hypocrites throughout American history: “What’s good for thee is not good for me.”
In early September, Reid defended the exemption to Obamacare granted to members of Congress and their staffers by the Office of Personnel and Management on August 7. As Heritage’s The Foundry pointed out, “there is no statutory authority, either in Obamacare or in Title V of the U.S Code, for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to make government insurance contributions on behalf of federal employees to any plan other than an FEHBP plan.”
But when Vitter introduced his No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment on September 12, Reid was forced to make a decision on whether it should be brought to a vote. As Majority Leader of the Senate, Reid exercises power by determining what bills will come to a vote in committees and before the full Senate. 


Reid has indicated from the outset that he opposes Vitter’s amendment, but he has attempted to maintain the public fiction that the amendment would receive the same treatment as any amendment proposed by any member of the Senate.

Despite significant evidence to the contrary, Reid continues to insist that the Congressional exemption authorized by the Office of Personnel Management is contained within the law. But on Tuesday, Vitter called the Congressional Obamacare exemption “flat out against the law,” and that exposure of Reid’s blatant hypocrisy may have been too much for the Majority Leader to take.
When Senate Democrats subsequently prevented Vitter’s amendment from coming to a vote, Vitter took to the floor of the Senate and delivered a statement that called Reid out on his hypocrisy.  “After freaking out last Thursday with threats and bribery, this week Harry Reid said he’s fine with an up-or-down vote on my No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment. I guess that was just a weak attempt at disguising his fear about losing his special exemption,” he said.
According to a statement issued by his office on Thursday, “Vitter’s amendment would reverse and clarify the decision by the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) on Obamacare. The legislation will require that all Members of Congress, the President, Vice President, and all political appointees in the Administration must purchase their health insurance on the Obamacare Exchange without the help of taxpayer-funded subsidies. Congressional staff would be prohibited from receiving any contribution greater than what they would receive if they were not employed by a congressional office.”
Tea party stalwart Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) are co-sponsors of the Vitter amendment, along with Senators Mike Enzi (R-WY), Dean Heller (R-V), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Jim Inhofe (R-OK).

The Obama administration decided that Obamacare Navigators, tasked with helping Americans enroll in a health insurance plan, would not undergo mandatory background checks. Now, in the ten weeks since the launch of Healthcare.gov, the ill-trained Navigators have put Americans’ sensitive health and tax information at risk. 
Breitbart News has obtained a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report on the Obamacare Navigators that will be released Monday. It has found that Obamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and, in some cases, actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further, there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.


Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a Congressional hearing that it was “possible” for convicted felons to become Navigators. The report, titled Risks of Fraud and Misinformation with ObamaCare Outreach Campaign: How Navigator and Assister Program Mismanagement Endangers Consumers, concludes that is only one of many worries Americans should have about Navigators. 
The Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), and HHS actually learned that “poorly-trained Navigators gave consumers incorrect information about the health care exchanges, violated HHS rules and procedures, and even encouraged applicants to commit tax fraud in some instances.” Moreover, this was learned from various news reports due to the complete lack of any internal oversight.
On November 21, the Obama administration briefed the Committee. Those in attendance included Gary Cohen, the Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and Mandy Cohen, Director of the Consumer Support Group at CCIIO.

The Committee report concluded that “documents call into question the effectiveness of the Navigator program and the Obama administration’s ability to safeguard consumer information.” HHS’s mismanagement of the Navigator and Assister programs “induces fraudulent behavior and poses real threats to the safety of consumers’ personally identifiable information, such as one’s social security number, yearly income, and other sensitive tax information,” the report found.
The report also discovered that Obamacare Navigators have “encouraged consumers to commit tax fraud by underreporting income in order to qualify for ObamaCare’s health insurance subsidies.” Some have “assisted applicants before completing their 5 to 20 hour online training course, and others took custody of paper applications and mailed them for the applicant, violating the rule that applicants must mail in the application themselves.” 
For instance, the Committee found:

Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance application so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies. Navigators were also recorded advising an applicant to lie about her smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium. It was later discovered that two of the so-called Navigators involved in the incident were assisting consumers with their applications even though they had not completed their training and certification requirements. 
One self-identified Navigator gave a television interview in which she told viewers blatantly incorrect information–that applicants’ credit scores could impact their eligibility for certain plans. It later came to light that the woman was not a certified Navigator but rather a volunteer with a Navigator organization. 
Mountain Project, Inc., a Navigator organization in North Carolina, has been collecting and mailing paper applications on behalf of applicants, in violation of Navigator rules and procedures.

The report found that HHS officials responsible for the Navigator program did not learn of the aforementioned incidents from internal oversight procedures, but rather from news reports. 
Yet the Obama administration still does not plan to implement a “secret shopper” program to monitor Navigators. HHS officials have put together “webinars” for Navigators, but they are voluntary and do not cover specific details.

The report also found that because the Obama administration did not warn Navigators that there could be problems with the HealthCare.Gov website, “Navigators were essentially useless” when the website crashed and had problems. To make matters worse, notes from an October 11, 2013 meeting state that the Navigators were encouraging potential enrollees to use paper applications they knew may not bring applicants quicker results “to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help.”
The Committee found that this “push towards the use of paper applications further increases security risks, since health insurance exchange applications contain personally identifiable information such as the applicant’s full name, social security number, the names and social security numbers of everyone in the applicant’s household, and income for every member of the household.”
The report also concluded that Navigators were also unprepared to handle situations in which consumers mentioned unreported income because the Obama administration did not even anticipate such situations. Gary Cohen, the director of the agency overseeing the Navigators, previously stated, “this could be one of the areas where it is a little beyond the ability of your average Navigator,” when asked whether Navigators knew how to deal with Americans who may be engaging in tax fraud or intending to under-report income. 
Though Cohen “admitted there is a need for better training on the issue through the ongoing education process” and did not rule out “requiring Navigators to report tax fraud in the future,” the Obama administration “has not taken the necessary steps to prevent this type of tax fraud.” The report found that Navigators have not even been provided with a document on how to handle potential tax fraud issues that may arise. 
Navigators, the report also found, “lack guidance about how to comply with the Voting Rights Act, which requires that federal government applications provide the opportunity for applicants to indicate their interest in registering to vote.”
And though Cohen told the Committee staff that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “[keep] a list of certified Navigators, which, as of mid-November, numbered 2,500 individuals,” the list is private, which means Americans do not have a way to know if their Navigators are actually even certified. That also allows Navigator organizations to “misrepresent the qualifications of an individual who is associated with that organization but is not a certified Navigator,” the committee found.

Half of the people who have signed up for Obamacare in 17 states have not activated their health insurance plans by making their first premium payment, a trend that threatens to further embarrass and frustrate President Barack Obama and the highly unpopular Obamacare program. 
Health insurance plans purchased through Obamacare only kick in once a customer pays their first month’s premium. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that “only about half of enrollees billed for plans offered by more than 100 insurers in 17 states had paid their first month’s premium,” according to Benaissance chief strategy officer Mark Waterstraat, whose firm serves as a third-party billing company for insurers. Another insurer, Scott & White Health Plan, told the Journal that only 35% of its enrollees have paid for the plans they applied for. 
The Obama administration remains far behind its 7 million enrollment target but has recently celebrated what it calls two million Obamacare “enrollments.” Yet that figure merely reflects the number of applications submitted, not the number of paying customers who have turned on their plans by actually paying for coverage. Whether insurers in the other 33 states are experiencing nonpayment rates in the 35% to 50% range is presently unknown. If those rates extended nationally, they would mean the Obama administration’s claim that it has enrolled two million people in Obamacare would plunge to just 700,000 to one million. 


Even progressive groups like the left-leaning journalism group ProPublica say the emergence of an Obamacare nonpayment gap raises “the prospect that actual enrollment will be far lower than the figures HHS [Health and Human Services] is releasing.” 

Part of the problem may be the costs of the plans offered through Obamacare. A recent USA Today analysis found that over half of all counties in the 34 states on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange “lack even a bronze plan that’s affordable by the government’s own definition.”
“There is also a lot of worrying going on over people making payments,” industry consultant Robert Laszewski told ProPublica. 
Experts say that first-time insurance buyers may not fully understand the duties and responsibilities that come with ownership. A recent study published in the Journal of Health Economics found that only 14% of individuals who have health coverage could correctly answer all four of four basic questions about health insurance, including understanding what a “deductible” and “copay” mean. If comprehension levels are that low for those who already have insurance, analysts worry what that might mean for first-time insurance purchasers, especially for a program as complex as Obamacare.
Persistence of the Obamacare nonpayment trend would pose serious challenges for the Obama administration’s ability to hit its goal of seven million paying customers by the end of March. 
According to the latest CNN poll, support for Obamacare is now at a record low 35%. 
Obamacare will cost U.S. taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years.

President Barack Obama has illegally suspended the single most important provision of Obamacare, the infamous Individual Mandate, for some Americans. 
On Dec. 19, the president declared a change to the Individual Mandate, a provision that led to the first lawsuit in American history where a majority of the states in this nation (26 out of 50) sued the federal government over the constitutionality of a federal law, resulting in a historic Supreme Court decision that conservative lawyers and scholars roundly condemn insofar as it upheld the Individual Mandate as a massive tax by a 5-4 vote.
The Obama administration’s disastrous rollout of Obamacare has been a textbook illustration of the manifest incompetence of government to run the American healthcare system, from the humiliating website difficulties to the eye-popping costs of skyrocketing monthly insurance premiums and deductibles. The White House explains that it would be unfair under these circumstances to penalize Americans who attempt to obtain insurance through the Obamacare exchanges but are unable to do so.


Therefore the president has declared a “hardship exemption” for Americans encountering those difficulties. There will be a grace period for at least part of 2014. The White House has not specified a firm date of when this exemption will definitely end, or how they will be able to distinguish with certainty people who earnestly tried to obtain insurance versus those who are gaming the system.
But this exemption, like those that came before it, is illegal. The language of ACA’s Section 1501 is to impose a truly-mandatory Individual Mandate. Conservatives insist that even if all the provisions in the ACA are applied, the system will not work financially. But even liberals admit that if the Individual Mandate is not in force, then you do not bring in enough revenue from young, healthy adults to pay for the staggering cost of the massive new entitlements and programs that the ACA creates. Without the Individual Mandate, you get a “death spiral” of growing deficits that will render health insurance companies insolvent and deprive healthcare providers of payment for their life-saving treatments.

In Section 1513 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Employer Mandate (the requirement for companies employing 50+ people) specifies that this requirement for employers to offer insurance goes into effect Jan. 1, 2014. When Obama announced over the summer that he was suspending that requirement until 2015, he said he has the power to “tweak” a law so long as that tweaking “doesn’t go to the essence of the law.”

That’s dead wrong under the U.S. Constitution. Ironically, it would not apply here anyway, since some of these provisions like the Individual Mandate and the Employer Mandate are two of the most important provisions of the entire ACA and are essential to the ACA’s core operations. However, even if they were insignificant provisions, the Constitution does not permit a president to change a single semicolon of a federal law by himself. 
Under Article I of the Constitution, every law must either pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the president, or if the president vetoes the bill instead of signing it, then it must pass the House and Senate a second time, by a two-thirds super-majority vote in each chamber. That is the only process by which federal law can be made. Everything else is illegal. 
Many laws authorize top administrative officials to develop regulations carrying the force of law to implement some provision in the law. Other laws contain provisions that empower executive-branch officials to suspend or modify certain legal requirements, usually for a fixed period of time and only after certain conditions are met, such as completing a study that discovers facts that are relevant to the law’s operations. This power is delegated by the terms of the statute, where the federal law-making body–Congress–votes to include such an option in a law. 
That is not the case with these parts of Obamacare. The changes in the law that President Obama has announced, such as telling insurers in Nov. 2013 that they could continue offering canceled policies, have been unilateral changes to mandatory terms in the federal law passed by Congress. These are provisions where Congress did not allow Obama or any of his Cabinet secretaries any discretion or options. They are requirements that bind the government and the private sector.
So not only is Obamacare bad policy, but now another aspect of this program is illegal.

On Thursday, President Barack Obama said of his health care law: “Despite all the evidence that the law is working the way it’s supposed to,” there are critics out there. He says they must be doing it for purely political reasons. That sound you hear is the fire alarm going off in the White House. 
Shortly after the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) was signed into law on Mar. 23, 2010, the administration announced that the massive Title VIII of the law–the CLASS Act that would set up a national system of elderly case–would never be implemented, because the Obama administration cannot find any way either to implement the system or to pay for it. 


Over the past three years, the Obama administration has been issuing “waivers” for various ACA requirements regarding how much companies must pay out in health care benefits to employees, because many low-wage employers like McDonald’s couldn’t meet those requirements, and would have to cancel all health care benefits for those employees. (It should also be noted that the “waivers” are unlawful, because the ACA imposes that requirement on employers and does not allow the government to waive them.) 
A year ago, the Supreme Court struck down as a violation of the Tenth Amendment the mandatory expansion of Medicaid in all 50 states, making it entirely optional. The White House started scrambling when half the states in the nation refused to go along with this unaffordable and unmanageable expansion of government health care. 
Also a year ago, the IRS issued a new regulation saying that the massive subsidies that taxpayers would have to pay on health care policies purchased from state-run government exchanges in all 50 states would also apply to policies purchased on an exchange run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, because it became clear that many states would not participate in that government-run model either. (In fact, 34 states have refused to set up exchanges, and the IRS’s regulation is being challenged in court as illegal.) 

Then two weeks ago, the Treasury Department announced that for the first year it is in effect (2014), the IRS would not enforce the Employer Mandate requiring large employers to provide healthcare to employees. The system was ready to implode and deprive millions of Americans of both health care and work hours (forcing many employers to cut hours to 29/week for full-time employees), and the IRS could not develop an effective reporting or enforcement system. (Like the “waivers” above, this too is illegal.) 
And just this week, HHS announced that the massive state exchange system may be put off a year as well. It was supposed to start on Oct. 1, 2013, and is having so many severe problems that it too cannot start when the ACA says it must. 
Yet with all that, Obama says that the ACA is working great, and those who deny it must have sinister political motives. (Set aside the fact that now some of the ACA’s biggest critics are major unions like AFL-CIO and the Teamsters, normally Obama’s biggest allies and without whose zealous support the ACA would never have passed Congress.)
It’s like George Orwell’s 1984. The government literally could say 2+2=5, and no one would call them on it. If a conservative leader said such things, the media would call for his head. But when a liberal does it, they ignore it. (Or if you’re MSNBC, you applaud his “courage” and might offer him a TV show to anchor.)
If any private citizen said such things, we’d have a one-word label for him: “liar.” But most people in this country rightly show great respect for the institution of the presidency that we don’t use such terms (unless they’re committed liberals and the president happens to be a conservative Republican–in which case you can call him anything you want). Instead, we say he’s “got his facts wrong” or he’s using “fuzzy math,” or some other such softer statement. 
So using such a word would be disrespectful, and we won’t do it here. But if the smoke detectors go off at the White House, there’s no need to call the fire department. The smoke is because President Obama’s pants are on fire.

A veteran Washington adviser who has worked for four Presidents on both sides of the political aisle said that the stunning Government Accountability Report  that found President Barack Obama has not had a one-on-one meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since the passage of Obamacare over three years ago is an indictment of the entire White House operation and shows that the Obama administration has bordered on “malfeasance.” 
“I have no doubt the White House is right, that Secretary Sebelius was in several group meetings with the president about health care,” Gergen caveated, “but the whole point is, there was nobody in charge in the administration.”



Appearing on CNN’s Newsroom program Saturday night was David Gergen, a known Washington “fixer.” Some veteran Washington observers have even suggested that Obama should bring Gergen in to help manage the Obamacare rollout crisis. He was asked by CNN Anchor Deborah Feyerick about the GAI report. 
Feyerick cited a report from “an outfit called the Government Accountability Institute [that] finds the president and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius held just a single one-on-one meeting after Obamacare was signed into law over three years ago.” 

“I don’t think this is simply sloppiness on the part of the White House,” Gergen said. “What seems to me is there’s a case of near malfeasance here.”
Gergen, who has served as Director of Speechwriting for the Nixon White House, Director of Communications for both Presidents Ford and Reagan, and then as a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton, is intimately familiar with how the White House operates. In addition, he normally takes a “neutral” position on most matters and often gives those in power the benefit of doubt.
But Gergen emphasized that the GAI report concerning the lack of meetings between Sebelius and Obama raises troubling issues about the conduct of affairs in the Obama White House.
Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer unveiled the report on Wednesday on Fox News’s Hannity and Breitbart News. 
As Breitbart News has reported, Schweizer said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.

“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity.
Feyerick, the CNN host, added that the White House had attacked the report, “Jay Carney [is] saying that the report’s misleading and based on a ridiculously false premise, those are his words David Gergen, what do you think about this?”
Gergen responded by saying the GAI report was a big deal and should not be dismissed. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly” but their meetings were not recored on the visitors logs. Schweizer had previously noted that GAI also looked at White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” And he noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meeting off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.

Gergen faulted the White House for this lack of contact and condemned the whole White House operation. 
“The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one, I think, frankly, is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation,” he said. 
Gergen said that “at the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.” Gergen referenced Schweizer’s Politico article in which he mentioned that, “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” Schweizer also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors, and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”
Feyerick, the CNN host, added, that if health care reform “was so important to the president, you would think that there was a lot more one-on-one interaction especially on something that’s so critical to him and his policy.” Princeton Professor Julian Zelizer, who was also on the panel, did not respond directly to the details of the GAI report, only to say that “we have to be careful because as the White House said, that [report] does come from a conservative organization.”  
The Government Accountability Institute, though, is a nonpartisan organization and its mission is to “investigate and expose crony capitalism, misuse of taxpayer monies and other governmental corruption or malfeasance.” GAI, headed by Schweizer, has written several reports in recent years and has been criticized by both the Obama White House and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).

On Wednesday, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said it was “inexcusable” and “unpardonable” that President Barack Obama did not meet one-on-one with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since Obamacare passed over three years ago. 
On Fox News’s Hannity, host Sean Hannity referenced the shocking Government Accountability Institute report when asking Lee whether he knew if Sebelius has met with Obama in one-on-one meetings. 
“Not to my knowledge,” Lee answered, before saying, “this is inexcusable” and “absolutely unpardonable.” 


Lee, who was the architect of the strategy to defund Obamacare and one of the fiercest opponents of the healthcare overhaul, continued by saying “there was this little oversight in the launching of this significant an enterprise” and Obamacare is “so much more than about the website.” Lee said ultimately Obamacare is about the “fundamental unfairness and unworkability of the law.”
At a House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Sebelius was flustered when asked to give specific evidence that she and Obama have met “regularly.” Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, exclusively told Breitbart News that he will ask Sebelius for specific dates of those alleged meetings. 
The White House and the Health and Human Services Department have claimed Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly,” but have not provided any firm dates except for an alleged meeting last Thursday, which was a day after the GAI report was released. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said there are many meetings between Obama and cabinet secretaries that are not on the public record. 

When Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer broke the GAI report on Fox News’s Hannity last Wednesday, though, he mentioned that GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.
The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”
According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”
Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.
“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday.

Just a week before young adults return home for the end of year holidays, Organizing for America is debuting a video imploring parents to interrupt their time with their children to promote the benefits of Obamacare in a last-ditch attempt to ease millennial dissatisfaction with President Obama.
The video, debuting on BarackObama.com and promoted through various social media, arrives on the eve of a joint President and First Lady event designed to target mothers of uninsured millennials as they arrive home for their holidays. 
In the clip, a mother and father call their son, presumably about to drive home for Christmas dinner, and warn him that they have something “very important” to talk to him about. The son spends the entire drive home fretting about the worst case scenario (“Your father and I are moving in with you!”) and inexplicably expecting arbitrary pop culture references (“I am the one who knocks!“). The “reveal” that the parents want to talk about health insurance is predictable, as is the fact that the son is, above all, relieved. “That’s it?” he asks.




The ad, titled “Get Ready To Have The Talk,” plays like an ’80s anti-drug PSA, urging parents to use the holidays as a stage for an intervention to stop something unhealthy in their children’s lives. The fact that it happens at the dinner itself (though the accompanying Twitter graphic shows the actor playing the son mid-hot chocolate later in the night) instructs parents to directly address the Obama administration’s agenda in the middle of what, for many celebrating the night, is a religious celebration devoid of political meaning.
The targeted advertising appears to be a last-minute attempt to reverse devastating trends in the Affordable Care Act’s and the President’s nosedive in the public opinion polls as the year wanes and HealthCare.gov continues to fail millions. A Harvard Institute of Politics poll released this month shows 57% of young Americans ages 18-29 disapprove of the ACA and 52% would support removing the President from office. The targeting of parents also appears to be a direct reaction to dwindling support for Obamacare among white women.
Apparently, the White House hopes changing mothers’ minds will cause a trickle down effect that reaches the young uninsured. Or, at least, that is what Democrats should hope the White House is doing, because the video demonstrates a prodigious lack of understanding of youth culture today. 
It makes sense. Young people today were not the young people of five years ago–the young people who truly believed in President Obama–and to the White House, it seems that all these new young people do is quote Breaking Bad at each other in their plaid onesies. It’s a Hail Mary pass from an administration that was previously unstoppable in reaching out to young Americans, one perhaps that is their only move after HealthCare.gov failed so extraordinarily that Ezra Klein wondered aloud why someone in the administration hasn’t been fired over it. 
We’ll have to wait until next week to see just how many parents take this advice, but the outlook doesn’t seem to be so bright if this is the last PR resort.

Before the dust settled on the news that the Obama Administration was delaying the intrusive employer mandate until 2015, a new 606-page regulation was issued on Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services stating it would now rely on self-reported income and employment verification in the state-run exchanges under ObamaCare. In other words, a welcome mat for fraud.
This is another startling development which is becoming part of a larger theme as ObamaCare is rolled out to the public. It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is unworkable. For those like myself who opposed it from the start, we saw the writing on the wall early on as President Obama’s signature health care legislation was rammed through the halls of Congress. If only then-Speaker Pelosi had insisted that her party read the legislation before passing it, maybe some of this would have come to light earlier on. While the eventual passage of the legislation was certain under Democrat control of Congress, maybe some Democrats now sounding the alarm about the devastating impact of the legislation would have done so sooner if they had read it while it was still a bill, not only after it became law.


As of now, ObamaCare is $1 trillion over budget; I say “as of now” because it’s almost certain that with the elimination of the anti-fraud measures the cost will further skyrocket, and there are examples to back up this theory.

In January, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services began an effort to remove ineligible people from the state’s Medicaid rolls. The initial audit concluded that of the first 20,500 recipients screened, it was recommended 13,709 be removed from eligibility. The Chicago Tribune reports that “since 2000, Illinois Medicaid rolls have doubled, from fewer than 1.4 million people to nearly 2.8 million, or more than 1 in 5 Illinoisans.” In part because of the rising Medicaid rolls, the state’s backlog of unpaid bills is expected to grow to $21 billion by fiscal year 2018.
States are fascinating laboratories of democracy that can provide brilliant blueprints for other states and the federal government to follow. However, states can also serve as flashing red lights when plans go wrong. Illinois is a great example of how a lack of anti-fraud measures can drain a state’s coffers. As President Obama’s home state, he would be wise to take notice.
President Reagan famously said “trust but verify.” In light of the notion that the U.S. health care system makes up one-eighth of the economy, it’s my hope that this administration will grasp hold of this sensible advice.

As the first hearings on the failed implementation of Obamacare begin Thursday, with the testimony of the healthcare.gov contractors before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Democrats have already developed their strategy for blunting Republican criticism. They will a) assert that repairs are being made; b) attack critics for “politicizing” the problems; and c) demand the GOP join efforts to support the law.
Along the way, Democrats will cling mightily to the straw man upon which they relied throughout 2009-2010 during the debate over the law: namely, that if you oppose Obamacare you are opposed to providing health care to the working poor, to those with pre-existing conditions, to the temporarily unemployed. They will cover the foreseeable failure of a policy that has already hurt millions with the glory of noble intentions.


Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, previewed the Democrats’ strategy on Oct. 22, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN’s The Situation Room. Cummings made clear that his party will try to deflect criticism of Obamacare by casting it as the latest example of alleged Republican overreach on Obama administration scandals:

BLITZER: I know you must be very frustrated. Were you surprised to learn that apparently no one was really in charge of this Web site rollout, even though they had a couple years to plan for it? 
CUMMINGS: Yes, a bit surprised. But Wolf, what we’ve got to concentrate now on is making sure that the Web site works. And I’m hoping that Republicans and Democrats will see this not as a partisan issue, but as one that we have to make work for all the American people. Failure is just not an option….
Keep in mind, Republicans have spent the last few years trying to repeal it over 45 times, trying to defund it, trying to delay it. And so I have not seen a lot of effort on their part to make the law better but simply to destroy it. So that’s the kind of issue that I’m working with, Wolf, on my committee. I’ve got to make sure that we all work together to make sure that the law works for millions upon millions of Americans who need health care….
I think what I’m seeing now is the same play and the same scene all over again. We saw the chairman make strong allegations which were inaccurate with regard to Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. And only to find out that those allegations were simply not accurate and had no basis of fact. So it makes my job a little tougher. 

Note that the country has yet to learn the truth of what happened in Benghazi, Fast and Furious, and the IRS scandal. In every case, Cummings has tried to prevent oversight, not to facilitate it. He acknowledges some failures in the administration, and expresses some minimal outrage, but then tries to cast Republicans as witch-hunters rather than trying to hold the executive accountable. Expect more of the same on Obamacare.

Apparently the media is growing tired of the White House selectively releasing ObamaCare data that gets to the heart of nothing but makes the program look like it is much more popular than it likely is. For instance, today the White House informed the media that between Sunday and Friday, Healthcare.gov enjoyed 3.7 million visits. 
We have also been told  that the site’s error rate was .077 percent, the response time averaged under a second, and a whopping (and improbable) 93% of consumers did come back later after they were asked to due to the site being too busy. 


As The Hill points out, though, that data is all hollow happy talk that tells us nothing about what really matters. What the White House refuses to disclose, or claims it doesn’t yet have the data to disclose, just happens to be the information that will tell us if ObamaCare is or is not working:
The Obama administration is selectively releasing data and metrics on ObamaCare to bolster its case that the rollout is going better in the month of December.
Tidbits of information from federal health officials — especially figures that show improvements at HealthCare.gov — have become a key tool in the effort to “reboot” the law in the eyes of the public.

But the limited nature of the releases has created conflict with the media and put the spotlight on outstanding areas of concern for the rollout, such as the enrollment site’s back end.
The White House has blithely changed the definition of the world “enrollee” to someone who has not yet enrolled, but has only selected an insurance plan and placed it into a shopping cart. Studies show that the abandonment rate for shopping carts is 67%. 
Up until now, though, the media have breathlessly reported “enrollment” numbers spoon-fed to them by the White House without doing any of their own independent reporting to find out how many have actually enrolled. Maybe those days are coming to an end. 
The Hill points out the other vital metrics the White House has thus far not released:
Since late October, federal health officials have touted traffic to the site, error rates and page load times almost daily in an effort to illustrate positive changes.

Enrollment figures are only discussed monthly, and leaked sign-up numbers are not confirmed. Vital information for judging the growing risk pools, such as applicants’ ages, goes undiscussed.
The administration appears to have largely chosen data over anecdotes as the most powerful way to communicate site improvements to the media.
The metrics released are difficult to independently verify, but provide easy headlines and talking points for anxious supporters of the Affordable Care Act, including congressional Democrats.
Another area where the White House has dissembled rather than been forthcoming involves the number of meetings between Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama during the three years after the passage of ObamaCare. A Government Accountability Institute study finds only a single meeting between the two recorded on any White House calendar or log. Friday, Jay Carney would only say that the two met frequently, but provided no details. 
While we are sure to be hit with all kinds of selective data leaks before the end of the year that are only meant to make ObamaCare look successful, The Hill reports that a number that will not be released until the end of the year is a breakdown of those who are truly enrolled — in other words, those who have actually paid for a premium.
The fact that the White House always has positive data that sounds good but means nothing, but never the data that matters, has raised the suspicions of the American people from the beginning. It is good to know now, that after two-plus months of this Administration Hustle, the media has apparently had enough.

During Thursday’s congressional hearing, Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) tore into the ObamaCare contractors for a hidden line of source code that secretly surrenders the ObamaCare applicant’s right to privacy. It was yet another damning revelation about the snoopiest White House ever, and by Friday, CNN’s Carol Costello was in full attack mode using misinformation to push back for the Administration.  
Costello invited Barton on her Friday morning show, and after Barton reiterated his concern over ObamaCare’s secret and deceptive disclaimer, Costello dug in:


Well, I’ve been wondering about that. The only health-related question the website asks of you is whether you smoke. It doesn’t ask any other question. So what specifically are you talking about? What specific information would you share on this website that you wouldn’t normally share?

Before we get to Barton’s very specific answer, I have to interrupt to point out how stunningly ignorant Costello’s question is. First off, even if she was correct about the smoking question being the only health-related question, it is still a health-related question, and therefore a violation of HIPAA. Secondly, my understanding of HIPAA is that it not only protects your medical information, but also your personal information. And as someone who actually has gone through the ObamaCare application process, I can testify (and did here in detail) that the site asks a number of personal questions I “wouldn’t normally share.” 
Regardless, why is this secret disclaimer not a big deal to a supposed journalist? We are talking about the federal government slipping in a line of code that will sucker millions into surrendering their privacy rights altogether, not just what qualifies under HIPAA.
But Costello is stuck on her White House talking points that claim HIPAA only covers medical information and the smoking question is no big deal. 

Well, watch what happens next: Barton lists three more medical-related questions the ObamaCare website asks: your current insurance plan and its policy number, your mental and physical condition, and whether or not you are pregnant. 
And what is Costello’s response? Does she say, “Oh, I didn’t know that. If you are correct, that is a problem.” 

Nope. She just babbles on with her talking points as though she didn’t hear Barton answer her question with damning specifics:

Dozens of times (that we know of) over his campaign to pass ObamaCare and to win re-election, President Obama lied to the American people about being able to keep the health insurance they like. But that lie has only been replaced with another: the lie that these cancellations will be limited to the 5% of Americans in the individual marketplace — when the truth is that these cancellations have only just begun.
Over at National Review, in a piece appropriately titled “Lying About Lies,” Michael Tanner reports that the same ObamaCare formula currently wiping out the individual market is about to rain hell on the employer-based market. The result will be that tens of millions of policies will be wiped out. 


This is a secret that is and always has been hiding in plain sight. 
As far back as last March, the media dutifully reported that the CBO reported that these cancellations were coming. So the media knew Obama was lying during the campaign but never said a word to spread this truth — oh, except to call Mitt Romney a liar for telling the truth. 
All these Democrats and members of the elite media now pretending they don’t or didn’t know… Please. 

Just as the media knew Obama was lying about people in the individual market being able to keep their insurance, the media also know that the same apocalypse looms for the employer-based market. It is not conservatives making this estimate, it is the Congressional Budget Office. [emphasis mine]
But the same conditions that are causing the cancellation of individual policies will eventually result in the cancellation of millions of employment-based policies as well. The only reason that hasn’t happened yet is that the employer mandate was postponed for a year, so employer plans don’t yet have to be ACA-compliant. But they will. Even the Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as 20 million workers will lose their current employer-sponsored plans. Combine that with those losing individual plans, and more than 30 million Americans cannot keep their current insurance.
ObamaCare’s latest trick is the “junk plan hustle.” Over and over, we keep hearing about how our White House overlords are doing Americans a favor by canceling the insurance they like and replacing it with “appropriate” health plans. But most of those plans are not junk plans. That is just another lie the White House is telling, and the media are letting them get away with it. 
The media know the White House is lying about this junk plan nonsense because the ObamaCare guidelines for what isn’t a “junk plan” only includes 2% of the policies currently in existence. 
According to HealthPocket, a health-insurance consulting firm, fewer than 2 percent of individual plans on offer today meet all ACA requirements. The most frequent reason for noncompliance was not a failure to cover hospitalization, as the administration has suggested, but not providing pediatric care, including vision and dental care for children. A worthwhile benefit, perhaps, but if you are childless, it’s hard to see how lacking such a benefit makes your policy subpar.

This is why other serious think tanks believe that before this nightmare is over, up to 93 million people could lose the insurance Obama promised they could keep. 
In order to buy time, Obama, Democrats, and the media are trying to con the American people into believing that the rolling ObamaCare catastrophe is compartmentalized to just 5% of the population. This conspiracy of silence is all about trying to contain through a lie of omission what is a legitimate reason for the public to panic as soon as they realize that … they are next. 
Obama is not sorry for lying. And the media are not sorry for covering up that lie for three years. 
The phase we are in now is nothing more than a 2.0 version of that exact same lie.

The Obama administration decided that Obamacare Navigators, tasked with helping Americans enroll in a health insurance plan, would not undergo mandatory background checks. Now, in the ten weeks since the launch of Healthcare.gov, the ill-trained Navigators have put Americans’ sensitive health and tax information at risk. 
Breitbart News has obtained a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report on the Obamacare Navigators that will be released Monday. It has found that Obamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and, in some cases, actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further, there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.


Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a Congressional hearing that it was “possible” for convicted felons to become Navigators. The report, titled Risks of Fraud and Misinformation with ObamaCare Outreach Campaign: How Navigator and Assister Program Mismanagement Endangers Consumers, concludes that is only one of many worries Americans should have about Navigators. 
The Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), and HHS actually learned that “poorly-trained Navigators gave consumers incorrect information about the health care exchanges, violated HHS rules and procedures, and even encouraged applicants to commit tax fraud in some instances.” Moreover, this was learned from various news reports due to the complete lack of any internal oversight.
On November 21, the Obama administration briefed the Committee. Those in attendance included Gary Cohen, the Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and Mandy Cohen, Director of the Consumer Support Group at CCIIO.

The Committee report concluded that “documents call into question the effectiveness of the Navigator program and the Obama administration’s ability to safeguard consumer information.” HHS’s mismanagement of the Navigator and Assister programs “induces fraudulent behavior and poses real threats to the safety of consumers’ personally identifiable information, such as one’s social security number, yearly income, and other sensitive tax information,” the report found.
The report also discovered that Obamacare Navigators have “encouraged consumers to commit tax fraud by underreporting income in order to qualify for ObamaCare’s health insurance subsidies.” Some have “assisted applicants before completing their 5 to 20 hour online training course, and others took custody of paper applications and mailed them for the applicant, violating the rule that applicants must mail in the application themselves.” 
For instance, the Committee found:

Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance application so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies. Navigators were also recorded advising an applicant to lie about her smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium. It was later discovered that two of the so-called Navigators involved in the incident were assisting consumers with their applications even though they had not completed their training and certification requirements. 
One self-identified Navigator gave a television interview in which she told viewers blatantly incorrect information–that applicants’ credit scores could impact their eligibility for certain plans. It later came to light that the woman was not a certified Navigator but rather a volunteer with a Navigator organization. 
Mountain Project, Inc., a Navigator organization in North Carolina, has been collecting and mailing paper applications on behalf of applicants, in violation of Navigator rules and procedures.

The report found that HHS officials responsible for the Navigator program did not learn of the aforementioned incidents from internal oversight procedures, but rather from news reports. 
Yet the Obama administration still does not plan to implement a “secret shopper” program to monitor Navigators. HHS officials have put together “webinars” for Navigators, but they are voluntary and do not cover specific details.

The report also found that because the Obama administration did not warn Navigators that there could be problems with the HealthCare.Gov website, “Navigators were essentially useless” when the website crashed and had problems. To make matters worse, notes from an October 11, 2013 meeting state that the Navigators were encouraging potential enrollees to use paper applications they knew may not bring applicants quicker results “to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help.”
The Committee found that this “push towards the use of paper applications further increases security risks, since health insurance exchange applications contain personally identifiable information such as the applicant’s full name, social security number, the names and social security numbers of everyone in the applicant’s household, and income for every member of the household.”
The report also concluded that Navigators were also unprepared to handle situations in which consumers mentioned unreported income because the Obama administration did not even anticipate such situations. Gary Cohen, the director of the agency overseeing the Navigators, previously stated, “this could be one of the areas where it is a little beyond the ability of your average Navigator,” when asked whether Navigators knew how to deal with Americans who may be engaging in tax fraud or intending to under-report income. 
Though Cohen “admitted there is a need for better training on the issue through the ongoing education process” and did not rule out “requiring Navigators to report tax fraud in the future,” the Obama administration “has not taken the necessary steps to prevent this type of tax fraud.” The report found that Navigators have not even been provided with a document on how to handle potential tax fraud issues that may arise. 
Navigators, the report also found, “lack guidance about how to comply with the Voting Rights Act, which requires that federal government applications provide the opportunity for applicants to indicate their interest in registering to vote.”
And though Cohen told the Committee staff that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “[keep] a list of certified Navigators, which, as of mid-November, numbered 2,500 individuals,” the list is private, which means Americans do not have a way to know if their Navigators are actually even certified. That also allows Navigator organizations to “misrepresent the qualifications of an individual who is associated with that organization but is not a certified Navigator,” the committee found.

A veteran Washington adviser who has worked for four Presidents on both sides of the political aisle said that the stunning Government Accountability Report  that found President Barack Obama has not had a one-on-one meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since the passage of Obamacare over three years ago is an indictment of the entire White House operation and shows that the Obama administration has bordered on “malfeasance.” 
“I have no doubt the White House is right, that Secretary Sebelius was in several group meetings with the president about health care,” Gergen caveated, “but the whole point is, there was nobody in charge in the administration.”



Appearing on CNN’s Newsroom program Saturday night was David Gergen, a known Washington “fixer.” Some veteran Washington observers have even suggested that Obama should bring Gergen in to help manage the Obamacare rollout crisis. He was asked by CNN Anchor Deborah Feyerick about the GAI report. 
Feyerick cited a report from “an outfit called the Government Accountability Institute [that] finds the president and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius held just a single one-on-one meeting after Obamacare was signed into law over three years ago.” 

“I don’t think this is simply sloppiness on the part of the White House,” Gergen said. “What seems to me is there’s a case of near malfeasance here.”
Gergen, who has served as Director of Speechwriting for the Nixon White House, Director of Communications for both Presidents Ford and Reagan, and then as a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton, is intimately familiar with how the White House operates. In addition, he normally takes a “neutral” position on most matters and often gives those in power the benefit of doubt.
But Gergen emphasized that the GAI report concerning the lack of meetings between Sebelius and Obama raises troubling issues about the conduct of affairs in the Obama White House.
Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer unveiled the report on Wednesday on Fox News’s Hannity and Breitbart News. 
As Breitbart News has reported, Schweizer said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.

“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity.
Feyerick, the CNN host, added that the White House had attacked the report, “Jay Carney [is] saying that the report’s misleading and based on a ridiculously false premise, those are his words David Gergen, what do you think about this?”
Gergen responded by saying the GAI report was a big deal and should not be dismissed. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly” but their meetings were not recored on the visitors logs. Schweizer had previously noted that GAI also looked at White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” And he noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meeting off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.

Gergen faulted the White House for this lack of contact and condemned the whole White House operation. 
“The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one, I think, frankly, is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation,” he said. 
Gergen said that “at the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.” Gergen referenced Schweizer’s Politico article in which he mentioned that, “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” Schweizer also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors, and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”
Feyerick, the CNN host, added, that if health care reform “was so important to the president, you would think that there was a lot more one-on-one interaction especially on something that’s so critical to him and his policy.” Princeton Professor Julian Zelizer, who was also on the panel, did not respond directly to the details of the GAI report, only to say that “we have to be careful because as the White House said, that [report] does come from a conservative organization.”  
The Government Accountability Institute, though, is a nonpartisan organization and its mission is to “investigate and expose crony capitalism, misuse of taxpayer monies and other governmental corruption or malfeasance.” GAI, headed by Schweizer, has written several reports in recent years and has been criticized by both the Obama White House and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).

Last week, President Obama apologized for misleading the American public with his false claim that “if you like your insurance, you can keep it.” Without this assurance, it is unlikely ObamaCare would have passed. Obama was not the only politician fudging the truth. Most Democrat lawmakers repeated this claim on the campaign trail and in meetings with constituents. If Obama apologized, they should as well, as they are equally culpable. 
Breitbart News has compiled a list of the Top 10 Senate Democrats who should follow Obama’s lead and apologize to the American public. These particular lawmakers either went all-in on the false claim for partisan reasons or were in a position to know that millions of Americans would not be able to keep their health insurance. 
If a reader interprets this list as a guide for whom to call in Congress, so be it. 


10. SEN. MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA): “If you like the insurance that you have, you’ll be able to keep it.” (MSNBC’s Hardball, 12/16/09)
Mary Landrieu, like all Senate Democrats, provided the deciding vote on passing ObamaCare. After 3 years, it is hard to remember all the parliamentary tricks the Democrats used to pass a bill that almost none of them had read. Landrieu, who is up for reelection next year, lied on TV. She should apologize. 
9. SEN. KAY HAGAN (D-NC): “We need to support the private insurance industry so that people who have insurance they’re happy with can keep it while also providing a backstop option for people without access to affordable coverage.” (“Republicans Vent As Other Compromise Plans Get Aired,” National Journal’s Congress Daily, 6/18/09)

160,000 residents of North Carolina has lost their health coverage. Sen. Hagan has been most aggressive in trying to separate herself from ObamaCare. No wonder, since even a Democrat poll has found her now in a statistical tie with any of her possible Republican challengers. In September,  Hagan held a 12-17 point lead. She is up for reelection next year and should apologize. 
8. SEN. MARK BEGICH (D-AK): “If you got a doctor now, you got a medical professional you want, you get to keep that. If you have an insurance program or a health care policy you want of ideas, make sure you keep it. That you can keep who you want.”
Begich won his Senate seat in 2008, after DOJ staffers trumped up false charges against the sitting GOP Senator Ted Stevens. Begich is running for reelection in Alaska, without the Obama wave and without a mythical DOJ investigation. He should apologize. 
7. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): “We should begin with a basic principle: if you have coverage and you like it, you can keep it. If you have your doctor, and you like him or her, you should be able to keep them as well. We will not take that choice away from you.”
Sen. Bennet heads to DSCC, the party arm to elect Democrats to the US Senate. He will have an outsized role in races across the country. He said his position on ObamaCare was based on a “basic principle.” He should apologize.  

6. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): “Again, if you like what you have, you will be able to keep it. Let me say this again: If you like what you have, when our legislation is passed and signed by the President, you will be able to keep it.” (Sen. Murray, Congressional Record, S.6400, 6/10/09)
Let me say this again, as a senior member, and now Chair of the Budget Committee, Sen. Murray must have been in a position to know that these claims were false. She won her first race for Senate campaigning as a “soccer mom” in “tennis shoes.” Insert your own joke. 290,000 residents of Washington have lost their health insurance. She should apologize. 

5. SEN. TOM HARKIN (D-IA): “One of the things we put in the health care bill when we designed it was the protection for consumers to keep the plan they have if they like it; thus, the term ‘grandfathered plans.’ If you have a plan you like –existing policies–you can keep them. …we said, if you like a plan, you get to keep it, and you can grandfather it in.” (Sen. Harkin, Congressional Record, S.7675-6, 9/29/10)
Sen. Harkin has long been a slippery politician. As Chair of the Health Committee in the Senate, Harkin would have had more intimate knowledge of ObamaCare than most other lawmakers. His yowler here is he tries to claim that the “put in” language to ensure people could keep the plan they like. That is a sin of commission. Harkin, who is retiring, should absolutely apologize. 
4. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): “If you like your insurance, you keep it.” (U.S. Senate, Finance Committee, Bill Mark-Up, 9/24/09)

Schumer, who was in a position to know the inner-workings of the law seems to have lied. Asking him for an apology, though, is like asking Anthony Weiner to become modestly self-aware. Still, he should apologize. 
3. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): “This bill before us on the Senate floor makes it clear that if you have an insurance policy that you like, you can keep it. If you like the doctor that you’re currently doing business with, you can continue to use that doctor.” (Sen. Durbin, Teleconference, 12/4/09)
Durbin is the Number 2 Democrat in the Senate, amazingly. He seems preternaturally disposed to obscuring the truth. He actually said the legislation “makes it clear” that you can keep your insurance. He either can’t read legislation or he was intentionally misleading the public. In any event, he should apologize. 
2.SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV):”In fact, one of our core principles is that if you like the health care you have, you can keep it.” (Sen. Reid, Congressional Record, S.8642, 8/3/09)
Core principles, apparently, aren’t what they used to be. Sen. Reid emptied out the parliamentary cupboard to get ObamaCare passed. As Majority Leader, he had to have a keen understanding of what was in the bill and what the consequences would be. The White House, at the time, was aware of the fact that many Americans would lose their health insurance. Surely, Sen. Reid was privy to the same information. He should apologize.
And, the #1 Senate Democrat who should apologize… 
1. SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT): “That is why one of the central promises of health care reform has been and is: If you like what you have, you can keep it. That is critically important. If a person has a plan, and he or she likes it, he or she can keep it.” (Sen. Baucus, Congressional Record, S.7676, 9/29/10)
Sen. Baucus wrote most of the bill that became ObamaCare. He has been steeped in health care policy for decades. He was in a position to know, and had to know, that the “central promise” that people could keep their current health care coverage was a lie.
He should apologize, but unfortunately, he has chosen to retire rather than face the voters. I can only hope he does not go softly into the night.

1104	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/17/D-C-Insurance-Commissioner-Fired-Day-After-Criticizing-Obamacare-Fix	News	0	Healthcare	Democrat Scandals	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Washington, D.C.’s insurance commissioner was fired a day after he criticized President Barack Obama’s “administrative fix” for Obamacare. 
William P. White, the D.C. insurance commissioner, told the Washington Post that D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray’s top deputies said Gray “wants to go in a different direction” after White was one of the first commissioners to push back against Obama’s “fix.”
Though White said he was not told that he was specifically fired for his criticism, he “said the timing was hard to ignore.” He said that 24 hours after his criticism, he was ‘basically being told, ‘Thanks, but no thanks.'”


Obama, in a Thursday White House press conference, announced an administrative fix that would allow insurance companies to extend plans that they have cancelled for another year. After that press conference, White, according to the Post, said Obama’s “action today undercuts the purpose of the exchanges, including the District’s DC Health Link, by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate.”

He also said that he concurred with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’s assessment that Obama’s administrative fix “threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”
According to the Post, “White’s statement was removed from the department’s Web site sometime before Friday morning.”
White was “Gray’s commissioner for the D.C. Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking since February 2011.” D.C. officials said he was removed because any criticism of Obama’s administrative fix needed to be vetted more thoroughly, and White failed acknowledge the misstep of not sending his statement criticizing Obama higher up the chain of command before releasing it. 
After Obama falsely promised Americans that they could keep their insurance plans under Obamacare, he has scrambled after millions received cancellation notices, and he eventually announced on Thursday his administration will allow insurance companies to let those whose insurance plans were cancelled to re-apply and keep their plans for another year. 
Whether insurance companies will be allowed to do so, though, will ultimately rest with the insurance commissioners of the states. And others, like Washington state’s insurance commissioner, have already rejected Obama’s “administrative fix,” vowing to “stay the course” with Obamacare. 
As the Post noted, Obama’s plan “rattled the insurance industry, which had set prices for next year based on many of its products changing to comply with the health-care law,” because “allowing some plans to continue beyond Jan. 1 could also run afoul of provisions in laws passed by dozens of states and the District to implement” Obamacare.

1117	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/05/10/White-House-Benghazi-off-the-record	Opinion	1	International News	Democrat Scandals	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
In the White House’s latest efforts at transparency, the administration announced to reporters that it would brief reporters on the latest shocking developments about the Benghazi situation … behind closed doors. Politico reports that the meeting started at approximately 12:45 PM ET, and that it moved the normal press briefing to 1:45 PM ET. Jay Carney, White House press secretary, did not comment on whether the meeting took place.

Politico reports:

The off-the-record session was announced to reporters in the wake of an ABC News report showing that White House and State Dept. officials were involved in revising the now-discredited CIA talking points about the attack on Benghazi.

The administration routinely exerts pressure on reporters it feels are not kind enough in their coverage. Reporters like Cheryl Attkisson of CBS News have felt the hand of their bosses for “wading dangerously close to advocacy” with regard to Benghazi. No doubt this “off-the-record” meeting was designed to get all the president’s horses and all the president’s men to put the Benghazi humpty dumpty together again.
UPDATE: Reporters not invited to the off-the-record briefing are reportedly incredibly unhappy about it:


UPDATE II: Jake Tapper of CNN reports that the regularly scheduled press briefing has been delayed even further:

UPDATE III: Politico now reports that the meeting has been characterized as “deep background.” The existence of the meeting itself is considered “off-the-record.” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, “Deep background means that the info presented by the briefers can be used in reporting but the briefers can’t be quoted.” So expect a fair number of “White House sources” to appear in reportage for the next few days.
UPDATE IV: Jay Carney began his on-the-record press briefing by announcing that 14 news organizations were invited to the closed door briefing, but that it was not a substitute for the on-the-record briefing. He then announced that it was “erroneous” to describe the briefing as “off-the-record,” and instead suggested it was “deep background.”

On Friday, two prominent Republican backers of the Senate immigration bill hosted a conference call with reporters to reveal the “history” behind some organizations opposing the legislation. According to the speakers, a significant amount of the opposition to immigration reform is being led by liberals, environmentalists and pro-abortion and eugenics activists worried about population growth. 
“[T]he primary leaders and funders of the anti-immigration movement were drawn to it because they were also active organizers and supporters of, and contributors to, the population-control movement in the United States,” Mario Lopez, a speaker on the call, recently wrote. Lopez is President of the Hispanic Leadership Fund. Lopez was joined on the call by Josh Culling, with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform.
This ad hominem argument is both inane and irrelevant. People come into issues from all kinds of vantage points. I have no doubt that there active immigration reform opponents who are liberals or have overblown worries about population growth. Those views, however, don’t discredit what they may say on a different issue. Nor do those views discredit what people without those views believe on an issue. 


Friday’s call was a leftist tactic to discount what millions of Americans feel about an issue because some other people hold views with which they would disagree. It was reminiscent of the media’s attempt to smear the entire Tea Party movement because a handful of people said or did something stupid. 

Even if one were to cede the premise that an entire infrastructure to oppose immigration reform were built by population control activists, the fact is immaterial to the concerns many have about the legislation before the Senate. Even if you support expansive legal immigration, it is a bad bill. Its fatal flaw is that it doesn’t secure the border or increase enforcement in any meaningful way. One doesn’t have to be a population control zealot to see the fundamental problem with that approach. 
Surely, the speakers would hopefully acknowledge, there are many opposed to the Senate bill who don’t believe in population control. I would wager the overwhelming majority of Americans who have concerns about the bill are not advocates of abortion or eugenics to control the population. So, why are the views of a decided minority relevant to an issue with national implications? 
The richest irony of the call was that the speakers are allies of groups like SEIU and La Raza in supporting the specific Senate proposal. One could just as easily have a convened a press call to discuss the “history” behind these groups and why conservatives should be cautious about working with them. The speakers on the call, for example, acknowledged doing at least some work with the National Immigration Forum, which has received considerable funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute. Is that the proper alliance for a conservative?
No one should schedule such a call, however. Issues should be decided on merits, not ad hominem aspersions about someone else’s motives. The call was an attempt to smear all opposition to the Senate bill as arising out of the questionable beliefs of a few people. It was an attempt to quash, rather than foster, debate on the underlying merits of the proposal.
The call also perpetuated a dangerously false choice. Conservatives should either accept legislation largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer or be labeled as against reform. That our allies are forcing this choice is unconscionable.

Speaking in Ireland this week, President Obama stated that Catholic schools were divisive: “If towns remain divided–if Catholics have their schools and buildings and Protestants have theirs, if we can’t see ourselves in one another and fear or resentment are allowed to harden–that too encourages division and discourages cooperation.” On Thursday, the American Catholics for Religious Freedom fired back on President Obama’s words to 2,000 young people at the G8 Summit, stating, “President Obama’s anti-faith, secular agenda was shamefully on full display yesterday when he told the young people of Northern Ireland that Catholic education and other faith-based schools were divisive and an obstacle to peace.  All Americans of faith should be outraged by these comments which clearly telegraph the President’s belief system and are in fact at their core even anti-American.”

American Catholics for Religious Freedom points out that the media has completely ignored the story, and adds, “Secular progressives like President Obama ignore the truth that faith-based education is a component of the Religious Freedom guaranteed by the Constitution.  He can’t bear the thought that Catholic and parochial schools not only teach important values but consistently produce better educational results at lower cost than America’s failing public schools. The President’s troubling values are showing here in a way that demonstrate just how dangerous this Administration is and how committed it is to eroding the rights of all people of faith.”


And, they note, this is the same President who has attempted to cram down anti-Catholic doctrine via Obamacare. “It’s time Americans stood up for Religious Freedom, for the U.S. Constitution and against President Obama’s radical views about the place of faith in American life,” the group concludes.

1126	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/08/22/In-Foreign-Affairs-Obama-s-Not-Bush-Non-Policy-Collapses	News	1	International News	Democrat Scandals	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
The alleged use of deadly chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against civilians and opponents on the anniversary of President Barack Obama’s “red line” statement might have marked the collapse of Obama’s foreign policy–if such policy actually existed. In fact, however, the Obama administration has no foreign policy other than its continued opposition to the perceived postures of George W. Bush, more than four years gone.
Obama’s policy in Syria had been to rehabilitate the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. Well before he won the presidency, Democrats–including current Secretary of State John Kerry–made a point of visiting Assad to show their approach to foreign relations was different from, and more effective than, the allegedly confrontational approach of the Bush administration. Syria’s nuclear weapons program, exposed when Israel destroyed it in 2007, did not prompt any change in Democrats’ approach to the regime.


Therefore Obama renewed diplomatic relations and re-opened the U.S. embassy in Damascus, elevating the status of the regime. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even referred to Assad as a “reformer.” The hope was that doing so would convince him to side with the U.S. over Iran, and to win goodwill in the Arab world more generally.
In Egypt, the Obama administration adopted a similar approach, i.e. appeasing a tyrant with the intention of establishing a clear break with Bush’s pressure for democratic reforms and encourage a new perception of the U.S. as more open to the Arab and Muslim worlds. In the midst of an orgy of federal spending, Obama cut funding for pro-democracy groups in Egypt and prioritized relations with Hosni Mubarak’s regime.
At the same time, however, Obama began trying to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood, not because he wished to encourage a democratic process in Egypt that might include their participation, but because he wished to appease Islamist sentiment in general. His administration refused, for example, to identify radical Islam as the source of terrorism, and even redefined the term “war on terror” itself as “overseas contingency operations.”

Therefore when the Arab Spring erupted in 2011, the Obama administration initially tried to argue that he was not a “dictator.” Then, as media criticism began to mount, Obama switched sides and backed Mubarak’s ouster, all the while claiming that he had not, in fact, changed his policy. His previous efforts to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood as a legitimate organization gave some amount–though not much–of legitimacy to that claim. 
Today, in the aftermath of the Egyptian coup, Obama’s foreign policy has lost even the pretense of principle. He is showing outrage at the Egyptian military’s treatment of the Muslim Brotherhood protestors, cutting some aid and canceling joint military exercises (none of which he did in response to the Brotherhood’s own excesses when in power). Yet he refuses to call the coup itself a “coup,” or to cut all aid to the Egyptian military.
Meanwhile, in Syria, Obama is still refusing to do anything that might actually deter the regime from using banned weapons–such as imposing a no-fly zone, for instance–while accelerating aid to the Syrian rebels, who are dominated by anti-American jihadists. His policies are all half-measures and contradictions. Faced with the fact that his academic anti-colonialism has little real-world relevance, he is just avoiding any real commitments.
In fact, the only real foreign policy priority of the Obama administration is to avoid being blamed for anything that could possibly go wrong. He concluded his remarks on Egypt last week by insisting: “We don’t take sides with any particular party or political figure. I know it’s tempting inside of Egypt to blame the United States or the West or some other outside actor for what’s gone wrong.” The buck stops…with Egypt, he said. Not with me.
That is not to say that the Middle East’s current problems are easy to resolve. Republicans and conservatives have had a tough time coming to a consensus about what should be done. The Arab world presents only bad options and worse options: a genocidal regime in Syria versus brutal jihadist groups; a military tyranny in Egypt versus radical Islamists with hegemonic ambitions. The dangerous temptation to withdraw is strong.
The one point of agreement among conservatives–even the likes of Patrick Buchanan, these days–is that the U.S. should primarily be concerned with shoring up Israel against common enemies such as Al Qaeda and Iran. In other words, the best path might be to focus on the sole U.S. ally in the region. But the Obama administration has done the opposite, pressuring Israel and giving Iran leeway, despite continued frustration.
It is arguable that the Bush administration had a similarly rudderless foreign policy when it took office in 2001, driven only by the desire to do the opposite of its predecessor. Yet it pulled together a new strategy–however flawed–after 9/11, when circumstances had changed. Obama has failed to learn from crisis–whether the Green Revolution in Iran in 2009, or the Arab Spring and its aftermath. “Not Bush” is a non-policy, but a real failure.

As the Egyptian military effectively declared a coup, overthrowing the elected government of repressive Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi, the Obama administration struggled to come up with a coherent strategy to deal with the situation. 
President Obama released a statement on Morsi’s ouster, suggesting that his administration “does not support particular individuals or political parties, but we are committed to the democratic process and respect for the law.” With those principles in mind, Obama declared himself “deeply concerned” and called for a transition to civilian rule. He refused to state whether the United States would withdraw aid to Egypt, saying only that he had directed a comprehensive review process.


Simultaneously, the State Department, which issued a mandatory evacuation order to non-essential personnel on Wednesday, said it would not take sides in the Egyptian situation. “We haven’t taken sides and don’t plan to take sides here,” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.
In an embarrassing signifier of the level of chaos plaguing the administration, Secretary of State John Kerry called into the top level meetings from a secure phone. According to CBS producer Mosheh Oinounou, Kerry was on the “Isabel” on Wednesday afternoon. Oinounou said that when another CBS producer yelled “Morsi!” to Kerry, she received no response. Oinounou tweeted this photo:


Later, Oinounou reported that the State Department denies his claim that CBS reporters saw Kerry aboard his yacht; the State Department maintains that Kerry has been working on Egypt “all day.”
Whether Kerry was working all day or not on the strategy, it’s clear that confusion reigns at the highest levels. President Obama in Cairo in 2009 decried the “overthrow of a democratically-elected Iranian government” in the 1950s; when Honduras’ military ousted a would-be dictator, the Obama administration originally kicked back before caving. Now, it seems that the administration can’t label the military coup a military coup, and won’t label it a democratic movement.
President Obama isn’t even leading from behind at this point, simply because he can’t tell which direction is behind.
NOTE: This post has been edited to reflect the State Department’s denial of the original CBS report regarding Kerry’s presence on his yacht.

Saturday morning Patrick Howley of The Daily Caller dropped another nuke on the fire that is Benghazi-Gate. Howley connects the dots surrounding a number of recent leaks coming of out CBS News about the fate of its award-winning investigative reporter, Sharyl Attkisson. 
From the beginning, Attkisson has been one of the few mainstream journalists willing to dig into the September 11 terror attack in Libya, and the Administration’s response to it. Fearing the story might lead exactly where it did yesterday with Jonathan Karl’s bombshell report, the mainstream media has poured most if its energy into wishing the story away or playing Palace Guard for the White House. 
Attkisson’s dogged pursuit of the truth has not only pitted her against a media desperate to protect Obama, but also, apparently, against her bosses at CBS News, one of whom is the brother of a top Obama official.


Moreover, CBS News president David Rhoades is not only the brother of President Obama’s national security advisor, Ben Rhodes, but ABC News reports that Ben Rhodes was very much involved in the editing of the now-infamous CIA talking points. 
So…
1. According to ABC News, Obama’s national security advisor Ben Rhodes was deeply involved in the editing of the CIA talking points.  

2. These same CIA talking points are central to what many believe is a White House coverup.
3. Ben Rhodes is the brother of CBS News president David Rhodes.
4. At CBS News, Sharyl Attkisson is one of the only mainstream media journalists with the dogged determination and moral courage to demand the truth about the White House’s involvement in the CIA talking points.  
5. For months now  reports have surfaced that Attkisson’s bosses are unhappy with her, that she has trouble getting her Libya stories on the air, and that she’s being accused of engaging in “advocacy.”

Seven hundred retired Military Special Operations professionals from the organization “Special Operations Speaks” sent a letter to the House of Representatives urging members to support H.Res 36, which will create a House Select Committee to investigate last September’s deadly terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.  
Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA), a sub-committee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee, issued a resolution for a House Select Committee to investigate issues surrounding the Benghazi Attack last November in the 112th Congress. He re-issued his resolution for the select committee when the 113th Congress began. The resolution currently has over 60 co-sponsors.
Only Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) can appoint a Select Committee and Boehner appears to mainly rely on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate the Benghazi attack. However, any information that may be garnered from that committee will, as always, remain classified.


“As a retired Special Operations officer who spent most of my thirty-six years preparing for and executing rescue missions to save fellow Americans, I am deeply troubled by the events in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The men and women who I served with lived by an ethos that pledged to never leave a fallen comrade and to make every effort to respond when a fellow American was threatened. I have seen men take great risks to save a fellow warrior. I have even seen men die trying to do so,” wrote General William G. ‘Jerry’ Boykin in a statement to Breitbart News. 
Boykin added, “The lack of accountability regarding the Benghazi event disturbs me greatly and bears the earmarks of a cover up. America is entitled to a full accounting of this egregious attack on our people with some explanation as to why there was no effort to save the Americans in the US Embassy annex and the CIA station, or at least to recover their bodies before they fell into Libyan hands. Our Congress has yet to fulfill its responsibility to provide a complete analysis of the attack or to provide answers as to what exactly happened. A  bi-partisan Special Committee is needed to determine the truth about Benghazi.”
Last month, Rep. Wolf, along with Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA), a House Ways and Means Committee member, sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry demanding more information on State Department employees who survived the Benghazi attack. In his letter to Kerry, Wolf noted that sources say that as many as 30 survivors of the Benghazi attack were allegedly wounded. Seven of those thirty were said to be critical injuries.  Sec. Kerry confirmed he visited an injured Benghazi survivor at Walter Reed. 

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, pointed to Kerry’s admission as a reason why he expects to speak with Benghazi survivors. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a Senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees,” Issa told Breitbart News. 
Since Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) first told Breitbart News in December that the Obama administration had not been allowing him or any other member of Congress to see Benghazi survivors, more Republican members, including Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John McCain (R-AZ) are calling for survivors to be allowed to testify at hearings on Capitol Hill without fear of legal or career repercussions.
Signers of the letter believe the House Select Committee should look into a number of issues, including the lack of military response to the events in Benghazi, if any non-military assistance was provided during the attack; the number U.S. personnel who were injured in Benghazi; the current locations of survivors; the names of the individuals in the White House Situation Room (WHSR) during the entire 8-hour period of the attacks and was a senior US military officer present.
“As veterans from all aspects of Special Operations, we have no doubt that there’s a lot more to what happened in Benghazi than President Obama and his Administration are letting on. From the very beginning, he has attempted to mislead and outright lied to the American people about why the attack on September 11th, 2012 happened, how it happened, and what our government did or did not do to save the lives of our patriots abroad,” former Navy SEAL Captain Larry Bailey wrote in a statement to Breitbart News.
The representatives from the retired military community want “a full accounting of the events of September 11, 2012,” adding that the,  “American public be fully informed regarding this egregious terrorist attack on US diplomatic personnel and facilities. We owe that truth to the American people and the families of the fallen.”

Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) said Friday that the resignation of President Barack Obama’s Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is not enough. He said Attorney General Eric Holder should step down too.
“One down and one to go,” Gosar said in a statement. “While Secretary Napolitano may be gone she will not be forgotten. Her inaction and incompetence on border security will continue to plague our nation for years to come.”
“‘See no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil’ is no way to govern and yet it is exactly how she and this administration operates,” he continued. “The American public deserve better.”


Gosar added that it is time for Holder to resign as well.
“What the American people need now is for Attorney General Eric Holder to follow her lead and resign,” Gosar said. “The American people have no confidence in him or his ability to do his job. My message to him would be: Better late than never. Today is a good day to go.”
Gosar has a resolution in the House calling for Holder’s resignation that a number of members of Congress have signed onto. During the previous session, 130 House members, eight U.S. Senators, and several governors from around the country called for Holder to resign over Operation Fast and Furious. 

In Fast and Furious, the Obama administration’s Department of Justice and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed 2,000 weapons bought through straw purchases to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. Holder remains in both criminal and civil contempt of Congress for his failure to cooperate with the congressional investigation into the scandal, which left hundreds of Mexican citizens and U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry dead. 
President Obama has asserted executive privilege to continue concealing thousands of pages of documents related to the scandal from Congress.
Fast and Furious is hardly Holder’s only problem moving forward, especially as House Republicans draw closer to obtaining the documents uncovered via a federal court lawsuit. The Attorney General faces multiple scandals, particularly his decision to approve secret investigations into members of the news media. Holder reportedly met with President Obama on a forthcoming report on the DOJ’s activities in regards to that issue on Friday.
The Associated Press noted how Gosar’s harsh words for Napolitano contrast sharply with those of his fellow Arizona Republican, Sen. John McCain. McCain rushed to praise Napolitano for her work, saying she “served our nation with honor.”
Napolitano’s DHS released hundreds of illegal aliens from prisons earlier this year, citing the sequester as the reason.

New footage of a speech by Chuck Hagel in 2008 has surfaced, in which the former Senator mocked the idea of continuing the U.S. policy of confronting Iran and supporting Israel. “When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran, you can’t talk with Syria and we’re, we should stay where we are and support Israel, and so on, well you miss the point,” he told the laughing audience at an event for his book, America: Our Next Chapter.
Hagel added that the U.S. “shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran,” even in the event of a nuclear attack on Israel, and suggested Israel would be the first to attack Iran with a nuclear weapon.


Hagel told the Senate on Jan. 31 that he could not provide records or video for more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given over the previous five years because they had not been transcribed or recorded:


We have given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there, every video that I have that’s out there. On paid speeches, most every one of those paid speeches–in the contract it says that they are private and not videotaped. That wasn’t my decision. That was the contract of the group I spoke to. I believe every paid speech I gave I didn’t have a prepared text. I gave it extemporaneously, which is something I’ve been doing for long before I left the Senate.

However, records and recordings of many of those speeches do exist, suggesting the administration either did not perform the due diligence necessary to comply with the Senate’s request, or that Hagel misled the Senate.
In the new footage, which was uploaded to YouTube and is apparently from a question-and-answer session after his formal remarks, Hagel fields a question about whether the U.S. would attack Iran to help defend Israel from an attack by Iran or one of its proxies that threatened Israel’s existence. He says that the U.S. should not attack Iran, and that the U.S. should “engage” Iran instead–even in those circumstances:

Q: [I]f Israel is attacked by Iran or an Iranian proxy like Hezbollah in a way that existentially threatens Israel, almost to the extent that Israel was attacked in ’73 and it’s existentially threatened, would you support an American airstrike using U.S. forces, B2s, whatever on Iran?”
A: I’ll answer the question as honestly as I can. That’s a hypothetical question that somehow frames up the simplicity of the hypothetical question. The complications in the Middle East, and I’m certainly not an expert there, I have a chapter on the Middle East, I do know [laughter], I know a little something about the Middle East. I spent a lot of time there. And I spent a lot of time in Israel with the prime minister and others. You, who are well informed on this issue know the complexities starting with–go back to the Bible, go back to ancient times, thousands of years. I mean that, if you really want to start trying to understand the Middle East, Paul, or David Aaron Miller, who you may know, has a new book out on this, The Not So Promised Land, [sic]. And if you want to read something that is very, very enlightening, this guy, he’s getting tremendous reviews on it. He’s Jewish. He worked in the State Department , worked for Baker, worked for Albright, I think he’s worked for four Secretaries of State, different Democrats, Republicans. But it’s a great, great book.
But your question, I mean the complication of what’s going on there, Hamas is already attacking Israel. Iran supports Hamas. Iran supports Hezbollah. What I would much rather see is this administration, or hopefully the next administration, engage Iran, engage Syria. When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran, you can’t talk with Syria and we’re, we should stay where we are and support Israel, and so on, well you miss the point. 
Our policy has been so successful I believe, hasn’t it [laughter], that the Middle East is far better off today than it’s ever been, isn’t it? [Laughter.] I mean all those countries, Lebanon is in great shape, Gaza is in great shape, Israel is in good shape, Iran, Iraq, things have never looked better, because we won’t talk to anybody. We are not going to have peace, stability, security or anything that even hints of it in the Middle East until Iran and Syria and all the players are part of it.
Now that doesn’t apologize for, or doesn’t close our eyes to what Iran has been doing, what Iran does do. But unless they are engaged in some way, then I don’t see this getting any better. And where this could go, where this could eventually go–somebody was asking me the other day about a nuclear exchange in the world, where that would come from? And I said, well, I’ll give you a scenario that’s very real. If Israel gets backed up enough into a corner, and Israel uses a tactical theater nuclear weapon–you want to talk about seeing some things unravel in the world. The United States shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran or anybody else. I mean, we got our hands full right now… [Applause]

Last week, Iranian “Supreme Leader” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei bluntly rejected the suggestion by Vice President Joe Biden that the U.S. and Iran should meet for direct, bilateral talks on Iran’s nuclear program.

Left-wing media critic Jeff Cohen has been all over cable news as a contributor, but for a time he worked as a senior producer for MSNBC. Monday, in the wake of the NSA spying scandal, Cohen lashed out at his former employer as the “official network of the Obama White House.” 
This isn’t exactly news to the most of us, but MSNBC’s water carrying for Obama’s massive surveillance state apparently woke Mr. Cohen up:


When it comes to issues of U.S. militarism and spying, the allegedly “progressive” MSNBC often seems closer to the “official network of the Obama White House” than anything resembling an independent channel. With a few exceptions (especially Chris Hayes [10]), MSNBC has usually reacted to expanded militarism and surveillance by downplaying the abuses or defending them.
Had McCain or Romney defeated Obama and implemented the exact same policies, treating whistleblowers like Manning and Snowden as foreign espionage agents, one would expect MSNBC hosts to be loudly denouncing the Republican abuses of authority.
Cohen then names names:

As Snowden arrived in Russia from Hong Kong, MSNBC host Ed Schultz blustered on [12] about Snowden as a “punk” and “coward.” …
MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry has been condemning Snowden [14] by contrasting him with civil disobedients who “love their country” and submit to arrest – while Snowden just wants to “save his own skin [11].” …
MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow has also disappointed. After doing a typically thorough presentation on the force-down of President’s Morales’ plane, she ended her report [17] by expressing displeasure only that Washington had apparently gotten allies to go out on the limb “for nothing.”
For the most part, the left is perfectly okay with MSNBC being a branch of the Obama White House on every other issue. It is only on issues the left disagree with, like this spying business, that brings out the complaints. 
MSNBC is at least being consistent.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) will honor former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with this year’s Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center. The award will be presented to Clinton on September 10th, the eve of the first anniversary of the terrorist attack on the United States mission in Benghazi that killed four Americans.
The Christian Science Monitor reports that Bush, a potential GOP contender in the 2016 presidential race, is chairman of the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center located in Philadelphia.  
“Former Secretary Clinton has dedicated her life to serving and engaging people across the world in democracy,” Bush said in a statement. “These efforts as a citizen, an activist, and a leader have earned Secretary Clinton this year’s Liberty Medal.” 


Bush’s decision to honor Clinton, who is considered by some to be a likely Democrat candidate for president in 2016, was condemned by the Independence Hall Tea Party Association of Philadelphia. According to the Christian Science Monitor, the organization released its own statement Monday, referring to the event as “extremely distressing,” and offering, instead, an opportunity for another Liberty Medal recipient. 

According to the statement: 

As all of you undoubtedly know, much of the blame for the Obama Administration’s failure to contain the Benghazi attack and the scandalous handling of its aftermath, can be traced directly to Ms. Clinton. 
Indeed, a Congressional investigation regarding Ms. Clinton’s role in the cover-up of the Administration’s failure is still ongoing. 
A newly formed organization, the Independence Hall Foundation, will hold a “What Difference Does It Make” press conference on Independence Mall, September 10, 4 PM, to denounce the selection of Ms. Clinton as the 2013 Liberty Medal recipient and to offer an alternative award (details below). 
During the conference, the Foundation will name its choice of recipient(s) for the 2013 Defender of Liberty Medal. 
Dom Giordano will headline the presser and we certainly hope you will consider joining us. 
A 5 PM Prayer Vigil for the victims of the Benghazi attack will immediately follow the press conference.  

The National Constitution Center’s announcement, dated June 27th, about the award of the Liberty Medal to Clinton, states: 

As Secretary of State, Clinton advocated for “smart power” in foreign policy, elevating diplomacy and development and repositioning them for the 21st century – with new tools, technologies, and partners, including the private sector and civil society around the world. 

National Constitution Center president and CEO Jeffrey Rosen said, “Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to expanding opportunities for ‘We the People’ not just in this country but around the globe.”  
Upon the announcement of Clinton’s award in June, Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft wrote, “Really Jeb, no one else came to mind?”

So Ted Cruz doesn’t trust the Republicans. Imagine that.
“Let me be clear” he said on the Senate floor the other day. “I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats.” And why not? The last four years have given us all ample reason not to trust the Democrats, as $1 trillion deficits have become the new normal and the national debt has zoomed toward $17 trillion, all under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid team’s watch.
But what about the Republicans, who so often claim to be the party of limited government? The truth is, the GOP’s record is seldom as grand as its rhetoric. Aside from a few Tea Party stalwarts, plenty of Republican senators are ready to throw in the towel on the debt ceiling, let it go up, and get a few scraps from the Democrats in return.


“Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,” Cruz was quoted in the New York Times. “There are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.”
He is right about that. Senior Republican staffers in Congress tell me that members of the Republican Leadership in both houses of Congress are terrified of not raising the debt ceiling, having been convinced that calamity will ensue if we don’t. But the alternative? Senate Majority Leader McConnell would, I am told, be happy to see the debt ceiling raised with no Republican votes. Then Republicans can beat up Democrats for raising it, while knowing that the economy won’t explode as Paul Krugman has warned it would. 
And if House Speaker John Boehner had to choose between a clean debt ceiling increase (one with no limits, allowing Obama to keep raising it ad nauseum) and no debt ceiling increase at all, I am told he would take the former by conservatives in the House of Representatives.

So the establishment Republican mind-set says, “More debt is better than a melt-down, but at least get something in return, even if it doesn’t mean much, we have something to run against the Democrats with.” What do they want in return? They know they don’t have the votes to get much in the way of budget cuts, so they can at least keep the base happy with talk about “economic growth.”
When Cruz, who is anything but your traditional freshman back-bench Senator, said he didn’t trust Republicans, the party establishment, led by John McCain, howled in response. But where is the Republican leadership’s credibility? When they last held real power, these Republicans goosed up domestic discretionary spending faster than it rose under Bill Clinton and piled on the debt.
It was under a Republican president and Congress that we got Medicare Part D, the biggest new entitlement since LBJ’s Great Society. The prescription drug benefit added trillions to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities, passed only when party bosses needed to violate normal procedures to get the votes to pass it. Former U.S. Comptroller David Walker called it “the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s.”
Medicare’s chief actuary, Richard Foster, later said he was threatened not to reveal that the drug benefit’s price tag would exceed $400 billion in the first ten years. This figure was necessary under congressional rules to keep the bill from being blocked on a point of order. Foster estimated the real price tag was in excess of $500 billion. Several GOP congressmen would also recount arm-twisting tactics from the party leadership that went beyond the norm.
Instead of reducing the federal role in education, the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress gave us No Child Left Behind, which helped double the size of the Department of Education, a Cabinet-level agency Republicans had pledged to abolish as recently as 1996. John Boehner, now the speaker of the House, was an NCLB sponsor and described its enactment as “one of the proudest accomplishments of my tenure in Congress.”

Under a Republican president and Congress, a $128 billion surplus was replaced by a $455 billion deficit. By the time George W. Bush left office, the shortfall was $1.2 trillion. Discretionary spending went up faster in Bush’s first term than it did in eight years under Bill Clinton. Under Bush’s watch, the federal budget exceeded $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion, for the first time. Most of these milestones were reached before the Democrats retook Congress. Federal spending rose from 18.4 percent of GDP to an average of 20.51 percent under Bush.
Bush and the Republican establishment bailed out the Wall Street banks with the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (with Democratic support, naturally). They bailed out the auto industry. They even pioneered a pre-Obama stimulus program, with similar results. The deficits and government growth would later endanger the Bush tax cuts, one of the signature conservative policy achievements of the period.
The Republicans who would negotiate the debt ceiling with the Democrats in a conference will be the same people who voted for all this big government and their successors. This unfortunately includes even Paul Ryan. What faith can we have that the results will be different this time?
So is there any doubt at all why Ted Cruz doesn’t trust Republicans? He explained that he thinks “a whole lot of Americans likewise don’t trust the Republicans and the Democrats because it is leadership in both parties that has gotten us in this mess.” 
Maybe we need new leadership.

On Sept. 12, religious-liberty leaders met with Pentagon officials to discuss the rapidly-escalating incidents of religious-liberty violations in the military under the Obama administration.  
On Apr. 28, Breitbart News broke the story of Pentagon brass meeting with anti-Christian activist Mikey Weinstein to discuss religious-liberty policies. Quoting Weinstein in his own printed words, this activist has a record of calling observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek impose “theocratic terror” on America, and that evangelizing (sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ) in the military is an act of “sedition and treason” against this country, making those who do it “enemies of the Constitution.” He says those who do so should be court-martialed (criminally prosecuted). 
As this story developed, the Obama-Hagel Pentagon defended its policy, and changed its story several times, as it was revealed that these meetings with Weinstein had been going on for years. In the following months there were additional incidents, such as removing Christian patriotic artwork at a military base, censoring a Christian chaplain, and a Christian service member reportedly being relieved of duty by his lesbian commander because he refused her order to say that it is wrong not to support gay marriage. 


Now leaders from Restore Military Religious Freedom–a coalition to protect service members of faith–met with Pentagon officials. Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin (ret.) of the Family Research Council, Col. Ron Crews (ret.) of the Chaplains Alliance for Religious Liberty, Kellie Fiedorek of the Alliance Defending Freedom, and nationally-known Christian talk radio host Sandy Rios took with them two petitions calling on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to protect religious liberty. One was a general petition with 170,000 signatures, and the other–with 50,000 signatures–was sparked by the last incident mentioned above, where Air Force Senior Master Sergeant Phillip Monk was relieved of duty by Maj. Elisa Valenzuela, allegedly because of Monk’s Christian beliefs on marriage. Monk now faces possible court martial. 

These Christian leaders met with Lt. Gen. Richard C. Harding, the three-star judge advocate general of the Air Force (the top lawyer in that branch of the military), and Maj. Gen. Howard D. Stendahl, the two-star Air Force chief of chaplains. 
Gen. Boykin said after the meeting:

The meeting included a productive discussion on the issue of religious freedom in the military as a whole and not just the U.S. Air Force. After delivering the petitions, we explained our concerns regarding the trend towards infringements on the constitutional liberties of service members in all uniformed services. 
We appreciate their offer to review decisions that do not reflect Air Force policy made by commanders at various bases.  At their request, we will report future events and concerns directly to Air Force leadership.  After reviewing a series of troubling incidents involving chaplains, the coalition members were assured in the meeting that chaplains would not be forced to do anything that violates the tenets of their faith.   
We also requested that the Department of Defense and the Air Force issue a definitive statement regarding the ability of service members to share their faith publicly.  Previous statements on the subject have been confusing and contradictory. 
Additionally, we asked that the Department of Defense move quickly to implement the religious freedom protections enacted in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Given new incidents of military personnel facing career reprisals for their religious beliefs, it is vital that regulations preventing discrimination be issued by the Secretary of Defense as demanded by law. We intend to remain in contact with the Air Force to ensure that the law’s implementation is consistent with the intent of Congress.

Congress is working on new statutory language to protect such religious speech in the military, which has passed the House and is pending in the Senate. President Obama threatens to veto this legislation.

The massive, coordinated initiative by the Catholic Church to push for comprehensive immigration reform is being run by a group that has the support of the most far-left corners of the Church who often seem to be at odds with actual Catholic doctrinal teachings.
As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn wrote Thursday, Kevin Appleby, Director of Migration Policy for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) is coordinating the Church’s initiative to apply political pressure to Congress to pass an immigration reform law that will include a pathway to citizenship. 
According to its USCCB website, Migration and Refugee Services (MRS) “is charged with assisting the bishops in the development and promotion of migration policy positions within the context of the Church’s social teaching:” 



MRS works with grassroots Catholic networks across the US to promote fair immigration and refugee policies, advocates for the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, engages in the fight against human trafficking, develops initiatives aimed at educating Catholics on the Church’s teaching on migration, and assists the U.S. Catholic bishops in carrying the voice of the Church to Congress and the Administration. 

Among the coalitions with which MRS/USCCB is closely aligned is the Justice for Immigrants Campaign which is the “boots on the ground” group that is “designed to unite and mobilize a growing network of Catholic institutions, individuals, and other persons of good will in support of a broad legalization program and comprehensive immigration reform.” 
Even though support of amnesty is not a doctrinal matter for the Catholic Church, Justice for Immigrants has been so successful in its media campaign that it has positioned even the most conservative Catholic bishops, who have rebuked the Democrat-led federal government on Catholic doctrinal matters, such as abortion and marriage, to place their trust in essentially the same politicians in the area of comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty.  
Even Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who heads the USCCB, publicly criticized Republicans during an MSNBC interview in May of 2012. 


“You need to get your house in order when it comes to immigration,” Dolan said to the GOP. “You have the reputation of being fairly tough on immigrants…you’d better come up with a much saner, more civil, more just immigration policy.” 
However, some of the founding member organizations of Justice for Immigrants are groups whose actions have not been aligned with Catholic doctrinal teachings, such as those on abortion and marriage.
Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) has been under scrutiny for several years for its ties to pro-abortion leaders. 
A Planned Parenthood lobbyist, Alisa LaPolt Snow, recently drew national condemnation when she told Florida state representatives that, if a baby is born alive during a botched abortion, the decision about whether to save its life “should be left up to the woman, her family, and the physician.”

LaPolt Snow’s biography, however, indicated that she served “on the board of Catholic Charities of Northwest Florida – Tallahassee.”


In July of 2011, CCUSA also confirmed to LifeSiteNews that it had hired the firm of gay lobbyist Tom Sheridan, the Sheridan Group, to work on its behalf. 

Earlier that year, Catholic Charities of San Francisco had invited a number of pro-abortion lawmakers to its annual Loaves and Fishes fundraiser, including several with 100 percent pro-abortion voting records with NARAL. In addition, it had been previously discovered that the director of programs of San Francisco Catholic Charities had adopted children with his gay partner and was publicly supported by the charity’s leaders. 
According to LifeSiteNews, Sister Jeannine Gramick, founder of New Ways Ministry, a dissident group, said, “Catholic Charities in general have been the most progressive wing of the church other than the nuns.” 
CCUSA also pressed the Catholic faithful to support passage of ObamaCare “immediately,” even though the law lacked a provision that excluded funding of abortion. 
Pope Benedict XVI had issued an apostolic letter last December that directed Caritas Internationalis, the umbrella group that represents CCUSA and Catholic Relief Services, to cease practices that are inconsistent with Church teaching. The former pope warned diocesan bishops and parish priests about the increase in charitable services to the poor becoming integrated with practices that are inconsistent with Church doctrine. 
Catholic Relief Services (CRS), a Justice for Immigrants member organization, has also been at the center of a scandal this year regarding the funding of organizations that promote abortion and birth control. According to LifeSiteNews, CRS has denied any direct involvement in either funding or the distribution of items related to abortion or contraception. 
Last week, LifeSiteNews reported, however, that CRS is a dues-paying member and on the board of directors of MEDiCAM, an organization that has supported the individual training of abortion providers, and CORE Group, which has devoted half of its total budget to “family planning.”  
CRS reportedly admitted this fact, and responded, “We acknowledge our differences, air our disagreements on these issues, and contribute our Catholic voice to the conversation.” 
Similarly, in July, CRS reportedly gave $2.7 million to a population control organization that uses its work to distribute anti-malaria drugs and mosquito nets as a means of spreading its population control programs. 
The Catholic Health Association (CHA), also a founding member of Justice for Immigrants, last month announced that it would accept the White House’s “accommodation” for religious employers that opposed the HHS contraception and abortifacients mandate, even though the bishops said the final rule failed to resolve several key concerns for them.  
Sister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of CHA had also supported the passage of ObamaCare, even after the USCCB withdrew its backing because of concerns about whether the health reform law would be used to subsidize abortions. 
Though not specifically mentioned as a “member organization” of Justice for Immigrants, the Nuns on the Bus, a group of Catholic nuns that espouses liberal social policies, held a national bus tour for comprehensive immigration reform this summer. 
Last year, the Nuns spoke out against Congressman Paul Ryan’s budget proposal which, they said, favored wealthy Americans at the expense of the poor. Following that tour, Sister Simone Campbell, leader of the Nuns, appeared on “The Colbert Report” and was a prime-time speaker at the Democrat National Convention, despite the fact that the DNC openly promoted abortion and same-sex marriage. 
Given the backing of many well-known “Catholic” organizations, the Church’s political advocacy for immigration is significant. As Breitbart News’ Flynn noted, the “support of amnesty seems broader and more coordinated than its actions against an ObamaCare mandate requiring coverage of contraception. In recent years, the Church has been more vocal in its criticism of abortion, but even that seems muted in comparison with current plans on immigration reform.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Nearly half of the crowd at Saturday’s Elite 8 game between Syracuse and Marquette at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. booed President Barack Obama when he was shown on the big screen with just over ten minutes to play in the first half. After the boos erupted, a contingent of Obama supporters countered with cheers.
Obama also golfed on Saturday for the first time since the sequester cuts went into effect at the beginning of March and then took some of his foursome–and his Secret Service detail–to watch Syracuse oust Marquette and secure a trip to the Final Four. 


One would have expected a friendlier crowd for the President, but there are still several possible explanations for the boos. Obama and his White House team had supported Georgetown (Syracuse’s rival) in the past, and the President had forecast Indiana (who was eliminated by Syracuse) to win the East Regional and go on to win the national title, for example.  Or, perhaps they booed because POTUS had gone to the game with Secret Service agents while the White House remains closed to tours. 
The Obama administration canceled the popular White House tours citing Secret Service costs. Throughout the week, Obama has been scrutinized because of Secret Service expenditures for the First Daughters’ vacations to the Bahamas and Sun Valley, Idaho.

Spring Break is a common ritual for students across the country, and First Daughter Malia Obama is no exception. But, of course, there is an important difference between the First Daughter and other students. When Malia Obama takes a trip, the American taxpayers get stuck with a hefty bill. How hefty? That’s what we’ve been trying to find out.
As you know, JW has kept close watch on the First Family’s extravagant personal trips for the American people, since we’re the ones footing the bill. And last week we released records detailing the government funds expended on Malia’s March 2012 Spring Break vacation to Mexico. According to the records, obtained from the U.S. Secret Service as a result of a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed on September 20, 2012, the total cost of the trip amounted to $115,500.87. 

The following is a breakdown of the costs as detailed in the documents, which are available in full here:


Ground transportation:       $23,964.81
Lodging:                           $21,682.92
Airfare:                             $47,767.34
“Vouchers”:                       $21,636.14 (not itemized)
Support Charges:               $449.66 (travel for one from Mexico City to Oaxaca, not                                             itemized)

Malia Obama’s Spring Break trip evoked a significant amount of controversy after the Obama White House reportedly ordered the removal of press reports detailing the trip. 
On March 19, 2012, numerous online press outlets reported on Malia Obama’s Mexico trip, noting the fact that she was accompanied by 25 U.S. Secret Service Agents and as many as 12 of her friends. However, shortly after the press reports surfaced, they were quickly removed from the Internet. 

As reported by Politico: 
The AFP, the Huffington Post and other websites have scrubbed a report about first daughter Malia Obama’s school trip. On Monday, the AFP reported that Obama’s daughter was on a school trip along with a number of friends and 25 Secret Service agents. The story was picked up by Yahoo, the Huffington Post, and the International Business Times, as well as UK publications like the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and other overseas publications like The Australian. But on Monday night, the story had been removed from those sites.
In an update to this story, Politico published a statement issued by Kristina Schake, Communications Director to the First Lady, indicating that the removal of these news stories was “a White House effort:” 

“From the beginning of the administration, the White House has asked news outlets not to report on or photograph the Obama children when they are not with their parents and there is no vital news interest. We have reminded outlets of this request in order to protect the privacy and security of these girls.”
The trip reportedly took place shortly after the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statement advising students on Spring Break “to avoid Mexico.”  
I think we can all agree that in these economic times, with huge public debt and high unemployment, spending $115,000 in taxpayer funds on a Spring Break trip to Mexico is inappropriate. Is this what Americans are being asked to pay higher taxes for?
This is far from the first time the Obamas have taken advantage of the American taxpayer to enjoy expensive vacations.
We previously obtained records from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing Michelle Obama’s February 2012 President’s Day weekend ski vacation to Aspen, Colorado, with her two daughters. The records indicate U.S. Secret Service costs, including accommodations at the Fasching Haus deluxe condominium and the Inn at Aspen, were $48,950.38.
Judicial Watch also obtained documents from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing costs associated with Michelle Obama’s controversial August 2010 vacation to Spain. According to a Judicial Watch analysis, the records indicate a total combined cost of at least $467,585.  
Judicial Watch also obtained documents detailing costs of a June 21-27, 2011, trip taken by Michelle Obama, her family and her staff to South Africa and Botswana. Judicial Watch received mission expense records and passenger manifests for the Africa trip that described costs of $424,142 for the flight and crew alone. Other expenses, such as off-flight food, transportation, security, etc. were not included.
That’s a total of four trips at a cost of almost $1 million. And these are the trips we know about.
Rest assured, JW will continue to monitor these First Family excursions in a second Obama term. I suspect they will continue.

Two Congressmen are asking the Treasury Department if it inappropriately scrutinized conservative-owned businesses the same way it targeted Tea Party groups filing for tax-exempt status.
Republicans Mike Kelly (PA-03) and Jim Renacci (OH-16) circulated a letter Thursday requesting Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to release documents detailing the process and methodology the Automotive Task Force used to shut down General Motors dealerships in 2009 during the automotive industry crisis. 
Renacci’s Northeast Ohio Chevrolet dealership was closed in 2010 after losing a battle with General Motors. Congress loaned General Motors $50 billion in 2009 after GM declared bankruptcy, which resulted in the federal government owning a majority share of the company. Roughly 2000 dealerships received “wind-down” agreements, and while hundreds were able to survive an exhaustive arbitration process, Renacci-Doraty Chevrolet in Wadsworth did not. Renacci, then a Congressional candidate challenging incumbent John Boccieri, placed the blame squarely on President Obama. 


Mike Kelly has a similar story. He decided to run for Congress when it was announced that Obama’s Automotive Task Force slated Wayland Chevrolet in Butler, Pennsylvania for closure. The dealership was started by Kelly’s father in 1953.
Now that it has been confirmed that the Treasury Department unfairly profiled conservatives around that time, the Congressmen are wondering if that could have been a factor in the selection of certain dealerships for closure.
The IRS scandal “raises serious questions about past decisions made by the [Treasury] Department regarding auto dealership closures that occurred in 2008 and 2009,” reads the letter. “We formally request that the Treasury Department provide all e-mails, phone records, notes, memoranda, reports, and other communications regarding the decision-making process for dealership closures from the Automotive Task Force headed by Car Czars Steve Rattner and Ron Bloom.”

The letter also notes that while the Automotive Task Force claimed to have objectively evaluated each dealership, a Special Inspector General Report found that there was “little or no documentation” that proves objective criteria were used.

Eight months into President George W. Bush’s second term, the Washington Post wrote that Bush’s frequent trips to his Texas ranch symbolized “a lackadaisical approach to the world’s most important day job” and gleefully noted that Bush was intent on setting the record for being on “vacation”–or away from Washington, D.C.–for the most number of days of any president. 
But when President Barack Obama vacations in Hawaii, sets up a fantasy golf vacation for himself with Butch Harmon and Tiger Woods, averages more than a vacation a month in 2013 while purporting to be a man of the people and demanding the rich pay their fair share, and playing sequester politics by shutting down White House tours, the mainstream media is silent. 
And while Bush spent more time outside of Washington than Obama, it is also worth nothing that nearly all of Bush’s vacations were trips back to his Texas ranch or family vacation homes in Maine. 


The Post, in 2005, conceded that Bush’s vacations–unlike Obama’s–were not lavish and he did not “make time for fun.”

“Bush rarely takes the type of vacation one would consider exotic — or, to some, even appealing,” the Post wrote. “His notion of relaxation is chopping cedar on his ranch or mountain biking through rough terrain, all in 100-degree-plus temperatures in dusty Texas where crickets are known to roast on the summer pavement. He seems to relish the idea of exposing aides and reporters to the hothouse environment.”
Obama, on the other hand, has traveled to Hawaii every winter. The Obama daughters are vacationing at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas this week with a full Secret Service detail, as Breitbart News reported, even as the White House claimed they could not afford to pay Secret Service agents to continue the popular White House tours for other students who are on their spring vacations in Washington, D.C. 
The Obamas have gone to Martha’s Vineyard multiple times while the country was in recession and Americans were struggling to find jobs. Michelle Obama has taken a whirlwind trip to Spain and a ski trip to Aspen. 
Obama took 13 vacations in his first term, which spanned all or part of 83 days. But they have been much more lavish than Bush’s. His annual vacations to Hawaii alone have cost taxpayers at least $20 million during his first term. In 2011 alone, Michelle Obama may have cost taxpayers $10 million on vacations herself. Obama’s fantasy golf outing this year cost local law enforcement in Florida a reported $78, 205. 
Bush was content to work from home during his vacations. And for doing so, the mainstream media tagged him as lazy and disinterested. The Obamas gallivant around, making plenty of “time for fun,” and the mainstream media does not call them out for wasting taxpayer dollars or even for the terrible “optics.”

On Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney tried to dismiss a shocking Government Accountability Institute (GAI) report that found President Barack Obama had only a single face-to-face meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since Obamacare was signed over three years ago. 
When asked whether the nonpartisan GAI report shows a deficiency in Obama’s “leadership skills” during his White House press briefing, Carney alleged that “cabinet secretaries don’t regularly get entered into the visitor’s logs” and alleged that Obama meets “frequently” and “regularly” with Sebelius. 
As Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer noted on Fox News’s Hannity on Wednesday, though, GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.


The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was, though, “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”
According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”
As Breitbart News has reported, GAI “recorded listings as they were contained on the White House and Politico presidential calendars; other forms of communications, such as private emails or phone calls, are not able to be quantified.” They also examined public records on Politico’s White House schedule 

Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare
“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday.

In a piece he wrote for Politico on Thursday, Schweizer mentioned that “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” He also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors, and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”
On Fox & Friends on Friday, Schweizer emphasized that ignorance should never be an excuse for a leader. 
“If you’re an executive you need to know for sure–for darn sure–that the rollout is going to work and it’s going to go well,” Schweizer said. “And it’s really incumbent upon a president to contact the people that are involved in this initiative.”
That is not the case with Obama, Schweizer noted, particularly because Obama’s top advisers like Valerie Jarrett “don’t challenge” Obama’s weaknesses and “reinforce this notion that he is so brilliant.” 
Schweizer said presidents consult their top advisers in times of war and peace and that “there’s just simply no excuse for him to be this detached on this important piece of legislation which is reorienting one-sixth of the national economy.”

The United States Postal Service, along with the U. S. Government and the communist government of Cuba, resumed talks this week to negotiate USPS supplying direct mail service between the countries. The State Department hinted the move might help the failing government agency with its money problems.
The Associated Press reported Monday morning that a “U.S. Official” confirmed the United States is looking to resume the mail service which has been out of commission since 1963:

U.S. and Cuban diplomats and postal representatives will meet in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday for technical talks aimed at ending a 50-year suspension in direct mail between the United States and the communist island. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the matter publicly before Congress is notified. Lawmakers were to be notified of the meetings starting Monday morning, the official said.
The resumption in talks does not signify any change in the Obama administration’s Cuba policy, the official said, stressing that the discussions are taking place in the context of the Cuba Democracy Act of 1992 and are consistent with the U.S. interest “in promoting the free flow of information to, from and within Cuba.”

The State Department confirmed the talks will take place this week. “This is something we feel is good for us,” Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, “But it’s not meant to be a signal of anything or indicate a change in policy.”


When asked if the bankrupt Postal Service is in any position to provide these kind of services, Psaki said she “assumed” that “more revenue” would be generated because more stamps would be used.

USPS lost $16 Billion in 2012 and announced at the beginning of this year a change of services that are set to begin this summer.
Read the transcript from the State Department below:

QUESTION: All right. And then if there’s nothing else on North Korea, I just want to nail down the postal talks with Cuba.
MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.
QUESTION: Do you expect anything out of this round or is this really not – is this just – in other words, if these two days of talks are a success, there won’t be direct mail service immediately, I presume, but maybe I’m wrong, so could you —
MS. PSAKI: That’s a good question on the timeline. Just to give you a little bit of history here, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 states that, quote, “The United States Postal Service shall take such actions as are necessary to provide direct mail service to and from Cuba.” So this is – as you mentioned, on June 18th and 19th – well, you didn’t mention the dates, but so everybody knows, representatives from the Department of State and the United States Postal Service will meet with representatives from the Government of Cuba for a technical discussion on reestablishing direct transportation of mail. The reason we’re doing this is because it’s, of course, good for the Cuban people. This is something we feel is good for us. But it’s not meant to be a signal of anything or indicate a change in policy.
QUESTION: Syria?
QUESTION: Are those talks here or in —
MS. PSAKI: In terms of the exact location, I’m not sure if they’re at the Department of State or if they’re just somewhere else in the —
QUESTION: Could we go to Syria?
QUESTION: Well, can we —
MS. PSAKI: Well, let’s finish Cuba.
QUESTION: Are those talks exclusively on the mail service?
MS. PSAKI: That is with the United States Postal Service. That’s their purview.
QUESTION: But I’m saying is it mainly about the – is there anything going to come up about Mr. Gross?
MS. PSAKI: I don’t want to predict. There are issues that are, of course, raised on both sides. As you know, this is an issue that has been raised at the highest levels from the United States, but given these are talks with the Postal Service, I would expect that will be the focus.
QUESTION: You don’t consider that the highest level?
MS. PSAKI: Well – Brad, having fun on your last day? (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Just one more. I mean, is the U.S. Postal Service in any kind of position to make any kind of deals or agreements with Cuba? I mean, this is an organization that is essentially going broke, and I’m just curious. Is —
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think that’s combining two different things, in my opinion. This has been – we have had – I read off the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992.
QUESTION: Right.
MS. PSAKI: So they’re simply allowing mail to travel, which is – I would assume provides them with more revenue, with more stamps used.
QUESTION: Considering that – well, all right, exactly. So in other words, this could actually help the Postal Union’s budget if they are able to —
MS. PSAKI: I don’t want to go too far on it, but – I don’t want to go too far, Matt, but it’s more people using their services.
Jill.
QUESTION: Jen, a clarification on that too. What is the genesis of this? I mean, how did these talks actually come about? Who asked for them?
MS. PSAKI: Well, this is something that the U.S. has felt would be a positive step for the Cuban people. We felt it was in our interests. In terms of who specifically asked for it, I don’t have that level of detail, but it’s just something that we felt it was – it would be positive moving forward.
QUESTION: But basically, the U.S. asked for it?
MS. PSAKI: I would have to check on that for you, but it’s something, again, that we are very supportive of and we are, of course, helping direct here.
QUESTION: Isn’t it a continuation of the talks from 2009 that were on the same subject?
MS. PSAKI: Well, I don’t know if I’d call it a continuation because it’s been a number of years, but yes, it’s on the same subject, and we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to move things forward.

As President Obama has halted funding for White House tours and Blue Angels performances, citing the budget sequester, he and First Wife Michelle geared up Tuesday for a star-studded, soul music concert in the White House that featured such celebs as Justin Timberlake, Queen Latifah, and the Reverend Al Green.
Only a few days before the big gala concert, the Obama Administration claimed sequestration caused January’s anemic jobs numbers by cutting vital government services. However, the purportedly severe cutbacks of government spending didn’t stop the President from enjoying a night of stirring soul music during Tuesday’s program, titled In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul.
First Lady Michelle Obama kicked off the April 9 tribute to Soul with an hour-long, morning program held in the White House State Dining Room billed as a “guidance” on the night’s Memphis Soul performance. The event was held for students and music lovers and featured soul greats Sam Moore, Mavis Staples, Charlie Musselwhite, Ben Harper, and pop star Justin Timberlake as panel members taking questions from the audience.


Mrs. Obama opened the morning’s introductory program by discussing the importance of music in America today and urged the children in the audience to faithfully practice playing music.
“The only way for you to become the best musician you can be is to keep pushing through those moments when something doesn’t seem fun by spending hours in the practice room repeating those scales and drilling into that theory,” she said. “And if you do all that… you might become a better performer than you ever imagined.”
The First Lady went on to note that even if one doesn’t become a musician for a career choice, all that effort is still a worthy exercise.

“When I was young I played the piano, now as I try to remind my kids I regret the fact that I didn’t keep it up. I try to tell them that every single day,” she claimed.
The full concert was recorded later that evening and included performances by Alabama Shakes, William Bell, Steve Cropper, Al Green, Ben Harper, Queen Latifah, Cyndi Lauper, Joshua Ledet, Sam Moore, Charlie Musselwhite, Mavis Staples, and Justin Timberlake, with Booker T. Jones as music director and band leader.
During the night’s finale, the artists tried to get President Obama to join in the singing on stage, but the President rebuffed the offer.
Despite declining to sing, Barack and Michelle stayed on the stage during the finale, shaking hands, dancing, and clapping.
The concert was recorded for television, and In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul was broadcast Tuesday on PBS stations nationwide.

I have seen more powerful men than Barack Obama fall. I worked in South Africa during Thabo Mbeki’s presidency, when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) won 70% of the vote and earned the power to change his country’s constitution unilaterally. In 2005, I watched from the gallery as he told Parliament he was dismissing his deputy, Jacob Zuma, over allegations of corruption stemming from a lucrative arms deal.
Two years later, Mbeki was ousted by his party and forced to resign his presidency of the country. Zuma is now president, and the ruling party is both fractured by rivalries and weakened by the growing strength of the opposition Democratic Alliance. The growing current of dissent in South Africa is not, primarily, over principles or policies but over clashes over the spoils of power in a time of economic stagnation and turmoil.


President Obama holds unprecedented sway over his own party–and yet the first signs of internal tension are already bursting into the open. The news that he has turned his campaign into a permanent, non-profit organizing outfit to push for his policies has been greeted with frustration by members of the Democratic National Committee, who see the new “Organizing for Action” group as a competitor for fundraising dollars and power.

The Hill reports on the open dissatisfaction at the DNC: 

DNC members said they were caught off guard when the leaders of the president’s reelection team announced Obama for America was morphing into Organizing for Action (OFA), a nonprofit group that can take unlimited “soft money” donations….While the new group will seek to go toe to toe with GOP outside groups like Crossroads GPS, some Democrats aren’t pleased that Obama didn’t fold his powerful grassroots operation back into the DNC.

The looming fights over spending, deficits and debts also threatens the coalition that re-elected President Obama. The Obama administration designed a sequester whose non-defense cuts would scare as many voters and interest groups as possible. It expected that sequester to be canceled; now there is a strong chance that it may go through. If it does, interest groups and lobbies may find themselves fighting each other–and Obama.
Many of the president’s strongest backers were prepared to wait until the election was over to demand their money’s worth. Hollywood, for example, watched the defeat of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in frustration–and patiently waited for Obama to return to office. Now, having won its tax benefits in the fiscal cliff talks, it may revive SOPA again.
Yet it will have to compete with other interest groups in the Democrats’ coalition, who believe that the president was not aggressive enough in his first term and are no longer willing to accept the idea that compromise with Republicans is necessary. The rush to redeem promises made by Obama to each of these constituencies will likely increase friction within Democratic ranks–just as Republicans are pressing their case on debt.
That is why the most important opposition to Obama may come from within–some on matters of principle, such as the loose alliance of liberal and pro-Israel groups opposing Chuck Hagel’s nomination for Secretary of Defense; and others on pure self-interest. Republican opposition will still be critical, especially given the effective veto the House still holds. But it will likely be given a boost by Democrats’ own greed and impatience.

On Wednesday, the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee Jeff Sessions (R-AL) said he plans to vigorously oppose President Barack Obama’s Treasury Secretary nominee Jack Lew.
“Jack Lew must never be Secretary of Treasury,” said Mr. Sessions in a statement. “His testimony before the Senate Budget Committee less than two years ago was so outrageous and false that it alone disqualifies.”
On Feb. 13, 2011, Mr. Lew appeared on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley and said of Mr. Obama’s proposed budget:



Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we’re not adding to the debt anymore; we’re spending money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing down our national debt.

During Senate testimony, Mr. Sessions blasted Mr. Lew’s false statement and said he was “flatly in error”:

Lew, who is a former director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has at times displayed a striking level of ignorance over how the budgetary process operates.

During the Crowley interview, Mr. Lew said that the reason Mr. Obama has failed to pass a budget in the Senate is because such bills can be filibustered. But as anyone familiar with the process knows, budgets are considered “privileged,” meaning they do not require a filibuster-proof majority 60 votes and can instead be passed with a simple majority.

Mr. Lew repeated the elementary error to NBC’s David Gregory. “One of the things about the United States Senate that I think the American people don’t realize,” said Mr. Lew confidently, “is that it takes 60 votes, not 50, to pass something.”

One would think the former head of OMB–the nation’s top budget post–would know how the budget process works. But apparently Mr. Lew does not.

Now, Mr. Lew has been nominated to become Treasury Secretary of the United States in the worst economy since the Great Depression. That, says Mr. Sessions, cannot happen:

It’s time for a Secretary of Treasury to look the American people in the eye and lay out an economic plan for America that will end our debt path that has endangered our future and which will find support among the American people and the world’s financial community. Far from being a positive force towards this essential good, Mr. Lew has given priority to the political interests of the President, in whose White House inner circle he has now served for several years.
At this time of unprecedented slow growth, high unemployment, and huge deficits, we need a Secretary of Treasury that the American people, the Congress, and the world will know is up to the task of getting America on the path to prosperity not the path to decline. Jack Lew is not that man.

Questions have also emerged over a $950,000 bonus Mr. Lew received in 2009 in his role as chief operating officer of Citigroup’s Alternative Investments unit–a group that bet billions against homeowners paying their mortgages. Mr. Obama has previously railed against “obscene” Wall Street bonuses wherein “fat cats” get “awarded for their failure.” Still, Mr. Lew took the money.
In a letter to Mr. Lew, Sen. Chuck Grassley asked, “How is it in the public’s interest for you to receive a $1 million bonus on the eve of a massive $301 billion commitment to rescue Citigroup?”
Mr. Lew’s response: “My position at Citi was a management position. I was not an investment adviser. My compensation was in line with other management executives at the firm and in similarly complex operations.”
It is presently unknown whether Mr. Sessions plans to filibuster the Jack Lew nomination.

FALLS CHURCH, Virginia — While giving a speech endorsing Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s Virginia gubernatorial bid at a small concert and theater venue just outside Washington, D.C., former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took several veiled shots at President Barack Obama and the way her 2008 Democratic primary opponent has run Washington since being first elected five years ago. 
While Clinton never mentioned Obama by name, she used innuendo and some indirect references to try to separate herself from the president ahead of what is widely expected to be another run at the White House for her in 2016. 
“I thought hard about what I wanted to say to Virginians today,” Clinton opened her remarks by saying. “I’ve been out of politics for a few years now. I’ve had a chance to think a lot about what makes our country so great, what kind of leadership is required to keep it great.”


Later in the speech, Clinton noted her work as Secretary of State and said she has come across leaders worldwide who divide and leaders who unite, a reference to Obama’s aloof and divisive style of politics and leadership.
“I’ve spent four years traveling across the globe, a great honor and privilege to represent all of you,” she said. “I’ve learned even more about what it takes to make the decisions, what it takes to bring people together to build the kind of future that we all want for our children and grandchildren. I’ve seen leaders who are divisive. And I’ve seen leaders who are unifiers. I’ve seen leaders who are exclusive. And I’ve seen leaders who are inclusive.”
A few minutes later, Clinton got even more direct in her criticism of current leadership in Washington, D.C., presumably a reference to both how Republicans and Democrats have handled ongoing policy battles.

“Now recently in Washington, unfortunately, we’ve seen examples of the wrong kind of leadership,” Clinton said. “When politicians choose scorched earth over common ground, when they operate in what I call the ‘evidence-free zone’ with ideology trumping everything else. We’ve seen that families in Virginia and across the country have felt the consequences, workers furloughed, businesses suffering, children thrown out of Head Start, poor mothers worried they won’t get the help they need to buy formula and food for their babies, that is not the kind of leadership we need in Virginia and America today.”
Clinton then touted bipartisanship, something that has been Obama’s weakest trait since being elected–a fact that has been on display even more so in recent weeks during the government shutdown and debt ceiling debate.
“Virginia has a history of getting it right, of electing problem-solving governors like Mark Warner and Tim Kaine,” she said. “We know well that both Mark and Tim reached across the aisle, focused on getting answers to the questions that Virginians had. That is the kind of leader Terry is. That is the kind of governor he will be.” 
“For example, when Gov. McDonnell worked with the legislature to make historic investments in transportation that are vital to Virginia’s future, Terry supported him and the legislature every step of the way,” she explained. “Some might say: ‘Why would he do that? It’s a Republican governor and a Republican legislature.’ Well, there’s a simple answer: It was the right thing to do.”
Clinton also took a shot at people who are corrupted by ideology, by special interests, or both–another sideswipe at Obama. Much of the liberal base of the Democratic Party is upset that Obama has not been stricter with Wall Street and is similarly upset that he seems more consumed with ideology than with solving problems.
“If it’s only about yourself, if it’s only about you wanting to get a job and get the perks that go with it and, you know, have people stand up when you come into a room, that’s not enough anymore because it’s hard,” Clinton said. “Politics is hard, as the lieutenant governor and attorney general candidates know, because people are weary.” 
“They’re wondering ‘Could I give this person my vote and will he then remember me? If I vote for him or her, will they do what I heard them say they will do? Will they get diverted by big money or ideology or power will they remember who put them into office?'” she continued. “I can tell you, you don’t have to worry about that with Terry McAuliffe.”

Gallup reports that President Obama’s approval rating slipped again in the 2nd Quarter, falling to 47.9%. The dip was the second quarterly drop in a row. At the end of last year, on the heels of his reelection, Obama’s approval rating stood at 51.9%. His approval rating is near the bottom of second-term Presidents at this point in their tenure. 
Both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton had significantly higher approval ratings at this point in their Presidencies. Reagan enjoyed a 58.7% approval rating, while Clinton’s approval was slightly lower, 56.3%. Gallup notes that Obama’s poll numbers more closely resemble George W. Bush and Harry Truman. Truman’s approval rating was 48.7%. Bush’s was slightly lower than Obama’s at 47.3%.
Over the next three months, the 19th Quarter in office, every modern President has seen a decline in their approval ratings, with the exceptions of Reagan and Clinton. Both Presidents were presiding over a strong and growing economy. Obama will be presiding, at best, over a weak and stagnant economy. 


Obama faces particular challenges over the next three months, however. This Fall, Washington will be consumed with another fight over raising the nation’s debt ceiling and passing a budget. The last time Obama and Congress fought over the debt ceiling, his approval ratings fell to the lowest of his time in office, 41%. 

Also, in October a major piece of his ObamaCare law is scheduled to go into effect, the federal and state health insurance exchanges. As with any major government undertaking, there are likely going to be problems with the implementation. Massive problems, however, which are not unlikely, could further erode Obama’s approval. 
Obama’s challenge is that he is in a weak position to absorb those threats to his approval. Just a drop of a few points would put his approval in the low 40s. That is a weak position heading into an important election year, when the Democrats are at serious risk of losing control of the Senate. 
Senate Democrats would likely continue to chart their own course, moving themselves away from Obama and the White House. The success or failure of Obama’s second term may be decided this Fall.

Last November, President Obama won a narrow reelection and the Democrats in the Senate added two seats to their caucus. A few high-profile Republicans lost their races. The outcome has prompted the usual round of hand-wringing from the media, pundits and national GOP Leaders about the future of the party. A deeper look at the election results, however, paints a more complicated picture. Democrats may want to conduct their own hand-wringing about the future of their party. 
Although it lost the Presidency, the Republicans picked up a large number of victories in November. They gained a Governorship and solidified their gains from 2010 in the House and in the states. The GOP now has 30 Governors, a record in modern political history. They control all levers of state government in 25 states. One would have to go back to the 1920s to find the GOP so ascendant in the states. The Democrats have complete control in just 12 states, an historic low. (The rest of the states have split control.) 
GOP strength in the states isn’t confined just to the South or the Plains. They control the Governor and Legislature in industrial heartland states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, as well. While Governor’s races in these states will always be competitive, redistricting should ensure that the GOP will dominate the legislatures in these states for the next decade. 


This isn’t just a numbers game. The polarization in the states gives each party an opportunity to enact large parts of their respective agendas. Republicans in several states are embracing this chance. Several states are looking at comprehensive overhauls of their tax codes. Republicans are looking at reforms throughout state government, from the budget, education and business regulation. 

Democrats, meanwhile, made strong gains in the states where they hold control. The party won a supermajority in the California and Illinois legislatures, for example. Progressives in these states will feel emboldened to pursue their agenda of higher taxes on the wealthy and business, and increased social spending. In many places, they will pursue stricter gun control and new environmental regulations. 
The public is about to benefit from a real-time experiment in whose policies are better suited to encourage economic growth. The likely Democrat lurch to the left in several states could tarnish the party’s brand in large parts of the country. Successful Republican governance in the states, by contrast, could repair some of the damage done to the GOP’s brand in national politics. 
The national GOP does face challenges. National party leaders are engaged in an existential crisis over the right amount of “conservative” or “moderate” positions. They seem largely disengaged from the party’s base supporters and activists. 
That said, Democrats are on a path to disengage them from large segments of the public. Combining this with the national Dem push to raise taxes and enact gun control, among other issues, will make it difficult for Democrats to remain competitive in large parts of the country. This will create an enormous opportunity for the national GOP to fix its brand. 
It shouldn’t look to machinations on Capitol Hill for salvation. It should look to the states.

A Republican in California won a state Senate seat on Wednesday in a District in which Democrats have a 22-point advantage and that is 60% Hispanic.
Andy Vidak, the Republican farmer, won the special election runoff for the 16th District Senate seat when his opponent, Democrat Leticia Perez, a Kern County Supervisor, conceded on Wednesday, a day after voters cast their ballots. Vidak had 54% of the vote to Perez’s 46%.
Perez had initially conceded two months ago when the special election was held. But a recount put Vidak under the 50% threshold that was needed to avoid a runoff, and Perez took back her concession nearly a week after the initial election. The seat became vacant when the Democrat, who won the seat in 2010 by 21 points, resigned to work for Chevron. Democrats thought, especially with a Hispanic female candidate, the seat would be a shoo-in for them. The veto-proof supermajority Democrats have in the state Senate is now imperiled with Vidak’s victory.


As Breitbart News had previously reported, though, “Vidak, a working class candidate, resonated with working class Hispanics in the district who also saw how coastal California elites were not putting their bread-and-butter interests first.”

Vidak ran broadly on “the bifurcation of California: the coastal liberal elites versus the Valley folks.” On a more local level, Vidak’s theme of “fish versus farmer” resonated with Democrats in a District where the unemployment rate is 15% and as high as 30% in some communities in the District. Vidak reminded voters that liberal environmentalists, in order to protect fish, only allowed farmers to receive 20% of their water allocation, crippling the region’s economy. He also stressed that Perez supported the the state’s high-speed rail project that would have razed business, farms, and homes in the District. Because she supported the agenda of coastal elites and Democrat interest groups, Perez was able to raise twice as much money as Vidak, but 16th District voters ultimately rejected her liberal policies. 
It is often said that California is a harbinger of things to come for the country. For Republicans looking at California, there has not been much of hope of late, but Vidak’s victory could be a sign that areas that have traditionally voted for Democrats may give the right kind of Republican a chance as they see unemployment rates increase and opportunities for upward mobility decrease in their communities.

Recent polling shows that an election wave of anti-ObamaCare sentiment is growing, and it is not only likely to hand the GOP control of the United States Senate, but might wipe out as many as 12 Democrat seats–many of which looked safe just a few months ago. 
Back in July, Five Thirty Eight’s election guru Nate Silver believed that control of the Senate was a tossup. That has all changed now that voters got their first real look at the brutal consequences of ObamaCare.


Starting with the generic ballot that simply pits Republican lawmakers against their Democrat counterparts, the movement towards the GOP has been striking. In the Real Clear Politics average of these polls, going back as far as the beginning of the year, Democrats have consistently led by 3 to 4 points. During the government shutdown, Democrats leaped to 6 and 7 point leads. Since the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare, though, Republicans are not only in the lead by 2.5 points; they have led in every poll but one since November 10. 
This generic polling is reflected in the available polling of individual Senate seats. 
Keep in mind that in order to win control of the Senate, Republicans need only pick up six seats, and with Democrat incumbents retiring in the redder than red states of South Dakota, West Virginia, and Montana, Republicans pretty much have three Senate pick-ups in the bag. But thanks to ObamaCare and vulnerable Democrat Senators refusing to put their own promises and the wellbeing of their constituents above slavish devotion to Obama, picking off another three should be fairly easy. 

 
Kay Hagan (D-NC)
In North Carolina, Democrat Kay Hagan looked as though she was cruising to a second term victory. Just a few months ago, polls showed her ahead by double digits against her most likely Republican challengers. 
In September, before ObamaCare started cancelling people’s policies by the millions and boosting the price of their premiums, Hagan was beating potential challenger Greg Bannon by a whopping 16 points. In the most recent poll taken just a couple weeks ago, Bannon picked up an astonishing 17 points and is now ahead by 1. 
All of Hagan’s most likely Republican challengers made similar gains. 

There is a YouTube video of Hagan promising that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance if you like it. Obviously that is not true, which means she either lied or blindly voted for something without understanding the consequences for her constituents.
 

Mary Landrieu (D-LA)
Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu has seen her approval rating collapse by double digits in just six months. Three months ago, Landrieu looked as though she would coast to a fourth term in a state Mitt Romney won without breaking a sweat. The National Journal now lists Landrieu as the third most endangered incumbent facing re-election in 2014. 
In August, Landrieu was polling over 50% in potential match ups (which would avoid a Louisiana runoff that requires the eventual winner hit at least 50%) and beating Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy, her most likely opponent, by a full 10 points. The consequences of ObamaCare have completely flipped that script. 

A recent poll shows the relatively unknown Cassidy behind by only 2 points
There is YouTube video of Landrieu promising her constituents that under ObamaCare, you can keep your insurance. The facts have either proved Landrieu a liar or incompetent. Other than token legislation to keep that promise, Landrieu has been as devoted to Obama and ObamaCare as any liberal Democrat. 
 
Mark Pryor (D-AR)
Thanks to ObamaCare, Senator Mark Pryor’s approval ratings in Arkansas have collapsed to just 33%, the lowest of his 12 years in the Senate. When Democrat Arkansas incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln lost her seat in 2010, her approval ratings were actually higher. The National Journal ranks Pryor as the most vulnerable Senate incumbent facing reelection in 2014. 
Pryor is also on record misleading his constituents about ObamaCare. 
 
Mark Begich (D-AK)
Just before the disastrous ObamaCare rollout, Alaskan Senator Mark Begich was cruising to reelection by as much as 11 points. Post-ObamaCare polls show that Begich has been considerably weakened and is ahead by only a point or two against his likely Republican challengers. Moreover, Begich’s approval rating among Alaskans now sits at a measly 39%. 
Begich is on record misleading his constituents with false assurances that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance. The GOP is already pounding him over that. 
Other than token proposals, Begich has done absolutely nothing to either keep that promise or to mitigate the damage ObamaCare is doing to Alaskans. 
The National Journal lists Begich as the second most vulnerable incumbent in the Senate. 
 
Iowa – Open Democrat Seat
With longtime Democrat Tom Harkin retiring from the Senate, Democrats thought they had made this seat safe with the recruitment of Rep. Bruce Braley. Until the American people were rattled by the consequences of ObamaCare, Democrats were probably right. In matchup after matchup, Braley was ahead by double digits. 
Post-ObamaCare, that lead has shrunk to single digits. 
 
Mark Udall (D-CO)
Prior to the ObamaCare rollout, Udall wasn’t even on the National Journal‘s list of endangered incumbents. Millions of insurance cancellations later, however, and the Democrat has a real fight on his hands. In one likely match up, Udall’s 15 point lead back in June has dropped to just 3 points. 
—

Since the ObamaCare fallout, the National Journal has added Al Franken (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) to its 2014 endangered list. Prior to the country being hit upside the head with the reality of ObamaCare, the idea that any one of these incumbents had anything to worry about was unthinkable. 
Shaheen is vulnerable enough that former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown is considering a challenge. Polls show her under 50% at 48% and Brown only behind by 4%. He hasn’t even made it official and is already within the margin of error. And if he runs, it will be on the issue of ObamaCare. 
Many believe that the worst of ObamaCare has yet to show itself. As the 2014 midterm elections loom closer late next year, so will the employer mandate. The Obama Administration itself has predicted that the fallout from the employer mandate could be tens of millions of cancellations. 
Knowing this is coming, and unless something changes, these vulnerable Democrats are likely to be remembered only as having done nothing to avoid catastrophes mainly afflicting the working and middle class. 
That is, other than hold hands with Obama to watch it all burn.

In a New York Times interview published Saturday, President Obama came out foursquare against the Keystone XL pipeline, claiming that it would not create jobs. “Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator,” Obama said. “There is no evidence that that’s true.” He then blamed Canada for not “doing more” to prevent carbon emissions from oil sands. Obama continued, “I meant what I said; I’m going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release.” 

Obama also blasted reports that job creation would be significant: “”[M]y hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline – which might take a year or two – and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in a economy of 150 million working people.” He stated that gas prices would go up in parts of the United States thanks to Keystone XL: “So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they can’t ship some of that oil to world markets.”


On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told Fox News Sunday that Keystone’s failure to move forward was somehow Republicans’ fault: “There were some political games that were played, that took it off the trail and path to completion, where Republicans put it out there as something that was put on a timetable that it could not be resolved. It caused a delay. Playing political games with something like this was a mistake.”

The headline reads, “McAuliffe avoids position on EPA rules, Cuccinelli dodges on House spending vote,” because just like Virginia’s Democrat gubernatorial nominee, Terry McAuliffe, the left-wing Washington Post wants to have it both ways. In an article published Friday, the Post tries to mitigate the damage President Obama’s new strict carbon emission limits will have on the McAuliffe campaign by also putting a pox on Republican nominee Cuccinelli’s house over, bizarrely, DC’s ongoing budget battles. 
But as hard as the Post might try, there is just no comparing the latest round of federal budget battles to the effect Obama’s war on coal will have on Virginia and working class Virginians.


At the bottom of its article, the Post is eventually forced to admit that the Cuccinnelli campaign — if not the man himself — actually did comment on the possibility of a government shutdown:
“It’s pretty rich that in the same week it was revealed that Terry McAuliffe wants to shut down Virginia’s government, he’s now focused on whether the federal government is going to do the same,” Cullen said, referring to remarks by McAuliffe that he would not sign a budget as governor if it did not include funds for expanding Medicaid. “No one wants to see the federal government shut down, period. Ken Cuccinelli is not running for Congress, he’s running for governor. . . . Ken Cuccinelli would more than welcome a debate with Terry McAuliffe on the issue of Obamacare.”
Fast Terry, however, has yet to stand up for the state’s southwest coal country, and who knows how many middle class jobs. Instead of staking a position one way or another, the McAuliffe campaign punted with a statement that tries to please everyone and promises to take a position sometime in the future:

Terry agrees with the broad swath of scientists, economists, and military leaders, who view climate change as a looming problem for Virginia,” campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote in an e-mail. “While he agrees that there needs to be some limit on carbon pollution and believes that Virginia can and should lead the way in building new plants that create low-cost, low-carbon energy, he looks forward to further reviewing the President’s proposed rules in detail and studying their impact on Virginia’s economy.”
Cuccinnelli was quick to jump on the Obama administration:
“The administration renewed its war on coal today,” Cuccinelli said, adding — as he often does — that “a war on coal is a war on the poor” and that Virginia “needs a governor who’ll fight for those folks” who depend on the coal industry.
It is doubtful Virginia voters will care one or another if a potential governor chooses to focus on his state as opposed to the latest drama unfurling in the nation’s capitol. These new carbon emission controls, however, directly affect the state and thousands of Virginia jobs. 
Instead of choosing a position, McAuliffe is likely hoping to dither through the last five weeks left in the campaign. And as we have already seen, the Washington Post will be right there to hold his hand.

1636	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/05/Obama-s-Cash-For-Clunkers-Unleashed-Environmental-Nightmare	Opinion	1	Environment	Economy	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"


In a classic tale illustrating the “law of unintended consequences,” a new report concludes that President Barack Obama’s $3 billion “Cash for Clunkers” taxpayer-funded boondoggle artificially drove car prices up, not down, and unleashed an “environmental nightmare” through shredding, not recycling, many of the 690,000 cars people traded in for an up to $4,500 car credit.
In 2009, Mr. Obama proudly declared that his Cash for Clunkers program, officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), was a stunning success.  “There were skeptics who weren’t sure that this ‘Cash for Clunkers’ program would work,” said Mr. Obama. “But I’m happy to report that it has succeeded well beyond our expectations and all expectations, and we’re already seeing a dramatic increase in showroom traffic at local car dealers…So I’m very pleased with the progress that’s been made in the House today on the “Cash for Clunkers” program.” 


But as Yahoo News notes, the program’s decision to shred, not recycle, many of the trade-in vehicles unleashed an “environmental nightmare”: 


Shredding vehicles results in its own environmental nightmare. For each ton of metal produced by a shredding facility, roughly 500 pounds of “shredding residue” is also produced, which includes polyurethane foams, metal oxides, glass and dirt. All totaled, about 4.5 million tons of that residue is already produced on average every year. Where does it go? Right into a landfill.
E Magazine states recycling just the plastic and metal alone from the CARS scraps would have saved 24 million barrels of oil. While some of the “Clunkers” were truly old, many of the almost 700,000 cars were still in perfectly good condition. In fact, many that qualified for the program were relatively “young,” with fuel efficiencies that rivaled newer cars.

A study conducted by Resources for the Future further underscored the program’s failure economically and environmentally:

Approximately 45 percent of the spending went to consumers who would have purchased a new vehicle anyway. Our results suggest no gain in sales beyond 2009 and hence no meaningful stimulus to the economy. In addition, the program will reduce CO2 emissions by only 9 to 28.4 million tons, implying a cost per ton ranging from $91 to $288 even after accounting for reduced criteria pollutants.   

And E–The Environmental Magazine says the Department of Transportation’s declaration that Cash for Clunkers was a success is simply a case of smoke and mirrors:

The Department of Transportation reported that Cash for Clunkers was an environmental success…In general, drivers traded in inefficient SUVs and trucks for more efficient passenger cars. However, it’s quite easy to negate this small difference in gas mileage purely by the fact that people will be more likely to drive a vehicle that takes less money to fill up with gas. It’s an efficiency paradox: as we get more efficient at using energy, the overall cost of energy goes down, but we respond by using more of it. Auto emissions of carbon dioxide are directly proportional to gasoline consumed. With only 690,000 fuel-efficient vehicles purchased and over 250 million cars registered in the U.S., that is a negligible difference in overall greenhouse gas emissions.

As the Washington Post even conceded, Mr. Obama’s Cash for Clunkers scheme was an economic and environmental failure: “So were the naysayers right?” asked the Post.  “It seems so.”

President Barack Obama will deliver a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday afternoon in which he will call for new regulations aimed at restricting carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, not just new ones. Previously, Obama had aimed regulations at new coal plants. Shares of U.S. coal stocks plummeted ahead of the speech, though the Washington Post suggested global market turmoil played a role.
The Obama administration has been uniquely hostile to coal and other fossil fuels, despite the fact that the rapid expansion of natural gas development through “fracking” and oil production from shale deposits has driven much of the growth that the U.S. economy has mustered during his presidency. Permits for oil and gas exploration and development on federal land have slowed; offshore oil and gas activity has been blocked, especially after the Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010, even in defiance of the courts; and the Environmental Protection Agency has pushed new emissions rules despite Congress’s refusal to pass a cap-and-trade bill.


Obama has long singled out coal in particular. In January 2008, as he sought to outflank rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the left, then-Sen. Obama promised to “bankrupt” new coal plants. His administration issued heavy-handed new regulations on coal, forcing many plants out of production. And his left-wing supporters in Hollywood have cheered him on, encouraging him to bypass Congress, far from the job losses that will occur. Politicians of both parties in coal-producing state have protested, to little avail.

Earlier this week, seven governors wrote to the president to urge him to stop new EPA regulations on the new source performance standard (NSPS) for new coal power plants, arguing that they would cause plants to be shuttered, and pointing out the industry’s own progress on reducing emissions. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) was one of the seven, and wrote to the president: “It is imperative that abundant natural resources such as coal continue to be available to meet our base load electricity needs. I am convinced that we can achieve this goal, while lowering emissions. Significant technological advancements in generating plant efficiency and emission capture and reduction are within reach, but need regulatory flexibility that does not discriminate against our own home-grown energy resources if they are to be achieved.”
Nevertheless, Obama is expected to announce an expansion of regulations. The New York Times reported last week that the president would seek to apply regulations to existing coal plants as well as new ones. 
In his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany last week, President Obama warned of the need to take action against “coastlines that vanish, oceans that rise”–an echo of his much-lampooned 2008 speech in Minneapolis upon winning the Democratic nomination, in which he said that he was “absolutely certain” that future generations would remember his nomination and anticipated victory as the moment that “when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.”
For Obama and his most radical supporters, that moment was much delayed–perhaps, until today.

As our national debt continues to soar, taxes to rise, and the overall economy to tank, President Obama is talking about…gun control.
He is doing this so he can seize on the emotions of those who operate emotionally rather than rationally, thereby diverting their attention from the real crisis our nation faces right now — which is financial in nature. 


We are still headed toward the fiscal cliff we narrowly missed days ago: our rendezvous with it was only pushed back a few months. Yet the focus coming out of the White House is on ending gun shows, making 30 round magazines harder to get, and adding a greater psychological component to background checks. 

Never mind that these things will neither stop or even delay another Sandy Hook from happening — they are not meant to. Rather, they are meant to take our eyes off the ball and redirect all emotion to a red herring so that the real fight–a fight to rein in spending, cut taxes, reduce our debt, and stabilize our economy–is not even talked about.
Moreover. Senators like Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) are right in line with Obama, pushing the wildest gun control schemes imaginable as a way to stir up even more emotion in the form of protest, thereby keeping our eye off the ball to an even greater extent.
Am I saying we accept gun control? NO, NO, NO, and even hell no — Our motto remains, “From my cold dead hands.”  But what I am saying is we can’t fight gun control in a way that allows Obama to play us. 
He and the Dems will always take more gun control if they can get it, but right now, as much as anything, they’re also happy with the diversionary benefits they get from focusing on guns while the economy slides ever closer to the brink.

In a poll released Tuesday, one day after President Obama slammed Republicans for what he dishonestly described as a “government shutdown,” Rasmussen has found that when it comes to cutting health care costs, a majority of 51% favor “having a partial government shutdown until Democrats and Republicans agree on what spending for the health care law to cut.”
An even higher number of 53% favor a partial government shutdown until “Democrats and Republicans can agree on what [general] spending to cut.” Only 37% oppose. 
For obvious reasons, the media refuse to make clear that it is not the GOP proposing any kind of government shutdown, partial or otherwise. The GOP’s plan is to kill the ObamaCare debacle with a bill that funds everything but the president’s job-killing health care plan. It is up to the president and Democrat-led Senate, then, to decide if this wildly unpopular drag on our economy is worth shutting down the government. 


Both the media and the president are eager for this showdown; both relish the idea of replaying the 1990s when the media and the Clinton White House worked together to bludgeon then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich over a similar gambit. 

This poll, though, shows that this tactic might not work as well this time. Just for starters, people are much more concerned about the deficit today than they were in the mid-nineties; and there was no boondoggle like ObamaCare hanging out there as a prize in a shutdown showdown. 
Make no mistake, the media will ignore this poll. The results do not fit the media’s pro-ObamaCare Narrative, and only interferes with the reality they are attempting to manufacture that says a shutdown can only mean disaster for the GOP.
But to those interested in reality, this poll should be food for thought.

Our Johnny-on-the-spot media elite are all over the devilish details of ObamaCare this week. The three-year anniversary of the signing of the bloated government grab is tomorrow, and what better time to point out its massive failures and punitive complications than after it is too late to do anything about it? 
In the media’s defense, some of the failures being reported on now weren’t apparent in 2009 and 2010, but that’s not my complaint. My complaint — and what should be America’s complaint — is where was this kind of scrutiny and reporting when this terrible bill was being gamed through the all-Democrat federal government? 
As we all know, skeptical, forward-looking media analysis of ObamaCare was pretty much non-existent back then. We also know that those who did read the bill and report on its real and potential horrors (through New Media and in Townhall meetings) were demonized by the media. 


Rather than report on the devilish details or laugh Democrats out of office for submitting fraudulent ObamaCare budgets to the CBO so the monstrosity could be called “deficit neutral,” the media instead played State Pipe Organ and focused on all the “goodies.” 
In the meantime, out here in the real world and contrary to all those cotton candy promises the media assured us would come true, insurers facing all kinds of restrictions and a glut of sick people have boosted our health care premiums, and companies everywhere are cutting back employee work hours to avoid being forced to provide insurance. Moreover, contrary to Obama’s biggest promise, people are losing their insurance because companies would prefer to pay the fine than for the Cadillac plans ObamaCare demands. 
And how can one even begin to count the number of individual ObamaCare horror stories that dribble out almost daily, not from the ObamaMedia, naturally — but from conservative media sites like Drudge? We’re about to face a terrifying shortage of physicians and heaven only knows what this means.  

But if you believe in the philosophy of better-late-than-never, Politico actually summoned a little moral courage Friday morning. One of its morning leads takes a fairly in-depth look at how the bill remains unpopular and the massive uphill battle the government faces (money and tech) to get the ObamaCare pieces in place by October, when people are supposed to start signing up. (ObamaCare’s insurance exchanges and most punishing mandates hit early next year.)
Here’s Wednesday’s Wonk Blog at the Washington Post:
Last week I posted a copy of the draft application for Obamacare benefits, which clocks in at a hefty 21 pages. 
Consumer advocates and Wonkblog commenters had similar questions: Why on earth would the federal government create such a complex form to obtain a public benefit? 
You don’t have to spend much time with the chart to get that, it’s really not simple at all.

And Wednesday’s New York Times:
‘Our revenues are about $8 million, but the food business is a low-margin industry so cutting $108,000 out of our profits, which are just over $200,000, is a big deal,’ said Ms. Shein, who is the chief executive. They are evaluating different ways to comply with the new law and finance the expense.

You get my point. But if you don’t, Sean Hannity has a terrific round-up here. 
Over at Investors Business Daily, they’ve come up with “10 Disturbing Facts Americans Have Learned” about ObamaCare over the last three years. 
A better title might have been “10 Disturbing Facts About ObamaCare the Media Are Still Covering Up.” 

Regardless, “disturbing” is a kind word when you’re talking about skyrocketing premium costs, losing your employer-based insurance, having your hours cut back, and nearly a trillion in new tax hikes that will hit the middle class. 
The damage Obama, Democrats, the media, and the Supreme Court have done to this country is impossible to wrap your mind around. How did so many become so corrupted that they gleefully aided and abetted the likely destruction of our most vital and successful institution: the imperfect but still amazing American health care system? 
And God help us; it is just getting started.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will agree to expand the state’s Medicaid program under Obamacare on Tuesday.
According to the Newark, NJ-based Star-Ledger, Christie will announce the expansion when he unveils the governor’s new budget in a 3 p.m. speech to a joint session of New Jersey’s Legislature on Tuesday. 


Christie joins Florida’s Rick Scott and Virginia’s Bob McDonnell as two Republican governors who have completely reversed course on the issue after rejecting addition Medicaid funds.
As recently as last summer, Christie had suggested that he would refuse the Medicaid expansion. As he told Fox & Friends in July: “Medicaid is pretty well expanded in our state already because of the legacy of previous Democratic governors. So, I don’t think there’s a lot for us to do in New Jersey in that regard.”
Likewise, McDonnell had said in July: “Expanding Medicaid without fixing Medicaid is a terrible idea.” 

Christie and McDonnell were both elected in 2009 in the first wave of Tea Party-supported Republican campaigns. McDonnell is leaving office after this year; Christie is widely favored to win re-election.
State Sen. Joe Vitale, a Democrat who is chairman of the New Jersey Senate committee that deals with health care, told the Associated Press that he “had been briefed” on Christie’s decision. Health advocacy groups also said they were told by Christie’s staff of the decision that will cover 300,000 uninsured people in New Jersey. 
The Supreme Court, in its Obamacare ruling last year, made Medicaid expansion, which was mandatory in the Obamacare law, optional for the states. However, the federal government attempted to encourage the states to participate by offering to pay 100% of the cost for the first three years, and 90% of the costs thereafter, provided Medicaid eligibility is expanded to include those living within 133% of the poverty line. 
In essence, states that accept the federal government’s deal will have the short-term costs subsidized by federal taxpayers. The Star-Ledger notes that New Jersey is expected to receive “$1.7 billion a year” to cover the initial costs. A recent Government Accountability Office report predicted that Obamacare would add $6.2 trillion to the long-term federal deficit.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 22 states, including the District of Columbia, have now agreed to the Medicaid expansion. Seven of those states are governed by Republicans. 
Though once a conservative hero for his tough stances on the state budget and his willingness to confront New Jersey’s public sector unions, Christie has fallen from grace. In late October, he offered effusive praise for President Barack Obama’s handling of Hurricane Sandy, though all Obama had done was visit the area briefly. Many residents are still struggling to rebuild, and face numerous obstacles, including the federal bureaucracy.

Before the dust settled on the news that the Obama Administration was delaying the intrusive employer mandate until 2015, a new 606-page regulation was issued on Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services stating it would now rely on self-reported income and employment verification in the state-run exchanges under ObamaCare. In other words, a welcome mat for fraud.
This is another startling development which is becoming part of a larger theme as ObamaCare is rolled out to the public. It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is unworkable. For those like myself who opposed it from the start, we saw the writing on the wall early on as President Obama’s signature health care legislation was rammed through the halls of Congress. If only then-Speaker Pelosi had insisted that her party read the legislation before passing it, maybe some of this would have come to light earlier on. While the eventual passage of the legislation was certain under Democrat control of Congress, maybe some Democrats now sounding the alarm about the devastating impact of the legislation would have done so sooner if they had read it while it was still a bill, not only after it became law.


As of now, ObamaCare is $1 trillion over budget; I say “as of now” because it’s almost certain that with the elimination of the anti-fraud measures the cost will further skyrocket, and there are examples to back up this theory.

In January, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services began an effort to remove ineligible people from the state’s Medicaid rolls. The initial audit concluded that of the first 20,500 recipients screened, it was recommended 13,709 be removed from eligibility. The Chicago Tribune reports that “since 2000, Illinois Medicaid rolls have doubled, from fewer than 1.4 million people to nearly 2.8 million, or more than 1 in 5 Illinoisans.” In part because of the rising Medicaid rolls, the state’s backlog of unpaid bills is expected to grow to $21 billion by fiscal year 2018.
States are fascinating laboratories of democracy that can provide brilliant blueprints for other states and the federal government to follow. However, states can also serve as flashing red lights when plans go wrong. Illinois is a great example of how a lack of anti-fraud measures can drain a state’s coffers. As President Obama’s home state, he would be wise to take notice.
President Reagan famously said “trust but verify.” In light of the notion that the U.S. health care system makes up one-eighth of the economy, it’s my hope that this administration will grasp hold of this sensible advice.

On Monday, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin urged Americans to light up Capitol Hill switchboards to urge senators to live up to their campaign promises and support Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) in their effort to defund Obamacare. 
“Remember, we elected these senators precisely for moments like this. If they can’t do anything with the power we’ve given them through their elected office, then perhaps it’s time for them to retire and let someone else have a go,” Palin said. “Opposition to Obamacare carried us to victory in 2010. And 2014 is just around the corner.”


On Saturday, Palin wrote an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News backing Lee and Cruz. In her Facebook post on Monday, the day the Obamacare fight started in the Senate, Palin said it was even more important for Americans living in red states–like Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina–represented by Democrats to “politely” let their senators know there will be consequences at the ballot box if they vote procedurally to shut down debate in the Senate: 


Please call your senators and politely ask them to stand with Senator Cruz. This is especially important if your senator is a Democrat up for re-election in a red state in 2014. That would be Senators Mark Begich (D-AK), Mark Pryor (D-AR), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), and Kay Hagan (D-NC). Remind them politely that we are watching their votes very carefully and even a procedural vote that shuts down this debate will be regarded as a vote for Obamacare, and there will be consequences for them at the ballot box next year. The same goes for Republicans up for re-election. We definitely expect them to stand shoulder to shoulder with Senator Cruz through thick and thin.

The House passed a short-term resolution to fund the government except for Obamacare on Friday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is attempting to insert an amendment to that bill that funds Obamacare before sending the bill back to the House. On Monday, Cruz asked that there be a 60-vote threshold for amendments on the House bill being taken up in the Senate. 
Palin reiterated, “We shouldn’t preemptively surrender the fight to those who rammed through this outrageously burdensome and unaffordable ploy for government control of health care even though some are trying to convince us that the fight is futile.”
“Just because a fight isn’t easy, doesn’t mean it’s not worth fighting,” she said.
Palin then included information about where Americans could find the contact information for their senators: 

The number for the Capitol Hill Switchboard is 202-224-3121. Ask for your senator’s office. You can also find their contact information and contact them online at

Wednesday night, House Leadership withdrew legislation to fund the government through December in response to growing conservative criticism that the measure didn’t strip funding for ObamaCare. Congress must pass legislation to authorize continued government spending before September 30, or the government will shut down. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had unveiled a plan that would split the ObamaCare funding from the underlying government spending, but conservatives balked at the plan. Any action on spending now has been pushed to next week.  
Conservatives, led by Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, have argued that any measure to extend government spending authority should also include language to defund ObamaCare. On October 1, the health care exchanges authorized by ObamaCare, where individuals can presumably shop for health insurance, are set to open. On January 1, all Americans are mandated to have health insurance. On that date, as well, large subsidies and tax credits to supplement those insurance premiums will begin. Unless the law is uprooted now, it will likely remain. 
Cantor’s plan envisioned the House passing a “clean” resolution to continue government spending, one which absorbed the sequester cuts. It also would include a separate resolution that defunded all aspects of ObamaCare. Under Cantor’s plan, the Senate would receive the “clean” resolution until it had voted on funding ObamaCare. The Senate would have to definitively vote on funding ObamaCare before it could vote to keep the government open. 


Conservatives rebelled, arguing that the split resolutions offered nothing more than a symbolic vote against ObamaCare and removed all leverage against the unpopular law. Democrats in control of the Senate could vote down the ObamaCare defunding and then quickly authorize legislation to keep the government functioning. 

The issue is, however, far more complicated. Funding ObamaCare requires about $13 billion in annual appropriations that is subject to Congressional authorization. More than $70 billion a year, however, is funded by mandatory spending that isn’t subject to Congressional authorization. In other words, Congress could eliminate all spending for ObamaCare, but 70% of the program would march on. 
That said, everything in life is done on the margins. Eliminating just a fraction of the overall spending on ObamaCare could upend the whole program. That is the hope of conservatives. And that hope cause GOP Leadership to blink.

If health insurance prices triple, do we still have to call Obamacare the “Affordable Care Act”? 
A report released yesterday by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce reveals the devastating reality many Americans will face when Obamacare is in full force next year. While the majority of Americans will likely see their healthcare premiums increase, no one will swallow the cost burden more than young Americans.


Previous studies have reported that youth healthcare premiums could increase as much as 45 percent, but the the House Committee report concluded that young Americans could see an increase as much as 203 percent.
“Recent college graduates with entry-level jobs who are struggling to pay off student loan debt could see their premiums increase on average between 145 and 189 percent,” the report said. “Some studies estimate young adults could experience premium increases as high as 203 percent. Any increase, let alone tripling current costs, could break the bank for young adults who have just started out on their own.”
The current average payment for health care premiums among young Americans is $648, but will increase to $1,872 under the Obamacare legislation. The graph below breaks down the average increases in healthcare premiums for young Americans in major cities:

 
According to the report, young Americans are disproportionately affected by Obamacare for three reasons:

Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating: In other words, price controls. Obamacare mandates that all Americans pay healthcare premiums regardless of anticipated medical expenses. Young Americans must subsidize retirees who use healthcare far more often to level the insurance price disparity between younger and older Americans.
Essential Health Benefits: Obamacare mandates certain health servives be covered by health insurance. These include coverage for preventive and wellness services, chronic disease management, rehabilitative and habilitative services, and many more. In short, the more categories you are forced to cover, the more expensive your premium will be. No more affordable catastrophic plans. 
Taxes and Fees on Plans, Drugs, and Medical Devices:  The total cost of new taxes and fees on drug manufacturers, device manufacturers, and health care plans is $165 billion. This will ultimately be passed on to the consumer in higher premiums.

Families will also see a significant increase in their healthcare premiums. One of the studies in the report found that a family could see the costs of their premiums rise to $7,186 in the next decade. 
With a stagnant economy, unprecedented levels of unemployment (youth unemployment currently 17.6 percent), and average household expenses on the rise (gas, food, energy, etc), there are very few people that can afford $800-$4,000 more to pay for the rise in healthcare premiums. 
Remember when President Obama said, “if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan”? Or that Obamacare would “bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family.” Me too.

During a colloquy aiding Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in his filibuster-like Senate floor speech Tuesday evening, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) challenged the assertion that Senate Republicans must vote for cloture to support the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) that defunds Obamacare, offering two alternative methods for passage which preserve that element of the legislation.
“Now, it’s interesting that what we’re discussing here today, much of what we’ve been discussing today has been on the upcoming cloture vote,” Lee said. “There have been those who have argued that if you want to support the continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives–remember, this is the continuing resolution that will keep our federal government funded while defunding Obamacare–if you want to support that, that you must vote yes on the cloture vote on the bill.”
Lee then questioned the logic of that argument, which has been presented by GOP Senate leadership. 


“It’s anticipated that Senator Harry Reid… and 53 democratic allies, as I understand, will all be voting for cloture on that bill,” he said. “That begs the question… does that mean that Harry Reid and the 53 Democrats likely to follow him are supporting the House-passed Continuing Resolution, the one that keeps government funded while defunding Obamacare? I find that a little strange. I find it a little counterintuitive.”

Lee argued the logic is not sound. 
“That’s a problem, indeed, because that… [allows] neither an open amendment process nor an up-or-down vote on the House-passed resolution in as-is condition–in either of those circumstances, we would be fine,” Lee said. “But we’re not getting that. We’re getting stuck with something else. He wants to gut the House-passed continuing resolution of the defunding language without an open amendment process and without the opportunity for an up-or-down vote.”
“So in that circumstance, I don’t understand why it would be the case that Republicans would feel that voting ‘yes’ would be supporting the House of Representatives and voting ‘no’ would be voting against the House of Representatives.”
Then Lee told Cruz that it seems to him that such a move “would be quite the opposite of that.”
“It seems to me, Senator Cruz, that if–if one, in fact, wanted to stand behind the House of Representatives and stand behind their willingness to defend the American people and protect them from this harmful law… [one] would necessarily need to vote ‘no’ if, in fact, Senator Reid does what we expect him to do later this week.”

In a poll released Tuesday, one day after President Obama slammed Republicans for what he dishonestly described as a “government shutdown,” Rasmussen has found that when it comes to cutting health care costs, a majority of 51% favor “having a partial government shutdown until Democrats and Republicans agree on what spending for the health care law to cut.”
An even higher number of 53% favor a partial government shutdown until “Democrats and Republicans can agree on what [general] spending to cut.” Only 37% oppose. 
For obvious reasons, the media refuse to make clear that it is not the GOP proposing any kind of government shutdown, partial or otherwise. The GOP’s plan is to kill the ObamaCare debacle with a bill that funds everything but the president’s job-killing health care plan. It is up to the president and Democrat-led Senate, then, to decide if this wildly unpopular drag on our economy is worth shutting down the government. 


Both the media and the president are eager for this showdown; both relish the idea of replaying the 1990s when the media and the Clinton White House worked together to bludgeon then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich over a similar gambit. 

This poll, though, shows that this tactic might not work as well this time. Just for starters, people are much more concerned about the deficit today than they were in the mid-nineties; and there was no boondoggle like ObamaCare hanging out there as a prize in a shutdown showdown. 
Make no mistake, the media will ignore this poll. The results do not fit the media’s pro-ObamaCare Narrative, and only interferes with the reality they are attempting to manufacture that says a shutdown can only mean disaster for the GOP.
But to those interested in reality, this poll should be food for thought.

1876	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/08/CNN-Blames-Christians-for-Obamacare-Problems	News	1	Healthcare	Economy	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
CNN has blamed Christians for the problem of Americans without health insurance, calling it “The Obamacare ‘scandal’ you haven’t heard about.” In an article on CNN.com’s Belief Blog, CNN writer John Blake says that, while famous pastors “preach in states where crosses and church steeples dot the skyline,” they do nothing about “the poor who can’t get the health insurance they would receive if they lived elsewhere.”
That refers, in turn, to the decision of twenty-five states not to participate in Obamacare’s expanded Medicaid funding. The states were allowed to opt out following last year’s controversial Supreme Court decision on Obamacare, which upheld the law as a whole but struck down the mandatory state participation in Medicaid expansion, citing the protection provided to state powers under the Tenth Amendment.


Some Republican states took the funding anyway, which provides health insurance subsidies for households with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level. Though the federal government will initially cover almost all of the cost, many Republican governors are wary of potential future costs, and are also worried about the effect on the federal budget itself. Many are also opposed to participating in the Obamacare program on principle.

CNN seems to think that the choice to opt out of Obamacare is somehow the responsibility of well-known pastors such as Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes, who declined to comment for Blake’s article. One minister, Rev. Phil Wages, said he would not preach that states should accept Medicaid funding because he does not believe that care for the poor is the primary responsibility of the government, according to Christian teachings.
Beyond that, most churches are non-profit organizations whose tax-exempt status might be threatened if they became involved in political causes. Blake recognizes that, but strongly suggests that churches have a duty regardless. (Curiously, he does not suggest that churches should preach against Obamacare because of the millions of families that are losing their health insurance plans, contrary to the president’s promises.)
Blake covers different perspectives on the question of speaking out. But the premise of CNN’s article is that churches are to blame for Obamacare’s failures–not the federal government, not the Democrats who passed it, and not President Barack Obama himself. The thinly-veiled implication–a repeated theme in leftist critiques–is that Christians are hypocrites who care about personal salvation, but not about good works.

Under the Gang of 8’s backroom immigration deal with Senators Schumer, Corker and Hoeven, formerly illegal immigrants who are amnestied will be eligible to work, but will not be eligible for ObamaCare. Employers who would be required to pay as much as a $3,000 penalty for most employees who receive an ObamaCare healthcare “exchange” subsidy, would not have to pay the penalty if they hire amnestied immigrants. 
Consequently, employers would have a significant incentive to hire or retain amnestied immigrants, rather than current citizens, including those who have recently achieved citizenship via the current naturalization process.
The issue is really an “interaction effect” of the immigration proposal and ObamaCare itself.  


Beginning in January, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees, that do not currently offer healthcare benefits that are considered “acceptable” by the Obama administration, must pay a penalty if at least one of their workers obtains insurance on a new government-run “exchange.” The penalty can be as much as $3,000 per employee.  

Many employers have been preparing to cope with the new regulations by slashing the hours of full-timers to part-time status. Since “full-time,” in the language of ObamaCare, is averaging 30 hours per week, employers will, in general, receive the penalty if they have 50 or more employees who are working an average of 30 hours per week.  
If the immigration bill becomes law, many employers could receive incentives of hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire amnestied immigrants over American citizens. In addition, these newly legalized immigrants could work “full-time,” an advantage for companies and businesses as well, while employers could lay off or diminish to “part-time” status, American workers. 
Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner explains that he spoke with Alex Conant of Sen. Marco Rubio’s staff in April about the wrinkle, and was told that this was an issue that could be addressed during the legislative process. 
“[T]he scenario you raise illustrates both the absurdity of ObamaCare, and why we have insisted on a lengthy process to review this legislation before any votes are taken,” Conant emailed Klein. “We always expected there might be a need for amendments to fix technical problems, and we’ll be interested in seeing what sort of amendments might be offered to improve this part of the legislation without giving ObamaCare to illegals- something Sen. Rubio has always said he will not support.” 
However, as Klein said a couple of weeks ago, the issue has not been addressed and, in fact, the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven deal carries out what appears to be a major complication for American workers. Klein said that Conant did not respond to further requests for comment on this issue.  
As for Conant’s comment in April about Rubio insisting on a “lengthy process to review this legislation before votes are taken,” that seems to have gone with the wind as well.

Though the Obama administration said that individuals making under $45,960 would get Obamacare subsidies, low-income young people in most of America’s big cities who relied on that promise are discovering they will be ineligible for them. 
According to a CNN report, though young people are now required to purchase insurance under Obamacare or pay a fine, “many low-income younger Americans won’t get any subsidy at all” because, as the Obama administration claims, the “cost of insurance is lower than the government initially expected.”
In April, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius “told a congressional subcommittee that any individual making under that $45,960 threshold–or four times the poverty level of $11,490 for an individual–would qualify for ‘an upfront tax subsidy.'”


According to CNN, “subsidies are based on a formula set by law, applying to individuals with annual incomes of one to four times the poverty level–or $11,490 to $45,960.” And to calculate the subsidies, “the government sets a maximum amount that low-income customers will have to pay for insurance as a percentage of their income. That cap is then subtracted from the cost of a mid-level insurance plan in the individual’s region, and the difference is their subsidy.”
And though insurance companies are required to “knock that amount off the price of premiums before the customer pays,” the subsidy is “zero” if the baseline plan insurance plans are cheap enough. That means many low-income younger Americans who are forced to buy insurance are discovering, to the surprise of many, that they will have to do so without the subsidies they were promised, as CNN noted:

In Chicago, a 27-year old will receive no subsidy to help offset premiums of more than $165 a month if he makes more than $27,400 a year.
In Portland, Oregon, subsidies for individuals making just $28,725 a year phase out for those younger than 35 years old.
In Nashville, a 25-year old making $25,500 will not qualify for a subsidy.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, a 4o-year old  making $28,725 a year will not get a subsidy.

Throughout the Obama administration, our dangerously incurious, acquiescent media have been collectively caught off guard by every White House scandal, from Benghazi to the IRS to “you can keep your insurance.” Each and every time, the media ignored conservatives who warned in advance of what was happening. But the next unexploded scandal — a nuclear bomb in ObamaCare — is an opportunity for the media to redeem itself.
Thursday, Forbes reported that the Obama administration knew in 2010 that by the time the dust settles, 93 million Americans will lose their insurance due to ObamaCare. This time, instead of being caught off guard and surprised by something that is an open secret, maybe the media can get ahead of this story before it is too late — if it isn’t already:


Section 1251 of the Affordable Care Act contains what’s called a “grandfather” provision that, in theory, allows people to keep their existing plans if they like them. But subsequent regulations from the Obama administration interpreted that provision so narrowly as to prevent most plans from gaining this protection.

“The Departments’ mid-range estimate is that 66 percent of small employer plans and 45 percent of large employer plans will relinquish their grandfather status by the end of 2013,” wrote the administration on page 34,552 of the Register. All in all, more than half of employer-sponsored plans will lose their “grandfather status” and get canceled. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 156 million Americans–more than half the population–was covered by employer-sponsored insurance in 2013.
Another 25 million people, according to the CBO, have “nongroup and other” forms of insurance; that is to say, they participate in the market for individually-purchased insurance. In this market, the administration projected that “40 to 67 percent” of individually-purchased plans would lose their Obamacare-sanctioned “grandfather status” and get canceled, solely due to the fact that there is a high turnover of participants and insurance arrangements in this market. (Plans purchased after March 23, 2010 do not benefit from the “grandfather” clause.) The real turnover rate would be higher, because plans can lose their grandfather status for a number of other reasons.
How many people are exposed to these problems? 60 percent of Americans have private-sector health insurance–precisely the number that Jay Carney dismissed. As to the number of people facing cancellations, 51 percent of the employer-based market plus 53.5 percent of the non-group market (the middle of the administration’s range) amounts to 93 million Americans.
Dear Media: This is science, math, and law. How about digging in a little bit on this one? Because it is coming and we all know it.

President Barack Obama unveiled his “Power Africa” program on Sunday that will spent $7 billion in U.S. taxpayer money to fund a sub-Saharan Africa electricity program that will also develop geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar power.
The International Energy Agency says achieving universal electricity access to sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 would require $300 billion.


Obama said his plan is meant to bring “light where there is currently darkness.”   

The Obama White House released a statement saying that the president’s Africa plan “will commit more than $7 billion in financial support over the next five years,” including: 

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide $285 million in technical assistance, grants and risk mitigation to advance private sector energy transactions and help governments adopt and implement the policy, regulatory, and other reforms necessary to attract private sector investment in the energy and power sectors. 
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) will commit up to $1.5 billion in financing and insurance to energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa.
The U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) will make available up to $5 billion in support of U.S. exports for the development of power projects across sub-Saharan Africa. 
The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will invest up to $1 billion in African power systems through its country compacts to increase access and the reliability and sustainability of electricity supply through investments in energy infrastructure, policy and regulatory reforms and institutional capacity building.
OPIC and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will provide up to $20 million in project preparation, feasibility and technical assistance grants to develop renewable energy projects.  These efforts will be coordinated through the U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative (US-ACEF) and supported by the recently launched U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Development and Finance Center (CEDFC) in Johannesburg, South Africa.
The U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF) will launch a $2 million Off-Grid Energy Challenge to provide grants of up to $100,000 to African-owned and operated enterprises to develop or expand the use of proven technologies for off-grid electricity benefitting rural and marginal populations. 
In 2014, OPIC and USAID will jointly host an African energy and infrastructure investment conference.  The conference will bring investors, developers, and companies together with U.S. and African government officials to demonstrate the opportunities for investment and the tools and resources available from the U.S. government and other partners to support investment.

Power Africa will also receive $9 billion from General Electric and other private companies.

The 844-page immigration reform bill the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” dropped in the dead of night contains a lucrative handout that would give taxpayer-funded free cell phones to some people who live or work near the U.S. border with Mexico.

SEC. 1107. ACCESS TO EMERGENCY PERSONNEL.(a) SOUTHWEST BORDER REGION EMERGENCY COM- MUNICATIONS GRANTS.–(1) IN GENERAL.–The Secretary, in consultation with the governors of the States in the South- west Border region, shall establish a 2-year grant program, to be administered by the Secretary, to im- prove emergency communications in the Southwest Border region.(2) ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS.–An individual is eligible to receive a grant under this subsection if the individual demonstrates that he or she–(A) regularly resides or works in the Southwest Border region;
(B) is at greater risk of border violence due to the lack of cellular service at his or her residence or business and his or her proximity to the Southern border. (3) USE OF GRANTS.–Grants awarded underthis subsection may be used to purchase satellite telephone communications systems and service that–(A) can provide access to 9-1-1 service;and(B) are equipped with global positioning systems.(4) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.– There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the grant program established under this subsection.

Manjarres first found the immigration bill’s free cell phone goodies and dubbed the handout the “MarcoPhone.”

“Move over ‘Obama phone,’ we present the new ‘Hola, Como Estas?!’ MarcoPhone,” Manjarres wrote on Wednesday morning. 
Rubio spokesman Alex Conant did not return a request for comment from Breitbart News.
Interestingly, TracFone, a company that will likely benefit from this type of government program, is based in Rubio’s Miami, Florida.
Correction: Breitbart News initially misspelled the name of the company TracFone. We regret the error.

House Speaker John Boehner appears to have put to rest rumors that he may break what is informally called the “Hastert Rule,” an unwritten guideline that a majority of the majority party should be needed to bring a bill to the House floor, in order to pass a version of amnesty like the “Gang of Eight” bill currently moving through the Senate.
A source with direct knowledge of these matters told Breitbart News that Boehner has decided to abide by the Hastert Rule in regards to immigration reform. “No immigration bill will be brought to the floor for a vote without a majority of the Republican conference in support,” the source told Breitbart News on Monday.
Around Washington, conservatives have worried that Boehner may back down from conservative principles on immigration and support the Gang of Eight bill. They fear he may rush the bill to the floor if the Senate passes it and try to move it through the House with a majority of Democratic votes. 


Even though those rumors continue to fly, signs now indicate that Boehner will not break the Hastert Rule and will only bring a bill to the floor with the support of the majority of Republicans.

Reports from Ryan Lizza at The New Yorker and David Drucker at the Washington Examiner appear to support the idea that Boehner will not break with Republicans. It did take Rep. Steve King (R-IA) banding together more than 50 of his colleagues to call for a special GOP conference meeting on the topic, at which they expressed their dissatisfaction with the Senate bill and their hope that Boehner will stick to the Hastert Rule. 
In addition to King’s efforts, conservative groups have circulated letters around Washington calling on the conference to formally codify the Hastert Rule into the House GOP conference rules so that it must be followed, instead of just being a guideline.

Partial transcript via Fox News:
ED HENRY: Can you give us an update on the sequester because yesterday, the Customs and Border Protection (INAUDIBLE) said that they’re actually postponing furloughs and overtime cuts for border patrol agents. I thought in February, when Secretary Napolitano came out here with you, she told us it was dire, these border patrol agents were going to be furloughed and that we were going to be less safe because of that.

JAY CARNEY: Well, I think both are true. What is — what is a fact is that when you’re dealing with these kinds of across-the-board forced budget cuts in the middle of the fiscal year and you’re having to make all sorts of adjustments to account for them and to reduce your expenditures accordingly, you know, it’s a moving picture. And you know, what — and that can be on the plus side where furloughs may take place a little later or on the minus side, where things may be more immediate.
Watch the video to see how heated it got. More proof Henry is a great reporter. 
Though they are more than capable of going overboard at times, the media-at-large does a very good job of vetting and holding Republicans accountable. What Ed Henry just did used to happen practically every day to the White House press secretary between the years of 2001 and 2009. Moreover, there were frequent gang tackles where members of the White House press corps would coordinate to ensure a question got answered. 
I didn’t hear anyone jumping in to help Henry, did you?
And these lapdogs wonder why Obama treats them like one-night stands.

Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) gave the clearest indication that proponents of comprehensive immigration reform may make their final–and strongest–push to get legislation passed next year after House Republicans make it through their primaries. 
“I think conventional wisdom is that time is not on our side,” McCain told reporters on Monday after an event in Chicago. “But there are a number of members of Congress who have primaries and when those primaries are done, they may be more inclined to address the issue of comprehensive immigration reform.”
President Barack Obama has urged Congress to pass immigration reform legislation this year. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is reportedly going to bring legislation to the floor within the next month and other House Republican leaders have indicated support for piecemeal pieces of legislation that can make it to conference with the Senate, where proponents and opponents of immigration reform had said a pathway to citizenship will prevail. 


Though the Congressional Budget Office has determined the Senate’s immigration bill would lower the wages of working class Americans, House Republicans are reportedly working on piecemeal pieces of legislation to eventually get to conference with the Senate. McCain also said on Monday that the House should just “pass something” to get to conference with the Senate. House Republicans like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) are reportedly working on legislation that would grant a pathway to citizenship to all of the country’s illegal immigrants.

McCain’s comments indicate even if the current push to enact comprehensive immigration reform fails, the real fight may be in the spring and summer of next year, when Obama could use immigration as a midterm election issue and Republican lawmakers will not be worried about primaries in the 2014 election cycle.
In 2010, McCain made a right turn on immigration, infamously promising to “complete the danged fence” as he was fighting for his political life to win re-election in Arizona. Shortly after he got elected to serve another term, McCain quickly lurched back to the left, becoming a champion for comprehensive immigration reform and calling Tea Partiers whose support he needed in 2010 “hobbits” and “wacko birds.”

2173	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/02/Obama-Administration-Decided-to-Block-Access-to-Memorials	Opinion	0	None	Economy	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

The Obama Administration has decided to block access to public memorials on the National Mall as a result of the government shutdown. Like its decision to end White House tours when the sequester cuts took effect, there is no rational reason for this. The Park Police, nominally in charge of monitoring these spaces, isn’t even affected by the shutdown. Shutting off access to these sites is gratuitous and petulant. 
On Monday, the first day of the government shutdown, a number of WWII veterans showed up at a memorial to their service to find that access had been blocked. The memorial is in a public space and is open 24/7, with almost no oversight from Park Police personnel. (Who, by the way, are exempt from the government shutdown.) The White House was, according to reports, informed of the veterans’ visit and chose to block access.
Having lived in DC for 18 years, I can tell you, the WWII Memorial is simply an architectural structure in an open public space. There is no official “access” to it. There are no guards. It’s a building in a park. Yet, the Obama Administration tried to block veterans from viewing the public memorial, even after hearing about the planned visit. 


Fortunately, the “greatest generation” was having nothing of this and easily overcame the government barricades. (Do we yet again have to rely on this generation to show the promise of America?) 

On Wednesday, the veterans’ group is planning to visit the Lincoln Memorial, which the Obama Administration has also vowed to close to visitors. I have regularly visited this memorial at one or two in the morning. At those hours, it is a peaceful and reflective place. It is an open space. There is no access that needs to be blocked. It is only by a conscious decision, and a great deal of work, that access would be blocked. 
This is nothing more than a petulant response by the Obama Administration to the government shutdown. Over the next week, more than 500 WWII veterans are expected in DC to visit the memorial dedicated to their sacrifice. If the Park Police again try to erect barricades to this public space, it will be another sign that the Obama Administration has made an affirmative decision to separate itself from the American public. 
Obama chose this pass. He ought to be made to own it.

In legislation filed yesterday, the House GOP Leadership made an important twist in their plan to pass a short-term increase in the debt ceiling. Rather than increase the debt ceiling by a few hundred billion dollars, buying them time for further talks on the budget, they have opted to “suspend” the debt ceiling. Its a blatant abdication of their constitutional authority. It’s an ominous sign of the talks to come. 
Article 1 of the US Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to borrow money to fund the government. Up until World War I, Congress would approve every bond issuance. The borrowing demands of the war made this impractical, so Congress authorized a “debt ceiling,” where the government could freely borrow up to a statutory limit and then go back to Congress to approve additional borrowing. Think of it as giving your teenager a pre-paid debit card. 
With this measure, the government had more flexibility to manage its affairs while preserving the Constitutional principle that Congress controlled the purse strings. 


“Suspending” the debt ceiling until May upends this principle. Upon enactment, the government’s borrowing authority would be unlimited until May. Presumably, the government could borrow trillions in this window, providing either the markets or the Fed would meet the new supply of debt. 

Worse, however, is that the GOP move establishes a very slippery precedent. The left has been agitating to simply eliminate the idea of a debt ceiling entirely. For all its flaws, the ceiling at least guarantees we will have some debate about government spending. The left finds this annoying. Unfortunately, the GOP plan to “suspend” the ceiling provides at least partial support to this argument. If we can “suspend” it for three months, why not a year? Once you’ve surrendered the constitutional principle behind the ceiling where and how can you draw a line? 
Despite their past history of punting on difficult fiscal issues, I was willing to give the House GOP a skeptical benefit of the doubt on their plan for a short-term lift in the ceiling. The deficit debate has three components, ie. debt ceiling, sequestration, and budget expiration, which happen close to each other, but not simultaneously. It made some strategic sense to weave them together into a single debate. 
I assumed, however, that this would entail an increase in the debt ceiling of a few hundred billion dollars, to provide the time to negotiate a longer-term deal. I did not anticipate it would feature the House GOP surrendering its constitutional obligations. 
When the GOP took control of the House, they vowed that every piece of legislation would contain specific language citing the constitutional authority for the proposed law. It would be interesting to see their interpretation of the constitutional authority to suspend the document.

The ongoing scandal involving Internal Revenue Service targeting of Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status took a step closer to the White House last week when testimony from retiring IRS tax law specialist Carter Hull before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee pointed investigators directly to the agency’s Office of Chief Counsel. 
Though Hull did not specifically name IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins as the person who ordered him to send Tea Party group applications to his office “for further review,” Hull’s testimony brought the Obama political appointee to the forefront in the ever expanding scandal.
On July 18, Hull testified that in March 2011 Judy Kindell, a senior technical advisor to Lois Lerner, then the head of the IRS tax exempt division, “told me to forward my recommendations [concerning the approval of Tea Party group applications for tax exempt status] to the Office of Chief Counsel for their review.”


Hull was asked if Ms. Kindell agreed with his earlier recommendations that the IRS had sufficient information at that time to make a determination on the Tea Party groups applications for tax-exempt status.

“She did not say whether she agreed or not. She said it should go to chief counsel,” Hull told the committee. 
On Tuesday the connection between Wilkins and the White House was strengthened when several media outlets reported that Wilkins met with the President at the White House on April 23, 2012, just two days before the IRS issued a revised set of BOLO (“Be on the lookout”) instructions to IRS agents reviewing tax-exempt applications that appear to target Tea Party groups for more stringent review standards.
Also on Tuesday, True the Vote, a Tea Party group that focuses on preventing voter fraud and was one of the groups subjected to IRS targeting, announced that it is suing Mr. Wilkins, adding him to the list of defendants in the lawsuit it filed against the IRS in May of this year.
Wilkins, a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School, has been a partner with Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale, and Door (also known as WilmerHale), the prestigious Washington, D.C. law firm, since 1988. According to Federal Election Commission records, Mr. Wilkins has donated generously to political candidates over the years, most of them affiliated with the Democratic Party. In 2008 he represented Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s Chicago church, the one which President Obama attended for twenty years, on a pro bono basis before the IRS. President Obama named him Chief Counsel at the IRS in April, 2009.

So Ted Cruz doesn’t trust the Republicans. Imagine that.
“Let me be clear” he said on the Senate floor the other day. “I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats.” And why not? The last four years have given us all ample reason not to trust the Democrats, as $1 trillion deficits have become the new normal and the national debt has zoomed toward $17 trillion, all under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid team’s watch.
But what about the Republicans, who so often claim to be the party of limited government? The truth is, the GOP’s record is seldom as grand as its rhetoric. Aside from a few Tea Party stalwarts, plenty of Republican senators are ready to throw in the towel on the debt ceiling, let it go up, and get a few scraps from the Democrats in return.


“Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,” Cruz was quoted in the New York Times. “There are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.”
He is right about that. Senior Republican staffers in Congress tell me that members of the Republican Leadership in both houses of Congress are terrified of not raising the debt ceiling, having been convinced that calamity will ensue if we don’t. But the alternative? Senate Majority Leader McConnell would, I am told, be happy to see the debt ceiling raised with no Republican votes. Then Republicans can beat up Democrats for raising it, while knowing that the economy won’t explode as Paul Krugman has warned it would. 
And if House Speaker John Boehner had to choose between a clean debt ceiling increase (one with no limits, allowing Obama to keep raising it ad nauseum) and no debt ceiling increase at all, I am told he would take the former by conservatives in the House of Representatives.

So the establishment Republican mind-set says, “More debt is better than a melt-down, but at least get something in return, even if it doesn’t mean much, we have something to run against the Democrats with.” What do they want in return? They know they don’t have the votes to get much in the way of budget cuts, so they can at least keep the base happy with talk about “economic growth.”
When Cruz, who is anything but your traditional freshman back-bench Senator, said he didn’t trust Republicans, the party establishment, led by John McCain, howled in response. But where is the Republican leadership’s credibility? When they last held real power, these Republicans goosed up domestic discretionary spending faster than it rose under Bill Clinton and piled on the debt.
It was under a Republican president and Congress that we got Medicare Part D, the biggest new entitlement since LBJ’s Great Society. The prescription drug benefit added trillions to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities, passed only when party bosses needed to violate normal procedures to get the votes to pass it. Former U.S. Comptroller David Walker called it “the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s.”
Medicare’s chief actuary, Richard Foster, later said he was threatened not to reveal that the drug benefit’s price tag would exceed $400 billion in the first ten years. This figure was necessary under congressional rules to keep the bill from being blocked on a point of order. Foster estimated the real price tag was in excess of $500 billion. Several GOP congressmen would also recount arm-twisting tactics from the party leadership that went beyond the norm.
Instead of reducing the federal role in education, the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress gave us No Child Left Behind, which helped double the size of the Department of Education, a Cabinet-level agency Republicans had pledged to abolish as recently as 1996. John Boehner, now the speaker of the House, was an NCLB sponsor and described its enactment as “one of the proudest accomplishments of my tenure in Congress.”

Under a Republican president and Congress, a $128 billion surplus was replaced by a $455 billion deficit. By the time George W. Bush left office, the shortfall was $1.2 trillion. Discretionary spending went up faster in Bush’s first term than it did in eight years under Bill Clinton. Under Bush’s watch, the federal budget exceeded $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion, for the first time. Most of these milestones were reached before the Democrats retook Congress. Federal spending rose from 18.4 percent of GDP to an average of 20.51 percent under Bush.
Bush and the Republican establishment bailed out the Wall Street banks with the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (with Democratic support, naturally). They bailed out the auto industry. They even pioneered a pre-Obama stimulus program, with similar results. The deficits and government growth would later endanger the Bush tax cuts, one of the signature conservative policy achievements of the period.
The Republicans who would negotiate the debt ceiling with the Democrats in a conference will be the same people who voted for all this big government and their successors. This unfortunately includes even Paul Ryan. What faith can we have that the results will be different this time?
So is there any doubt at all why Ted Cruz doesn’t trust Republicans? He explained that he thinks “a whole lot of Americans likewise don’t trust the Republicans and the Democrats because it is leadership in both parties that has gotten us in this mess.” 
Maybe we need new leadership.

(Reuters) – Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker proposed a nearly $70 billion biennial budget on Wednesday that combines income tax cuts with increased spending on transportation infrastructure and private education.
Walker, a first-term Republican facing re-election next year, said he would offset the tax cuts and spending increases contained in his 2013-2015 budget by redirecting some funds away from public schools and healthcare, freezing aid to local governments and selling off state assets such as power plants.


Democrats said the proposal would weaken the economic security of the state’s most vulnerable residents.
Walker, who touched off massive protests two years ago when he curbed the collective bargaining rights of public workers, said his proposed income tax cut would save residents $343 million.
“More money in the hands of taxpayers will likely drive greater demand for goods and services, which will likely lead to greater production and eventually more hiring of employees,” he said.

The proposed budget, unveiled in an address to both houses of the Legislature in Madison, included expanded state aid to private schools through voucher programs and the tightening of income eligibility requirements for recipients of publicly funded health programs.
Walker said he also wanted “able-bodied, non-elderly” people receiving food stamps in Wisconsin to be enrolled in mandatory employment training.
“I’m all for providing a temporary hand up,” he told lawmakers. “But … it should not be a permanent handout.
Democrats, who tried unsuccessfully last year to recall Walker, were critical of the proposed budget.
State Senator Kathleen Vinehout, who was a candidate for governor in the Democratic primary ahead of last year’s recall election, said, “Roads and bridges are being paid for by borrowing and raiding money that would otherwise go to schools and universities.
“These are political choices, not the choices voters in Wisconsin would make.”
Walker’s proposed budget will now go to the state Legislature, which is controlled by Walker’s fellow Republicans.
Debate on the measure is expected to continue for months.

The mainstream media in the United States have ignored comments made by President Barack Obama during his a speech in Northern Ireland this week in which he described religious education as a source of conflict.
The president’s comments have sparked widespread controversy and criticism in the Irish media, as well as in Catholic media in the U.S., but the mainstream media have ignored Obama’s contentious remarks.


Obama, who attended an elite private high school, told an audience in Belfast on Monday [emphasis added]:


Because issues like segregated schools and housing, lack of jobs and opportunity — symbols of history that are a source of pride for some and pain for others — these are not tangential to peace; they’re essential to it.  If towns remain divided — if Catholics have their schools and buildings, and Protestants have theirs — if we can’t see ourselves in one another, if fear or resentment are allowed to harden, that encourages division.  It discourages cooperation.

Catholic media have interpreted the remarks as an attack on religious education itself, and Catholic education in particular. The mainstream media, which seized on every remark made by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney during his 2012 international trip as a near-disqualifying “gaffe,” have been entirely silent.
While gaffes are usually defined as extemporaneous, off-the-cuff errors or poorly judged statements, Obama’s remarks were planned in advance. The “gaffe” in Obama’s Belfast remarks lies in the fact that Obama did not consider the sensitivities of his audience–or that he inadvertently revealed his own anti-religious prejudice.
To travel to a city troubled by conflict, and to then insult the members of at least one of the two communities, is not only a gaffe, but a serious diplomatic error. 
Unless, of course, the speaker is President Barack Obama.

On Friday, a top political adviser to left-wing billionaire George Soros met with leftist organizations to form a new group called the Latino Victory Project, the Washington Post’s Matea Gold reports. The group is connected to Hollywood actress Eva Longoria, a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama’s political campaigns.
Gold notes that the Soros adviser and a network of about 30 other left-wing “donors, fundraisers and union leaders” met on Friday to develop “a strategy to make the [immigration] issue central in next year’s midterm elections if Congress does not pass a bill, identifying 10 House Republicans who would be vulnerable to pressure from Latino constituents.”  
“The meeting was attended by officials from several labor unions, including the National Education Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, as well as representatives of deep-pocketed backers of liberal causes, including a political adviser to billionaire George Soros,” Gold added.


The 10 Republicans they are targeting are Reps. Jeff Denham (R-CA), Buck McKeon (R-CA), Gary Miller (R-CA), David Valadao (R-CA), Daniel Webster (R-FL), Mike Coffman (R-CO), Scott Tipton (R-CA), Joe Heck (R-NV), Steve Pearce (R-NM), and Randy Weber (R-TX). These representatives are largely split on immigration efforts. 
Pearce, for instance, does not support the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” bill or anything like it. “You can’t get control of the borders if you tell people you can come here illegally and you can work until you work your way to the front of the line,” Pearce said in an interview with the New York Times‘ Ashley Parker in August. “The whole world would want to do it that way. Who would want to wait and do it properly?”
Weber, who represents the district of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), spoke at an anti-amnesty rally on Capitol Hill in June alongside Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and Steve King (R-TX). “The president has the authority to secure our border,” Weber said at the event. “He should do it today. In fact he should have done it yesterday.”

Denham, on the other hand, supports amnesty, at one point issuing verbal support for the Senate bill but backtracking after immense pressure from conservatives and constituents over the course of August. Since the congressional recess, Denham has come out to publicly endorse House Democrats’ amnesty plan, which was introduced by House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) earlier this month. Denham has also publicly claimed that House Speaker John Boehner promised that in the next “month or so” there would be a vote on immigration legislation in the House of Representatives. 
Boehner spokesman Michael Steel has not confirmed or denied these claims.
The group of left-wing donors that Soros’ top political aide attended was borne out of a fundraising committee called the Futuro Fund, which raised more than $30 million for Obama’s re-election campaing. “Led by actress Eva Longoria, Puerto Rico lawyer Andres Lopez and San Antonio businessman Henry R. Muñoz III, the fund represented the most robust demonstration yet of the Latino community’s ability to amass cash for U.S. political campaigns,” Gold wrote.
Cristobal Alex, a former program officer at the Ford Foundation, left his position there to lead the Latino Victory Project as the new group’s president. “What we want to do with the Latino Victory Project is build political power in the Latino community, so that the faces of Latinos are reflected not just in every level of government but in the policies that drive the country forward,” Alex said.
Moving forward, the Post noted, the group will agree to spend anywhere from $1 million to $2 million per target district. “The effort will begin in coming weeks with a campaign aimed at persuading the lawmakers to back an immigration measure this year,” Gold wrote. “If that fails, the group plans to run a barrage of radio and TV ads against them next year.”
The AFL-CIO’s immigration campaign manager, Tom Snyder, said each of these GOP lawmakers has a target on their backs. “There was agreement in the room that if we don’t see action in the House, we know who we’re going after,” Snyder said. “There’s a realization that we have to get back to basics. We’re at the point where if you don’t act, we’re going to have to make you pay at the ballot box.”
Amalia Perea Mahoney, a Chicago-area art gallery owner who the Los Angeles Times reported raked in between $200,000 and $500,000 for Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, said the group is “all very united” in its purpose. “I think it’s a pivotal moment,” she said. Mahoney is also an Obama appointee to an federal arts board. 
Soros has spent $100 million since 1997 backing what his Open Society Foundation calls “immigrant rights” groups and projects. Some of those projects, like Soros’ National Immigration Forum-backed Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT), were meant to create the illusion of grassroots support for amnesty where there was none. Recent polling data released by NumbersUSA, conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, shows that Evangelical Republican likely voters disagree with the push for amnesty despite the Soros group’s claims there is grassroots support among Evangelicals for the policy. 
Recently, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID), a supporter of immigration reform, withdrew from the House’s version of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” and announced his public opposition to negotiating with Obama and the Senate on immigration, saying such negotiations would be “crazy” for House GOP leadership to enter into. Labrador said House GOP leadership would not be smart to deal with these people because they are trying to “destroy” the Republican Party.

2321	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/13/Powell-vein-of-intolerance	Opinion	1	Civil Rights	Elections	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"
This morning, former Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press to discuss the nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to Secretary of Defense. During the discussion, David Gregory asked the liberal Powell, nominally a Republican but a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama, about the Republican Party. “I’m struck when you talk about Republicans as they. I know you insist despite voting for President Obama twice now that you’re still a Republican. But as– as I go through your record on some social issues and even foreign policy issues, I challenge you a little bit to say on what basis are you still a Republican? Do you feel like this Republican Party has left you or have you left it?”

Now, this is a half-decent question, given that Powell has been quite liberal on the issues for years now. But Powell’s answer wasn’t that he differed from Republicans on the issues. Instead, he went directly to the most common liberal meme these days in defending a radical left president: Republicans are racist. It’s a bully tactic that has become all the rage these days – Republicans don’t oppose Obama on policy, and they don’t have a good rationale for standing against liberalism. It’s just that they secretly hate black people.

Here’s what he said:

I think the Republican Party right now is having an identity problem. And I’m still a Republican. I’m a Republican who grew up along with George Bush XLI. I grew up with Ronald Reagan, Cap Weinberger, Frank Carlucci, that Republican Party, the Republican Party of Dick Lugar and John Tower. But in recent years, there’s been a significant shift to the right and we have seen what that shift has produced, two losing presidential campaigns. 
So far, this is a typical leftist talking point. The Republican Party has not moved to the right. In fact, it has moved in rather extreme ways to the left, given its spending record and establishment opposition to the Tea Party. Ronald Reagan was significantly more conservative than George W. Bush. But this was prelude to Powell’s real agenda: labeling Republicans closet bigots.

I think what the Republican Party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country has changed. The country is changing demographically. And if the Republican Party does not change along with that demographic, they’re going to be in trouble. And so, when we see that in one more generation, the minorities of America, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans will be the majority of the country, you can’t go around saying we don’t want to have a solid immigration policy. We’re going to dismiss the 47 percent. We are going to make it hard for these minorities to vote as they did in the last election. What did that produce? The court struck most of that down and most importantly, it caused people to turn out and stand in line because these Republicans were trying to keep us from voting. There’s also a dark– a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the Party. What I do mean by that? I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor say that the president is shuckin’ and jivin’, that’s a racial era slave term. When I see another former governor after the president’s first debate where he didn’t do very well, says that the president was lazy. He didn’t say he was slow, he was tired, he didn’t do well, he said he was lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans but to those of us who are African-Americans, the second word is shiftless and then there’s a third word that goes along with it. Birther, the whole Birther Movement. Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the Party? I think the Party has to take a look at itself. It has to take a look at its responsibilities for health care. It has to take a look at immigration. It has to take a look at those less fortunate than us. The Party has gathered unto itself a reputation that it is the party of the rich. It is the party of lower taxes. But there are a lot of people who are lower down the food chain, the economic chain, who are also paying lots of taxes relative to their income and they need help. We need more education work being done in this country. We need a solid immigration policy. We have to look at climate change. There are a lot of things that the American people are expecting and the Republican Party, as they get ready for the next election, really has to focus on some of these issues and not ignore them. Everybody wants to talk about who’s going to be the candidate. You better think first about what’s the party they’re actually going to represent. If it’s just going to represent the far right-wing of the political spectrum, I think the Party is in difficulty. I’m a moderate but I’m still a Republican, that’s how I was raised. And until I voted for Mister Obama twice, I had voted for seven straight Republican presidents.
Notice the subtle linkage there: Republicans oppose global warming, immigration reform of the type leftists want, redistribution of income, not out of principle, but out of hatred of those with a different skin color. This is despicable. And it is a lie. Powell’s statements are outrageous. His statements about “shuckin’ and jivin'”? He’s referring to former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AL), who wrote this about President Obama’s feckless foreign policy on Benghazi:
Why the lies? Why the cover up? Why the dissembling about the cause of the murder of our ambassador on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil? We deserve answers to this. President Obama’s shuck and jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end.

Is that racist? Of course not. But Powell labels it racist because it serves his political ends. 
Is the word “lazy” racist? If so, half the media hates white folks, because presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower have routinely been labeled lazy. 
As for the birthers, nobody in the mainstream of the Republican Party has ever given credibility to them. Only in Colin Powell’s opportunistic mind is the GOP linked with birtherism.
What’s more, Powell is the last person on earth who should be making this claim. He says that he voted for President Obama twice because he’s a moderate Republican whose party has left him. That’s nonsense. In 2008, Republicans ran the most moderate Republican in history in Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). And Powell voted against him. Why? Let Powell, circa 2009, explain:

And I spoke at length with John McCain about his campaign and I watched Mr. Obama and his campaign. And at the end, I cannot say I was totally colorblind. But at the end, I convinced myself, based on the facts as I saw it, that he was the better choice for this time in our nation’s history.
It is Colin Powell and his perspective that are underlaced with a vein of intolerance. Powell should know better than anyone that the GOP has no such vein – after all, the GOP discussed the possibility of him running for president on its ticket for years. No, this is about liberal bullying and thuggery – claiming that anyone who opposes leftist policies does so out of racism rather than political differences. And it’s vile.

During his radio show on Friday, Rush Limbaugh told his listeners, “I think abortion is at the root of so much that has and is going wrong in this country.” 
The conservative host went on to discuss that the reason why amnesty is essential to the liberal agenda is because abortion has, since Roe v. Wade in 1973, wiped out millions of potential taxpayers. The Democrat Party, Limbaugh said, has turned to amnesty as a means to ensure a “permanent underclass” in order to continue its image as the party of big government entitlements. 


Limbaugh said: 


Folks, let me tell you the way Washington thinks, in many ways, but this is one way they think.  They need money.  The US government needs money.  We are hopelessly in debt.  The tax increases that are coming are already over the top.  Washington knows, much of official Washington knows that they’ve gone beyond the point here, taxation, because the impact on economic growth and productivity and creativity has now been stifled.  I mean, the tax rates are such that real creation of wealth, real opportunity for prosperity is diminishing left and right.  
They’ve got to come up with money.  And they know this:  If you use the popularly accepted figure of 1.3 million abortions a year, go back to Roe vs. Wade 1973, 52 million taxpayers haven’t been born, is the way Washington looks at it.  They don’t look at it morally. They don’t look at it in any kind of cultural way or any kind of cultural impact. They just say we’re 52 million people short.  We have 52 million fewer people paying taxes.  We gotta replace ’em.  Hello amnesty.  The Democrat Party needs a permanent underclass in order to keep themselves alive as Santa Claus, to keep winning elections and stay in power. 

“I think that the number of abortions themselves…culturally, in terms of the sanctity of life, how that’s crumbled, I think it’s almost at the root of everything,” Limbaugh went on to say. “And if it’s not at the root of everything, it’s clearly had a profound impact on our culture, our society, and our politics, I think in ways that people don’t even stop to consider.” 
Limbaugh discussed the fact that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi refused to answer the Weekly Standard‘s question on Thursday about the morality of late-term abortion. 
“And, by the way, that’s it, she wasn’t gonna talk any more about it because she is a devout Catholic,” Limbaugh said. “She has six kids, and it isn’t about politics, and she’s not gonna discuss it anymore, she said, because the interviewer was taking it in the direction of politics, and abortion isn’t politics. Abortion is sacred ground, she said. It is the sacrament of liberalism, is what it is.”

On Friday the North Dakota state House passed the first personhood amendment in the United States, marking the first time in U.S. history that a legislative body has approved a personhood amendment in both the House and the Senate. The historic vote, 57-35, allows the amendment to be referred to North Dakota citizens for a vote.
According to SCR 4009, “the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.”  
Heraldonline.com reports that the amendment was written to ensure that both mother and baby are treated as medical patients, that medical care is not inhibited, and that fertility treatments are not banned. 


LifeSiteNews.com reports that every major pro-life organization in North Dakota has supported SCR 4009. 
“The North Dakota legislature has taken historic strides to protect every human being in the state, paving the way for human rights nationwide,” said Keith Mason, president of Personhood USA. 
Mason added: 


This amendment strikes the balance of accomplishing more for the unborn than any other amendment the nation has ever seen, while protecting pregnant women and their right to true medical care. We applaud the North Dakota House and Senate for their willingness to protect all of the people in their state. 

“The North Dakota personhood amendment takes the pro-life plank of the GOP platform and puts it into practice,” said Gualberto Garcia Jones, J.D., legal analyst for Personhood USA. “Furthermore, it allows the legislature the needed flexibility to implement the specific protections of the right to life through future legislation.” 
The state House also passed two other pro-life bills, one that demands that abortion doctors have admitting privileges to hospitals (SB 2305), and another that places a ban on abortions past 20 weeks and also bans taxpayer funding from going to organizations that provide abortions (SB 2368).  
Last week, the state legislature also passed a “heartbeat bill,” which could ban abortions as early as six weeks, and a ban on abortions for genetic conditions such as Down’s Syndrome. 
The bills will now go to Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) for his signature. Paul Maloney, executive director of North Dakota Right to Life told LifeSiteNews.com that his group has “always had faith” in Dalrymple and expects him to sign the bills. 
“I’m extremely proud of my state for the statement that they’ve made to the country,” Maloney said. “I guess it’s in the hands of the courts.” Maloney’s statement referenced the reality that the bills will almost certainly be subject to legal challenges. 
“We applaud North Dakota for defending life,” said Concerned Women for America CEO and President Penny Nance. “The bills in North Dakota protect the lives of the most innocent Americans, those without a voice, in the womb.” 
Nance added, “Hopefully these bills will start a national discussion about what life is and our duty as a civil society to protect it. It starts in the states.”

On Wednesday, the New York Times ran a blistering investigative report revealing the Clinton Foundation as a nonprofit rife with crony capitalist conflicts of interest and multi-million dollar deficits despite raking in at least $492 million from 1997 to 2007.
In 2007 and 2008, the Clinton Foundation, which is soon to be renamed the “Bill, Hillary, & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,” ran a $40 million deficit. Last year, it ran a deficit of over $8 million despite the Foundation and two subsidiaries generating $214 million in revenues.

Hillary Clinton plans to relocate her offices to the Foundation’s Manhattan headquarters in the weeks to come. Former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Clinton planned to use the Foundation as a “launching pad into 2016,” a reference to her potential presidential run.


The nexus between Clinton Foundation donors, foreign governments, and corporate interests has long been a concern to government watchdog groups. As of 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised at least $46 million from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Brunei, Oman, and other foreign governments–the very governments Secretary of State Hillary Clinton eventually negotiated with. Wealthy foreign investors, like Saudi businessman Nasser Al-Rashid and Indian politician Amar Singh gave at least $1 million each.
Previous news accounts have chronicled how Clinton Foundation donors have profited. In 2004, New York developer Robert Congel donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Shortly thereafter, Sen. Hillary Clinton reportedly helped the developer bag millions in federal assistance for his mall project. Congel and Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson denied any crony pay-to-play connection.
The New York Times says the cronyism and conflicts have reached critical mass. “The Clinton Foundation had become a sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old Clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest,” reports the Times. “It ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in.”

Despite the apparent fiscal mismanagement, well-connected Clinton allies appear to be doing quite well. In 2009, Douglas Band, whom Clinton insiders describe as a “kind of surrogate son to Mr. Clinton,” co-founded Teneo, a consultancy that has since hired Hillary Clinton confidante and disgraced mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner spouse Huma Abedin. As the Times explains:

Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country’s top hedge funds….Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients.  The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encourage4d others to become new foundation donors….Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.

Among Teneo’s earliest clients was now-defunct MF Global, run by disgraced Obama bundler Jon S. Corzine.
The Times says Chelsea Clinton “became increasingly concerned” that Band and Teneo’s outside business were negatively impacting the Foundation.
Now, the Times says Hillary, Bill, and Chelsea Clinton are gearing up for a $250 million fundraising push as Hillary prepares to use the Foundation “as a base for her to home in on issues and build up a stable of trusted staff members who could form the core of a political campaign.”

President Barack Obama rarely makes himself available to the mainstream media. They adore him anyway. At rare press conferences, such as the one scheduled for noon Friday at the White House, they lob softball questions or accept his evasive, meandering answers, rarely pressing him for clarity, much less truth. But there are many questions that the president ought to answer, yet which he is unlikely to face at all.
10. In 2008 you promised not to “do an end-run around Congress” with signing statements. Yet you have used signing statements and you have taken executive actions to circumvent Congress on immigration and other issues. Recently, you decided the employer mandate will not be enforced on October 1. Yet that date is stipulated by law. Doesn’t the Obamacare delay violate your powers under the Constitution?


9. Last week we learned that dozens of CIA personnel were in Benghazi at the time of the attack, and that there may be ongoing efforts to suppress information about what actually happened. In October 2012, you said that you issued three directives when you learned of the attack, yet these have never been seen. What did you actually do during the Benghazi attack, and why weren’t you more actively involved?
8. Last month, IRS officials testified to Congress that IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins, whom you appointed, was directly involved in reviewing applications for non-profit status by Tea Party groups. He also met with you in April 2012, prior to issuing new “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) criteria for evaluating such applications. What was your personal knowledge of the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups?
7. Recently your administration launched a new round of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders. Israel had repeatedly said that it would negotiate without preconditions, but Palestinian leaders would not. Your administration, through Secretary of State John Kerry, pressed Israel to release 104 terrorists from Israeli jails. Was there a single new concession you demanded from Palestinians?

6. You have publicly dressed down the U.S. military on the issue of sexual assault. In the 2012 campaign, you were very involved in specific controversies, even calling Sandra Fluke, for example. Yet you have refused to say anything about the conduct of a fellow Democrat, Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego, who refuses to resign. Aren’t you setting a bad example on sexual assault, as commander-in-chief, in the Filner case?
5. Edward Snowden has continued to reveal new information about the National Security Agency’s abilities to gather information about Americans’ private communications. Leaving aside the question of whether the government should have that power, or whether you have broken past promises on civil liberties, the fact that these leaks happened at all is striking. Why is Gen. Keith Alexander still the head of the NSA?
4. Recently you announced that you were canceling a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, over the Snowden issue and gay rights. Yet last month, even after Putin indicated he might offer Snowden asylum, you were still offering drastic cuts in America’s nuclear arsenal. It looks like the “reset” with Russia is a failure, after so many concessions. Isn’t it time to stop offering new cuts to U.S. nuclear weapons?
3. You are backing the Senate immigration bill, which passed because Democrats agreed to include border security measures. Regardless of whether those measures are sufficient, they depend on a commitment to enforce the law as written. Yet you have refused to enforce existing immigration laws, even imposing a so-called “Dream Act” by fiat. Why should Americans trust you to enforce a new immigration law?
2. You campaigned on the promise to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet you have helped the Taliban open a new office in Qatar, complicating relations with President Hamid Karzai, and recently suggested that there could be a “zero option” in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, as the U.S. withdraws, Al Qaeda is on the offensive across the region, and might return. Are we not repeating the mistakes of the past in Afghanistan?
1. You are about to head into a new round of budget negotiations. Some Republicans leaders have suggested that they are willing to offer concessions on the budget sequester if you commit to entitlement reform. You have spoken in theory about making some cuts but have never presented a plan, on paper, and have rejected all suggestions, even the Simpson-Bowles commission. Where is your plan to reform entitlements?
Bonus question: Last month, you spoke at length about how the African-American community views the death of Trayvon Martin case. You also asked people to respect the decision of the jury. Yet your Department of Justice is still aggressively investigating George Zimmerman, who is living in hiding, though all previous investigations showed no racial bias. Aren’t you violating Zimmerman’s civil rights?
UPDATE – Additional bonus question (from the comments): When you signed the Affordable Care Act, it included the Grassley amendment, subjecting members of Congress and their staff to the same rules as everyone else. Yet this week you signed off on special subsidies for members of Congress and their staff. Given your focus on inequality, how do you justify giving Congress Obamacare subsidies?
UPDATE 2 – Another bonus question (via Twitter): There is no longer any doubt that Nidal Hasan was motivated by radical Islamist beliefs. In May, you actually acknowledged for the first time that the Ft. Hood attack was an act of “Islamic jihad.” Yet your administration still considers is “workplace violence,” which denies victims certain benefits. Isn’t it time to declare the Ft. Hood shootings a terrorist act?

Ophthalmologist and Democratic political donor Dr. Salomon Melgen may have tried to buy cover from the IRS for the $11.1 million he owes in back taxes from 2006 to present, Breitbart News has learned. Melgen may have intended to court politicians with political donations and prostitutes with the hopes that they would help him wipe his IRS slate clean.
Melgen was a political donor from as far back as the early 1990s. According to Federal Election Commission records published on the Center for Responsive Politics website OpenSecrets.org, Melgen made his first political donation to a young first-term Democratic U.S. Congressman: Bob Menendez. After that $500 donation, Melgen’s friendship with Menendez developed further (the two were reportedly close before Menendez first took office).
Meanwhile, Melgen and his wife Flor started making more political donations to Menendez and other politicians and groups. As the years went by, the donations grew in size. Melgen became a regular on the political circuit. He hosted fundraisers for candidates and became close with the Clinton family throughout the 1990s. Salomon and Flor Melgen donated $2,000 total to President Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign, after having given $3,000 to Hillary Clinton’s brother–Hugh Rodham–for his failed 1994 U.S. Senate bid out of Florida. 


The donations continued to grow in size and quantity before Melgen began facing tax problems with the IRS in July 2002. The Free Beacon reports that the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Melgen for about $1.3 million then for unpaid taxes dating back to 1999, and that lien was released in November 2002.
Melgen continued supporting Democratic politicians from Florida and some other higher-profile Democrats around the country. He and his wife supported now-former Sens. Chris Dodd and Bob Graham, and Sens. Tom Harkin Chuck Schumer and Bill Nelson. He threw some cash to then House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (who reared Nancy Pelosi in House politics in the early 2000s after he lost the House Majority to Newt Gingrich in the 1994 elections.
After that original tax lien was wiped away–at this time, the details of why the lien was removed are unclear–all was going well for Melgen until, in 2008, he got slapped with another lien. According to the Free Beacon, the IRS charges in that lien that Melgen owed $6.2 million in back taxes dating to 1998. That second lien was lifted in August 2011.

It was in the middle of these first two liens–around the beginning of 2006–that Melgen ramped up his political activity. Until then, from that first donation to Menendez in 1993, Melgen and his wife Flor had donated a total of $88,360 to political candidates and groups. Save for two anomalies–a $250 donation to former Florida Republican Rep. Mark Foley, who resigned after his own sex scandal hit him, and a $1,000 donation his wife Flor gave to George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s–Melgen and his family didn’t donate to Republicans.
From the beginning of 2006 to present, Melgen almost quadrupled his political donation activity of the previous decade or longer. In the past seven years, he, his wife, and his daughter Melissa–who is the marketing director for her father’s eye clinic company–donated a total of $324,600 to political figures and groups. Like before, most of that went to Democrats.
According to a current Dominican Republic government official this reporter interviewed while writing for The Daily Caller before joining Breitbart News, Melgen allegedly began hosting sex parties replete with “sex, hookers and drinking.” Menendez allegedly attended these parties. While the senator and his staff deny prostitution parties took place at the villa or that Menendez participated in them–even though two prostitutes have alleged, in an interview with this reporter who broke the original story while at The Daily Caller, that they were paid to have sex with Menendez–Menendez’s staff admitted the senator flew to the Dominican on Melgen’s private plane on three occasions and told NBC News’ Michael Isikoff that Menendez stays at Melgen’s villa while there about twice a year.
The Dominican official told this reporter Menendez has allegedly been attending these sex parties at Melgen’s villa “for at least the past three years, probably longer.”
Back in the United States, Melgen continued increasing his political profile as a donor. In 2011, he expanded his reach outside the Democratic Party to begin funding two prominent Hispanic Republicans’ political efforts. He and his wife pushed Florida Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Over the course of 2011 and 2012, the Melgens donated $10,000 to Diaz-Balart and $9,800 to Ros-Lehtinen–a powerful congresswoman who at the time chaired the House Foreign Relations Committee.

As these sex parties allegedly continued in the Dominican, and Melgen continued building his political profile with bigger and bigger donations to higher and higher profile politicians–all while flying his private jet around–the doctor’s tax problems went from bad to worse. The Free Beacon reports that in May 2011 Melgen was hit with another IRS tax lien, this one for $11.1 million in unpaid taxes dating back to 2006. The previous $6.2 million lien was still in effect for another few months before the IRS released it in August 2011–meaning the doctor had $17.3 million in liens against him at that point.
The $11.1 million lien remains in place to this day. But in April 2011, one month before the IRS filed this additional lien for $11.1 million, and four months before the earlier $6.2 million IRS lien was released, the doctor and journalist Emilio Sanchez founded Hispanic media company VOXXI. Sanchez is the CEO.

“At VOXXI, we aim to fill a void in the mainstream media by delivering great journalism and telling captivating stories that educate, engage and entertain, all with a Hispanic touch and enriched by the power of social media,” VOXXI said in its mission statement. “We will defend the role of Hispanics in this nation by providing a news platform where Latinos can be heard and respected. As an independent voice, VOXXI fosters an open and dynamic dialogue, empowering our community to act and react on current events and trends.”
Documents filed with Florida’s Secretary of State’s office show Melgen is listed as the managing member of La Vox LLC, the limited liability company that owns VOXXI.
A few months later, at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., Melgen and Sanchez threw a bash celebrating VOXXI’s launch. Photos published online from the event show attendees other than Melgen and Sanchez include: Menendez, Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen, among many other politicians.

In a phone interview with Breitbart News on Thursday, Sanchez said the Menendez-Melgen story had nothing to do with his website. “There is no relationship between VOXXI and the Dr. Salomon Melgen–Senator Robert Menendez story,” he said. “We don’t have to make a statement.”
When asked if Melgen owned 100 percent of La Vox LLC or had a controlling interest in the company, Sanchez responded: “I don’t have to give you financial information on the company.”
Sanchez also said an earlier report from LatinoRebels.com that his company would be releasing a statement on the scandal was “not true,” and that his company won’t release a statement.
Through a spokeswoman, Diaz-Balart refused to comment to Breitbart News when asked for details on his connections to Melgen. A spokesperson for Ros-Lehtinen has not returned several requests for comment.
About two months after that event was Easter week. That week is the timeframe in which two women from the Dominican Republic alleged, in an interview with this reporter, they were under-paid to have sex with Menendez; they claim they were promised $500 each but say they only received $100 apiece.
Shortly after that Easter-week incident, a tipster who goes by the name “Peter Williams” alerted the George Soros-funded Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which began investigating. CREW alerted ABC News reporter Rhonda Schwartz, who also started investigating but for reasons unknown never ran a story, and the FBI.
FBI Special Agent Regino Chavez launched an inquiry into the prostitution angle of this scandal as it relates to Menendez and Melgen as early as August 1, 2012, emails show. In September 2012, Chavez emailed “Williams” to tell him that the FBI had been able to “confirm most of” the information he was providing on that front and that the FBI “know[s] that you are providing accurate information.”
As Schwartz never continued to not run a story on the matter and CREW didn’t publish anything either–while the FBI worked its will–this reporter got wind of the allegations floating around there. Early on November 1, 2012, this reporter broke the story in The Daily Caller.
A couple weeks ago, the emails between “Williams” and the FBI’s Chavez surfaced, as did many more details.
Over the ensuing months since the story first broke, ABC News has not run a story. While guest-hosting ABC’s Sunday news show “This Week,” the network’s foreign affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz had Menendez on for six minutes and chose not to ask about the FBI inquiry. Media coverage elsewhere has been scant as well. 
Melgen’s personal media company has ignored the story, something a VOXXI spokeswoman told Breitbart News has been a decision made by leadership. “It was an editorial decision,” VOXXI spokeswoman Julissa Bonfante said when asked why the outlet didn’t cover it.
Breitbart News’ Michael Patrick Leahy contributed to this report.

The ongoing scandal involving Internal Revenue Service targeting of Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status took a step closer to the White House last week when testimony from retiring IRS tax law specialist Carter Hull before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee pointed investigators directly to the agency’s Office of Chief Counsel. 
Though Hull did not specifically name IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins as the person who ordered him to send Tea Party group applications to his office “for further review,” Hull’s testimony brought the Obama political appointee to the forefront in the ever expanding scandal.
On July 18, Hull testified that in March 2011 Judy Kindell, a senior technical advisor to Lois Lerner, then the head of the IRS tax exempt division, “told me to forward my recommendations [concerning the approval of Tea Party group applications for tax exempt status] to the Office of Chief Counsel for their review.”


Hull was asked if Ms. Kindell agreed with his earlier recommendations that the IRS had sufficient information at that time to make a determination on the Tea Party groups applications for tax-exempt status.

“She did not say whether she agreed or not. She said it should go to chief counsel,” Hull told the committee. 
On Tuesday the connection between Wilkins and the White House was strengthened when several media outlets reported that Wilkins met with the President at the White House on April 23, 2012, just two days before the IRS issued a revised set of BOLO (“Be on the lookout”) instructions to IRS agents reviewing tax-exempt applications that appear to target Tea Party groups for more stringent review standards.
Also on Tuesday, True the Vote, a Tea Party group that focuses on preventing voter fraud and was one of the groups subjected to IRS targeting, announced that it is suing Mr. Wilkins, adding him to the list of defendants in the lawsuit it filed against the IRS in May of this year.
Wilkins, a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School, has been a partner with Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale, and Door (also known as WilmerHale), the prestigious Washington, D.C. law firm, since 1988. According to Federal Election Commission records, Mr. Wilkins has donated generously to political candidates over the years, most of them affiliated with the Democratic Party. In 2008 he represented Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s Chicago church, the one which President Obama attended for twenty years, on a pro bono basis before the IRS. President Obama named him Chief Counsel at the IRS in April, 2009.

When the trifecta of scandals first broke over the White House a few weeks ago, the media (who were literally blocking the truth from getting out about the IRS and Benghazi) were so caught off guard that for a couple of weeks they accidentally acted like real media and just reported the facts. Over Memorial Day weekend that all changed. 
It is fairly obvious that the media used the three-day weekend to gather themselves, talk to the White House, and coordinate talking points with one another. The result of this coordination has been apparent in the words “overreach,” “McCarthyism,” “disarray,” and “no GOP agenda” — all being uttered simultaneously across media platforms that are supposed to compete, not coordinate, with one another. 


The idea is for the media to revert to form. Rather than seek the truth, the media will go back to attacking those seeking the truth. Obama’s approval rating is going down, his left-wing agenda and legacy are in jeopardy, and the bleeding must be stopped. 
Another piece of coordination between media and Democrats reared its ugly head today in the most expected of places: Politico. No one takes more glee in savaging private citizens who dare not support Obama than Obama’s bullying thugs at Politico. 
During Tuesday’s testimony, Congressional Democrats attacked the private citizens brought before them to tell their individual horror stories. The witnesses were Tea Party groups and other conservative groups put through months of paralyzing harassment by an IRS that had intentionally singled them out based on their political beliefs. 

Democrats, however, did not care about the fact that these groups had been targeted, and they kept insinuating that these groups deserved the IRS scrutiny due to their political activity.  
Well, that is not the point and everyone knows it. Had the IRS put the same number of left-leaning groups through the same hyper-scrutiny as they did right-leaning groups, none of this would be happening. There would be no scandal.
But the idea here is to change the subject from the fact that the IRS singled out Obama’s political foes for paralyzing scrutiny in the run-up to Obama’s re-election campaign, to the supposed abuse of a tax exempt status by conservative political groups.  
The thinking goes that if Democrats can make the Tea Party look like tax cheats it will take the heat off of Obama and further damage his opponents. 
Well, right on cue, Politico arrives this morning like the cavalry with an appallingly dishonest (but expected) piece of reporting that falls right in line with what Congressional Democrats did yesterday. It is as pure a piece of coordination and left-wing propaganda as you will ever read. 

And this is the only kind of investigative reporting Politico ever does. Imagine if Politico poured these same resources into investigating the IRS’s connections to the White House or the shaping of the IRS talking points by the State Department. 
But today’s Politico piece is all about changing the subject. All it looks at is the political activity of yesterday’s Tea Party witnesses in order to make a case that they deserved scrutiny from the IRS. 
The Politico piece, however, intentionally ignores the fact that this is not the point of the scandal. The point is that these groups were singled out for harassment by their own government. 
The Politico piece intentionally ignores and chooses not to report on all the political activity of tax-exempt left-leaning groups (like Obama’s Organizing for America) — groups approved by the IRS, that are every bit as political as those on the right who were paralyzed by lengthy and intrusive questionnaires and  threats of perjury-those who had their information leaked to the media. 
Working directly with the Democrats, Politico is now putting in overtime to desperately steer subject away from and distract from partisan horrors committed by the IRS. 
The actual crime is no longer the story, according to Politico. No, the story is that the victims had it coming.

Senate Democrats, including Senate Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray, are hiding their budget from their Republican colleagues, Breitbart News has learned exclusively. Murray did share her budget plan with her Democratic colleagues on Tuesday. 
The budget is scheduled for markup on Wednesday morning in committee, and senators are only expected to read opening statements at the hearing. It will not be until later on Wednesday that Republicans will be allowed to read the full budget proposal.
House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, on the other hand, shared his budget with his Democratic colleagues ahead of its release. It is unclear why Murray will not show the budget to Republicans ahead of the Wednesday morning markup hearing. A Murray spokesman has not immediately returned Breitbart News’ request for comment.


A Senate Republican aide told Breitbart News it is possible Senate Democrats will not share their budget ahead of its public release with their colleagues across the aisle because it embarrasses them.

“I think it speaks volumes about Senate Democrats’ fear of the American people that they must hide their plan until they’ve first had a chance to mislead the media about it,” the Senate GOP aide said in an email. “If they had courage and confidence their plan would be popular, they would have been on the Sunday shows and holding press conferences bragging about it, as did Chairman Ryan. Instead, it’s leaks and crickets.”
What is known about Murray’s budget is already proving problematic for the Democrats. The Hill reports the budget includes $1 trillion in tax hikes; Murray claims it contains about $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction between spending cuts and tax hikes. Murray’s budget also voids sequester cuts for the next nine years.
The Hill‘s Erik Wasson notes that “once the sequester cuts are turned off, Murray’s budget appears to reduce deficits by about $800 billion, using the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline.” He adds that Murray’s budget “does not contain net spending cuts with the sequester turned off.”
The Murray budget, according to Wasson, also includes “reconciliation instructions on tax reform, a move that could allow the budget, which cannot be filibustered in the Senate, to become the legislative vehicle for a tax reform bill.”
Murray is supposedly moving forward with that idea even though such a stunt is likely to spark massive Democratic Party infighting. Wasson notes that Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, “has opposed including the instructions in the budget, arguing it would tie his hands in tax reform.”
A spokesperson for Baucus has not responded to Breitbart News’ request for comment on how he feels about Murray’s move to include tax reform reconciliation in the budget package.

When the subject of Hollywood and President Barack Obama comes up, most people think of the celebrities who cut videos supporting the leader’s two runs for the White House.
Others might name check movie producer Harvey Weinstein, one of Obama’s most vocal backers.


They all pale in comparison to studio mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks fame, who Mother Jones dubs the Kingmaker of the Democrat party. That hardly describes Katzenberg’s impact on two presidential elections, particularly the 2012 contest.


Katzenberg gave $3.15 million to Democratic super-PACs during the 2012 cycle–almost 30 times more than his total reported giving in 2008. (There’s no telling how much he might have given to other groups that don’t disclose their donors.) He steered millions more to Priorities–his friend and business partner, Steven Spielberg, gave $1 million, for instance. He hosted numerous fundraisers for Obama and raised more for the president than anyone else in California. All told, Katzenberg gave or raised more than $30 million to reelect Obama, helping Hollywood make up for Wall Street’s plummeting financial support of the president.

Of course, all that money means Katzenberg can get a few favors done when the need arises. And when his movie studio wanted to branch out into China, all those donations came in handy.

Obama officials say they respect Katzenberg not only for his fundraising, but also because he has no specific “ask”–no ambassadorship to Switzerland, no regulatory tweak, no nights in the Lincoln Bedroom. Even so, being Hollywood’s liaison to Washington has its perks: Obama takes Katzenberg’s calls, and he and his political adviser, Andy Spahn, visited the White House almost 50 times between them during Obama’s first term. (Not all of Spahn’s visits had to do with Katzenberg.) It has also left him well positioned to advocate for his industry’s and his company’s interests in China’s booming film market.

Hollywood stars like Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis deplore the impact of unfettered cash on the political process. They even made a movie about it–The Campaign.
Will they consider a sequel targeting King Katzenberg? Don’t count on it. Money is only evil when it props up the wrong (read: right) politicians.

On Wednesday, as Tea Party activists rallied against the IRS and the Senate immigration bill on Capitol Hill, President Barack Obama’s campaign-turned-lobbying arm, Organizing for Action (OfA), emailed a warning about “threats on women’s health” in Congress. It urged its members to sign a petition against a “terrifying” decision the GOP “to stand between a woman and her doctor when it comes to her health care decisions.”
Meanwhile, for the past several weeks, Republicans have sent fundraising pitches to their donors expressing indignation over the IRS scandal, in which the agency targeted conservative groups on the basis of their names and views for additional, and excessive, scrutiny. They are seeking to capitalize on grass-roots outrage–outrage that is often equally directed at Republican leadership–as they ramp up campaign efforts for 2014.


The OfA email about abortion is a re-hash of the 2012 presidential campaign’s “war on women” theme–and is aided, once again, by the mainstream media’s eagerness to focus on conservative gaffes, to the exclusion of mistakes by the president or members of his party. In addition to the abortion issue, Democrats are seizing on controversy over sexual assault in the military to signal to female voters that they are fighting for them.

The abortion issue has, in fact, gained new poignancy–though not in a way that favors the pro-choice side. The trial and conviction of Dr. Kermit Gosnell for the gruesome murders of babies delivered at his abortion clinic was ignored by the mainstream media but inspired pro-life activists to press for legislation limiting abortions past 20 weeks–the bill that inspired the OfA email but which, curiously, it does not describe.
Democrats are clearly worried about a midterm lull–which is why they have not only found it necessary to re-ignite old issues, but to share, selectively, in conservative outrage. As the IRS scandal has unfolded, for example, Democrats have strained to argue that “progressive” and liberal non-profits were also “targeted” by the IRS. Some Democrats have also split openly with the White House over the NSA and Prism scandals.
Meanwhile, Republicans are buoyed by a sense that frustration at the Obama administration scandals will help bring millions of conservative voters back to the polls after many apparently sat out the 2012 contest. The redistricting that followed the 2010 elections will also help ensure the party holds the House. But the race for the Senate has pit the GOP establishment against the base, as have issues like immigration reform. 
In that context, the IRS scandal represents a rare point of unity, which is why even those Republicans busily defending the NSA’s surveillance programs against the party’s resurgent libertarian wing are citing the IRS scandal as a legitimate grievance. The full extent of the IRS abuses is unknown, and questions remain about who ordered the targeting, and why. Yet the issue has already become part of the 2014 election lexicon.
Midterm elections typically have lower turnout than presidential elections, which is why the 2014 effort by both sides will be aimed at motivating their party’s base voters. Republicans already have a wide variety of new conservative grievances to harness; Democrats are, thus far, returning to themes that have worked in the past. In the thick of the fight, the actual issues at the core of these debates risk being hijacked or obscured.

California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Friday that a provision in House GOP leadership’s “no budget, no pay” plan is unconstitutional.
“That’s unconstitutional,” Issa said of House leadership’s plan to withhold the pay of members of Congress if they don’t pass a budget by April 15.
The plan offers to raise the debt ceiling for three months, and the Senate must pass a budget by the end of that time period-April 15. If they fail to pass the budget by April 15, members of Congress wouldn’t be paid.


Issa said that would interfere with the 27th amendment to the Constitution, which doesn’t allow pay for members of Congress to change until after an election. “No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened,” the 27th amendment reads.

Hours before, American Majority Action spokesman Ron Meyer also said the plan was unconstitutional for the same reason. Because of that, Meyer said “No Budget No Pay” couldn’t “take effect until next Congress.”
Meyer also said in an email that “numerous conservative members of the House have already come out and said they won’t vote for a plan which doesn’t cut spending.” At this time, it’s unclear if “No Budget No Pay” will cut any spending.
UPDATED (5:40pmET): In a statement to Breitbart News after this piece was published, Issa said he “strongly support[s] the House Republican leadership’s proposal to link the debt ceiling increase to passage of a budget by the Senate which has gone 1360 days without passing a blueprint for federal spending.  While the 27th Amendment prohibits Congress from varying its own pay within a given Congress, as I noted in my interview it can certainly withhold pay.  I have not read the legislative text of the ‘No Budget, No Pay’ proposal and how it approaches historically difficult questions about Congressional compensation.  I would note that there has even been legal action taken challenging the current system that gives Members of Congress an automatic pay-raise.  I have been an advocate for the strategy of linking a debt ceiling increase to passage of a budget as an effective way of forcing President Obama to focus on our nation’s long term fiscal situation.  I expect the final proposal brought before the House will have resolved any constitutional questions and that it will have my support.”

I’d like to congratulate the voters of Australia for doing what the voters of America should have done in 2012:
Australia’s conservative leader Tony Abbott swept into office in national elections on Saturday as voters punished the outgoing Labor government for six years of turbulent rule and for failing to maximize the benefits of a now fading mining boom.


Abbott, a former boxer, Rhodes scholar and trainee priest, promised to restore political stability, cut taxes and crack down on asylum seekers arriving by boat.
“From today I declare that Australia is under new management and Australia is once more open for business,” Abbott told jubilant supporters in Sydney.
America, on the other hand, will not be open for business until 2017 at the earliest.

It’s always a mistake to overstate the similarities between different national political environments – the differences are profound in even the most similar countries.  But there are some sharp parallels to be drawn here, particularly on the need for pro-growth tax cuts, and the squandering of a natural resources revolution.  Obama’s War On Energy has some similarities to the way Australians seem to feel their mining boom was wasted:
The election was been pitched as a choice on who is best to lead the A$1.5 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy as it adjusts to an end to a prolonged mining investment boom, fuelled by China’s demand for its abundant natural resources.
Abbott, 55, built up a strong opinion poll lead on the back of promises to rein in government spending, scrap an unpopular tax on carbon emissions, and stop the flow of refugee boats arriving in Australia’s northwest.
His campaign had support from media magnate Rupert Murdoch and his Australian newspapers, which have urged voters to reject Rudd’s Labor government. Australia’s other major newspaper group Fairfax also called for a change of government, saying
Rudd had painted Abbott’s planned spending cuts as dangerous European-style austerity and said his government was best placed to manage an economy that is slowing but remains the envy of much of the developed world.

This is really a golden moment for any aspiring capitalist economy to eat America’s lunch.  We’re years away from being remotely competitive.  The Obama Democrats are hell-bent to double down on his failed policies, not just due to ideological rigidity, but because Obama’s ego will never allow him to admit he’s been fundamentally wrong about everything for five years.  
And the American ruling class has become quite obsessed with using socialist policies to build invulnerable voting coalitions of government dependents.  They take Obama’s re-election as a sign that the American electorate is reasonably comfortable with the New Normal of double-digit real unemployment, expensive gas, a declining standard of living, out-of-control government spending, and all the rest of it.  The bar of economic leadership was lowered to accommodate President Obama; the ruling class doesn’t think it will be raised any time soon.
Now is your moment, aspiring capitalist tigers of the world.  The American workforce is buried under food stamps and long-term disability checks; employers are wrapped in chains of regulation, held tightly shut with the padlocks of ObamaCare.  No corporation in its right mind would relocate into the American quagmire of soaring corporate taxes (with class-warfare battle cries signaling even worse to come), high labor costs, and crushing regulatory burdens.  Every CEO in the world watched Democrats march Apple Inc. executives into a show trial and berate them for daring to keep their offshore revenue offshore, instead of bringing it home so Uncle Sam could cut himself a thick slice.  They all watched Obama and his party present irresponsible government deficits as an argument for tax increases, rather than government reform.  
A weakened America has turned away from its bedrock principles of economic liberty.  A huge void is waiting to be filled.

No one can argue with the fact that Paul Ryan’s compromise budget bill raises taxes and increases spending. Show me one Republican who got elected on that platform. Spare America the Orwellian word games. If the government is taking money out of your pocket to fund its growing Big Brother operations, it’s a tax. Whether money is taken from you via your phone bill, your airline ticket, or your income, it’s a tax. If politicians can’t be honest about this, it’s time to go home. 
The TEA Party’s very acronym stands for “Taxed Enough Already.” We sent these politicians to Congress in an historic landslide election in 2010 with a mandate to stop the runaway spending train bankrupting our nation, not to wave to it from the station or – heaven forbid – increase its speed. And yet, here we are still pretending that there are no real world consequences to running up near trillion dollar deficits year after year with no end in sight.


So, where does this leave us? We can sit back and accept the increased spending “Compromised Plan” with increases in taxes and spending, or we can charge ahead to at least preserve the very modest Sequester cuts American workers already fought for. If we go with the first option, we simply kick the can down the road yet again and wait for the inevitable real world consequences of bankruptcy (see Detroit for an example of what’s in store). Or we can go with the second option and probably get clobbered by the media (so what’s new?!).

The Political Establishment will no doubt tell us that a budget battle will distract us from the fight against Obamacare. But that excuse is just the latest variation in the Establishment’s old canard that they’re keeping their powder dry for the next big battle which never seems to materialize because they’re always too busy waving the white flag and following the path of least resistance until election day.
Enough is enough!
Here’s the deal, folks. The media will clobber us no matter what. We do not want more taxes. We want Congress to rein in spending and live within its means. (What’s so radical about that?!) Americans have gotten quite an education recently in wasteful government spending as we’ve all seen how the federal government can blow a billion dollars on a website that doesn’t work. 
Do these members of Congress really think they can justify every tax dollar they spend and still demand more from hard working Americans by increasing our taxes?
2014 is just around the corner. If any member of Congress thinks raising taxes and increasing wasteful spending is a winning strategy to run on, then by all means they should vote for the Ryan budget. We’ll be watching.

2533	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/27/Sequester-Politics-Dems-Set-to-Blame-GOP-for-Budget-Cuts-Potential-Gov-t-Shutdown	News	0	Economy	Elections	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"

Just as they did with the sequester, Democrats will try to blame Republicans for a potential government shutdown or cuts to the budget that may occur as part of a new debt deal this fall. 
Politico reported that, “President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies are eager to tag the GOP as the root cause of Washington dysfunction.” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Kelly Ward told the publication that Democrats are planning to highlight “the inability of Republicans to actually govern” and make that into a central “narrative” going into the 2014 midterm elections.
Even though the sequester idea originated in the White House, as Bob Woodward documented, Obama and Democrats tried to blame Republicans for the calamity that it would cause. Those tactics largely backfired, as a majority of Americans favored the across-the-board budget cuts.


Yet House Republicans and their advisers still remain fearful of Democrats and their tactics that have just recently failed, believing that a government shutdown over de-funding Obamacare or budget cuts would lose Republicans the House.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, said, “If you ask me what is the one thing that could reshuffle the deck on an otherwise stable mid-term environment in 2014, the answer is a government shutdown.” Brock McCleary, a GOP pollster and former NRCC deputy executive director, agreed, saying the “only way Republicans will lose the House is to shut down the government or default on the debt.”
The current continuing resolution to fund the government expires on Sept. 30, and the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit shortly after. Republicans have a 17-seat majority in the House and only four Republicans represent Districts that lean Democratic, which means Republicans will be more vulnerable from the right. Republican voters in most Republican House Districts want them to be more fiscally conservative and de-fund Obamacare. 
Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said his voters would “rather see Republicans veer more to the right” on fiscal matters, and Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, said, “the greatest risk for Republicans is for them to continue to disappoint their supporters. I don’t think they’ve inspired them or given them a reason to support them in quite a while.”
“At some point, they have to communicate to people there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats,” he told the publication.

So Ted Cruz doesn’t trust the Republicans. Imagine that.
“Let me be clear” he said on the Senate floor the other day. “I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats.” And why not? The last four years have given us all ample reason not to trust the Democrats, as $1 trillion deficits have become the new normal and the national debt has zoomed toward $17 trillion, all under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid team’s watch.
But what about the Republicans, who so often claim to be the party of limited government? The truth is, the GOP’s record is seldom as grand as its rhetoric. Aside from a few Tea Party stalwarts, plenty of Republican senators are ready to throw in the towel on the debt ceiling, let it go up, and get a few scraps from the Democrats in return.


“Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,” Cruz was quoted in the New York Times. “There are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.”
He is right about that. Senior Republican staffers in Congress tell me that members of the Republican Leadership in both houses of Congress are terrified of not raising the debt ceiling, having been convinced that calamity will ensue if we don’t. But the alternative? Senate Majority Leader McConnell would, I am told, be happy to see the debt ceiling raised with no Republican votes. Then Republicans can beat up Democrats for raising it, while knowing that the economy won’t explode as Paul Krugman has warned it would. 
And if House Speaker John Boehner had to choose between a clean debt ceiling increase (one with no limits, allowing Obama to keep raising it ad nauseum) and no debt ceiling increase at all, I am told he would take the former by conservatives in the House of Representatives.

So the establishment Republican mind-set says, “More debt is better than a melt-down, but at least get something in return, even if it doesn’t mean much, we have something to run against the Democrats with.” What do they want in return? They know they don’t have the votes to get much in the way of budget cuts, so they can at least keep the base happy with talk about “economic growth.”
When Cruz, who is anything but your traditional freshman back-bench Senator, said he didn’t trust Republicans, the party establishment, led by John McCain, howled in response. But where is the Republican leadership’s credibility? When they last held real power, these Republicans goosed up domestic discretionary spending faster than it rose under Bill Clinton and piled on the debt.
It was under a Republican president and Congress that we got Medicare Part D, the biggest new entitlement since LBJ’s Great Society. The prescription drug benefit added trillions to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities, passed only when party bosses needed to violate normal procedures to get the votes to pass it. Former U.S. Comptroller David Walker called it “the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s.”
Medicare’s chief actuary, Richard Foster, later said he was threatened not to reveal that the drug benefit’s price tag would exceed $400 billion in the first ten years. This figure was necessary under congressional rules to keep the bill from being blocked on a point of order. Foster estimated the real price tag was in excess of $500 billion. Several GOP congressmen would also recount arm-twisting tactics from the party leadership that went beyond the norm.
Instead of reducing the federal role in education, the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress gave us No Child Left Behind, which helped double the size of the Department of Education, a Cabinet-level agency Republicans had pledged to abolish as recently as 1996. John Boehner, now the speaker of the House, was an NCLB sponsor and described its enactment as “one of the proudest accomplishments of my tenure in Congress.”

Under a Republican president and Congress, a $128 billion surplus was replaced by a $455 billion deficit. By the time George W. Bush left office, the shortfall was $1.2 trillion. Discretionary spending went up faster in Bush’s first term than it did in eight years under Bill Clinton. Under Bush’s watch, the federal budget exceeded $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion, for the first time. Most of these milestones were reached before the Democrats retook Congress. Federal spending rose from 18.4 percent of GDP to an average of 20.51 percent under Bush.
Bush and the Republican establishment bailed out the Wall Street banks with the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (with Democratic support, naturally). They bailed out the auto industry. They even pioneered a pre-Obama stimulus program, with similar results. The deficits and government growth would later endanger the Bush tax cuts, one of the signature conservative policy achievements of the period.
The Republicans who would negotiate the debt ceiling with the Democrats in a conference will be the same people who voted for all this big government and their successors. This unfortunately includes even Paul Ryan. What faith can we have that the results will be different this time?
So is there any doubt at all why Ted Cruz doesn’t trust Republicans? He explained that he thinks “a whole lot of Americans likewise don’t trust the Republicans and the Democrats because it is leadership in both parties that has gotten us in this mess.” 
Maybe we need new leadership.

Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote Wednesday that America is a nation being bankrupt by a federal government led by “venal politicians” in her response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union Address. 
“What is the true state of our union? Though this may sound harsh, I’ll speak the truth here,” Palin wrote. “We are a country going bankrupt to fund a bloated, distant, and often corrupt federal government led by venal politicians more concerned with paying off their campaign cronies and consolidating their own power than in preserving the constitutional republic that so many have fought and died for (including our brave men and women in uniform who were barely mentioned last night).”
Palin has assailed the “permanent political class” since her landmark speech in Indianola, Iowa in 2011 that introduced that language into the political bloodstream. Director Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Schweizer’s Government Accountability Institute have assailed D.C. as a “boomtown” that produces nothing but continues to get wealthier by expanding the size and scope of government. 


During the State of the Union address on Tuesday, Palin live-tweeted with the “#SOTUGottaBKiddingMe” hashtag, assailing Obama and Washington, D.C.’s permanent political class for their cronyism. After the speech, Palin called out Obama for not honoring slain ex-Navy Seal Chris Kyle or U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens during the address. After attending Kyle’s funeral on Monday, Palin said Obama needed to “pay his respects” to the fallen American hero. 
“If you missed President Obama’s State of the Union address last night, you didn’t miss much – especially if you watched any of his past four State of the Union addresses,” Palin wrote. “We heard the same recycled rhetoric, and we heard his Orwellian declaration that the cornucopia of new federal programs he proposed, as well as his intention to eradicate world poverty, wouldn’t ‘increase our deficit by a single dime.'”
Palin also referenced Paul Krugman, “one of President Obama’s economic cheerleaders at the New York Times,” who last week was “remarkably candid” when he said “death panels and taxes is how we do this.” 

“But wait, I thought there’d be no such thing as ‘death panels,’ liberal liars?” Palin asked sardonically.
“This is the long-term forecast for the state of America under Obama’s failed policies: middle class taxes and death panels,” Palin wrote. 
Left-wing politicians and journalists ridiculed Palin when she predicted the Affordable Care Act would lead to bureaucratic death panels rationing treatment. Politifact named “death panels” its Lie of the Year in 2009.  
“Our country didn’t weather a Revolution, two World Wars, a Civil War, a Great Depression, and countless other political and economic storms, just to be sunk by the dangerous policies of this current administration,” Palin wrote. “We’re stronger than this. As President Reagan said, ‘I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.'”
Palin concluded by urging Republicans to get ready for the 2014 midterm elections:  “So, do something. 2014 is just around the corner. Get motivated! Get organized. America, don’t retreat. In the words of yet another White House program, ‘Let’s move.'”

If there are any questions remaining about the changing of the guard in the GOP, Senator John McCain’s answer to a simple question about whom he would support in a potential 2016 presidential match-up between Hillary Clinton and Rand Paul should answer that. When asked for which one he would vote, McCain laughed and said: “It’s gonna be a tough choice.”
It is quite telling that McCain would say such a thing to the left-wing New Republic, especially after he seemed so outraged after the bungling and subsequent cover up surrounding the September 11 anniversary attacks on our consulate in Libya. 
Whatever differences McCain and Paul might have over policy, four people were murdered on Hillary Clinton’s watch at the State Department, and her reaction to those trying to get to the bottom of it were famously met with Clinton screeching, “What difference does it make?” 


Moreover, you would think Clinton’s indifference to repeated requests for increased security for our diplomatic team in Libya would border on something close to unforgivable for a former POW. Not to mention the fact no one in the administration even tried to rescue or reinforce a group of Americans under attack. 

But we are undoubtedly in the middle of a changing of the guard in the GOP. The McCains, Roves, and Grahams see their time coming to an end, and in response they have, at times, launched nihilistic campaigns against the Tea Party, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, etc. 
Rove runs to the New York Times to attack his own, McCain runs to the New Republic to slash away at one of our rising stars by giving The Grand Dame of Libya  a credibility boost…
Seems that the mayors of the village are willing to burn it down rather than see themselves replaced.

Politico notes that the biggest obstacle to Democrats’ hopes of re-taking the House of Representatives in 2014 may be President Barack Obama. And the reason? His crusade for gun control:

Adding to the complications of running as a conservative Democrat is the lingering presence of billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has essentially declared war on pro-gun Democrats. Last month, Bloomberg funneled $2 million into his super PAC to sink the fortunes of a pro-NRA Democrat in a special primary election for an Illinois congressional seat. (A Democrat closer to Bloomberg’s gun stance is expected to win the general election.)
Polls consistently show Obama’s positions on issues ranging from immigration to the minimum wage to gun control picking up wide support across the country. But the 2014 battle for the House won’t be fought nationally — it will most likely be decided in several dozen districts, all but a handful of which favor Republicans.

Politico understates the importance of that Illinois race. The Democrat whom Bloomberg–and Obama–backed, Robin Kelly, has said she is in favor of “banning guns” outright and boasted of her “F” rating from the NRA. David Axelrod mocked her opponent, former Rep. Debbie Halvorson, suggesting that she was ironically insensitive to the “carnage” in the district she was running to represent. The real irony was that the Obama machine had recruited the pro-Second Amendment Halvorson to run in 2008.



“@politico: NRA ally Debbie Halvorson could win Jesse Jackson Jr.’s Chicago seat: politi.co/Whw4xE“Ironic, given carnage in 2d CD.
— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) January 27, 2013

Kelly was backed by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), who is featured in today’s Breitbart News story talking about how the assault weapons ban is merely the first step in a long-term agenda to ban handguns.

That might work in urban districts where Democrats rarely lose. It won’t work in swing districts that Obama lost in 2012, which are the districts that Democrats need to pick up in 2014. And it can’t help that they have anti-gun zealots like Schakowsky and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi leading the charge.

Not for days, not for weeks, but for months, Joe Scarborough and his Morning Joe panel not only pushed, begged and berated Congress to pass new gun control laws — they threatened, shamed, mocked, and laughed in the faces of anyone who dared disagree. But Tuesday, voters in the bluer-than-red state-of Colorado told Scarborough and company to go get their shine box.  Here is their unforgettably awkward and red-faced reaction:
—



—
What we saw from Scarborough and company, in the months following the terrible murders at Sandy Hook Elementary, wasn’t even concern-trolling; it was The Sanctimony of Our Betters coming from those who had deluded themselves into believing the GOP and NRA were on the path to irrelevance unless they reversed course and restricted Americans’ Second Amendment civil rights with laws that would have done absolutely nothing to stop another Sandy Hook. 
To listen to Scarborough, it was NRA that was losing its political clout. To listen to Scarborough, it was the GOP ensuring they would lose seats. “Oh, no,” Joe screamed! “The ‘lying‘ GOP is doomed if they don’t listen to me and hand Obama a victory on guns!”

Even after Manchin-Toomey died in the Senate, Scarborough and his peanut-gallery practiced a scorched-earth policy to hammer the NRA and GOP as out-of-touch, suicidal nitwits for not caving to their relentless emotional blackmail and cherry-picked polls. 
Well, a funny thing happened on the way to Reality, a funny thing called democracy — something that would not have caught The Bubbled off-guard had they been adult enough to consider this poll, or perhaps this one. Tuesday in Colorado, although outspent by the opposition, everyday citizens, with some help from the NRA, booted out two Democrat State Senators for passing the same gun control laws Scarborough demanded the GOP pass in order to survive. 
In other words, Scarborough was 100% wrong — it is Democrats and Bloomberg’s anti-gun group that took a beating for taking Scarborough’s advice. 
So watch the video again… This what a boorish, unrelenting, shrill, dishonest, and holier-than-thou crusade looks like after it meets American Liberty.

Questions are being raised whether outgoing billionaire New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is courting Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe (D) to enact gun control measures in Virginia if he should win the statehouse in November. 
On Tuesday, voters in Colorado recalled two state senators–Angela Giron (D-Pueblo) and Senate President John Morse (D-Colorado Springs)–that supported Colorado Gov. John Hickenloooper’s (D) sweeping gun control legislation, which he signed into law in March. As Breitbart News reported, Morse lost his recall election 51 to 49 percent, and Giron lost hers by a “whopping 56 to 44 percent.”
Bloomberg reportedly called Hickenlooper on at least two occasions before the Colorado governor signed the gun control laws, and he gave $350,000 more to his Mayors Against Illegal Guns group to back the efforts of Morse and Giron to fight the recall efforts against them leading up to the elections. With Bloomberg’s gun control dreams fading in Colorado, he may be turning his sights on Virginia through McAuliffe.


At the end of August, as the Colorado recall efforts were heating up, Bloomberg and McAuliffe reportedly met in McAuliffe’s native state of New York. The meeting prompted Second Amendment advocates in Virginia to wonder if Bloomberg and McAuliffe may have discussed something similar to NY SAFE Act for Virginia as a condition of Bloomberg’s financial support or endorsing McAuliffe; this would presumably help McAuliffe court Virginia’s business-oriented independent voters, particularly in Northern Virginia. Virginia, like Colorado, is quickly becoming a national bellwether on a host of issues. 

As Breitbart News reported, at least “one New York-based gun manufacturer” decided to move from the state because of NY SAFE Act. The Syracuse Post-Standard noted the law “expands a ban on military-style weapons, requires mental health professionals to report threats, limits magazines to seven bullets, taxes bullets, and creates a registry.” 
Politico, which reported the meeting between McAuliffe and Bloomberg, said it was unclear what the meeting was for, but noted that Bloomberg has indeed spent more than $15 million on his Mayors Against Illegal Guns group and candidates who back his gun control agenda. 
In the RealClearPolitics average of polls, McAuliffe has nearly an eight-point lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli in the gubernatorial contest, though recent polls have found that roughly 10% of the electorate is undecided. Election forecasters have the race pegged as “lean McAuliffe” or “tossup”; it is often difficult to predict turnout in an off-year elections in which the most fervent supporters are the only ones guaranteed to go to the polls. 
As Breitbart News noted, McAuliffe reportedly purchased a gun for the first time in January of 2013, and the National Rifle Association has given him an “F” rating.

On Friday, the House voted for a resolution to keep government open but also defund ObamaCare. Within minutes, Nancy Mace, who is opposing Sen. Lindsey Graham in the GOP primary, issued a press release attacking Graham for his past criticism of the defunding strategy. In just two hours, Graham tweeted that he supported the House’s efforts to defund the unpopular health care law. Such is the power of primaries. 

I support the House-passed bill to Defund Obamacare. #SenateMustAct
— Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) September 20, 2013
As recently as July, Graham said that defunding ObamaCare was “a bridge too far for him.” Primary opponents do tend to focus a politician’s mind. 


Graham faces at least three opponents in next year’s primary contest. Normally, multiple challengers give an edge to incumbents, as opposition is split among several challengers. South Carolina, however, uses a run-off system. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, the top two voter-getters face off in a run-off. Multiple challengers increase the odds that Graham falls below 50% and has to face a run-off. 

Graham is no doubt a nice man and would make a good GOP Senator from a state like Maine. His representing South Carolina, however, is a wasted opportunity for conservatives. An East Coast John McCain does a disservice to the Palmetto State. 
Graham’s tweet in support of the House action indicates he is aware of the challenge before him. Few incumbents are so disliked by the grass-roots, both in South Carolina and across the country. A run-off election, with a single conservative challenger, would ignite national interest and possibly create a wave that washes over Graham.
His tweet in support of defunding ObamaCare was a good start. He now has to follow that up over the coming weeks.

Dana Bash of CNN reported Wednesday evening that all of the Democratic Senators facing re-election in 2014 would back a “new” proposal to delay the Obamacare enrollment deadline–not really “new,” since Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) already said he would propose legislation to delay the individual mandate, and House Republicans passed a bill in late September to avoid a government shutdown if the mandate were delayed.

new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline
— Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) October 23, 2013


The House proposal failed in the Senate, 54-46, on a party-line vote. Every single Democrat voted against the proposed delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, including those up for re-election in 2014, including red-state Democrats–all of them. If just five of them had shifted, the shutdown would have been avoided and the delay would have been passed–to face Obama’s veto, but the point would have been made.

Furthermore, there are sixteen Democrats facing re-election in the Senate, almost enough to override the president’s veto. If just a few more Democrats–perhaps the five planning to retire–had switched to back a delay that even the White House is said to be considering in one form or another, then Obama’s veto would not have been a threat. The disastrous Obamacare rollout, and the shutdown, would not have happened.
As I wrote on Sep. 23, that solution was “Win-win. Therefore unlikely.” But it should have happened, if the media had been more interested in the substance of the issue rather than whether Obama would win or lose. Instead, they helped Democrats and the media label the GOP as terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, “Gremlins” (my favorite) and suicide bombers–while some Republicans joined in the insults.
When the polls landed, Democrats became the “terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, and suicide bombers,” pressing their perceived advantage to demand the reversal of the budget sequester–at least until their allies in the media quietly warned them not to squander their victory. Now that some Democrats have embraced what Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and–yes–John Boehner fought for, no one is calling them nasty names.
What’s done is done–and Republicans will have to find a way back from what was, in the end, a very real political loss. But let it be noted, along the way, that the very same Democrats who will now be lining up to support a delay in the enrollment deadline or individual mandate were proud that they “never folded” in the debate just a few weeks ago. They had their chance to protect Americans. They protected Obama instead.

On Wednesday, CNN’s Dana Bash tweeted that all Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2014 will reportedly support a delay of Obamacare’s enrollment deadline. 
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who is up for re-election in 2014, wrote to Obama on Tuesday and asked him to delay the enrollment deadline for the individual mandate. “Given the existing problems with the website, I urge you to consider extending open enrollment beyond the current end date of March 31, 2014,” Shaheen wrote to the president. “Allowing extra time for consumers is critically important so they have the opportunity to become familiar with the website, survey their options and enroll.”
On Wednesday, Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR), who is facing a tough challenge in his 2014 re-election against Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR), came out in support of Shaheen’s call for a delay of the individual mandate’s enrollment deadline. Pryor had previously been on record as supportive of the mandate as is.


Now, according to CNN’s Bash, the Democratic Party is coordinating an effort to support a delay in the individual mandate.

“new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline,” Bash tweeted on early Wednesday evening.
Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is on record as supporting a one-year delay in the individual mandate as well, although Manchin is not up for re-election in 2014. 
The Democrats’ push comes shortly after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) recently launched a crusade against Obamacare. Cruz’s efforts and those of Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) showed the American people the president and Senate Democrats were unwilling to compromise on Obamacare, and the Democrats’ stubbornness resulted in a temporary partial government shutdown and a short-lived debt crisis scare. 
Many Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), have been predicting for months that the Democrats would look for an Obamacare “escape hatch” ahead of 2014.

In a speech at Boston’s Faneuil Hall on Wednesday afternoon, President Barack Obama discarded his now-infamous broken promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep your health insurance.” Instead, he offered a new promise: “You will be getting a better deal,” the president told health insurance consumers. 
He blamed insurance companies, not Obamacare, for the canceled policies:



Now, if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law, and you really like that plan, you were able to keep it. That’s what I said when I was running for office. That was part of the promise we made. But ever since the law was passed, if insurers decided to downgrade or cancel the substandard plans, what we said under the law is that you have got to replace them with quality, comprehensive coverage because that, too, was a central premise of the Affordable Care Act from the very beginning…
So if you’re getting one of these letters [canceling your insurance policy], just shop around in the new marketplace. That’s what it’s for…
For the fewer than 5% of Americans who buy insurance on your own, you will be getting a better deal. So anyone peddling the motion that insurers are canceling people’s plan without mentioning that almost all the insurers are encouraging people to join better plans with the same carrier and stronger benefits and stronger protections, while others will be able to get better plans with new carriers through the marketplace, and then many will get new help to pay for these better plans and make them actually cheaper–if you leave that stuff out, you’re being grossly misleading, to say the least.

Ignoring evidence that the “better deal” is often far more expensive than existing plans, the president updated his promise without apologizing for misleading voters for years about the consequences of Obamacare. He also ignored the fact that companies were compelled by the law to change their plans to comply with new rules.
Obama, repeating a common Democrat talking point, also cited Medicare Part D to claim that Democrats had helped Republicans improve that policy, even though they had opposed it. However, as Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC) pointed out in Congress earlier Wednesday, Medicare Part D is voluntary–unlike Obamacare.

It worked last time. Last year, when oral arguments in the Obamacare case seemed to go against the administration, the left targeted Chief Justice John Roberts with a series of attacks from President Barack Obama on down. The attacks may have worked, as Roberts apparently changed his vote and upheld Obamacare by effectively rewriting the legislation itself to define the individual mandate as a tax.
The attacks on Roberts last year included President Obama’s general–and bizarre–assertion that the Supreme Court could not overturn congressional legislation, as well as a direct attack on Roberts by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), who admonished the Chief Justice about “the proper role of the judicial branch.” The left media joined in enthusiastically, bullying the Chief Justice into deferring to Congress and the President.


This time, the charge is being led by the left media, including Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post, who penned a front-page article attacking Roberts for his past rulings on race and discrimination. Roberts’s Obamacare decision, or his support for overturning most of Arizona’s allegedly discriminatory immigration law (another 2012 debacle) apparently earned no points from Grim, who castigates Roberts for ignoring race.

“Roberts has in the past been dismissive of the need for voting rights protections or affirmative action, viewing the world as without the sort of racism that might require such remedies,” Grim writes scornfully. He seizes on Roberts’s skepticism that the Defense of Marriage Act was motivated by anti-homosexual animus, pointing to a passage in the Congressional Record about the moral disapproval of homosexuality.
Grim makes use of a familiar left-wing tactic: casting moral disapproval of homosexuality as moral disapproval of gay people. Many supporters of traditional marriage are careful to distinguish between the two. Moreover, Roberts asked: “So eighty-four Senators–it’s the same question I asked before–eighty-four Senators based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people?” He was not denying that some might have acted out of animus, but doubting that all had done so.
The point was not lost on Justice Elena Kagan, who quoted the same passage from the Congressional Record to which Grim refers. She admitted, after Roberts’s question, that most Senators who voted for the act likely did not act out of anti-gay bigotry. Grim ignores that and twists Roberts’s words to cast him as willfully blind–not just to anti-gay bigotry, but bigotry in general.
There is, Grim implies, one way for Roberts to redeem himself–for the moment, anyway–and that is to vote to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. Then he can prove he is not blind, or bigoted himself–until the next constitutional controversy comes up, when the left will dip its pens in poison again and attack the Chief Justice, believing him to be the Court’s weakest link. Based on his recent history, they would not be wrong.

2716	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/30/ben-sasse-nebraska-obamacare	News	0	Healthcare	Elections	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"
A novice Republican running in a rural state has shattered fundraising records campaigning as the “anti-Obamacare candidate.” In his first race for public office, Ben Sasse has raised nearly $750,000 in just eight weeks of the first quarter of his nascent candidacy, according to records being filed with the Federal Election Commission.
The massive haul highlights how lucrative campaigning against Obamacare can be for Republicans. It also underscores how deeply motivated conservative voters are to see that the sprawling healthcare law be killed.


A college president in his hometown of Fremont, Nebraska, Sasse is a newcomer to politics, but he has spent much of the past decade working on healthcare issues. As a top advisor to President Bush’s Health Secretary, Sasse worked to cut red tape and pushed market-based solutions over government mandates. Sasse also spent several years traveling the country giving speeches and advising companies about the dangers of Obamacare and how it will hike costs, constrict innovation, and ultimately provide terrible health care.
“I am the anti-Obamacare candidate,” Sasse said cheerfully. “Not only have I read the 2,300-page bill, I have actually spent years studying it and I understand just how devastating this will be to American businesses, families and taxpayers.”
It was Sasse’s health care expertise and his outspoken opposition to Obamacare that inspired former Nebraska GOP chairman Mark Fahleson to draft Sasse to run for the open seat left by Sen. Mike Johann’s retirement.

“2014 and probably 2016 will be about one thing more than anything else,” Fahleson said. “It will be about Obamacare and the false promises and reckless entitlement spending that are set to destroy this country. And I don’t know anybody who knows more about it and is more honest about the problems of Obamacare than Ben.”
Sasse’s campaign comes just as the crusade against Obamacare has hit a fevered pitch in Washington.
“Ted Cruz has finally shown the Republican establishment in Washington just how fed up voters are with the federal government and the notion that bureaucrats know what is best for patients,” said one political consultant who advised the Cruz campaign. “That’s why a guy knowledgeable about healthcare like Ben Sasse being in the Senate would be the most destructive thing to ever hit Obamacare.”
Sasse’s cash haul of nearly $750,000 from individual donors in his first quarter breaks Nebraska’s previous record of $526,000 from individual donors, set in 2007 by Johanns while he was sitting U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.
Shane Osborn, former state treasurer who has been running for the senate seat for six months, raised just $234,000 in his first quarter, according to FEC records.

Partisan loyalty trumped pro-Israel policy as Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) announced, over the objection of many of his constituents, that he would support the nomination of former Sen Chuck Hagel (R-NE) as Secretary of Defense today. Pro-Israel Democrats in the Senate majority who might have voted against Hagel, are now likely to support him in the wake of Schumer’s decision, making Hagel’s confirmation all but certain.
Even as pro-Israel advocates mobilized against Hagel’s appointment, the White House has worked hard behind the scenes to shore up his support. Yesterday, Hagel delivered a letter to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in which he expressed regret for his controversial comments about a “Jewish lobby” (though, as with an anti-gay remark in 1998, Hagel made the apologetic gesture to a third party, not to the target of his offensive comment).
Schumer’s announcement coincides with a long essay by Arianna Huffington in today’s Huffington Post in which she describes Hagel as a “neoconservative nightmare” and attempts to debunk criticisms of his candidacy. As with other defenses of Hagel, the Huffington post article does not make the case for Hagel–whose focus was foreign affairs, not defense, in his Senate days–but rather argues against Hagel’s opponents.


For example, Huffington attempts to dismiss concerns about Hagel’s temperament, calling them a “modern-day male version of the old dig that used to be directed at women.” Yet President Barack Obama himself made John McCain’s “temperament” an issue in the 2008 campaign–even mentioning it in his nomination acceptance speech–and Democrats rejected UN Ambassador John Bolton based on “temperament” concerns.

Huffington makes clear that the primary reason that President Obama nominated Hagel, and that Democrats are willing to overlook his anti-abortion, anti-climate change views, is that Hagel emerged as a potent critic of the Iraq War. Like many on the left, Hagel also has expressed the view that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the “core” of Middle East turmoil, and now supports defense cuts that he once warned strongly against.
Hagel’s supporters have been at great pains (even to the point of concocting outright lies) to defend him against charges of antisemitism–charges prompted by his poor record on Israel and his statement that members of Congress were “intimidated” by the so-called “Jewish lobby.” More than a poor choice of words, his critics argue, Hagel’s statement reflects a particular animus towards Israel and its political supporters.
The 2006 speech on the Senate floor in which Hagel called for a more even-handed approach to Israel and the Arab world is a case in point. Hagel’s words came at a time when Israeli civilians were under attack by Iranian-backed Hebollah, and Israel was isolated at the United Nations. Hagel’s premature call for an immediate cease-fire would have prevented Israel from responding to the threat–and sent a message of opposition.
Other critics, such as Alan Dershowitz, have focused less on Hagel’s position on Israel or his statement about a “Jewish lobby” and have instead questioned his policy towards Iran. Hagel has not only opposed military action to stop the Iranian nuclear program; he has also, at times, opposed sanctions. His appointment as Secretary of Defense sends a signal that the United States is not serious about countering the Iranian nuclear threat.
Huffington’s article barely mentions Iran, but does attempt to deal with another serious problem in Hagel’s record: namely, his staunch opposition to the surge in Iraq, which Hagel predicted would fail. Not only does Huffington defend Hagel’s position, but she even attempts to claim he was right: “Since then it’s become accepted gospel in Washington that the surge was successful. Accepted gospel that is, once again, wrong.”
Hagel’s supporters are not concerned about the facts of the surge, or whether Hagel is qualified for the job. What they want is a weakened Department of Defense, and with the appointment of an anti-war war veteran, they have one. Hagel’s opponents have not given up, but Schumer’s defection from the pro-Israel cause, and the willingness of gay advocates and green activists to overlook Hagel’s contrary past, have virtually sealed the win.

            NYT: July 14th 2013- CAIRO — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Egypt on Saturday for meetings with its newly elected Islamist president and the chief of its still-dominant military council, declaring that the United States “supports the full transition to civilian rule with all that entails.”
But after weeks of internal debate across the Obama administration over how to respond to the ongoing struggle between the president and the generals, Mrs. Clinton touched on it only lightly, saying she looked forward to working “to support the military’s return to a purely national security role.”


State Department officials said the meeting itself sent a historic message. Seated in an ornate room in the presidential palace, Mrs. Clinton smiled for cameras and traded pleasantries with President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist jailed more than once by the American-backed autocracy overthrown 18 months ago. She became the highest ranking United States official to meet Mr. Morsi since he was sworn in two weeks ago as Egypt’s first democratically elected president.

But her outreach to the new president appeared constrained by evident reluctance to address his struggle to pry power from the generals. Her muted tone, State Department officials said, reflected a growing sense that American attempts to intercede may be futile in a contest where the outcome remains uncertain, all the players are deeply suspicious of American motives, and almost any statement could elicit a popular backlash.
Instead of calling for an immediate handover of power as American officials have in the past, Mrs. Clinton instead emphasized only the need for “building consensus across the Egyptian political spectrum.” In brief remarks after the meeting with Mr. Morsi, her sole reference to the military decrees dissolving the Islamist-led Parliament and eviscerating his powers was a call for “consensus” among all sides in order “to work on a new constitution and Parliament, to protect civil society, to draft a new constitution that will be respected by all, and to assert the full authority of the presidency.”
A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in a briefing to reporters, said Mrs. Clinton planned to deliver virtually the same message in a private meeting with Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Egypt’s top military commander, as she did in public remarks on Saturday.

On Tuesday, The Hill published an article suggesting that Sen. Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of Obama’s plan for military action in Syria, had shifted his position on the conflict with an eye towards running for President in 2016. The article, by Alexandra Jaffe, insinuates that Cruz has abandoned his previous hawkish views for one that better positions him to contest the GOP nomination. It is a complete misreading of Cruz’s consistent views on the issue. 
To build her argument, Jaffe points to a line Sen. Cruz said on the Senate floor back in June:
“We need to be developing right now a clear, practical plan to go in, locate the weapons, secure or destroy them, and then get out. The United States should be firmly in the lead to make sure the job is done right,” Cruz said.


That is not what President Obama is proposing. Obama has called for a “limited,” or in the words of John Kerry “unbelievably small”, military strike with the intention of “punishing” Syrian strong-man Bashar Assad to deter him from using chemical weapons again. Obama’s planned strike would try to “degrade” Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons in the future. 

If Obama’s strike were executed, the Syrian regime would still possess stockpiles of chemical weapons. They would still be vulnerable to seizure by the al-Qaeda-backed terrorists who make up the bulk of Syrian rebels opposing Assad. Obama’s action could even weaken the Assad regime to the point that terrorists in the rebel forces had easier access to these weapons. 
Cruz’s position on Syria has always been predicated on keeping these weapons out of the hands of terrorists. In an interview on the Sean Hannity show in late August, Cruz said:

With 9 major rebel groups, 7 of them may well have some significant ties to Al Qaida. If Assad is toppled and replaced by a radical Islamist regime, what would be truly dangerous for the United States, for our allies like Israel and Jordan, is for a radical Islamic government to seize control of those chemical weapons and to deploy them against us or our allies. That should be the focus of the President, and as we’ve seen throughout the Middle East that has not been the focus of the President. 

And:

[O]ur concern should be those chemical weapons, preventing them from falling into the hands of Hezbollah, preventing them from falling into the hands of Al Qaida, that should be guiding our actions, not expressing some moral outrage from a university facility lounge.

This week, in The Washington Post, Cruz spelled out a situation wherein he would support military action:

Should we in the future have intelligence that al-Qaeda or Hezbollah is on the verge of acquiring chemical weapons or that Iran is nearing a nuclear breakout, I would support aggressive military action to prevent them from acquiring those weapons because the alternative is unacceptable.

The Hill article would have been more correct if it had detailed Cruz’s consistency on Syria, notwithstanding the political calculus of a potential run for President in 2016. That story, however, would hardly be worth Jaffe hitting her keyboard. While Obama’s foreign policy lies tattered, more useful for her to parse the words of Republicans and pull things out of context.

2799	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/05/06/Democrats-Agenda-for-Benghazi-Hearing-Protect-Hillary-at-All-Costs	Opinion	0	International News	Elections	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Ahead of Wednesday’s long-awaited hearings at the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about the Benghazi terror attack of Sep. 11, 2012, Democrats have a clear agenda: protect Hillary Clinton at all costs.
Clinton, the former Secretary of State and likely frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, could be severely damaged by testimony about the attacks, which occurred in part because of security lapses for which the State Department is primarily responsible. 


Past testimony about the attacks has also revealed that President Barack Obama did nothing once informed the attacks were under way, and that there was no communication among key members of the administration and military who could have responded.
In her own testimony before Congress in January before leaving office, Clinton was evasive, famously shouting at Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), “What difference does it make?” in reference to the question of who had edited the administration’s talking points to remove references to Islamist terror and emphasize a protest that never happened. 
The media applauded her performance, but her outburst left an impression of apathy about the four Americans who were killed that night in Benghazi, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.

Since the day after the attacks, Democrats and the media have treated Benghazi as an unfair political attack by Republicans, rather than a legitimate national security crisis in its own right. 
Media coverage in the fall focused on Republican Mitt Romney’s response to the attacks, rather than Obama’s actions as commander-in-chief. When questions were raised about whether Obama had lied to the public about the attacks, the media covered Obama’s tracks, with CNN’s Candy Crowley intervening in the second presidential debate to defend the president, and CBS News suppressing damning footage of the president until shortly before the election.
With Obama safely re-elected, the goal is now to protect Hillary Clinton. Last week, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) called upon Speaker of the House John Boehner not only to retract, but to apologize publicly for, an inter-committee report that suggested Clinton had ignored requests for additional security in Libya.
On MSNBC, a channel that serves as the mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, Rev. Al Sharpton–who also serves as an informal White House adviser–described the Benghazi investigation as the “new vast right-wing conspiracy,” a reference to Clinton’s claim, as First Lady, that Republicans were merely out to target her husband and that he had not committed any wrongdoing in the Monica Lewinsky affair that led to his impeachment.
Though there are undoubtedly some political motives present, Democrats’ claims are largely a projection of their own political agenda in Benghazi, which has remained consistent from the start: to shield the party and its leaders from responsibility for a major terrorist attack on American sovereign territory. 

That agenda far exceeds any pursued by Republicans, whose goals, however political, happen to include the national security interests at stake.
On this past weekend’s Sunday shows, Democrats showed unusual willingness to criticize the Obama administration over Benghazi, acknowledging that the Benghazi talking points had been false. 
Yet that willingness to criticize may be a way of inoculating the party against further revelations to come; it may also be easier because new information about the Benghazi talking points has tended to implicate the White House rather than Clinton herself, even if State Department officials have also been listed among those involved.
Clinton’s role in Benghazi is particularly damaging because it risks becoming the signature legacy of her tenure at the State Department. Despite racking up an exhaustive travel record, Clinton had few actual achievements to show for her four years as Secretary of State–a burden as she contemplates her 2016 ambitions.
At least one key witness in Wednesday’s hearing, Mark. I. Thompson, is expected to offer testimony highly damaging to Clinton. He has alleged that Clinton sidelined the State Department’s counter-terrorism operation during the Benghazie attacks: “You should have seen what (Clinton) tried to do to us that night,” he has said, according to Fox News.
Though Democrats seem to have shifted their focus to Clinton’s prospects, Obama himself is not free of the troubles Benghazi presents. Evidence continues to emerge that senior White House officials were directly involved in the manipulation of the Benghazi talking points, suggesting that there had been a deliberate decision to mislead the public. 
Obama has yet to explain his own actions–or inaction–during and after the attack. His activities throughout the evening of Sep. 11 are unknown; he flew to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next day.

House Republican leaders reportedly did not bring any immigration bills to the floor before the August recess because they were fearful of the backlash they would get from voters in their districts during the break.
According to a report in the National Journal, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA), and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) think the “tactical play” will “boost” the reform’s changes. 

Breitbart News reporter Matthew Boyle reported ten days ago that House Republicans were planning to pass various piecemeal bills and hope to conference with the Senate to get a more comprehensive bill enacted. Conservatives expressed to Boyle their concerns that conferencing with senators–and potentially the White House–would transform whatever is passed in the House into something resembling the Senate’s bill, which Numbers USA Executive Director Roy Beck said, on Breitbart News Sunday, was an “end of America” bill.


Last Friday, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) essentially made the strategy public at a town hall event in his district, confirming Boyle’s reporting. 
National Journal noted that House Republican leaders wanted to keep immigration “on the back-burner” to lessen the type of “backlash” that coalesced against Obamacare in August 2009.  
As Politico reported, five “a la carte” immigration bills have already passed two key committees in the House while the Senate was debating its immigration bill. 
Bills passed in either the Homeland Security or Judiciary Committees include a border security bill that has weaker provisions than the Senate’s, a plan to award 500,000 visas to agricultural workers, which “can be adjusted according to market needs,” a bill to lift the current cap on high-skilled visas, a bill to give states more power to enforce federal immigration laws, and an E-Verify trigger that will make newly-legalized immigrants “undocumented” again if E-Verify is not in place by five years.

Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) gave the clearest indication that proponents of comprehensive immigration reform may make their final–and strongest–push to get legislation passed next year after House Republicans make it through their primaries. 
“I think conventional wisdom is that time is not on our side,” McCain told reporters on Monday after an event in Chicago. “But there are a number of members of Congress who have primaries and when those primaries are done, they may be more inclined to address the issue of comprehensive immigration reform.”
President Barack Obama has urged Congress to pass immigration reform legislation this year. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is reportedly going to bring legislation to the floor within the next month and other House Republican leaders have indicated support for piecemeal pieces of legislation that can make it to conference with the Senate, where proponents and opponents of immigration reform had said a pathway to citizenship will prevail. 


Though the Congressional Budget Office has determined the Senate’s immigration bill would lower the wages of working class Americans, House Republicans are reportedly working on piecemeal pieces of legislation to eventually get to conference with the Senate. McCain also said on Monday that the House should just “pass something” to get to conference with the Senate. House Republicans like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) are reportedly working on legislation that would grant a pathway to citizenship to all of the country’s illegal immigrants.

McCain’s comments indicate even if the current push to enact comprehensive immigration reform fails, the real fight may be in the spring and summer of next year, when Obama could use immigration as a midterm election issue and Republican lawmakers will not be worried about primaries in the 2014 election cycle.
In 2010, McCain made a right turn on immigration, infamously promising to “complete the danged fence” as he was fighting for his political life to win re-election in Arizona. Shortly after he got elected to serve another term, McCain quickly lurched back to the left, becoming a champion for comprehensive immigration reform and calling Tea Partiers whose support he needed in 2010 “hobbits” and “wacko birds.”

This week, conservative scholar and talk radio host Mark Levin said he would accept an offer by the Republican National Committee to moderate a presidential debate during the 2016 cycle.
Last week, RNC communications director Sean Spicer appeared on The Wilkow Majority with guest host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, and said Levin was one of the people who should be asking questions at the debates instead of mainstream media journalists. 
After Breitbart News reported on the interview, the movement to allow conservatives like Levin to potentially moderate a debate picked up momentum and “took on life.” 


Levin, in comments picked up by The Right Scoop, said he was of two minds after reading the Breitbart News report about Spicer’s comments. He said he believed the RNC was either “sucking up” to him so he does not criticize them or actually serious. 

“I accept,” Levin said. “Yes, I’ll do it.”
He said he would like to ask Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, if he were to run, why he refused to sign a brief opposing Obamacare. Levin said he would also like to ask Christie why he was weak on border security, soft on the Ground Zero Mosque, favored gun control, and supported environmentalists. 
Levin said he would like to ask former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, if he were to run, if he felt there should be a “two Bush limit on the presidency” and why he “supports anarchy on the border” by promoting comprehensive immigration reform so fervently. 
The talk radio host said he still did not fully believe the RNC would actually extend an offer to him because the Republican establishment “buffoons” who are “destroying the Republican Party from within” loathe him. 
“You know how much they despise me,” Levin said. “I think I am hated more [at the Republican National Convention] than at the Democrat convention.”
“So yeah, I’m available [to moderate the debates],” Levin said. “I don’t believe it for two seconds.”

Politico’s Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei stretched their writing wings and penned an editorial Thursday night on the looming collapse of the Republican party. Allen and VandeHai, whose day jobs are to undercut the GOP and its candidates, feign concern that the party isn’t doing enough to appeal to voters who don’t support the party. A more interesting story for the democrats-with-by-lines is the precipitous drop in support for Obama on every major issue. 
According to Gallup, just 35% of Americans support Obama’s handling of the economy. In early June, before Obama embarked on an extensive tour of speeches about the economy, 42% approved of his efforts. In other words, the more he talked about the economy, the less Americans approved of how he was handling it. 
It isn’t just the economy, though. Americans don’t support how Obama is handling virtually every issue. Only 26% support Obama’s handling of the federal deficit. Taxes? 36% approve. Foreign Affairs? 40%. Immigration? 39%. Health Care? 39%. Only on fighting terrorism (50%) and race relations (51%) does Obama win the backing of a majority, just, of Americans. 


Obama basically has the backing of the Democrat base and no one else. With Republicans holding the House, 30 Governorships and more state legislative districts and statewide offices than almost any time in history, and likely to make gains in the Senate next year, it seems it is the Democrats who are on Allen and VandeHai’s “eve of destruction.”  
To stitch together their partisan theory, Allen and VandeHei point to perceived problems the GOP has with African-Americans, Hispanics and gays. None of these demographic groups ever formed any meaningful part of a winning coalition for the GOP. No political party should actively try to alienate a block of voters, but the GOP’s path to future victory isn’t paved with pandering appeals to these groups either. 
Politico’s editorial is largely built around the presumed need for the GOP to pass some kind of amnesty legislation to appeal to Hispanic voters. While it is certainly true that the nation needs to reform its broken immigration system, reform comes in many varieties. A recent poll found that 60% of Hispanics want the border secured before amnesty is granted, a position in line with a majority of the GOP caucus in the House. Allen and VandeHai make the mistake of accepting the conventional wisdom in DC that “immigration reform” means accepting the Senate “Gang of 8” bill. In the alternative universe that is reality, the issue is far more complex.   

Even if the House GOP were to reverse course and embrace amnesty, it isn’t at clear they would benefit at the ballot box. George H. W. Bush was part of an Administration that actually granted amnesty to illegal immigrants, and he received the lowest percentage of support from Hispanics than almost any time previously. If Mitt Romney had magically received 70% of the Hispanic vote last year, he still would have lost to President Obama. There just aren’t enough voters in any of the demographics Politico focuses on to make that much of a difference for the GOP.
Mitt Romney largely lost the election last year because millions of conservatives and working-class whites failed to show up at the polls. In the last two cycles, the party nominated the moderate, centrist candidates the media barks the GOP needs and large swathes of the party’s base stayed home. The GOP would be better served “auditing” its outreach and messaging to these groups than fine-tune its messaging to groups preternaturally wired to vote against the party. 
In modern political history, the GOP has won when it has embraced its conservative principles and articulated a message of freedom and enterprise. Freedom is the most inclusive message in politics. As the late Andrew Breitbart used to say, “If we can’t sell Freedom, we suck.” 
Allen and VandeHei would rather the GOP adopt the Democrat playbook and make explicit appeals based on identity politics. An healthy dash of racial politics with a pinch of feminist rhetoric. It is a recipe for disaster for the GOP. Which is, of course, why Politico is pushing it.   
If Republicans choose to take advice from hacks like Allen and VandeHai, then they deserve the failures they will surely reap.

2856	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/15/CPAC-2013-Kelly-Ayotte-Tea-Party-Hawk	Opinion	1	None	Elections	SomewhatNegative	Positive	breitbart.com	"
Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) is the unsung heroine of the foreign policy debates of the past few months. A Tea Party candidate who was elected in the 2010 wave, Ayotte has been one of the most reliable voices on the Benghazi attacks, the Hagel nomination, and the prosecution of terrorists. She has worked with Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC)–without joining their withering attacks on the party’s libertarian wing.
In the Hagel confirmation process, though much of the mainstream media’s attention focused on the aggressive questioning by McCain, Graham, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), it was Ayotte’s line of questioning that was most effective in exposing Hagel’s position on Iran, which is the most pressing national security challenge the nation faces at the moment. Ayotte eschewed theatrics and flash for patient and yet penetrating questions.


In one particularly revealing exchange, Ayotte pinned Hagel down on his opposition to a “military option” on Iran:


Ayotte: Can you help me understand, when you went to Islamabad, Pakistan in 2006, you said at that time that a military strike against Iran, an military option, is not a “viable, feasible or responsible option.” And it strikes me that what you’re saying about the military option now and even–it seems inconsistent with that statement. And why would you make that statement in Pakistan that it’s not a “viable, feasible or responsible option” in light of your statement today that you do, I have, and I strongly agree that a military option should be on the table?
Hagel : That statement was made in a context of all options regarding Iran. And Pakistan was where I was at the time. And the larger context of that was nuclear powers, which certainly Pakistan is part of that club. And not unlike what Secretary Gates said about a strike on Iran, my point was that this would not be a preferable option. There would be consequences to this option. Things would happen as a result of it. If we could find a better option, a better way to deal with Iran to assure they do not get nuclear weapons, then we’re far better off. That was the context of that statement.
Ayotte: Senator Hagel, I know that my time is up and I know we’ll have an opportunity for a second round of questions, but as I see your quote it didn’t say “preferable option;” it said, was not a responsible option.

During the debate over UN Ambassador Susan Rice’s potential candidacy as Secretary of State, Ayotte joined McCain and Graham in stressing their objections to Rice over her role in spreading the story that the Benghazi terror attack on Sep. 11, 2012 had been a protest over an anti-Islam video. In an effort to characterize opposition to Rice as racist and sexist, the president and his party pointedly ignored Ayotte’s role in the debate.
Ayotte refused to take the bait, remaining focused on the issues at hand. Her remarks after a meeting with Rice–“I want to say that I’m more troubled today”–marked a turning point, after which Democrats knew that Rice’s candidacy would be a losing proposition. 
In her remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference this morning, Ayotte touched on foreign policy but returned to the domestic issues that were the theme of her election campaign in 2010: 

Let me tell you about some of the things that keep me up at night. Too many Americans are out of work. Federal regulations are strangling businesses. Obamacare is increasing health care costs and stopping so many of those businesses from hiring. And I come from a small business family. I know what that’s like. How hard the small businesses work. We have a broken tax code and the president and Senate Democrats, they just want to keep increasing taxes, making it harder and harder, for our small businesses to hire and grow and put people to work in this country. Our nation is drowning in debt. We have had four straight years of trillion dollar deficits.

In 2012, Ayotte was considered a long-shot contender to be Mitt Romney’s running mate. While that may have been premature, it likely portends Ayotte’s future. She is one of the few conservatives who is fluent in both the Tea Party’s constitutionalism and the hawkish policy prescriptions of the national security wing of the Republican Party.

This week’s new episode of the HBO series The Newsroom apparently took some factual liberties from its “ripped from yesterday’s headlines” format.
The July 28 episode featured several reporters, including the show’s senior producer Jim Harper (played by John Gallagher Jr.), getting thrown off the Romney presidential campaign bus for asking tough questions.


Did something like that actually happen?
Patrick Hynes, an adviser to Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign who worked with online media for the communications department, answered some questions from Breitbart News about the show via email.
Big Hollywood: What was your reaction to The Newsroom scene description about reporters getting booted off the Romney campaign?

Patrick Hynes: My initial reaction was that once again the Hollywood left is out to depict Republicans as unreasonable, authoritarian, stupid, hostile and mean spirited because in the absence of such a stereotype, Republicans might actually win some elections, and well, we can’t have that, can we? BH: To your knowledge, did any such event ever take place during the campaign?
PH: No, nothing like that ever took place, as far as I know. Don’t get me wrong, relations between the campaign and the press were not good and there were frequent moments of hostility every day. But I don’t recall ever hearing of reporters getting thrown off the bus.
BH: If such an event occurred, would you have heard about it? Would Gov. Romney have heard about it?
PH: I would have heard about it. We would almost certainly have been in rapid response mode if something like this had happened.  In fact, it would have been impossible for anyone not to hear about it, as anything like this fictional account would have consumed a day’s worth of campaign coverage. There is nothing the press likes to cover more than itself.
BH: Why do you think a show would manufacture such an event?
PH: To make a boring and insufferable program slightly more interesting and to make Republicans look stupid.

As the House begins to take up comprehensive immigration reform legislation, Richard Viguerie’s Conservative HQ sent a warning to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI): don’t commit political suicide by becoming the House’s version of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).
“We are still astonished and disappointed in how Florida Senator Marco Rubio squandered his conservative and Tea Party movement base by becoming the face of S. 744 – [the Senate’s bill],” the outlet wrote on Thursday. 
Rubio’s support among conservatives and Republicans has plummeted since he championed the Senate’s bill, and he has not mentioned the bill since it passed the Senate more than three weeks ago. 


Conservative HQ does not want to see Ryan meet the same fate. The site’s staff members write that “it looks like another promising Republican,” Ryan, “is about to follow Rubio down the plank and over the side into the shark-infested waters of granting amnesty to illegal immigrants.” Ryan, they argue, “should be smarter than to get sucked-into supporting anything remotely resembling the corrupt pork and special interest favor bloated Senate bill.”
Ryan recently told the Associated Press that he is keeping in touch with the House’s “Gang of Seven,” a group of bipartisan lawmakers focusing on immigration law. The “Gang” includes Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), who said Ryan is his “guiding light. I know I get him in trouble every time I say it.” Ryan has also clashed with conservative talk radio hosts Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin about the immigration bill’s impact on working-class Americans. 
Senior White House aides reportedly “often mention” Ryan “as crucial to the prospects for legislation this year” and hope that Ryan could “sway recalcitrant House members.” In addition, Ryan is associated with business and Catholic groups who are “backing an overhaul of immigration laws.” The Associated Press states Ryan urged House Republicans in a closed-door meeting last week to seize the moment to pass sweeping immigration reform. 

Conservative HQ claims that Ryan has a “penchant for granting the kind of deference to the interests of the establishment Republican Party’s corporate paymasters,” which include the “shills for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the cheap labor opportunists and the inside-the-Beltway party hacks of the ‘buy the Hispanic vote’ wing of the Republican Party.”
According to Conservative HQ, while Tea Partiers and conservatives want to have honest discussions about how to solve the country’s immigration problem but are wary of harmful side effects which could result from the current legislative push: 

What they are not prepared to do is dole out millions of dollars in slush funds to radical Hispanic political organizations like La Raza, grant vast new powers to the federal executive branch, insulate it from Congressional direction and oversight, bring millions of new clients for the welfare state from illegal and ineligible for benefits status to legal and eligible for benefits status and grant blanket amnesty to illegal immigrants who are in jail.

The authors urge Ryan to preserve his political capital and reject attempts to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation akin to the Senate bill.
“We welcome Paul Ryan to the debate on how best to apply conservative principles to immigration reform – something that eluded Senator Rubio,” Conservative HQ writes. “However, if Paul Ryan wants to avoid Marco Rubio’s fate he must begin by publicly and forcefully rejecting the corruption, pork and special interest favors of Rubio’s Gang of Eight bill.”

On Friday night Corey Stewart, one of seven candidates seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor in Virginia, admitted to a crowd of 50 Tea Party activists that he was not only “connected to” the mysterious Virginians for Limited Government (VLG) group that has paid for attack mailers on five of his opponents; he’s also provided funding for the group.
Larry Nordvig, the Executive Director of the Richmond Virginia Tea Party who attended the Friday meeting, told Breitbart News on Monday that Stewart admitted his connection to VLG during a public question and answer period. Holding two of the VLG funded attack mailers in his hand, Nordvig described this back and forth he had with Stewart:


Nordvig Question: “Do you agree with these ads and did you have any connection to them whatsoever for the record?”
Corey Stewart Answer: “Am I connected? Yes. I have donated money to that organization.”
Nordvig Question. “At least a couple of these candidates fought against these budget increases, specifically Steve Martin…The information on the flyer is not correct so this information is misleading. Will you do the right thing and publicly condemn these ads as false?”
Corey Stewart Answer: “No, I’m not going to do it. I play hardball. This is politics.”
Sue Sadler, who is with a concerned citizens group in James City County and was present at Friday’s event, told Breitbart News on Monday that “Nordvig’s account is absolutely correct.”
Carolyn Worssam, a member of the Richmond Tea Party, told Breitbart News on Monday “that sure is an accurate description of the conversation between Larry and Corey Stewart.”
A third source, who is one of the 13,000 delegates to the convention that will select the Republican Party’s nominee for Lieutenant Governor in Richmond on Saturday and was present at the Friday event, told Breitbart News on Monday “that’s an accurate and balanced description” of the exchange between Nordvig and Stewart.

A fourth source, who was also at the meeting on Friday, told Breitbart News on Monday “that’s completely accurate.”
The meeting was held at Mimi’s Cafe in Henrico, Virginia, near Richmond, and was moderated by Carol Stopps, a supporter of Mr. Stewart. Ms. Stopps told Breitbart News on Tuesday: “That was an accurate description of the conversation between Larry and Corey. Corey did not deny he knows the organization and contributed to the organization. In my opinion this is typical campaign material and there were no misstatements in the mailers.”
Stewart’s admission could be a violation of Virginia election law, which requires that independent expenditure political action committees not coordinate their activities with the campaigns of any candidates. It is unclear how much Stewart has contributed to VLG, since it has failed to file its Statement of Organization with the Virginia State Board of Elections.
The exact organizational structure of VLG remains unclear. On Monday the group changed its “about us” description on its website to say that it is a 501(c)4 tax exempt non profit corporation.
A search of Guidestar, the online source that provides information about non profit corporations that have received 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 tax-exempt status from the IRS shows no entry for “Virginians for Limited Government.” By law, 501(c)4 organizations are prohibited from “primarily” engaging in political communications.
On Tuesday, Corey Stewart emailed this statement to Breitbart News: “Over the course of my life, I have supported and recommended several conservative organizations including the Family Foundation, Gun Owners of America, National Right to Work, Campaign for Liberty and Virginians for Limited Government to various people.”
Stewart emphasized that neither he nor his campaign “had any coordination” with Virginians for Limited Government. “I am proud to support these like-minded organizations over the course of my political career,” his email statement continued. “What these groups do, I have no control over.  Neither myself or my campaign have had any coordination with this group.”

Peter Schweizer’s book, Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes and Line Their Own Pockets, exposes abusive money schemes undermining the legitimacy of representative government. Beltway tactics such as the “tollbooth,” the “milker bill,” and “double milker bills” shamelessly extort campaign cash to advance or stall legislation aimed at targeted money. All too often, the reality is “pay to delay” or “pay to play.”  
One scandalous revelation is the staggeringly high interest rate some politicians charge on personal loans they make to their own campaigns, resulting in windfall personal profit. Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) pocketed $294,245 in interest payments on a $150,000 loan at 18% (later lowered to 10%). She dismissed 60 Minutes journalist Steve Kroft’s challenge to the “Mafia” interest rate, saying, “It’s not like I really profited… I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”  


Her comment opens a window into a dirty secret soiling mainstream party politics. Players get rich–typically with your money. At times, the sums are staggering.  
Jamie Gorelick served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration and followed that gig with a five-year tenure as a board member of the congressionally-chartered, tax-exempt Fannie Mae, where she reportedly received over $26 million in salary, bonuses, so-called performance pay, and stock options.  
Fellow Fannie Mae board member Franklyn Raines, who previously served as Bill Clinton’s Director of the Office of Management and Budget, received $90,000,000 in total compensation for six years’ service. Yet Time Magazine called him one of the twenty-five people to blame for the 2008 financial meltdown. The New York Times reported that he agreed to pay $24.7 million, including a $2 million fine, to settle claims against him flowing from the crash.  

It is simply a “given” within the professional political class that insiders profit. A seemingly endless supply of tax dollars has long fueled complaints that government policy makers, office holders, functionaries, party insiders, connected lobbyists, and families cash in on the public dole. It even has a name: “crony capitalism.” The latest example is the debacle known as HealthCare.gov–hundreds of millions for what can at best be called an embarrassment developed by a Canadian subsidiary that contributed heavily to pols of all stripes.   
Rep. Napolitano’s dismissive backhand at the suggestion of anything remiss over her pocketing a mere $294k is symptomatic of the narcissism now epidemic in the political class. Real profit for the new elites is about serious largesse. Anything as paltry as her racket is chump change. It crosses party lines and flows from bloated government, obscure quasi-governmental entities, and politically packed special entities such as Fannie Mae. And it passes stealthily into respectful private business deals, where political rivals become strange bedfellows. 
The current gubernatorial race in Virginia offers a fascinating glimpse of one such pairing. Terry McAuliffe, a DC-area transplant from upstate New York, parlayed his political connections and fundraising acumen into the chairmanship of the DNC. His style of politics takes no prisoners.   
McAuliffe has a penchant for investing in techie upstarts with potential for big profit. In 1999, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Telergy, Inc., in Syracuse, New York, his home town. Telergy planned to create a contiguous end-to-end high-speed fiber optics network in the northeastern US along utility rights-of-way. Its plan was to leverage relationships with Niagara Mohawk, NYSEG, Consolidated  Edison, GPU, El Paso, and certain National Grid electric subsidiaries. A good old-fashioned dose of classic American initiative–with risks, to be sure–and the potential for handsome profit. 
And if the story stopped there, God bless every penny he and his partners could make. That’s why the Constitution protects private property as a fundamental right and encourages capital market creation by granting Congress legislative authority to introduce copyright and patent legislation, all of which encourages the risk/profit correlation that has driven the American economic engine to produce a better standard of living for the broadest swath of society the planet has ever known. 

However, the company vastly overvalued its assets and went bust. The Washington Free Beacon reported on McAuliffe’s Telergy link long ago. Byron York added some details here.
But there is more to the story. Telergy laid off a slew of local Syracuse employees–hundreds–without any severance in 2001 and, by the end of the year, filed for bankruptcy. McAuliffe has always said he was just an investor and did not run day-to-day operations. But Telegry’s S-1 SEC filing offers a tantalizing window into the relationships of political insiders and the subordination of principle to profit.  

The S-1 identifies McAuliffe under its list of “EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND KEY EMPLOYEES.” See page 59. But notice who else it lists among the officers and directors:   
J. Patrick Barrett, President and Director. The former Chairman of the New York GOP State Committee during the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush, he is a wealthy and powerful party insider. No one moves within the upstate NY GOP without clearing things with Pat Barrett.  
 Thomas G. Young, Vice President, Government Relations. He was the Democrat Mayor of Syracuse from 1986-1993, which coincided with Pat Barrett’s term as GOP state party chair. A longtime political of Terry McAuliffe, who hails from Syracuse.  

John F. O’Mara, Director. He served as special counsel to George Pataki when the latter was governor of NY and was chair of the New York State Public Service Commission. A powerful state GOP insider. 
And, of course, McAuliffe.  
All were key players in the political rough and tumble of NY party politics. Some still are. And they were adversaries. Ideologically and politically split–or so it would appear. Yet here they were, in bed together in their personal business investments–and not as mere passive investors the way millions are when vested in mutual funds or as capital investors in start-ups. Each took publicly-identified roles as significant players with fiduciary responsibilities. 
But even when the deals go bust, the directors and key people make out, as happened with Telergy. McAuliffe reportedly made some $1.2 million by brokering an investment in Telergy by Gary Winnick of Global Crossing, another company McAuliffe invested in and made millions before it, too, went bankrupt. That failure resulted in $54 billion in shareholder losses and 10,000 lost jobs. 
There is nothing wrong with making lots of money. We all love the idea. But the deeper point is to recognize what the money can do to the insiders. Telergy was but one example. 
Is it reasonable to believe that such relationships do not erode independence? How aggressively will a state party chair campaign against the local mayor of a rival party come election season when the two are officers of the same business venture? And what of their advocacy of the cherished goals of the grass roots party faithful?It isn’t crony capitalism, but it reeks of cynicism. And its effect on sincerity and message is corrosive. 
It is one reason some believe the RINO element within the GOP is uncomfortable with Ken Cuccinelli. Like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker, these insurgent new bloods really believe in freedom, the ideals of their agenda, the sanctity of life, and the restoration of principal. And a new core of GOP leaders stands ready to seize the party with them: Gov. Nikki Haley, Congresswomen Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Kristi Noem, Senators Tom Coburn, Deb Fisher, Pat Toomey, and more.
The emerging voices of conservative principle are sounding the heat of the nation. For a long time, too many have allowed deception to pile high the precipice from which we fall until so dark and damp a tomb we become accustomed to the stench of rotted expectation. No more. With a nod to Mr. Dylan, “the times they are a-changing.”

As a candidate for president, Barack Obama promised to lead the most open, most transparent administration in history. He has not kept that promise. Time and again, members of his administration have failed to keep faith with the American people. Acting in secret, they have taken sometimes extraordinary steps to shield their actions from the public.
The latest example involved Lisa Jackson, who has led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency since the beginning of the president’s first term. Jackson is resigning, but only after it was revealed she used a fake name (Richard Windsor) to create a fake e-mail address to conduct official EPA business.


What Jackson did contravenes federal law which, because as a nation we value open and transparent government, prohibits such behavior.
This is not the first time the EPA has been in the spotlight because its administrator acted against the interests of transparency. Carol Browner, who led the agency under Bill Clinton and then served for a time as President Obama’s “environmental czar” – ordered the hard drive on her government computer erased and reformatted and all backup tapes destroyed only hours after a federal judge had ordered the EPA to preserve all agency e-mail records.
This conduct, the use of phony e-mail addresses and the erasure of computers pose an interesting question: What is the EPA and its administrators doing that they are so unwilling to have their official communications become public? It doesn’t paint a pretty picture for the left’s agenda or its methods of implementation.

Jackson’s conduct came to light only after a a whistle-blower divulged she was using her fake e-mail account to conduct controversial business, evade congressional oversight, and get around the requirements of the federal Freedom of Information Act. Typically, government business is conducted in public. Correspondence and e-mail must be available to scrutiny, both by Congress and the American people. When a fake name is used, it allows an agency and its employees to evade accountability.
There is no way around it. This is government corruption at its highest form – and the polar opposite of the kind of transparent and open government political leaders on both sides of the aisle claim to want.
EPA’s record of following the law and being transparent couldn’t be much worse. Obama’s EPA has twice failed to provide as required by law a “Unified Agenda” which is a compendium of regulations planned in the foreseeable future. For the record, no other administration has ever even once failed to meet the requirements of this law. This, combined with the more than 12,000 secret e-mails, suggests a pattern of chicanery, obfuscation, and lawlessness at Obama’s EPA.
The problem does not end with Ms. Jackson or her staff. For the last four years, when asked to respond to lawful requests for information by Congress or by American citizens under FOIA, EPA attorneys did not provide e-mail sent and received by the administrator at her “Richard Windsor” e-mail address. Moreover, they affirmed that all responsive e-mails had been provided, when they clearly had not.
It is important whether these attorneys knew or had reason to know that their representations were false. And it is incumbent on the U.S. Congress and, perhaps, the U.S. Department of Justice to begin an inquiry into whether they did so.

To stop the culture of corruption at the EPA, it is not sufficient for Ms. Jackson to step down. There must be a comprehensive investigation concerning the actions of Ms. Jackson, her staff, and EPA attorneys who were involved. It must be determined who knew about or participated in the corruption. Ms. Jackson clearly did but did anyone else? Any government employee involved should be fired and prosecuted. If they are an attorney, they should also be disbarred.
No one has ever gone to jail for violating the Freedom of Information Act but, the federal mail and wire fraud law is broadly used to target corruption in government that falls well short of bribery or extortion. Ms. Jackson and all those who participated in the fraudulent and fake e-mail scheme should face prosecution.
Once the 12,000 or more secret e-mails become public, Attorneys General and United States Attorneys all over the United States will likely have jurisdiction to investigate and perhaps even prosecute Ms. Jackson or anyone else who were involved in there e-mail fraud scheme. Congress should also have a full investigation and also determine if other of agencies have engaged in similarly corrupt schemes designed to shield their activities from public scrutiny, particularly those that pertain to the official function of their position and the development of public policy.
The Obama administration has been one of the least transparent or open administrations in memory. The activities of Lisa Jackson at the EPA are just one example of that. If the president hopes to remove the taint from his administration, he must take a personal interest in rooting out this sort of corruption. He cannot simply accept Ms. Jackson’s resignation and call the matter closed.

Gov. Rick Scott (R-FL) on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have required Florida hand out driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, a sign he is taking a stand against the left in favor of conservatism. 
“Florida is home to immigrants of many nationalities, who add to the cultural fabric of our great state, and whose productivity and hard work have contributed to our economic turnaround,” Scott said in his official letter to Florida Secretary of State Kenneth Detzner announcing the veto. “Still, our nation struggles with immigration issues every day, as Americans seek to reconcile the fact that at one point our families were immigrants who came, as many do today, to work and live the American dream with the fact that the federal government has failed at enforcing the nation’s laws on this topic.”
Scott went on to detail the inconsistencies of immigration policy coming out of Janet Napolitano’s Department of Homeland Security and President Barack Obama’s administration at large.


“Despite the federal government’s inability to enforce the nation’s current immigration laws or to find common ground on how to change them, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in a June 2012 memo the immediate establishment of a ‘Deferred Action Process for Childhood Arrivals,'” Scott wrote. “Through this process DHS provides that a young person illegally brought to the United States as a child will not be subject to removal if the individual meets certain criteria.” 

“Qualifying for deferred action status does not confer substantive rights or lawful status upon an individual; it does not create a pathway to a green card or citizenship; nor does it extend to any family members of the person granted the status either,” he explained. “Deferred action status is simply a policy of the Obama Administration, absent Congressional direction, designed to dictate removal action decisions using DHS agency discretion. It was never passed by Congress, nor is it a promulgated rule.”
The institutional left and Florida Democrats are furious that Scott would make such a move. Democrat state Sen. Darren Soto called Scott’s veto an “anti-Hispanic bomb.”
“Make no mistake about it: This will be an anti-Hispanic bomb if he vetoes this bill,” Soto, a sponsor of the legislation, said before Scott officially vetoed the bill according to the National Journal. “The vast majority of my peers understand we need to encourage immigrants to become working members of our society. It makes no sense that the Scott administration would veto something it’s already doing.”
The Florida House Democrat who also sponsored the bill, Rep. Randolph Bracy, tried to argue Scott’s veto foils plans to move the national Republican party as a whole toward amnesty. “I thought the party was moving in that direction and was behind this bill, and then the governor just comes out of nowhere and does this,” Bracy said according to National Journal. “Republicans have been talking as a party about Hispanic outreach, and this was only a small step.”

The headline reads, “McAuliffe avoids position on EPA rules, Cuccinelli dodges on House spending vote,” because just like Virginia’s Democrat gubernatorial nominee, Terry McAuliffe, the left-wing Washington Post wants to have it both ways. In an article published Friday, the Post tries to mitigate the damage President Obama’s new strict carbon emission limits will have on the McAuliffe campaign by also putting a pox on Republican nominee Cuccinelli’s house over, bizarrely, DC’s ongoing budget battles. 
But as hard as the Post might try, there is just no comparing the latest round of federal budget battles to the effect Obama’s war on coal will have on Virginia and working class Virginians.


At the bottom of its article, the Post is eventually forced to admit that the Cuccinnelli campaign — if not the man himself — actually did comment on the possibility of a government shutdown:
“It’s pretty rich that in the same week it was revealed that Terry McAuliffe wants to shut down Virginia’s government, he’s now focused on whether the federal government is going to do the same,” Cullen said, referring to remarks by McAuliffe that he would not sign a budget as governor if it did not include funds for expanding Medicaid. “No one wants to see the federal government shut down, period. Ken Cuccinelli is not running for Congress, he’s running for governor. . . . Ken Cuccinelli would more than welcome a debate with Terry McAuliffe on the issue of Obamacare.”
Fast Terry, however, has yet to stand up for the state’s southwest coal country, and who knows how many middle class jobs. Instead of staking a position one way or another, the McAuliffe campaign punted with a statement that tries to please everyone and promises to take a position sometime in the future:

Terry agrees with the broad swath of scientists, economists, and military leaders, who view climate change as a looming problem for Virginia,” campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote in an e-mail. “While he agrees that there needs to be some limit on carbon pollution and believes that Virginia can and should lead the way in building new plants that create low-cost, low-carbon energy, he looks forward to further reviewing the President’s proposed rules in detail and studying their impact on Virginia’s economy.”
Cuccinnelli was quick to jump on the Obama administration:
“The administration renewed its war on coal today,” Cuccinelli said, adding — as he often does — that “a war on coal is a war on the poor” and that Virginia “needs a governor who’ll fight for those folks” who depend on the coal industry.
It is doubtful Virginia voters will care one or another if a potential governor chooses to focus on his state as opposed to the latest drama unfurling in the nation’s capitol. These new carbon emission controls, however, directly affect the state and thousands of Virginia jobs. 
Instead of choosing a position, McAuliffe is likely hoping to dither through the last five weeks left in the campaign. And as we have already seen, the Washington Post will be right there to hold his hand.

3012	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/04/18/Hagel-Grilled-on-Army-Email-Comparing-Christians-with-Racists-and-Terrorists	News	0	Civil Rights	Gay Rights	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"

Rep. Randy Forbes (R-VA) grilled Defense Sec. Chuck Hagel on a Pentagon email warning Army officers to watch out for soldiers who do not support gay marriage or who disfavor Muslims, equating them with the Ku Klux Klan and Neo-Nazis. 
The Pentagon officer who sent this email reportedly got his information from a radical, leftist anti-Christian organization linked to a convicted terrorist. 
As reported by Fox News’ Todd Starnes, Lt. Col. Jack Rich at Ft. Campbell sent an email warning Army officers to be on the lookout for soldiers connected with “domestic hate groups.” In his 14-page email, Rich identified groups that support traditional marriage or advocate strict border enforcement regarding illegal aliens as domestic hate groups. 


This story is disturbing for several reasons, one of which is this U.S. military email was reportedly using the “domestic hate group” list created by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). This radical-left organization has listed Christian organizations such as the American Family Association and Family Research Council (FRC), immigration reform groups such as FAIR, and various Tea Party organizations as “hate groups.” The SPLC publicly claims they are no different than the KKK and Neo-Nazis, groups that engage in extreme violence and acts of terrorism. 
Yet SPLC has itself now been linked to a domestic terrorist. As we covered in detail, on Aug. 15, 2012, Floyd Corkins attempted to go on a mass-shooting spree at FRC headquarters in Washington, D.C. with 100 rounds of ammunition. Corkins shot building manager Leo Johnson, yet the wounded Johnson disarmed Corkins, who was then captured alive. 
As part of a plea deal, Corkins signed a full confession in which he admitted that he selected his targets from SPLC’s hate group list and used the map SPLC put on its website to find FRC with the intent of murdering everyone in the building (several dozen people). He called himself a political activist and was going to kill everyone in the FRC building because FRC opposes redefining marriage to include gay marriage. 

Corkins was convicted on Feb. 6, 2013, of committing acts of domestic terrorism. 
It is profoundly disturbing that anyone in the U.S. military would use material from such ultra-left zealots, who label organizations that disagree with them on a range of issues–not just social issues like marriage, but also national security issues (immigration) and economic issues (Tea Party groups)–as “hate groups.” 
Yet SPLC is the only group here that has actually been linked to a terrorist, one who was inspired to commit his despicable crime by none other than the same SPLC whose material the Obama administration’s military command is now using. 
The terrible Boston bombing is a reminder what real terrorism looks like. The Obama administration needs to deal with this threat, not associate with radical-fringe organizations that convicted terrorists cite as their enablers.

On Sean Hannity’s Fox News Channel program Tuesday night, while discussing same-sex marriage, Dr. Ben Carson made the point that if we change the definition of marriage for homosexuals, what’s to stop NAMBLA or those into bestiality from demanding the same. 
The media, which is always ready to destroy any black man who dares think for himself, uniformly pounced today. In response to the manufactured uproar, the soft-spoken Carson (who was a hero to the left until he came out as a conservative), did the interview rounds on cable Friday, including Andrea Mitchell’s show on MSNBC and Wolf Blitzer’s on CNN. 


In both appearances, Carson apologized for what he said and made clear that he wasn’t comparing gay couples to pedophiles or those erotically charged by animals. His point was that God defined what marriage is, not man, and if man changes that definition, it can lead to anything. 
Carson also said he was in favor of giving same-sex couples the same rights as married couples, short of marriage. 
NBC News obviously wants to destroy the threat of any independent-thinking black man as quickly as possible. So it should come as no surprise that, by the time Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart filled in for MSNBC’s Martin Bashir, Carson’s apology was treated as far from sufficient. In short, Capehart and his guests, Toure’ and Krystal Ball, treated the apology as a lie. 

This is all par for the course at NBC News. 
Sadly, so is the chryron pictured above — “Blinded by the White” —  which was used as the clip of Dr. Carson played during the segment.
NBC News is notorious for using this kind of race-baiting to further its left-wing agenda, including fraud:
During last year’s GOP primary, Ed Schultz edited video of Texas Governor Rick Perry to make him look racist. 
In April of last year, the “Today Show” was caught editing audio of a 9-1-1 call to make George Zimmerman look racist. 

In August of 2009, Contessa Brewer sliced and diced a photograph so it wouldn’t look like a black man attended a Tea Party carrying a firearm.   
So it was only a matter of time before they went after Carson in this way for his apostasy.

This week more than 100 human rights and other groups from around the world signed a joint statement supporting the new Russian law banning gay propaganda aimed at school children. 
The signers are “highly concerned about the heavy attacks that the Russian Federation is facing due to its recent Federal Law…that protects innocence and moral formation of children…”


The signers cite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the family is the fundamental unit of society and “is entitled to protection by society and State.” 
They assert the new Russian law “protects the innocence of children and the basic rights of their parents recognized in international legislation and treaties.”  They also note that the concepts of “sexual orientation and gender identity” are not outlined in the existing binding international treaties and agreements.
Organizations signing the statement come mostly from Europe, but also from the United States and Latin America. Most consider themselves human rights organizations focused on the rights of children and the family. 

The statement and large number of signatories challenges the assertion made by gay activists in the United States that the West stands united against the new Russian law. 
At the same time that the new statement was released, the Washington Post reports on how the “Russian law isolates gay teenagers.”  
Reporter Kathy Lally tells the story of 16-year-old Maxim of Moscow who came out publically as gay at 13-years-old. He says his classmates called him names and that a teacher tried to cut his “longish hair.” A 15 year-old-girl who says she is a lesbian was picked on in her class and then berated when she came out to her mother. 
Advocates claim the new law puts these children in further danger since they cannot seek help from adults who could be fined for helping them. Advocates define help in only one way, helping these children continue with the notion they are gay and always will be.  But is that the case?
The boy Maxim tells the reporter that he “didn’t become gay. I was born gay.” Someone must have taught him that. An adult taught him that.  A child does not come to such a dubious conclusion by himself. 

Dr. Paul McHugh, former long-time chief of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and an emeritus professor there now, tells a different story in an important friend-of-the-court brief he submitted in the Proposition 8/DOMA cases before the US Supreme Court. 
From his own professional experience and from the scientific literature he concludes that “sexual orientation is not immutable” and is “not solely an accident of birth.” Further he says that “sexual orientation can and often does change over time.” He also makes the case that “social science experts raise serious doubts about the definability of sexual orientation.”

McHugh’s brief quotes academics friendly to gay rights. Lisa Diamond, writing in Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, says, “There is currently no scientific or popular consensus…that definitively ‘qualify’ an individual as lesbian, gay or bisexual.”
Gail S. Bernstein, who has clinical faculty appointments at the University of Denver School of Professional Psychology and the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, writes, “Much of the confusion about sexual orientation occurs because there is no single agreed upon definition of the term…there is not one universally accepted definition of sexual orientation, nor who is bisexual, lesbian or gay.”
What about immutability, the thought that someone put in Maxim’s head that he was born gay?

Letitia Anne Peplau and Linda D. Garnets, writing in the Journal of Social Issues, “Although additional research will fill in gaps in our knowledge, there is no reason to expect that biological factors play anything other than a minor and probably indirect role in women’s sexual orientation.” Rather there is “substantial indirect evidence in support of socialization model at the individual level.”
McHugh and others point out that if genetics were the cause of homosexuality then identical twins would always share the same sexual orientation as they always share the same eye color.  In fact, only roughly 30% of identical twins share a gay orientation, according to Kenneth Kendler’s paper in the American Journal of Psychiatry.  
McHugh cites a plethora of academic research concluding that, “…sexual orientation is influenced by a variety of factors beyond genetics or biology alone.” 
And the most recent statement from the American Psychiatric Association concludes, “Currently there is renewed interest in searching for biological etiologies for homosexuality. However, to date there are no replicated studies supporting any specific biological etiology for homosexuality.”
And what about permanence? Is homosexuality life-long? Once you discover your same-sex desire, does it never change? I am not talking here about therapy to alleviate unwanted same-sex attraction. Rather, academic research shows that quite separate from any such outside influence, that homosexuality is remarkably plastic.
Writing in the Journal of Social Issues, Lisa Diamond and Ritch Savin-Williams write, “Contrary to the notion that most sexual minorities undergo a one time discovery of their true identities, 50% of respondents had changed their identity label more than once since first relinquishing their heterosexual identity.”  
Writing in Developmental Psychology Lisa Diamond found “Half of the young women…relinquished the first sexual-minority they adopted.” In fact, a “10-year study of 79 non-heterosexual women reported that 67% changed their identity at least once and 36% changed their identity more than once.”
So, who is supposed to be talking to Maxim about such a complicated and thorny issue? Should it be gay advocates who have an ax to grind? Certainly, they would like to increase their tribe. And often they do this using phony science that says homosexuality is inborn and never changing.
The Russian people, supported by 100 human rights and other groups from around the world, have determined that such unscientific ideologues should be kept out of schools and out of sight of school children, and that the proper teacher for Maxim and others like him are those who love him most, his family.
Finally there is the question of the certitude of 16-year-olds. They are absolutely certain about a great many things. All of us were certain of things at 16 that seem crazy to us now. But, we grow and we change a great many things in our lives.
No doubt buoyed by sketchy adult advice, young Maxim is certain he wants to be with men and that he always will. But science shows that this question is vastly more complicated than that. Like all young people, Maxim deserves space to grow and learn and change and to be free from ideologies that may not have his best interests in mind.

The New Black Panther Party is in Sanford, Florida organizing rallies and gatherings to be held after the jury reaches a verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. The jury began its second day of deliberations on Saturday. 
Jurors are deliberating whether Zimmerman committed second-degree murder when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman has claimed he had to shoot Martin in self-defense. 


The Washington Times noted the group has tweeted, “New Black Panther Party will not give you specific details on anything other than to say we have rallies and street maneuvers planned.” The group has even tweeted about a planned Sept. 7 rally for Trayvon Martin: “We can’t and WON’T try to control the general dissatisfied population. For sure we are ORGANIZING.”

“If Zimmerman is acquitted there is likely to be unrest all over America. It will be way beyond the capacity of the NBPP,” the group tweeted. “From what we are hearing there is a HIGH chance of rebellion across the nation if Zimmerman is acquitted on all charges.”
The Times flagged some tweets that showed the group’s disdain for Zimmerman. The NBPP tweeted that Zimmerman was “exposed on closing arguments as a lying, conniving, manipulating scheming underhanded profiling devil” and that the prosecution’s “withering” closing argument “wiped that smile off his [expletive] face.”
On Friday, Malik Shabazz, Chairman of the the New Black Panther Party, appeared on the David Webb Show on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, which Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon guest-hosted. Shabazz claimed the New Black Panthers are in Sanford because President Barack Obama has encouraged more “traditional” civil rights groups and leaders, like Al Sharpton, to not play active roles in organizing protests during the trial. He said groups like the New Black Panthers have had to replace the more “traditional” civil rights groups who he claimed have been “silenced.”

When the media can aid Obama’s re-election through the fabrication of a divisive and completely phony black vs. white racial narrative, then the media are very interested in hate crimes and American racism. But when the media are handed an actual hate crime that involves a black man accused of gunning down four white people because they are white, the media collectively shrug.
The media also claim to be interested in mass-shootings. For days and sometimes weeks, we have seen our media turn their outlets over to obsessive coverage of one mass shooting after another. So you would think a racially-motivated mass-shooting would explode in the media. 


But according to our media, not all racially-motivated crimes and mass shootings are alike. In fact, if the media see no political upside, some racially-motivated mass-shootings are ignored as though they never even happened.  
In Greenville, North Carolina, it is now official. According to the Grand Jury indictments, a black man named Lakim Faust entered a Walmart in June with more than a hundred rounds of ammunition, and targeted white people based on their race:
Police said Faust’s first victim on June 21 was an insurance adjustor in the parking lot of a law firm. He then crossed a five-lane highway and shot three more people in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart, investigators said.

Three of the four people wounded in the shooting suffered permanent and debilitating injuries, according to the indictments. Details of those injuries were not specified.
In a just world, a local crime such as this would not deserve national coverage. One man does not in any way say anything larger about our society as a whole. But I do not write the rules, the media does; and the media poses as an objective institution concerned with hate crimes — so concerned, in fact, that they went so far as to manufacture evidence as a way to falsely accuse the Hispanic George Zimmerman of being both white and a racist. 
But an actual, official hate crime in North Carolina is completely ignored by this very same media. 
The reason is obvious: the objective, unbiased, not-at-all-liberal media see no political upside in a hate crime that can’t be used to gin up the left’s version of white guilt, push gun control, or falsely portray America as a country where white people still oppress minorities and therefore need a larger government to right these wrongs. 
The media ignoring this racially-motivated murder spree also has nothing to do with protecting black people. 
Sadly, the media don’t care about black people. This is why Chicago is ignored. Hundreds of black people are gunned down every year in Chicago. But the national media refuse to pressure the politicians in charge of that city and state to do anything, because on paper Chicago is a Liberal Utopia. The city also enforces some of the strongest gun control laws in the country.
If the media questions what is happening in Chicago, that would be mean questioning the very foundation of liberalism. And the media simply doesn’t believe a few hundred dead black people is worth doing anything that might undermine their political agenda.

Not every liberal journalist was brought to tears over the President’s belated statement on the George Zimmerman verdict.  Columnist Rich Benjamin at Salon.com called the effort “safe, over-rated and airy” and compared it unfavorably to Attorney General Eric Holder’s recent address to the NAACP by asking the provocative question: “Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Ni**er. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Ni**er?”

Finally the president has spoken about George Zimmerman’s acquittal. Even as the country waited for his singular response – the nation’s leader and a law professor who once looked like Trayvon Martin – the president danced around the issues. And what a dramatic anti-climax, listening to the president refuse to say anything insightful or profound about the acquittal. In signature professorial style, the president gave us the “context” to the episode and to black people’s “pain.” But he didn’t offer a meaningful opinion on the episode’s hot molten core: racial profiling, vigilantism, and “Stand Your Ground” laws.
Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric Holder delivered trenchant thoughts on the acquittal, demanding action. Before an audience of supporters, Holder recently called for a full investigation of Martin’s death after Zimmerman’s acquittal. Holder vowed that the Justice Department will act “in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We will not be afraid.”
“We must stand our ground,” he told supporters.
Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Ni**er. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Ni**er?

It’s an attention-getting way to suggest that Obama and Holder play “good cop/bad cop” on racial issues, and Benjamin goes on to show examples over their careers that support the idea.  Benjamin is a Senior Fellow at the liberal think tank Demos, has written extensively about the Zimmerman case, and has been critical of Obama’s reaction. 
The “Inner Ni**er” charge got a volatile reaction from most liberals who absolutely loved the meaningless, identity-politics-pander that President Obama passed off as a meaningful speech, and they took to Twitter to let Benjamin know. (H/T Tommy Christopher)


@elonjames Seriously @RichBenjaminUSA. What the fuck dude? Of all the framing around this you would use “Inner Nigger” to make this argument?
@elonjames Whether you thought that Obama’s speech is lacking or not, deliberate link bait like this is cheap and problematic at best.
@AngryBlackLady When I said publish more voices of color, this wasn’t what I had in mind, @Salon.
@AngryBlackLady I can’t. i can’t. RT @tommyxtopher: @AngryBlackLady @Salon @elonjames cue Rush Limbaugh “satire.” Maybe a parody Stevie Wonder album cover?
@elonjames Wow. And @Salon-do you guys not have editors? What editor in their right mind sees “Inner Nigger” and thinks “Publish this ASAP.”
@elonjames Fuck your career. This isnt about how many hits you can get. This is so much bigger than that and muthafuckas out here trying to be popular.
@elonjames Dear White People & Organizations: having negroes make dumbass arguments does not shield you from critique. CC: @Salon
@elonjames At this point @Salon should rename itself “White Liberal Bullshit Weekly.”
@AngryBlackLady And @Salon published that nonsense by @RichBenjaminUSA with Trayvon’s name spelled incorrectly in the photo caption — so that’s delightful.
@goldietaylor I don’t even know what to say. Why would a progressive site publish a piece re: POTUS’ “inner n-word”? 

That last tweet from MSNBC’s Goldie Taylor is instructive in that she acknowledges that “progressive sites” tend not to publish anything that would be seen as critical of President Obama, especially an article critical of the President within the realm of race.

On Monday, in response to my piece on 17-year-old Darryl Green of Chicago, who was found shot to death after refusing to join a gang at school, Jamelle Bouie of The Daily Beast claimed that “black-on-black crime” is a myth. “There’s no such thing as ‘black-on-black’ crime. Yes, from 1976 to 2005, 94 percent of black victims were killed by black offenders, but that racial exclusivity was also true for white victims of violent crime–86 percent were killed by white offenders. Indeed, for the large majority of crimes, you’ll find that victims and offenders share a racial identity, or have some prior relationship to each other,” wrote Bouie. Bouie added, “Nor are African-Americans especially criminal. If they were, you would still see high rates of crime among blacks, even as the nation sees a historic decline in criminal offenses. Instead, crime rates among African-Americans, and black youth in particular, have taken a sharp drop.”

That, of course, is not the point. Of course the vast majority of murdered whites are murdered by other whites. That’s why there’s no national outrage when a white person is killed by a black person: it’s not evidence of some underlying black violence problem directed against white people. But when a white Hispanic kills a black man (a far less common occurrence than a black person killing a white person), that’s taken as evidence of a deeply racist America requiring a media tsunami. And when a black person kills a black person, the media ignores it completely.

African-Americans aren’t especially criminal, of course; for Bouie to impute such notions to those who are concerned about black-on-black crime is insidious and vile. But the notion that we don’t see “high rates of crime among blacks” is sadly untrue. The numbers are coming down, but black Americans still commit a disproportionate amount of crime. Blacks represent 13.1 percent of the American population, but 49 percent of the murder victims. More than half of those victims were in their teens or twenties. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, “The percentage of black offenders [in sexual violence cases] increased from 18% in 1994-1998 to 27% in 2005-2010.” Thankfully, crime across the board is dropping, including in the black community. But that does not mean that the black community is not still plagued by black-on-black crime that far surpasses the problem of white-on-white crime by percentage, and absolutely dwarfs the problem of white-on-black crime.

Bouie’s real point is that statistics should not matter – disproportionate black-on-black murder is the result of white racism anyway. “And while it’s true that young black men are a disproportionate share of the nation’s murder victims, it’s hard to disentangle this from the stew of hyper-segregation (often a result of deliberate policies), entrenched poverty, and nonexistent economic opportunities that characterizes a substantial number of black communities,” Bouie wrote. Let’s assume all of that’s the case, for the sake of argument. That still does not justify the media’s disproportionate attention to a problem that does not heavily plague the black community — white (or white Hispanic) on black crime – even while ignoring the sort of crime that destroys black communities day in and day out, in the name of liberal policies and political correctness. The longer those on the left continue to ignore real problems in the black community, the more Darryl Greens will be murdered.

The mainstream media have awoken to the fact that President Barack Obama’s partisan attack on Republicans during the Navy Yard attack on Monday may not have been the best idea, even if only for tactical reasons. 
The New York Times‘ Maureen Dowd worried that Obama’s speech meant that he “cannot seem to connect anymore” and concluded that the president had been “overtaken by events.” The Hill called it a political “blunder” and agreed, via a quote from a “former aide,” that he had been “overtaken by events.” (Poor President Obama, always the victim of circumstances not of his own making, always “overtaken by events”!)


While it is encouraging that the media have noticed Obama’s attack–even though most networks cut away after he briefly mentioned the Navy Yard shooting–they continue to ignore three glaring problems:

1. The fact that Obama never considered canceling or postponing the speech. A president who does not realize that a mass shooting on a military base in the nation’s capital city is a reason to suspend politics as usual is dangerously removed from his duties as commander-in-chief–never mind the political damage. In addition, he is receiving bad advice, ignoring good advice, or simply not being advised by staff who have learned that he tunes out all but a select group of trusted Chicago insiders and loyalists. By putting politics first, the Obama administration is putting the nation at risk–at a time when risks are only growing.
2. The fact that the media pilloried Mitt Romney for lesser sins in 2012. When Mitt Romney issued a statement criticizing the Obama administration’s apologetic response to the Cairo embassy attack on Sep. 11 last year, the media attacked him viciously. Romney, too, was “overtaken by events”: he did not know that four Americans would be killed in Benghazi. But the media never let Romney forget his alleged gaffe, while giving Obama a pass for his inaction that night. Because the media never hold Obama accountable for anything, he rarely takes his governing responsibilities seriously, exacerbating a dangerous vacuum in national leadership.
3. The fact that the Navy Yard attack happened at all, four years after Ft. Hood. It is easier for the Obama-supporting media to dwell on an inappropriate speech than to ask the much more important question: how did the attack happen at all? Four years after a similar mass shooting at Fort Hood, was nothing done to improve security at military bases? Why were rules restricting guns on base not changed?  Did the Obama administration let the nation’s guard down by downplaying Ft. Hood as “workplace violence” instead of terrorism? Why, after the NSA scandal, was there no review of security clearance procedures and lists?

On Thursday, a town hall meeting hosted by Al Sharpton and the National Action Network to address gun violence exploded into a revolt against “Chicago Machine” politics, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and the aldermen in City Hall, with panel and audience members calling to vote out their elected officials. 
One 82-year-old preacher even called for “Tea Party” style meetings in some of Chicago’s south side communities such as Altgeld Gardens and Trumbull Park.



“This was a historic event,” Paul McKinley of V.O.T.E. (Voices of the Ex-Offender) and former 2nd Congressional District GOP nominee to replace Jesse Jackson, Jr. told Breitbart News. “Not because of Al Sharpton coming to town,” he continued. “This was first time since electing Mayor Harold Washington in the eighties that all of these grassroots groups and community organizers have come together under one roof to talk about the problems plaguing our community.”

While the stated goal for Sharpton was to bring the many different groups together to discuss solutions to the city’s violence epidemic, he may not have gotten the types of responses he was looking for. Calls for more gun control laws and getting guns off the streets were nonexistent and not mentioned by residents throughout the session. 
Instead, attendees offered solutions addressing the problems facing their community as a whole rather than just taking on “gun violence” itself. Audience members addressed the need for jobs and solving the foreclosure crisis plaguing Chicago’s south and west sides. Perhaps the loudest message–and one that Reverend Al or the Chicago media have yet to report on–echoed by several different people in attendance as well as panel members was that it is time for the black community to start voting differently.
“The manner in which we have been voting needs to change,” Wendy Pearson, an activist against Chicago school closings, told the room. “I’m here to say to you that we have been trained to vote in a specific manner… we need to start looking at the manner in which our elected officials have been voting… if they have not voted in a manner that is beneficial to you, yours, and your community, then you need to start voting them out.”
McKinley told the room, “Stop blaming just anybody for the violence in the city of Chicago. Blame the right people, not just white people, but the right people. Because it’s not just white folks a part of this, but it is on the fifth floor. The fifth floor took your schools, the fifth floor just took your jobs that he said that he gave to the ex-offender… and every single alderman was a part of this criminal process.”
McKinley called on President Obama to help the grassroots by discontinuing aid and government grants that go through Chicago’s political machine to “name-brand-blue-ribbon-negro-organizations” such as the NAACP and Urban League. McKinley told Breitbart News those groups “are poverty pimps, and are part of the problem and not the solution.”

Speaking in the final Virginia gubernatorial debate on October 24, Democrat candidate Terry McAuliffe said he doesn’t care “what grade [he] got from the NRA” and that more gun control is necessary.
The debate took place at Virginia Tech, and McAuliffe referenced the 2007 shooting on that campus as justification for more gun control. 
Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli correctly stated more gun control would not have prohibited that shooting and that shooters like the killer in that instance, Seung-Hui Cho, are “almost impossible” to find before they decide to start shooting. McAuliffe replied, “Some people should not own guns.” He then defended his gun control proposals, saying: “I don’t care what grade I got from the NRA. I never want to see another Newtown or Aurora or Virginia Tech again.”


Cuccinelli’s argument is in line with experts on the subjects of firearms and the mentally ill. Mayo Clinic psychiatrist J. Michael Bostwick, M.D., recently wrote that more gun control aimed at the mentally will not end mass shootings. According to Bostwick, not even confiscating guns from the mentally ill will do that. 

He says this is because the great percentage of the mentally ill are not dangerous, while individuals who commit mass shootings and are mentally ill are usually only discovered to suffer from mental illness after the fact. 
On top of this, an internal investigation by a Virginia Tech Review Panel reported that more gun control would not have stopped the Virginia Tech shooting. Looking particularly at bans on “high capacity” magazines–bans which McAuliffe supports–the review panel said having 10 round magazines instead of 15 round magazines “would have not made that much difference in the incident.”

“You come in here, brandish your little book as if I don’t know what’s in there–” 
“My little book? That’s the Constitution of the United States. It’s our founding document, Piers.” 


“I know what’s in your Constitution.” 
“Do you really?” 
That was the climax of a heated debate between Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Ben Shapiro and CNN’s Piers Morgan on live television this evening–one in which Morgan came off much the worse for wear.

Shapiro began by pointing out that for weeks, Morgan had bullied guests who defend the right to bear arms by “standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook.” 
“How dare you,” said a rattled Morgan. 
“I have seen you do it repeatedly,” Shapiro replied. 
He challenged Morgan to explain whether he wanted to ban all guns, not just “assault rifles,” since the vast majority of gun deaths involve ordinary handguns. “Why don’t you care about banning the handguns in Chicago?” Shapiro asked him.
Morgan, who later stated that he supported Americans’ right “to defend themselves with a handgun or a pistol,” pointed out that the weapons used in recent sensational mass shootings had been “assault rifles,” and insisted that the debate was not one of “left and right,” because his position ought to be the consensus, as in Britain. Shapiro countered that the basis of the Second Amendment was not self-defense or hunting, but the ability to resist government tyranny–a point that Morgan attempted to mock, unsuccessfully.

Shapiro’s statement is worth quoting in full: 

Shapiro: I think the reason that it’s about left and right here is because fundamentally, the right believes that the basis for the Second amendment–and they believe in the Second Amendment–the basis for the Second Amendment is not really about self defense, and it’s not about hunting. It’s about resistance to government tyranny. That’s what the Founders said, and that’s what the right believes in this country.
Morgan: Which tyranny are you fearing, yourself? 
Shapiro: I fear the possibility of a tyranny rising in the country in the next fifty to a hundred years. Let me tell you something, Piers. The fact that my grandparents and great grandparents in Europe didn’t fear that is why they’re now ashes in Europe. So this kind of leftist revisionist history where there’s never any fear of democracy going usurpatious or tyrannical, is just that. It’s fictitious.


Subsequently, Morgan accused Shapiro of wanting to “do nothing” about mass shootings, to which Shapiro replied that his position was to improve background checks and screening for mental illness and criminal histories among potential gun owners and their households. Shapiro later pointed out the hypocrisy in attacking the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment without subjecting violent video games, the American Civil Liberties Union and the First Amendment to the same scrutiny.
Morgan then presented Shapiro with a letter co-signed by Ronald Reagan in 1994, urging support for the assault weapons ban (an ineffective policy, which lapsed after ten years). He challenged Shapiro to justify “why an American needs an assault weapon.”
Shapiro repeated his point on tyranny, to which Morgan said: “Do you know how absurd you sound?” 
In so doing, he proved Shapiro’s point: 

Here’s where you go into the bullying….For weeks now, you have been saying that anybody who disagrees with your position is absurd, idiotic, and doesn’t care about the dead kids in Sandy Hook. And then when I say that’s a bullying tactic, you turn around and say that I’m bullying you.

Later on the program, once Shapiro was safely off camera, Morgan admitted: “In an ideal world, I’d have all guns gone, as we have in Britain, but this is not my country and I respect the fact most Americans wouldn’t wear that kind of argument.” 
An epic win for Shapiro, and for our “little book.”

Writer and film director David Mamet has weighed in on the current gun control push, and what he sees as government overreach couched in an “assault weapons” ban that is actually “a political appeal to the ignorant.”
Mamet describes it as a “hoax”- a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist, because “assault weapons” are used in few crimes, and the very designation “assault weapon” is based on a gun’s cosmetics–i.e., does it look menacing?
Going after such guns makes some people feel safer because they have slowly, and perhaps unknowingly, traded their independence for a “government knows best” mentality. 


Think about Ronald Reagan’s 10 most dangerous words in the English language–“Hi, I’m from the government and I’m here to help.” Reagan saw these words as dangerous because they were indicative of an encroaching government that had taken unto itself the role of determining what was best for you and for me: a role for which our government simply was not designed.

Mamet sees the government doing this very thing with an “assault weapons” ban, in that he sees it determining what guns we can and can’t own based on what has been determined that we do or don’t need. And as Mamet so ably points out, government officials exercise Marxist principles when they limit our exercise of freedom based on what they think we need.
This is all part of the “hoax.” It takes our eyes off of the real solution to crime in this country-namely, the strength of the individual and an armed citizenry-and it makes us think the answer is a blind trust in the supposed-altruistic aims of our government.
According to Mamet, the height of hypocrisy is that the people who are trying to disarm us are themselves surrounded (protected) by heavily armed guards. 
He specifically mentions Obama in this instance, and the way Obama has ordered armed guards for himself and his family for life. To this Mamet simply says: “Evidently, [Obama] feels he is best qualified to determine his needs, and of course, he is.” And subsequently, remarks Mamet, “I [too] am best qualified to determine mine.”

Don’t look for a new Justice Department report about American gun violence to receive any serious media coverage over the coming days, or ever.  According to the report from the department’s Bureau of Statistics, every argument the media and the left are currently making to push for new restrictions on our Second Amendment civil rights, are made up of anti-science nonsense. This report not only proves the media wrong, it proves the NRA right. 
Between the years of 1993 and 2011, as the assault weapons ban expired, more Americans purchased guns, the Supreme Court overturned outright gun bans, and individual states not only loosed gun control restrictions but also issued concealed carry permits to private citizens, incidents of gun violence in America collapsed. 


Between 1993 and 2011, nonfatal gun crimes plummeted 69%; from 1.5 million to 467,300. Gun-related murders dropped 40%; from 18,253 to 11,101. Gun-related murders for black Americans plummeted by 51%.
The report also shows that the media-created hysteria over school shootings is wildly misleading. Between ’93 and ’11, the murder rate in schools dropped by almost a third; from 29 to 20. 
Background checks have also been exposed as another bogus narrative the media’s crafted out of thin air. This report proves beyond any doubt that closing the so-called gun show loophole will accomplish next to nothing.  Less than one-percent of state prisoners caught with a gun purchased it at a gun show.  Moreover, who knows how many of those criminals might have passed or did pass a background check. 

So-called assault weapons are also not a problem, Only “2% of state inmates and 3% of federal inmates were armed with a military-style semiautomatic or fully automatic firearm.” 
What this study clearly shows is that Obama, Democrats, and the media don’t give a damn about stopping gun violence. If they did, they would be focused on everything but the one and two-percent problems. 
What we have here is a yet-another culture war; nothing more nothing less — and one aimed at the type of law-abiding citizens who attend gun shows and enjoy these so-called assault weapons. In other words, Red State conservatives. 
What is especially crucial to keep in mind is that 2011 is not some kind of outlier. If you study the original report, you will see that these decreases are all part of an 18-year trend, not an outlier year or two. 
This report is extremely good news is you are the kind of person who gives a damn about human life. 

But if you are cynical, power-hungry Democrats more uncomfortable with the idea of human freedom than you are pleased with a decrease in human life, this report is bad news. Furthermore, if you are a dishonest member of the media who believes that delivering political wins to Democrats is more important than human life, this report is also bad news. 
There is just no question that an armed American populace is a safer American populace. This study also proves that smart policing and a willingness to award serious jail time to violent offenders (two areas  our criminal justice system have focused on over the last two decades) does a helluva lot more to decrease the rate of gun violence than purely symbolic gun-grabbing laws. 
Thanks to this study we also know for a fact now that the Newtown massacre is being exploited by the media only to demonize Obama’s political enemies.

President Barack Obama lashed out defiantly and viciously at political opponents who defeated his efforts to expand federal gun regulations today. Standing with families of victims of the Newtown school shooting at the White House, the president claimed that opponents of expanded federal background checks had “no coherent arguments” for their position, and that the “gun lobby” had “willfully lied” in the course of the debate.
Ironically, while accusing others of lying, President Obama resorted to false claims and statistics about current laws, including the repeatedly debunked argument that 40% of gun sales are private, and that guns can be bought over the Internet without background checks. It was partly the dishonesty of those very arguments that had led potential supporters of new bipartisan legislation to doubt the administration’s motives in supporting the bill.


The administration’s defeat came earlier Wednesday, when the Senate failed to pass a cloture motion to end debate on a bipartisan proposal introduced by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). Only 54 votes of the necessary 60 votes could be found to support an expanded federal background check system (among other changes), partly because of fears that extending such checks would require the creation of a federal gun registry that could lead to confiscation.
The failure brought an end to four months of fervent campaigning by the president during which he used the Newtown disaster–or, in the eyes of many critics, exploited it–to make an argument about the urgent need for new laws, even if such laws would not have prevented the Newtown atrocity itself. Many Democrats rallied behind him, hoping at first to pass a new assault weapons ban, then abandoning that effort for more modest regulations.
Along the way, the administration lost the support of Democratic Senators in conservative states, many of whom will face re-election in 2014. President Obama made clear his intention to use Wednesday’s defeat to rally supporters against Republicans, whom he blamed directly and angrily, suggesting that they had defied the will of the American people and attempted to silence the families of Newtown victims who had a “right” to be heard in the debate.

Forced to cover a rare political defeat for the president, the mainstream media largely echoed his emotions. Virtually all of CNN’s correspondents agreed that the Manchin-Toomey bill had been defeated because of the power of the National Rifle Association and the fear of politicians afraid to take on Second Amendment activists. None considered that support for gun control has been declining, or that the legislation itself was deeply flawed.
Again and again, President Obama noted that 90% of Americans, and a majority of National Rifle Association members, supported expanded background checks. The former constitutional law lecturer seemed to expect that that majority’s will should be self-executing, ignoring the fact that constitutional rights like the Second Amendment exist precisely to protect minorities against majoritarian passions and presidential demagoguery.
Indeed, while the president described the failure of the legislation as a failure of “Washington,” it was also–and primarily–a failure of his administration. A White House operation and Obama campaign apparatus that is regarded as brutally effective ought to have been able to sell a proposal allegedly supported by 90% of the voting public. Yet persistent troubles in execution and failures of policy raise questions about whether Obama secretly preferred failure to success.
His opponents, the president insisted, refused to make it more difficult for “dangerous criminals” to buy weapons–ignoring one of the core arguments of the other side, namely that dangerous criminals frequently ignore the law to obtain weapons, while law-abiding citizens bear the burden of new rules and restrictions. He reduced his opponents’ motives to pure politics, accusing them of being afraid of being punished by an organized, determined minority.
Rarely have Americans ever seen a president attack his opponents so viciously, expressing and evoking such visceral emotions–especially at a time of mourning. President Obama’s tirade contrasted with his reserved, measured response to the Boston Marathon bombings, in which he urged Americans to speak and act with restraint. If this has been, as he claimed, “a pretty shameful day in Washington,” the president’s tantrum was the most shameful moment of all.

As an “assault weapons” ban seems less likely to even make it to a floor vote, President Obama and Democrat lawmakers are increasingly looking to universal background checks as the piece of legislation they can push through the House and Senate.
Here’s the problem: Universal background checks are the most insidious of all the gun control measures pushed heretofore. They will rob of us of more freedom than an “assault weapons” ban and a “high capacity” magazine ban combined, all in the name of preventing another Sandy Hook shooting. Yet they will actually do nothing to prevent such a shooting. Nothing at all. 


As David Kopel so ably put it in his Jan. 30 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, universal background checks necessitate a gun registry if they are to be enforceable. 

Put simply, this means that once a universal background state statute is in place, the government will require you to register every gun you own–shotguns, rifles, and handguns–so that they can be sure you do not sell a gun privately. 
Which brings us to our second point: universal background checks will end private sales, period. No more sales to neighbors, no more sales between a father and his son or a mother and her daughter. No more sales between friends. 
Once guns are registered, and private sales have been ended, the door will be opened for taxes allocated per number of guns owned, forced liability insurance payable based on number of guns owned, and for outright gun confiscation. 
The NRA has warned about the confiscation that usually follows registration, historically speaking, and the Democrats themselves are already promoting per-gun taxes and liability insurance. 
The bottom line: Universal background checks represent the crest of the hill atop the slippery slope. We must contact our Reps. and Sens. and demand that they say no to this insidious gun control measure.
It has nothing to with Sandy Hook Elementary, but everything to do with helping Democrats realize their dreams of crushing the 2nd Amendment.

Washington, D.C. has historically been one of America’s most difficult places for law-abiding citizens to obtain and own a firearm, especially a handgun. D.C. had a complete ban on handguns since 1976 until a 2008 Supreme Court decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, that struck down what was ruled an unconstitutional ban.
“Local lawmakers in DC have managed to keep a de facto ban in tact by making it very difficult for law-abiding citizens to get guns,” said AWR Hawkins, Ph.D, a military historian and writer for Breitbart News. He pointed out in an interview for this article that D.C. officials’ gun control efforts only affect law-abiding citizens while criminals simply ignore the laws.
He pointed out that criminals did not pay attention to the past unconstitutional handgun ban or any of the D.C. rules on keeping guns unloaded and unlocked or disassembled. Dr. Hawkins explained his views on the previous formal ban and the now de facto ban:


These laws clearly give criminals the upper hand in at least two ways: 1) They make it clear that law-abiding citizens will be unarmed (defenseless) against an armed attack as they go through their daily routines on the streets of DC. 2) These laws are so burdensome they actually dissuade people from getting guns to begin with.
Dr. Hawkins’ analysis is reinforced greatly by the recent July 2, 2013 prison sentences handed down in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to six narcotics traffickers and money launderers. The U.S. Attorney’s office said “agents and detectives seized multiple handguns, more than a kilogram of powder cocaine, large quantities of crack cocaine, and over $40,000 in cash.”
The U.S. Attorney’s office described the investigation that led to the six arrests, prosecutions, and sentences as “a long-term investigation.” This indicates that the area’s gun-bans resulted in an extended period of time where the only people carrying firearms were criminals with no regard for law. The case further indicates that even with some of the nation’s strictest guns laws, it took a long-term effort to apprehend and charge gun-toting felons and prevent their guns from being a threat to law-abiding citizens who are left defenseless against such criminals.

Today, former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), who was famously shot by mentally ill Jared Lee Loughner in Tucson, Arizona, testified before the Senate on gun control. While Giffords and her husband, former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, testified that they weren’t there as victims but as Americans, the reverse was clearly the case: as shooting victims, they have been trotted out by the left-leaning media to provide Cindy Sheehan-like “absolute moral authority.” The implication: disagree with the politics of these victims, and you don’t care enough about them.
The media coverage of Giffords’ testimony exploited Giffords’ victimhood to the hilt. But The Atlantic led the way with a picture of her “handwritten notes,” which The Atlantic labeled “pen-scrawled words … deliberate … diligent … written on a surface all too familiar to schoolchildren: binder paper.” And, The Atlantic added, “She is trapped in her injury. And few things make that point more powerfully than a piece of binder paper and a hand-scrawled message.”


The Atlantic got the photo from the Washington Post, which had put it up. Buzzfeed, too, put up the photo, quoting the Americans for Responsible Solutions Facebook page:

It will be hard. But the time is now. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you” – Like and share Gabby Giffords’ handwritten testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun violence. Join her and Mark Kelly by texting SOLUTIONS to 90975.
So did ThinkProgress. And Business Insider.
Except that Giffords didn’t scrawl that message. Her speech therapist did.
That doesn’t mean that Giffords doesn’t think the things that her therapist wrote. It does show, however, how far the media is willing to go in order to exploit shooting victims to further the gun control agenda. 
It is Giffords’ choice to be there. It is the Democrats’ and media’s and President Obama’s choice to exploit her presence. Then again, the left has never been shy about hiding behind victims to push their politics.

A week from today, voters in Colorado will be offered the opportunity to recall two state senators who voted for increased gun control in the wake of the shootings at Newtown. We hope that they will take it.
Ripe for the chopping block are Angela Giron, of Pueblo, and senate president John Morse, of Colorado Springs. Both ignored the will of their constituents and pushed for limits on the size of magazines and the extension of background checks to private sales. Now they may lose their jobs.


Because the United States is not a direct democracy, the dismissal of public officials outside the healthy rhythm of regularly scheduled elections is a tool that should be used sparingly. Nevertheless, there remain certain circumstances in which the offenses committed are sufficiently grievous to render such an approach appropriate, which goes some way to explaining why the citizens of Colorado have felt provoked to call for the first recall elections in the state’s 137-year history.

As in New York and Connecticut, lawmakers in Colorado were aware that gun-control efforts benefit immensely from the unlovely combination of legislative haste and emotional rawness — and they leveraged both. During debate, swathes of law-enforcement officers went to the capital to argue against the proposals; they were turned away at the door. Women, many of whom had been the victims of sexual violence, assembled to add their input; they were treated with condescension and impatience — if they were called to speak at all. Citizens who had driven down from other parts of the state were so frustrated at being kept out of committee meetings in Denver that they drove around the capitol building for eight hours honking their horns. This was not, to borrow a favored chant of the Left, what democracy looks like.

For those of us foolish enough to live in a crime-gripped city while also summarily denied our constitutional right to protect ourselves, this week’s massacre at the Navy Yard pretty well sums up our insane, defenseless existence.
Our Capitol Hill neighborhood drowned in the scream of sirens as police cars, vans, trucks, and armored vehicles streaked through the narrow streets at deadly speeds. The skies filled with the constant wapping of countless helicopters.


Just back from dropping children off at school, neighbors began frantically calling, texting and emailing one another to see what was wrong. The crisp morning reminded many of Sept. 11, 2001.
Police dispatched text and email alerts to residents that there was an “active shooter” at the nearby Navy Yard, just blocks from where our children play little league baseball. Many were dead and more injured, we were told. 
Then the terrifying news: As many as two more shooters were on the loose and being sought. 

D.C. police concluded their advisory to residents with the same admonishment that punctuates every crime alert: “DO NOT TAKE ACTION.” Instead, we are given an “event” number and instructed to call 911.
As any decent American knows, there is no feeling more powerless than to realize that a couple of mass murderers are loose in your neighborhood and you are denied the right to keep a gun to defend yourself, your family, or your home. A sickening knot tightens in your gut.
“DO NOT TAKE ACTION.”
Then came the latest Orwellian phrase in the “homeland security” lexicon: “Shelter in place!”
So, not only are you not allowed to defend yourself against mass murderers, you are not supposed to run from them either.

This, my fellow countrymen, is pure insanity.
And all the terror and real bloody carnage took place inside the most impenetrable fortress of gun control utopia.
The very guns Aaron Alexis used to kill 12 people are banned in this city, unless you submit to an exhaustive, invasive, and expensive process and prove to the city bureaucracy that you are worthy of your Second Amendment rights. Clearly, that failed.
We now know that Alexis was run through to the normal background checks already in place to purchase a gun from a gun dealer. He submitted to even more exhaustive background checks to get his job and access to the Navy Yard. All of those background checks, and he still massacred 12 people. 
We also now know that Alexis had multiple run-ins with police in various states and was accused of committing numerous gun crimes, including firing a gun into his neighbor’s occupied apartment and blasting the tires off of a car in a fit of rage. In those cases, existing laws were already in place to nab the lunatic and strip him of his gun rights. For whatever reason, these laws that should have flagged him as a dangerous criminal were not enforced.
So here we are with 12 good people dead, living in the land of gun control, where terror reigns because the criminals have guns and the rest of us are scolded “DO NOT TAKE ACTION” and “Shelter in place!”
The great cartoon philosopher Gary Larson once drew a panel of what he imagined a boneless chicken ranch might look like. Already flightless, the limp birds lay all about unable to even raise their heads with their legs splayed out in ridiculous fashion.
That is what we are here. Flightless and defenseless. As a cartoon about boneless chickens is hilarious; as a way of life, it is terrifying.

On Thursday, a town hall meeting hosted by Al Sharpton and the National Action Network to address gun violence exploded into a revolt against “Chicago Machine” politics, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, and the aldermen in City Hall, with panel and audience members calling to vote out their elected officials. 
One 82-year-old preacher even called for “Tea Party” style meetings in some of Chicago’s south side communities such as Altgeld Gardens and Trumbull Park.



“This was a historic event,” Paul McKinley of V.O.T.E. (Voices of the Ex-Offender) and former 2nd Congressional District GOP nominee to replace Jesse Jackson, Jr. told Breitbart News. “Not because of Al Sharpton coming to town,” he continued. “This was first time since electing Mayor Harold Washington in the eighties that all of these grassroots groups and community organizers have come together under one roof to talk about the problems plaguing our community.”

While the stated goal for Sharpton was to bring the many different groups together to discuss solutions to the city’s violence epidemic, he may not have gotten the types of responses he was looking for. Calls for more gun control laws and getting guns off the streets were nonexistent and not mentioned by residents throughout the session. 
Instead, attendees offered solutions addressing the problems facing their community as a whole rather than just taking on “gun violence” itself. Audience members addressed the need for jobs and solving the foreclosure crisis plaguing Chicago’s south and west sides. Perhaps the loudest message–and one that Reverend Al or the Chicago media have yet to report on–echoed by several different people in attendance as well as panel members was that it is time for the black community to start voting differently.
“The manner in which we have been voting needs to change,” Wendy Pearson, an activist against Chicago school closings, told the room. “I’m here to say to you that we have been trained to vote in a specific manner… we need to start looking at the manner in which our elected officials have been voting… if they have not voted in a manner that is beneficial to you, yours, and your community, then you need to start voting them out.”
McKinley told the room, “Stop blaming just anybody for the violence in the city of Chicago. Blame the right people, not just white people, but the right people. Because it’s not just white folks a part of this, but it is on the fifth floor. The fifth floor took your schools, the fifth floor just took your jobs that he said that he gave to the ex-offender… and every single alderman was a part of this criminal process.”
McKinley called on President Obama to help the grassroots by discontinuing aid and government grants that go through Chicago’s political machine to “name-brand-blue-ribbon-negro-organizations” such as the NAACP and Urban League. McKinley told Breitbart News those groups “are poverty pimps, and are part of the problem and not the solution.”

Democrats enjoy a supermajority in the Illinois House of Representatives, holding 71 seats to the GOP’s 47. On Wednesday, the same day the US Senate voted down gun control legislation, powerful Democrat Speaker Michael Madigan tried to push a restrictive gun control measure through his chamber. The result was an open revolt by downstate Democrats, with almost half the Democrat caucus joining the GOP to kill the measure. The bill went down 31-76, a rare defeat for the legendary Madigan. 
Illinois is currently the only state in the country which doesn’t allow its citizens to have a concealed-carry gun permit. In December 2012, a federal appeals court struck down the state’s ban on concealed-carry permits, effectively ordering the state to enact the gun rights’ permit. The state is under a court-ordered deadline to pass the legislation.
On Wednesday, Dem leadership in the House moved legislation that would put severe restrictions on concealed-carry permits. It would provide that local law enforcement officials “may issue” permits, a provision that would allow local officials to effectively deny citizens in a particular jurisdiction a permit. “Must issue” permits, as long as certain criteria are met, conform more to our 2nd Amendment rights as local officials are not given the power to deny the permits. 


My first political job was in the Illinois legislature a life-time ago. Madigan, who is Chair of the IL Democrat party and father to state Attorney General Lisa Madigan, was Speaker then, as well. He is among the more shrewd and calculating political power-brokers in the country. He almost never loses a floor vote. 

It is possible, however, that he orchestrated the vote to allow his members from outside Chicago to vote against the measure. It wouldn’t be the first time he allowed the defeat of a progressive policy to protect members of his caucus. 
Either way, the Democrat revolt on the gun control measure shows the bad politics around the issue. Even while Obama embraces gun control at the federal level, Democrats in his home state reject them. Unlike Obama, they have to face voters again.

Gilberton, PA, Police Chief Mark Kessler was suspended after posting videos of himself shooting borough-owned automatic weapons and shouting obscenities about liberal attacks on the Second Amendment. And heading into the August 30 Gilberton Borough Council meeting–where he is expected to learn his professional fate–Kessler makes it clear he is willing to lose his job for the Second Amendment.
As time draws closer to the council meeting that could end his police career, Kessler says: “The support has been overwhelming, both national and international. I find it truly amazing how many people finally say, ‘You know what? This guy’s right.'”
In one of the video’s Kessler posted, he stands with an ‘assault rifle’ slung over his shoulder and reads a few pre-scripted words about Secretary of State John Kerry’s support of the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty–the treaty which undermines the Second Amendment by giving the international body ruling authority over small arms in the U.S. 


Here’s what Kessler says in the video: “They’re at it again. They just don’t know when to quit. …Kerry says, ‘U.S. will sign U.N. treaty on arms regulations despite lawmaker’s opposition.'” Kessler then looks right into the camera and says, “Secretary of State of John Kerry, that piece of shit…who is he to decide what we can and can’t own? And fuck the U.N. Who are they to decide what we, the American people, can own?”

Kessler then adds: “I have a message to Kerry and to these $%#@suckers in the U.N., ….sign anything you want to sign, it’s not going to mean shit. It [doesn’t] mean shit to me.”
Kessler then screams the Gonzales battle cry, “Come and take it!” and turns away from the camera and opens full-auto fire into the hillside right behind him.
The man loves freedom and he does not want an international body taking it away by degrees. He says that if he loses his job for standing up for the Second Amendment he is “willing to pay that price.”

George Soros’ Center for American Progress (CAP) has published a list of 13 new pieces of legislation they claim we need right now, in the wake of the crime at Sandy Hook Elementary.
As you will see, these proposals–like others from liberals–would not have stopped the shooting from taking place: they would not even have hindered it. But they would make it harder for law abiding citizens to get the guns they need to defend their lives and families.
For example, one of new laws that CAP wants is an end to private gun sales. This would include, of course, an end to those dreaded gun shows. 


Question: Did Adam Lanza buy his guns in a private sale? No. He took them illegally and used them illegally.
Another proposal by CAP is for states to turn over more personal information on citizens to the federal gov. so that background checks work better. 
Question: Did Adam Lanza foil the background check system to get his weapons? No. As a matter of fact, reports indicate he purposely forewent the background check because he knew he wouldn’t pass it.

Many of the other proposals include things which you probably guessed Soros & Co. would suggest–“assault weapon” ban, “high capacity magazine” ban, start gun registry database, and “treat gun trafficking as a serious crime.”
Seriously–what does a gun registry have to with ending crime?
And it’s funny that we need to treat gun-trafficking “as a serious crime,” when the highest ranking law enforcement official in our nation–AG Eric Holder–sat over a gun trafficking scheme that eventually meant 2,500 firearms were smuggled out of the U.S. and into Mexico. I do not remember Soros calling for Holder’s prosecution over that. 
To be fair, Soros & Co. do make one point that’s quasi-sensible. And that’s that federal agencies need to communicate with one another more when one agency has pertinent information on a potential gun buyer (conservatives have said this same thing concerning terrorism and terrorists for years).
They highlight this need by pointing out that Tuscon shooter Jared Loughner was denied entrance into the Army because of drug abuse problems in 2008. They believe this information, had it been shared with other agencies, would have prevented Loughner from passing a background check for the handgun he used in his crime against former Rep. Gabby Giffords. 
It must be noted, however, that even this quasi-sensible suggestion is a non-starter if it is a backdoor avenue to a new registry.
Soros & Co. undoubtedly believe guns are the problem. Rational people, on the other hand, know that criminals are the problem. If we create registries, pass bans, and give the government a greater share in our daily lives than they already have, we will soon realize that we ourselves have infringed on the very right our Founders marked as sacrosanct–private gun ownership.

Colorado Democrats are prepared to launch an all-out war on guns with legislation that includes bans on “high capacity” magazines, requirements for universal background checks, fees for existing background checks, and allowing victims of gun violence to sue firearm manufacturers for the misuse of weapons.
The proposed ban on “high capacity” magazines and the call for universal background checks are both reflective of similar measures being pushed by Democrats around the country. 
As I have made clear in earlier posts, if universal background checks are implemented, they will not only stop private sales and close the “gun show loophole,” but will also take away a grandfather’s ability to simply give his favorite rifle to his grandson or for a mother to give a handgun to her daughter for self-defense. 


In both scenarios, the guns will have to be registered, the government will have to be notified, specified fees will have to be paid, and background checks will have to be performed. 

The measure to add a fee to existing background checks for gun purchases is nothing less than a new state-level tax on gun purchases. If this law passes, the fee could eventually be raised high enough to rule out buying a gun in the first place. 
The proposal to allow crime victims to sue gun manufacturers is very onerous for gun companies. Although it would ostensibly only apply to makers of “assault weapons” if implemented, Colorado state Sen. Greg Brophy (R) said it “is the equivalent of holding Coors, the distributor, and the 7-Eleven from which the 12-pack of beer was stolen responsible for the drunk-driving accident.”
Even if the law allowing Coloradans to sue gun manufacturers passes, it will be impossible to implement currently because a federal law bans lawsuits against gun manufacturers over the misuse of their products. 
The state’s Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, has yet to show his hand regarding where he stands on all these proposals. One thing that is known is that 56% of Coloradans say the NRA best represents their views on guns and gun rights.

Gun rights return to the Supreme Court this year, challenging a federal regulation that resulted in a police officer’s felony conviction when he purchased a firearm for his uncle. 
Bruce Abramski is a former police officer whose uncle wanted to buy a firearm. His uncle is a law-abiding person who can legally purchase, but since Abramski is a former policeman, there are gun shops where he can buy firearms at a discount. Thus, he decided to buy the gun for his uncle. 
Everyone who purchases a firearm at a federally-licensed firearm retail store is familiar with Form 4473. The form is created by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and, among other things, asks whether you are the actual purchaser of the firearm, versus purchasing for someone else. Form 4473 tells you that if you say you are not the actual buyer, you cannot purchase the gun.


Abramski and his uncle checked with several gun dealers, all of whom said the legal way to proceed was for Abramski to purchase in his home state of Virginia as the actual buyer, then go to his uncle’s home in Pennsylvania, where they could go to another federally-licensed firearm dealer to have his uncle fill out the same ATF paperwork and undergo the same background check, then have the firearm transferred to the uncle. 
Abramski did so. Then he was charged and convicted of a federal felony for making a false statement that is “intended or likely to deceive” a gun dealer “with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the [gun] sale.”
Federal appeals courts with jurisdiction over many of the states in America understand that this provision of federal law is designed only to prevent “straw man” sales, where a buyer obtains the firearm on behalf of a convicted felon, domestic batterer, mentally ill person, or some other sort of person prohibited from buying guns. It is to make sure someone doesn’t get a gun on behalf of someone else who would be refused the sale after they failed a federal background check. In the Supreme Court’s words from 1976, it is to “keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency.” It was not written to prevent a policeman from being a nephew who tried to save his law-abiding uncle some money. 

Nonetheless, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond (with jurisdiction over the Mid-Atlantic states) agreed with two other federal appeals courts in holding that when Abramski checked the box affirming he was the purchaser, he committed a serious federal crime. 
If Abramski purchased the gun on his own, then decided to give it to his uncle as a free gift, that would be legal. Or if Abramski bought it for himself, then the following week decided to sell it to his uncle, that would be legal. But because his uncle wrote him a check for the gun before Abramski went to the store to buy the gun, and thus was acting as his uncle’s agent to buy a gun, Abramski became a federal felon. 
Question 11a on Form 4473 is poorly worded. That wording was chosen by ATF, not Congress. If Question 11a instead asked if you are purchasing on behalf of someone who cannot legally purchase a firearm, then Abramski would honestly have said “no,” and there would not be any criminal conviction. 
On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court granted review in Abramski v. U.S. Arguments are likely around February, with a decision before July 2014.

On Monday, while the death toll mounted at the Navy Yard, President Barack Obama delivered a strident partisan tirade against Republicans, using the fifth anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse to score political points ahead of the debt ceiling debate. It was an appalling act of division and insensitivity, and unlike George W. Bush’s My Pet Goat moment on 9/11, it was a calculated abdication of leadership.
It was also an act that places Obama’s passivity during the Benghazi attacks–and his decision to fly to Las Vegas the next day for a campaign fundraiser–in perspective. This is a president who, even as Navy Seals approached Osama bin Laden’s hideout, retired to play cards with his pals. The image is of a man with little regard for the lives of Americans in “his” military, or their families, beyond their use as campaign props.


In addition, President Obama–like it or not–leads the entire nation, not just the majority that voted him into office. In moments of terror and tragedy, his job is to bring the American people together, not to split us apart. Conservatives have been willing–eager, even–to embrace Obama on such occasions, as many did after his speech at the memorial for the Tuscon victims in 2011. Yesterday, he foreclosed any such reconciliation. 
What we are seeing is partly the result of Obama’s political foundation as a community organizer–there is never a crisis to waste, so to speak, in stirring up your core supporters against their contrived opponents. But even Alinsky, who had enough sense to criticize those who called police “pigs,” would have counseled against Obama’s speech yesterday, which could not have brought more benefit than harm to his cause.
Yes, Obama did begin by acknowledging the Navy Yard attacks. That is, at least, an improvement from how he reacted to the Ford Hood shooting in 2009, which he only mentioned after several “shout-outs” to his supporters in the audience. 

Yet the speech itself should have been canceled, or postponed. The fact that the White House never even considered that option shows how out of touch Obama is with his basic duties.
A story comes to mind, told by a friend in Chicago who met Obama during his obscure State Senate years. Obama was at a local function for medical professionals, and my friend, having just met the Senator from Hyde Park, tried to introduce him to a friend from the same neighborhood. In the nervous rush of the moment, he forgot that friend’s name. “Well, I guess he isn’t your friend, is he,” Obama deadpanned.
Obama then presented his business card, said, “You’ll be hearing about me,” turned, and left, leaving the two men in shock at his rudeness. 
That’s the real Obama–the one slowly emerging in presidential biographies now that he is safely ensconced in a second term, the one who drops even the most loyal aides when he feels they are no longer of use to him, the man capable of relating to large crowds but not concrete human beings.
Speaker of the House John Boehner said that Obama’s speech was a “shame.” Charles Krauthammer said that it was in “extremely bad taste.” It was worse than that. It was an insult to the victims and their families, a slap in the face to the nation as a whole, a dereliction of the simplest duty of empathy and discretion. He may apologize–he ought to–but what Obama revealed about himself in that moment can never be undone.

In 2011, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law California Assembly Bill 109, a piece of legislation designed to relieve overcrowded prisons in accordance with a Supreme Court decision. AB 109 enshrined “realignment” into law – a plan to place supposedly “non-violent, non-serious, and non-sex offenders” in county jails rather than state prisons. In other words, local governments were handed the problem of prisoners the state didn’t want to hold. On January 8, 2013, Brown said, “we’ve gone from serious constitutional problems to one of the finest prison systems in the United States.”

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation calls the realignment plan “historic legislation that has helped enable California to close the revolving door of low-level inmates cycling in and out of state prisons.” But in reality, realignment has created a revolving door for criminals: they cycle in, they leave, and they harm innocent citizens across the state.

David Mulder, 43, was shot and killed by police on Sunday night after stabbing a woman to death in a car near the San Bernardino Freeway. He had been released from prison early under realignment in September. 

Last week, a felon with convictions for grand theft auto, drug possession, receiving stolen property, and robbery was arrested for an alleged rape in Fontana. The former inmate, Juan Francisco Aguilera, 30, had been turned over to county supervision.
In February, 34-year-old Raoul Leyva was convicted of attempted voluntary manslaughter after beating his girlfriend, 21-year-old Brandy Marie Arreola, nearly to death. She still sits in a wheelchair, and has brain damage. She spent three months in a coma. Leyva was released early under realignment. He had already spent time in the system for domestic violence and parole violation.

These are not isolated incidents. They are evidence of a broad trend. According to statistics provided to Breitbart News by the office of Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, 11,473 criminals have been sent to Los Angeles County jails rather than state penitentiaries since realignment kicked in. Over 43,000 inmates are doing their time in local jails rather than state pen. By 2014, that number will skyrocket to 54,000. Now here’s the kicker: under the Brown realignment plan, Los Angeles county misdemeanor offenders will serve approximately 10-15% of their sentences. Then they will be released. That number will drop as jails become more crowded.
More criminals, more crime. According to statistics from the Los Angeles County Sheriff and Probation Departments, burglaries have increased dramatically, from 175% in Hawaiian Gardens to 45% in South Los Angeles to 50% in Compton; auto theft is up 365% in Artesia, 100% in Marina Del Rey, and 92% in Bellflower. The Criminal Justice Legal Foundation reports that in the six-month period after realignment, California’s crime rates rose across the board, including a 7.6% jump in homicide. The recent Northridge boarding house murderer, who killed four people execution style, was out thanks to realignment. Tobias Dustin Summers, wanted for kidnapping a 10-year-old Southern California girl, was out due to realignment.
For his part, Jerry Brown maintains that we don’t need more prisons. “I don’t think that’s smart, and I don’t think the law requires it, and moreover, management of a prison is quintessentially an executive function,” he said in January. The proof is in our hands, and it is bloody.

While we pray for those murdered and everyone who might be in danger, we cannot forget that the media and its allies in the Democratic Party have set a standard when it comes to reporting on the possible political motives of mass murderers. Though they generally make things up to turn the death of innocents into a talking point against the Right, it is still the left who set this precedent.   
And what do you know, Chris Dorner, the former police officer suspected of being behind the murder rampage presently unfolding in Los Angeles, has apparently left behind a manifesto addressed to America that the media are already selectively reporting on to leave out the more inconvenient portions. You see, there is no political upside for the media to reveal the politics of this suspected madman. 


What is being reported as Mr. Dorner’s manifesto not only endorses Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 and vigorously defends Barack Obama and the Democrats’ current gun control push; he also savages the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre while expressing all kinds of love for some of the biggest stars in the left-wing media — by name. 
No Tea Partier is this suspected mass murderer, who just might be politically motivated:
Chris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Pat Harvey, Brian Williams, Soledad Obrien, Wolf Blitzer, Meredith Viera, Tavis Smiley, and Anderson Cooper, keep up the great work and follow Cronkite’s lead. I hold many of you in the same regard as Tom Brokaw and the late Peter Jennings. …

Willie Geist, you’re a talented and charismatic journalist.
Mr. Dorner also seems to have a soft spot for those the media tells us are “safe” Republicans to like, such as George H. W. Bush and Chris Christie, “the only person I would like to see in the White House in 2016 other than Hillary.”
When it comes to defending Obama, Dorner sounds like he’s been watching an awful lot of NBC News:
You disrespect the office of the POTUS/Presidency and Commander in Chief. You call him Kenyan, mongroid, halfrican, muslim, and FBHO when in essence you are to address him as simply, President. The same as you did to President George W. Bush and all those in the highest ranking position of our land before him. Just as I always have. You question his birth certificate, his educational and professional accomplishments, and his judeo-christian beliefs. You make disparaging remarks about his dead parents.
Mr. Dorner’s gun control views make it sound as though much of his thinking has been affected by CNN. In a paragraph that mentions Sandy Hook, Dorner writes:

If you had a well regulated AWB, this would not happen. The time is now to reinstitute a ban that will save lives. Why does any sportsman need a 30 round magazine for hunting? Why does anyone need a suppressor? Why does anyone need a AR15 rifle? This is the same small arms weapons system utilized in eradicating Al Qaeda, Taliban, and every enemy combatant since the Vietnam war. Don’t give me that crap that its not a select fire or full auto rifle like the DoD uses. That’s bullshit because troops who carry the M-4/M-16 weapon system for combat ops outside the wire rarely utilize the select fire function when in contact with enemy combatants.
Those sound just like Piers Morgan’s talking points, no? Well, surprise-surprise, Dornan agrees 100% with Morgan on gun control, though he does worry that Morgan is hurting the cause:
Mr. Morgan, the problem that many American gun owners have with you and your continuous discussion of gun control is that you are not an American citizen and have an accent that is distinct and clarifies that you are a foreigner. I want you to know that I agree with you 100% on enacting stricter firearm laws[.]
The manifesto is thousands of word long and mentions dozens of people and topics. But politically, the manifesto is pretty clear. 
Which is why the media will downplay it with the same amount of energy they put into amplifying their lies.

How big of a wake-up call are the Obama scandals, especially the ones surrounding the seizing of phone records from the Associated Press and the IRS’s targeting of conservatives? So big that two of the media’s most shameful and shameless gun control advocates — Joe Scarborough and Piers Morgan — have finally conceded that arguments made by pro-Second Amendment activists against the expanding of background checks might not be so ridiculous. 
In a roundtable discussion on Friday’s “Morning Joe,”  Scarborough said that because of the IRS scandal, “My argument is less persuasive today because of these scandals.” He added: “People say, ‘Hey, if they do this with the IRS, asking people what books you read, then how can I trust them with information about my Second Amendment rights?'”


Mika agreed completely: “That is a really, really good point.” Even the Huffington Post’s Sam Stein agreed. 
Andrew Johnson at NRO grabbed the video:
—

Scarborough added that, when it comes to both background checks and immigration reform, the IRS scandal is “devastating,” because both of those pieces of legislation ask us to trust the kind of government that would seize the media’s phone records and use the IRS to target a president’s political foes.
Also courtesy of NRO, here is no-less than Piers Morgan conceding he was wrong to ridicule gun-rights activists (including our own Ben Shapiro) for making the argument that a legitimate fear of government tyranny is what makes the Second Amendment so crucial:
—


—
Though I was appalled by the media’s relentless and shameless push last month to pass the Toomey-Manchin bill that would have tightened background checks, I did support its passage, and said so many times while criticizing the media for their disgusting behavior. But this chilling reminder of how corrupt the federal government is has changed my mind completely. 
Moreover, our government is not only corrupt, it is vigorously protected by a media that is just as corrupt (NEVER forget the media ignored, dismissed, and even defended the IRS targeting conservatives). The government and media can scream all they want that background checks won’t be used to create a backdoor registry…
But the government and media are liars.

Reading the Left’s fevered desires over at Slate isn’t anything new. 
Not even articles breathlessly titled and subtitled:


Go for the Throat! Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party.
Not even articles that read:
The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat. …

Obama’s only remaining option is to pulverize. Whether he succeeds in passing legislation or not, given his ambitions, his goal should be to delegitimize his opponents. Through a series of clarifying fights over controversial issues, he can force Republicans to either side with their coalition’s most extreme elements or cause a rift in the party that will leave it, at least temporarily, in disarray.
Slate is what it is and some bloodthirsty Slate writer orgasmic over the prospect of Obama permanently pulverizing and destroying the GOP is as noteworthy as green on grass.
Oh, except after someone like Brit Hume connects the dots. 
The author of this outrageous left-wing fever dream is John Dickerson, whom Slate describes as “Slate’s chief political correspondent”. What Slate leaves out of its little bio, though, is that Dickerson is also the political director at CBS News. 
Dickerson is merely being Dickerson, and  there’s no doubt he speaks for legions upon legions of those in the media today. 

What is worthy of note, though, is that a CBS News’ political director is now comfortable openly calling for the destruction of the Republican Party. He obviously fears no admonitions from his colleagues or his employer. And why should he? Earlier this week, Bob Schieffer, a CBS News “living legend,” was perfectly comfortable publicly comparing the NRA to Nazis. 
You lump all of this with CNN chief Jeff Zucker applauding Piers Morgan’s shameless feasting off the dead children of Sandy Hook for ratings and attention, and what you have is a media that’s finally … coming out. 
And yet, even as they do, even as they openly celebrate their left-wing biases out of one side of their mouth, out the other, they will claim they remain objective and unbiased. 
The Big Lie has officially arrived. 
And somewhere Dan Rather’s thinking, “Oh, so now it’s okay!?”

A week from today, voters in Colorado will be offered the opportunity to recall two state senators who voted for increased gun control in the wake of the shootings at Newtown. We hope that they will take it.
Ripe for the chopping block are Angela Giron, of Pueblo, and senate president John Morse, of Colorado Springs. Both ignored the will of their constituents and pushed for limits on the size of magazines and the extension of background checks to private sales. Now they may lose their jobs.


Because the United States is not a direct democracy, the dismissal of public officials outside the healthy rhythm of regularly scheduled elections is a tool that should be used sparingly. Nevertheless, there remain certain circumstances in which the offenses committed are sufficiently grievous to render such an approach appropriate, which goes some way to explaining why the citizens of Colorado have felt provoked to call for the first recall elections in the state’s 137-year history.

As in New York and Connecticut, lawmakers in Colorado were aware that gun-control efforts benefit immensely from the unlovely combination of legislative haste and emotional rawness — and they leveraged both. During debate, swathes of law-enforcement officers went to the capital to argue against the proposals; they were turned away at the door. Women, many of whom had been the victims of sexual violence, assembled to add their input; they were treated with condescension and impatience — if they were called to speak at all. Citizens who had driven down from other parts of the state were so frustrated at being kept out of committee meetings in Denver that they drove around the capitol building for eight hours honking their horns. This was not, to borrow a favored chant of the Left, what democracy looks like.

On Sean Hannity’s Fox News Channel program Tuesday night, while discussing same-sex marriage, Dr. Ben Carson made the point that if we change the definition of marriage for homosexuals, what’s to stop NAMBLA or those into bestiality from demanding the same. 
The media, which is always ready to destroy any black man who dares think for himself, uniformly pounced today. In response to the manufactured uproar, the soft-spoken Carson (who was a hero to the left until he came out as a conservative), did the interview rounds on cable Friday, including Andrea Mitchell’s show on MSNBC and Wolf Blitzer’s on CNN. 


In both appearances, Carson apologized for what he said and made clear that he wasn’t comparing gay couples to pedophiles or those erotically charged by animals. His point was that God defined what marriage is, not man, and if man changes that definition, it can lead to anything. 
Carson also said he was in favor of giving same-sex couples the same rights as married couples, short of marriage. 
NBC News obviously wants to destroy the threat of any independent-thinking black man as quickly as possible. So it should come as no surprise that, by the time Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart filled in for MSNBC’s Martin Bashir, Carson’s apology was treated as far from sufficient. In short, Capehart and his guests, Toure’ and Krystal Ball, treated the apology as a lie. 

This is all par for the course at NBC News. 
Sadly, so is the chryron pictured above — “Blinded by the White” —  which was used as the clip of Dr. Carson played during the segment.
NBC News is notorious for using this kind of race-baiting to further its left-wing agenda, including fraud:
During last year’s GOP primary, Ed Schultz edited video of Texas Governor Rick Perry to make him look racist. 
In April of last year, the “Today Show” was caught editing audio of a 9-1-1 call to make George Zimmerman look racist. 

In August of 2009, Contessa Brewer sliced and diced a photograph so it wouldn’t look like a black man attended a Tea Party carrying a firearm.   
So it was only a matter of time before they went after Carson in this way for his apostasy.

The mainstream media have awoken to the fact that President Barack Obama’s partisan attack on Republicans during the Navy Yard attack on Monday may not have been the best idea, even if only for tactical reasons. 
The New York Times‘ Maureen Dowd worried that Obama’s speech meant that he “cannot seem to connect anymore” and concluded that the president had been “overtaken by events.” The Hill called it a political “blunder” and agreed, via a quote from a “former aide,” that he had been “overtaken by events.” (Poor President Obama, always the victim of circumstances not of his own making, always “overtaken by events”!)


While it is encouraging that the media have noticed Obama’s attack–even though most networks cut away after he briefly mentioned the Navy Yard shooting–they continue to ignore three glaring problems:

1. The fact that Obama never considered canceling or postponing the speech. A president who does not realize that a mass shooting on a military base in the nation’s capital city is a reason to suspend politics as usual is dangerously removed from his duties as commander-in-chief–never mind the political damage. In addition, he is receiving bad advice, ignoring good advice, or simply not being advised by staff who have learned that he tunes out all but a select group of trusted Chicago insiders and loyalists. By putting politics first, the Obama administration is putting the nation at risk–at a time when risks are only growing.
2. The fact that the media pilloried Mitt Romney for lesser sins in 2012. When Mitt Romney issued a statement criticizing the Obama administration’s apologetic response to the Cairo embassy attack on Sep. 11 last year, the media attacked him viciously. Romney, too, was “overtaken by events”: he did not know that four Americans would be killed in Benghazi. But the media never let Romney forget his alleged gaffe, while giving Obama a pass for his inaction that night. Because the media never hold Obama accountable for anything, he rarely takes his governing responsibilities seriously, exacerbating a dangerous vacuum in national leadership.
3. The fact that the Navy Yard attack happened at all, four years after Ft. Hood. It is easier for the Obama-supporting media to dwell on an inappropriate speech than to ask the much more important question: how did the attack happen at all? Four years after a similar mass shooting at Fort Hood, was nothing done to improve security at military bases? Why were rules restricting guns on base not changed?  Did the Obama administration let the nation’s guard down by downplaying Ft. Hood as “workplace violence” instead of terrorism? Why, after the NSA scandal, was there no review of security clearance procedures and lists?

Today, former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), who was famously shot by mentally ill Jared Lee Loughner in Tucson, Arizona, testified before the Senate on gun control. While Giffords and her husband, former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, testified that they weren’t there as victims but as Americans, the reverse was clearly the case: as shooting victims, they have been trotted out by the left-leaning media to provide Cindy Sheehan-like “absolute moral authority.” The implication: disagree with the politics of these victims, and you don’t care enough about them.
The media coverage of Giffords’ testimony exploited Giffords’ victimhood to the hilt. But The Atlantic led the way with a picture of her “handwritten notes,” which The Atlantic labeled “pen-scrawled words … deliberate … diligent … written on a surface all too familiar to schoolchildren: binder paper.” And, The Atlantic added, “She is trapped in her injury. And few things make that point more powerfully than a piece of binder paper and a hand-scrawled message.”


The Atlantic got the photo from the Washington Post, which had put it up. Buzzfeed, too, put up the photo, quoting the Americans for Responsible Solutions Facebook page:

It will be hard. But the time is now. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you” – Like and share Gabby Giffords’ handwritten testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun violence. Join her and Mark Kelly by texting SOLUTIONS to 90975.
So did ThinkProgress. And Business Insider.
Except that Giffords didn’t scrawl that message. Her speech therapist did.
That doesn’t mean that Giffords doesn’t think the things that her therapist wrote. It does show, however, how far the media is willing to go in order to exploit shooting victims to further the gun control agenda. 
It is Giffords’ choice to be there. It is the Democrats’ and media’s and President Obama’s choice to exploit her presence. Then again, the left has never been shy about hiding behind victims to push their politics.

When NBC News granted Al Sharpton the honor of having a prime time news show on their cable outlet, MSNBC, they lauded his role as an “elder statesman” of the Democratic Party. They named the show “Politics Nation” and positioned the nightly broadcast as a left-leaning political show focusing on national politics as a natural lead-in to “Hardball.”  It was a well-orchestrated PR strategy to distance Sharpton from his controversial and odious past as a race-baiting advocate for proven liars Tawana Brawley and the antagonist in the Duke Lacrosse case. 
The message was clear: Sharpton isn’t the charlatan race-baiter you’ve grown to loathe; he’s now a power player in the Democratic Party and is here to bring his unique, seasoned perspective to the national political conversation. 
Oh what a difference a year makes. 


These days, Politics Nation has turned into the Trayvon Martin Show as Sharpton goes right back to his roots as a sensationalist willing to advocate for any victim of a crime as long as they are the right race and the alleged perpetrator is white (or “white hispanic” in this case). 

Friday night Sharpton had Trayvon Martin’s family attorney on to discuss the George Zimmerman trial scheduled to begin in 10 days. Understand that Martin’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, has no actual standing in this case as it is the state of Florida against Zimmerman in these criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, Sharpton allowed Crump to lay out the state’s case against Zimmerman with Sharpton cheering and participating in the multi-media opening and closing arguments. By the time the segment was done, Zimmerman was all but tried and convicted with the most inflammatory and defamatory language possible: 

Crump:  When you really think about it in the totality of circumstances, George Zimmerman as this neighborhood watch patrol volunteer going around the neighborhood with a gun on prescription medication is every parent’s worse nightmare, because God help you if he comes up to your teenage child and says ‘what are you doing around here’ and your teenager doesn’t answer the question right. Then you have a Trayvon Martin situation at your doorstep. And we can’t have that in a law-abiding society.

Hearing that un-refuted and damning narration, no jury in the world would move to acquit Zimmerman. And that’s the point. Sharpton is using his NBC News platform to set the Zimmerman case up as an open and shut case of 2nd degree murder, and if anything short of a conviction comes from the Florida jury, well, you know the reason why. 
At that point, if Zimmerman is acquitted, get ready for Politics Nation to then be used to advocate for social justice and political unrest until there is “justice for Trayvon.” 
NBC News might as well replace Sharpton’s microphone with a bullhorn now.

Sarah Palin called on President Barack Obama to “pay his respects” to slain American hero Chris Kyle with “some gesture of condolence” before she, along with her husband, Todd, attended Kyle’s public memorial and funeral service in Dallas, TX Monday at Cowboys Stadium. The Palins became good friends with Kyle in the past two years. 
Kyle, the former Navy SEAL and author of American Sniper, a New York Times bestseller, was murdered on February 2 at a Texas gun range, allegedly by a former Marine suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) whom Kyle was trying to help. 
In a Facebook note, Palin wrote she found it “sad to see that flags aren’t flying at half staff for this American hero” and hoped Obama “pays his respects in some gesture of condolence” for someone who “sacrificed so much to keep him and all of us safe.”


Obama has publicly acknowledged people like Sandra Fluke and famous rappers, but he is not attending Kyle’s funeral and did not issue a statement after Kyle’s death. 

“We may never know to what extent Chris kept us free or how many lives he saved by his brave actions in the line of fire. But his fellow warriors know how important he was. My son Track couldn’t meet Chris when Todd and I first met him because Track was deployed to Iraq,” Palin wrote. “Then when we got to know Chris even better, our son was deployed in Afghanistan. We’ve met a lot of people in recent years, and Track has been privileged to meet them as well. But he said about Chris, ‘Mom, he’s the ONE person in the entire world I would be star-struck to meet. He’s it.'”
Palin first met Kyle during the premiere of Stephen K. Bannon’s “The Undefeated” movie in Pella, Iowa in 2011. Kyle was in charge of security for that event.
After attending the funeral, Palin suggested ways to honor and remember Kyle and, in another Facebook posting, wrote:

It was a beautiful memorial service for Chris Kyle at Cowboys Stadium this afternoon. What a celebration of a great life! All in all, is there a finer human being who has crossed the 50-yard line star in Texas than Chris Kyle? Please click on the following link for information on how we can help out the families of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. As patriotic Americans, this is a tangible way to show appreciation and support for good people. On a personal note, I thank you who’ve sent birthday greetings today, and it would be awesome if you’d join me in supporting the families of these heroes by helping them out!

The Palins got to know Kyle better when Todd Palin was on the show “Stars Earn Stripes” with Kyle. The Palins, along with the rest of the cast, spent a lot of time on set with Kyle’s family. Kyle was the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. 
“God bless this great warrior,” Palin said. “Let us keep his wife and children in our prayers, and may we never forget him or his sacrifice.”

While the left is frequently up in arms about the about the Koch brother’s money funding political and campaign projects,  there is no shortage of big leftist corporate and foundation money floating around hot political issues. 
Both the Joyce Foundation and Google are established players in the anti-second amendment movement as well as other progressive political causes.


The Joyce Foundation has injected large chucks of money into the anti-gun movement, including Mayor’s Against Gun Control and the Violence Prevention Center.   (Aside: Who was on the Board of the Joyce Foundation? None other than President Barack Obama who keeps assuring us that he doesn’t want to take our guns away. Obama sat on the board of the Joyce Foundation from 1994-2002.)

Likewise, Google’s support for anti-gun “advocacy” is no secret. 
Specifically, they’ve banned results related to firearms and other products that they don’t deem to be “family safe.” Until recently, gun-related products appeared with other products in search results on the shopping section. Many of America’s 80 million gun owners have used Google as a powerful price-comparison tool. Not anymore.
And the connections go further, Ben Howe writes: 
We know that Obama campaign manager Jim Messina received personal mentoring on both technology approaches and management style from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, his friend since the 2008 campaign.  We know that Google employees overwhelmingly contributed to Democrats in the last cycle (and aggregate individual employee contributions outnumbered the company’s PAC contributions). We know that Google vice president and “chief Internet evangelist” Vint Cerf received a presidential appointment to the National Science Board following last year’s election.
The left wing Joyce Foundation just funded a digital advocacy study co-authored by Organizing for Action’s (formerly Obama for America) Michael Slaby, who used to work for Google’s Eric Schmidt. 
As we continue hear wailing and lamenting about “big money” in politics and the need for campaign finance reform, let’s keep in mind the left is as big a benefactor if not bigger of “big money” as the right.

Larimer County, Colorado Sheriff Justin Smith is one of nearly 30 Sheriffs who have signed their names on the dotted line of a lawsuit to overturn the latest slew of gun control laws passed by the Colorado legislature and signed by Governor John Hickenlooper (D).
The suit in which Smith is taking part specifically targets the laws that emerged from HB 1224 and HB 1229.
HB 1224 bans rifle and pistol magazines holding more than 15 rounds that “were acquired after July 1, 2013.” At the same time, it also bans many other magazines by prohibiting smaller magazines “designed to be readily converted.”


When Breitbart News spoke to Sheriff Smith on July 22, he explained:


The problem with this is that those who wrote the law don’t understand firearms or magazines. And many of the most popular firearms have magazines with removal floorplates — for instance, a Glock magazine. This law will effectively ban certain magazines even if they’re under the capacity limit, based solely on the fact that they are expandable or simply give the appearance of expandability. 

HB 1229 put background checks in place for every sale in the state–in store sales, online sales, private sales, and of course, sales at gun shows. Additionally, after forcing every sale to go through a Federal Firearms License (FFL), this law also adds a $10 fee for every background check.
Smith explained to Breitbart News that another asinine aspect of HB 1229 is that it incorporates a 72 hour rule; the law is written so that any time your gun is out of your possession for more than 72 hours you will have to do a background check before getting it back (which also means you will have to pay a $10 fee).

They’ve written the law in a way that the difference between legality and illegality are undefined. They simply stress that the gun has to be in your possession at all times. They’ve tried to clarify this to mean under or within your domain.
But let’s say you’re a Colorado resident in legal possession of gun you owned prior the the July 1, 2013 deadline. You have an automobile accident and while the ambulance takes you to the hospital, police find the gun in your vehicle. They hold the gun for you but you’re in the hospital longer than 72 hours. 
When you finally recover and leave the hospital you ask the police for your gun and they say you have to do a background check to get your own gun back because it’s been longer than 72 hours. Moreover, you have a 17 round magazine in that gun and those are now banned, and because it was out of your possession for longer than 72 hours you’ve forfeited it.  
This is a mess. 

The suit filed by Smith and his fellow Sheriffs is joined by numerous Colorado businesses and individual Colorado citizens. Said Smith: “We are a cantankerous bunch and this is our Alamo.”

President Barack Obama and outgoing New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg have both tried to nudge their way into America’s Thanksgiving (or Thanksgivukkah) dinners, with talking points about Obamacare and gun control, respectively. Not only is introducing contentious political issues into a family holiday a recipe for unhappiness, but it also reflects the disturbing Orwellian ambitions of Obama’s big-government liberalism.
The idea that politics must be brought into every family discussion and every personal relationship has been a hallmark of Obama’s style since the 2008 campaign, when he told his supporters to confront their neighbors, to get “in their face.” During the debate over Obamacare in 2009-10, the White House did the same–and provided an email address, flag@whitehouse.gov, to which people could report “lies” among their friends.


One of those “lies” was that people could lose their insurance coverage due to the new law–a “lie” that has since proven true for millions of Americans. Clearly, Obama’s talking points have a short shelf life. Yet he remains undeterred, as are many of his followers, in imposing politics on intimacy. In 2009, supporters of Obamacare even encouraged each other to withhold sex from partners who did not support passage of the troubled law.

The great insight of George Orwell’s novel of totalitarianism, Nineteen Eighty-Four, was not that it exposed the brainwashing necessary for that system to function. That had been done already in Arthur Koestler’s Darkness at Noon, a chilling insight into the way that communism convinced its victims to confess to crimes they had not committed, to embrace and even look forward to their deaths as a form of love for the party’s ideals.
Orwell extended Koestler’s theme in Nineteen Eighty-Four with the invention of the propaganda language “Newspeak,” and the torture scenes in Room 101. Yet his unique contribution was to show that totalitarianism was not just focused on repressing the individual, but on interfering with the most intimate relationships between people. It is necessary, Orwell explained, to destroy such intimacy in order for Big Brother to rule.
That is the Orwellian world of nanny-state liberals like Obama and Bloomberg–the latter even using children’s placemats to sell his anti-gun ideology. It is worth remembering that Thanksgiving was founded as a celebration of freedom by those who had escaped government repression. They recognized that the bounty of the New World went hand-in-hand with faith and liberty–something our present would-be masters have forgotten.

Recently uncovered government documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) unmanned Predator B drone fleet has been custom designed to identify civilians carrying guns and track cell phone signals.
“I am very concerned that this technology will be used against law-abiding American firearms owners,” said founder and executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation, Alan Gottlieb. “This could violate Fourth Amendment rights as well as Second Amendment rights.”

The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) obtained a partially redacted copy of Homeland Security’s drone requirements through a Freedom of Information Act request; CNET uncovered an unredacted copy.


Homeland Security design requirements specify that its Predator B drones “shall be capable of identifying a standing human being at night as likely armed or not” and must be equipped with “interception” systems capable of reading cell phone signals.
The first known domestic use of a drone to arrest a U.S. citizen occurred last year in the small town of Lakota, North Dakota when rancher Rodney Brossart was arrested for refusing to return six of his neighbor’s cows that had wandered on to his property. Critics say the fact that domestic drones are being used in such minor matters raises serious concerns about civil liberties and government overreach.
“That drone is not just picking up information on what’s happening at that specific scene, it’s picking up everything else that’s going on,” says drone expert and Brookings Institution senior fellow Peter Singer. “Basically it’s recording footage from a lot of different people that it didn’t have their approval to record footage.” 

Others, like progressive author Naomi Wolf, have warned that domestic drones may soon be weaponized. The military version of the Predator B drone carries 100-pound Hellfire missiles, but the Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) says the 10 drones in its domestic fleet are unarmed.
Last month, NBC News uncovered a confidential 16-page Justice Department memo that concluded the U.S. government may execute a drone strike on an American citizen it believes to be a “senior operational leader” of al-Qaeda or “an associated force.” 
The Obama Administration defended the use of drones to kill Americans thought to be working with terrorists.  “These strikes are legal, they are ethical, and they are wise,” said White House press secretary Jay Carney.

On Friday the North Dakota state House passed the first personhood amendment in the United States, marking the first time in U.S. history that a legislative body has approved a personhood amendment in both the House and the Senate. The historic vote, 57-35, allows the amendment to be referred to North Dakota citizens for a vote.
According to SCR 4009, “the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.”  
Heraldonline.com reports that the amendment was written to ensure that both mother and baby are treated as medical patients, that medical care is not inhibited, and that fertility treatments are not banned. 


LifeSiteNews.com reports that every major pro-life organization in North Dakota has supported SCR 4009. 
“The North Dakota legislature has taken historic strides to protect every human being in the state, paving the way for human rights nationwide,” said Keith Mason, president of Personhood USA. 
Mason added: 


This amendment strikes the balance of accomplishing more for the unborn than any other amendment the nation has ever seen, while protecting pregnant women and their right to true medical care. We applaud the North Dakota House and Senate for their willingness to protect all of the people in their state. 

“The North Dakota personhood amendment takes the pro-life plank of the GOP platform and puts it into practice,” said Gualberto Garcia Jones, J.D., legal analyst for Personhood USA. “Furthermore, it allows the legislature the needed flexibility to implement the specific protections of the right to life through future legislation.” 
The state House also passed two other pro-life bills, one that demands that abortion doctors have admitting privileges to hospitals (SB 2305), and another that places a ban on abortions past 20 weeks and also bans taxpayer funding from going to organizations that provide abortions (SB 2368).  
Last week, the state legislature also passed a “heartbeat bill,” which could ban abortions as early as six weeks, and a ban on abortions for genetic conditions such as Down’s Syndrome. 
The bills will now go to Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) for his signature. Paul Maloney, executive director of North Dakota Right to Life told LifeSiteNews.com that his group has “always had faith” in Dalrymple and expects him to sign the bills. 
“I’m extremely proud of my state for the statement that they’ve made to the country,” Maloney said. “I guess it’s in the hands of the courts.” Maloney’s statement referenced the reality that the bills will almost certainly be subject to legal challenges. 
“We applaud North Dakota for defending life,” said Concerned Women for America CEO and President Penny Nance. “The bills in North Dakota protect the lives of the most innocent Americans, those without a voice, in the womb.” 
Nance added, “Hopefully these bills will start a national discussion about what life is and our duty as a civil society to protect it. It starts in the states.”

Millions of Americans should learn in three weeks whether the U.S. Supreme Court will take a case challenging Obamacare’s HHS Mandate for violating religious liberty. 
The media has been covering Korte v. HHS, where on Nov. 8 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit struck down Kathleen Sebelius’ regulation that implements a provision of the Affordable Care Act by requiring employers to provide abortion and contraception in their healthcare plans. 
The only religious exemption is for churches and other purely-religious employers. But countless secular and for-profit businesses are wholly owned by people of faith, who treat how they run their business as part of how they practice their religious faith, and object to providing products or services they regard as immoral or sinful. 


Five federal appellate courts have ruled on the issue thus far. Three have sided with religious business owners, and two have sided with the Obama administration. 

On Sept. 18, Breibart News broke the news that the first of these cases has been offered to the Supreme Court when lawyers from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) filed a petition with the justices in Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius. Later that same day, the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to review the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, which ruled in favor of the Green family in Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius. 
Two other federal appeals courts have weighed in on the issue. On Nov. 1, the D.C. Circuit sided with religious business owners in Gilardi v. HHS in a well-written opinion by Judge Janice Rogers Brown. And on Sept. 17, the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit supported President Obama and Secretary Sebelius. 
Judge Diane Sykes’ excellent opinion for the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit in Korte has deepened this national split in the federal courts. But despite the significant media attention that decision is getting, last week’s opinion is probably the end of the line for Korte. 
This is because the Supreme Court has now scheduled the petitions from Hobby Lobby and Conestoga for the justices’ closed-door conference on Nov. 26. The results of that conference could be released that afternoon or, more likely, will be announced when the Court holds its next session on Dec. 2.  
It is virtually certain the Supreme Court will take one or both cases. If review is granted, arguments will be in March or April, with a final decision on this issue before July 2014.

After the Supreme Court’s decision labeling Obamacare’s mandate a tax, the IRS has become the crucial centerpiece of President Obama’s health care rollout. But with the IRS’ targeting of conservative non-profits, Republicans are calling into question the agency’s involvement in the application of Obamacare.
On May 23, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) specifically targeted IRS involvement in Obamacare as a rationale for fighting the program:



And here’s another thing we shouldn’t be doing: handing over the administration of Obamacare to these folks. I mean, think about it. A deeply unpopular law being administered by an agency that’s so betrayed the public trust. Even the IRS’ staunchest defenders in this scandal describe their actions as a case of ‘horrible customer service.’ That’s the best they can say: ‘Horrible customer service.’ And now they’re going to be put in charge of a new trillion-dollar program? One that will give them access to all sorts of sensitive, deeply personal information? Well, that’s just what the Administration and congressional Democrats are about to let happen.

McConnell specifically pointed out that the IRS official charged with managing Obamacare was the “very same person who led the division of the IRS now embroiled in scandal – who oversaw the very office now under fire for the discriminatory and harassing behavior.”


McConnell is hardly the only Senator pointing out the nefarious connection between the IRS and Obamacare. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) told Breitbart News, “The president’s entire agenda is based on giving more and more power to the same executive branch agencies that have recently demonstrated themselves to either be criminally incompetent or tyrannically corrupt. Obamacare? Expanded gun background checks? Comprehensive immigration reform? They’re all based on competent collection and ethical use of personal information coerced from the American people by the federal bureaucracy.”
Catherine Frazier, press secretary for Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), agreed: “Everyone should be taken out of the Obamacare business because Obamacare needs to be repealed. The IRS is the very last agency that should be administering any of our laws. Americans have no reason to trust an administration that would engage in, then lie about its partisan, political targeting of Americans based on their personal beliefs.”
“The IRS has acted in this bigoted and un-American a fashion when it was just administering the tax code,” said Ben Sasse, President of Midland University in Nebraska and a person widely perceived to be a possible Senate candidate. “Imagine the range of discrimination possible when it becomes the most important regulatory agency for healthcare, the largest sector of the US economy. Which health offenses become crimes? If a citizen prefers a high-deductible plan, and the bureaucrats object – or if an employer makes paperwork errors – what happens? We are crossing a big threshold here. All defenders of freedom should be in favor of a bright line that prohibits the criminalization of anything related to the purchase of health insurance. The IRS needs to be fixed, not expanded.”
In the House, the opposition is no less pointed. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said to Breitbart News, “The IRS’s future role in ObamaCare is just one of many reasons why this law must be fully repealed. After their outrageous actions and the lack of any accountability – why should any American trust them to involved in their healthcare.”
With a new Gallup poll showing that a full 58 percent of Americans disapprove of the Obama administration’s handling of the IRS scandal, and that 77 percent of Americans think the IRS scandal is either very or somewhat serious, it’s clear that the pushback against Obamacare will center on IRS involvement. And that, in turn, will force President Obama to defend the embattled agency in order to save his flagship program.

Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart spent last week mocking the GOP for opposing Obamacare, ignoring legitimate concerns Republicans raised about both the health care legislation itself and its bungled launch.
Turns out the funny man did hear the GOP’s complaints.
Stewart interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday’s edition of The Daily Show, and he proceeded to both mock and shred her attempt to talk up Obamacare. One almost could feel sorry for an Obama administration official forced to defend the president’s signature train wreck.


Stewart kept his clown nose on for the start of their chat to highlight Obamacare’s deeply flawed web component.


We’re going to do a challenge,” Stewart said at the start of the interview. “I’m going to try and download every movie ever made, and you are going to try to sign up for Obamacare — and we’ll see which happens first.

Ouch. It was almost as if Jay Leno were sitting in Stewart’s chair for a moment.
Stewart wasn’t finished.

If I’m an individual that doesn’t want [Obamacare], it would be hard for me to look at a big business getting a waiver and not having to do it and me having to,” Stewart said. “Because I would feel like … like you are favoring big business because they lobbied you this year, but you’re not allowing individuals that same courtesy.”
Sebelius ducked the question and repeated her talking points. She did that a few more times on his follow-ups, prompting Stewart to say, “Am I a stupid man?

No, just a comedian who too often defends the president for partisan reasons and mocks the one cable news station–Fox News–which holds Obama’s feet to the fire on the latest headlines.
Sadly, many young Americans say they get their “news” from Stewart’s Daily Show. If true, Millennials got a dose of stone cold reality last night.

In a move sure to spark consternation inside the White House, Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA) sent a letter Tuesday to embattled Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius requesting she produce a list of the one-on-one meetings she and President Barack Obama allege to have held in the over three-and-a-half years leading up to Obamacare’s calamitous rollout–meetings that do not appear on the White House’s own official calendar. 
“I have been greatly concerned over the lack of transparency and disregard for straight answers,” says Gingrey in his letter to Sebelius. “The Government Accountability Institute reported this month that according to the White House calendar, you have only met with the President once at the White House since becoming Secretary. Yet the White House has disputed the account and claims that you have been briefing the President regularly.” 


Last week during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, Gingrey, a medical doctor, asked a flustered Sebelius how many one-on-one meetings she had with Obama. “A lot,” replied Sebelius. Gingrey then asked whether she could verify her statement. “I, I…,” Sebelius uttered while flailing her hands. The committee chair then announced that Gingrey’s time for questioning had expired. 
Gingrey says in his letter that the American people deserve to know “how the rollout of the healthcare law has been botched so badly, who in the administration knew what, and when officials received warnings of problems.”
Gingrey’s request to Sebelius comes on the heels of an explosive report and Politico Magazine article by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) that found the official White House calendar and the Politico presidential calendar do not record a single one-on-one meeting between the HHS chief and Obama since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010. Only once does Sebelius’s name appear–in a meeting that also included then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. Curiously, those same calendars record 277 private meetings between Obama and other Cabinet secretaries. 

Specifically, Gingrey says he wants Sebelius to answer the following questions: 

How many times have you met in-person with the president since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)?
How many meetings did you have with White House staffers to discuss ACA?
Were issues regarding implementation deadlines discussed? If so, what directions were given?
How many meetings did you have with White House, CMS, and other agency personnel to discuss ACA implementation?
When it became clear that the ACA would not be ready by October 1, who in the White House was briefed? When was he or she briefed? What were they told?
Specifically, did you meet with the president after you received the McKinsey briefing? If yes, did you inform him of the grave warnings outlined? If no, why not?  

Gingrey’s last question refers to a critical April 4, 2013 meeting wherein McKinsey & Co. consultants presented a 15-slide presentation to Sebelius and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner. The presentation cautioned that the ideal situation for the Obamacare website would include “end-to-end integrated operations and IT testing” and warned that there was “insufficient time and scope of end-to-end testing.” 
The Georgia congressman’s letter to Sebelius places the already beleaguered Obama Administration in a difficult and dangerous political quandary that could further erode the president’s already sinking trustworthiness and approval ratings. 
During his roundly-criticized November 14 press conference, Obama promised the American people that he was unaware of the HealthCare.gov problems until after the website was launched on October 1. But as GAI President Peter Schweizer pointed out in a Politico Magazine article, “If Obama and Sebelius worked together closely and regularly, why did the president publicly state he did not know about the problems with HealthCare.gov?” 
That unanswered question threatens to further unravel Obama’s tenuous standing with Independent voters who tend to base political preferences more on executive performance and leadership traits and less on ideological positions. 
Former counselor to four presidents from both parties David Gergen said on CNN that the GAI report and the White House’s refusal to turn over the dates of the alleged one-on-one meetings between Sebelius and Obama suggests that “there was no one in charge in the administration.”

Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) has officially left the House version of the “Gang of Eight” after Democrats–led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a House aide familiar with the discussions told Breitbart News–went back on a prior agreement-in-principle during the talks.
Originally, according to Labrador, the House group had agreed hat illegal immigrants would be required to cover their own health care costs and not have access to Obamacare. When the talks moved along, though, the Democrats went back on their promise and began insisting that illegal immigrants get access to government healthcare. 


That prompted Labrador to abandon the group on Wednesday evening, as the left was not negotiating in good faith, he said. A House aide confirmed to Breitbart News that Pelosi–who was not a member of the House immigration group–was the leader of the charge in pushing health care for illegal immigrants, even though the Democrats in the group had originally agreed to the compromise.

“I have tremendous respect for the members of the bipartisan group who have been working with me to fix our broken immigration system,” Labrador said in a statement. “But after today’s meeting, the framework of the bill has changed in a way that I can no longer support. Like most Americans, I believe that health care is first and foremost a personal responsibility. While I will no longer be part of the bipartisan ‘Group of Eight’ House negotiators, I will not abandon my efforts to modernize our broken immigration system by securing our borders and creating a workable guest worker program. I remain hopeful that the House can pass a bill around these principles and I will keep fighting to make it happen.”
Pelosi’s office has not returned a request for comment from Breitbart News for this story. 
Labrador had been working with Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), John Carter (R-TX), Sam Johnson (R-TX), Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), Xavier Becerra (D-CA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and John Yarmuth (D-KY). 
Labrador’s move comes on the heels of a report from Breitbart News that a high-ranking Senate aide said Rubio is searching for a way out of the Senate Gang of Eight.
“Rubio and his staff are trying to get out of the Gang of Eight,” the aide said. “They’re looking to use other Republican members as their parachute to get out.”

After the Supreme Court’s decision labeling Obamacare’s mandate a tax, the IRS has become the crucial centerpiece of President Obama’s health care rollout. But with the IRS’ targeting of conservative non-profits, Republicans are calling into question the agency’s involvement in the application of Obamacare.
On May 23, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) specifically targeted IRS involvement in Obamacare as a rationale for fighting the program:



And here’s another thing we shouldn’t be doing: handing over the administration of Obamacare to these folks. I mean, think about it. A deeply unpopular law being administered by an agency that’s so betrayed the public trust. Even the IRS’ staunchest defenders in this scandal describe their actions as a case of ‘horrible customer service.’ That’s the best they can say: ‘Horrible customer service.’ And now they’re going to be put in charge of a new trillion-dollar program? One that will give them access to all sorts of sensitive, deeply personal information? Well, that’s just what the Administration and congressional Democrats are about to let happen.

McConnell specifically pointed out that the IRS official charged with managing Obamacare was the “very same person who led the division of the IRS now embroiled in scandal – who oversaw the very office now under fire for the discriminatory and harassing behavior.”


McConnell is hardly the only Senator pointing out the nefarious connection between the IRS and Obamacare. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) told Breitbart News, “The president’s entire agenda is based on giving more and more power to the same executive branch agencies that have recently demonstrated themselves to either be criminally incompetent or tyrannically corrupt. Obamacare? Expanded gun background checks? Comprehensive immigration reform? They’re all based on competent collection and ethical use of personal information coerced from the American people by the federal bureaucracy.”
Catherine Frazier, press secretary for Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), agreed: “Everyone should be taken out of the Obamacare business because Obamacare needs to be repealed. The IRS is the very last agency that should be administering any of our laws. Americans have no reason to trust an administration that would engage in, then lie about its partisan, political targeting of Americans based on their personal beliefs.”
“The IRS has acted in this bigoted and un-American a fashion when it was just administering the tax code,” said Ben Sasse, President of Midland University in Nebraska and a person widely perceived to be a possible Senate candidate. “Imagine the range of discrimination possible when it becomes the most important regulatory agency for healthcare, the largest sector of the US economy. Which health offenses become crimes? If a citizen prefers a high-deductible plan, and the bureaucrats object – or if an employer makes paperwork errors – what happens? We are crossing a big threshold here. All defenders of freedom should be in favor of a bright line that prohibits the criminalization of anything related to the purchase of health insurance. The IRS needs to be fixed, not expanded.”
In the House, the opposition is no less pointed. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said to Breitbart News, “The IRS’s future role in ObamaCare is just one of many reasons why this law must be fully repealed. After their outrageous actions and the lack of any accountability – why should any American trust them to involved in their healthcare.”
With a new Gallup poll showing that a full 58 percent of Americans disapprove of the Obama administration’s handling of the IRS scandal, and that 77 percent of Americans think the IRS scandal is either very or somewhat serious, it’s clear that the pushback against Obamacare will center on IRS involvement. And that, in turn, will force President Obama to defend the embattled agency in order to save his flagship program.

On Friday a federal appeals court struck down ObamaCare’s HHS contraception mandate, deciding that the requirement is an infringement upon religious liberty.
According to The Hill, the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in favor of two Catholic brothers, Francis and Philip Gilardi, who own a 400-person produce company based in Ohio. The Gilardis argued that they oppose contraception due to the tenets of their Catholic faith, and challenged ObamaCare’s provision that requires them to provide free contraception to their employees through a health insurance plan. 
The brothers claimed that if they chose not to obey the law, they would incur a $14 million fine. 


A requirement that companies cover their employees’ contraception, the court ruled, is unduly burdensome for business owners who oppose birth control on religious grounds, though they may not be purchasing contraception directly. 

The Obama administration argued that the requirement is necessary to protect women’s right to decide whether and when to have children. It is expected the Supreme Court will ultimately pick up the administration’s appeal and make a final decision on its constitutionality. 
“The burden on religious exercise does not occur at the point of contraceptive purchase; instead, it occurs when a company’s owners fill the basket of goods and services that constitute a healthcare plan,” wrote Judge Janice Rogers Brown on behalf of the court. “It is clear the government has failed to demonstrate how such a right – whether described as noninterference, privacy, or autonomy – can extend to the compelled subsidization of a woman’s procreative practices.” 
Brown added that denying coverage of contraception would not undermine the Affordable Care Act’s requirements that health insurance provide preventative care. The Gilardis’ employees will still be covered for counseling, screenings, and tests, the judge observed. 
“The provision of these services — even without the contraceptive mandate — by and large fulfills the statutory command for insurers to provide gender-specific preventive care,” Brown wrote. “At the very least, the statutory scheme will not go to pieces.”   
The two judges on the panel who dissented said the rights of religious people do not extend to the companies they own.

Embattled Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius appeared flustered during Wednesday testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee as she struggled to answer questions about an explosive Politico Magazine report written by Government Accountability Institute President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer. 
The report revealed the White House calendar records a single one-on-one meeting between her and President Barack Obama in over three-and-a-half years.
“How many times did you actually visit with the President since 2009 or 2010 when you came on board?” asked Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is also a medical doctor. “How many personal visits did you have with him at the White House regarding the Affordable Care Act?”


“A lot,” said Sebelius.
“Can you verify that?” asked Gingrey.
The chair then said, “The Gentleman’s time has expired.” 

“I, I…,” a flustered Sebelius said while raising her hands in the air. 

The GAI’s report and Schweizer’s Politico Magazine op-ed revealed the White House’s official calendar and the Politico presidential calendar list just a single meeting between Obama and Sebelius from July 12, 2010 to November 30, 2013. On Friday, HHS spokesperson Joanne Peters released a statement claiming that Sebelius and Obama held “countless” one-on-one meetings together and that “dozens” of those private meetings were held in the last year alone. 
Similarly, when asked by NBC News reporter Peter Alexander and ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl about the GAI’s explosive report, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney claimed Sebelius has one-on-one meetings with Obama “frequently” and that “it’s safe to say that Kathleen Sebelius has been one of the more frequent visitors to and attendants to meetings with the president. 
However, Carney admitted to Jonathan Karl that he had no numbers, figures, or dates of meetings but said, “I think on this case, they’ll [HHS] have information for you.” But today during her testimony, Sebelius could only answer, “A lot,” when questioned how many times she had met with the president. And HHS spokesperson Joanne Peters has yet to release the “countless” and “dozens” of dates she claims Obama and Sebelius met one-on-one over the last three-and-a-half years leading up to the Obamacare rollout. 

Analysts say the GAI report hits at the core question of presidential leadership and executive management, traits that when damaged can do significant damage to a president’s popularity, especially among Independent voters. Former White House adviser to four presidents of both parties, David Gergen, said on CNN that the GAI’s report demonstrated “malfeasance” by the Obama White House. “The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one, I think, frankly, is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation,” said Gergen. “At the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.” 
Other GOP committee members expressed frustration with Sebelius for what they considered evasive and misleading answers. 
“We just don’t get the truth out of you!” Rep. John Shimkus (R-IL) said to Sebelius. “It’s like talking to the Republic of Korea.” 
Democrats on the committee like Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) laughed off Republican criticisms of Obamacare and said GOP concerns over millions of American families receiving insurance cancellations proves Republicans are “living on Mars.” Pallone added: “The reality is the Affordable Care Act is working…I’m proud of this law.” 
“Republicans are afraid this law is going to be popular,” said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA).
Obama claims he was never notified of problems with healthcare.gov prior to the website’s disastrous October 1 launch. 
The White House and HHS have yet to release the dated list of one-on-one meetings each claims occurred between Obama and Sebelius.

3850	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/17/D-C-Insurance-Commissioner-Fired-Day-After-Criticizing-Obamacare-Fix	News	1	Democrat Scandals	Healthcare	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Washington, D.C.’s insurance commissioner was fired a day after he criticized President Barack Obama’s “administrative fix” for Obamacare. 
William P. White, the D.C. insurance commissioner, told the Washington Post that D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray’s top deputies said Gray “wants to go in a different direction” after White was one of the first commissioners to push back against Obama’s “fix.”
Though White said he was not told that he was specifically fired for his criticism, he “said the timing was hard to ignore.” He said that 24 hours after his criticism, he was ‘basically being told, ‘Thanks, but no thanks.'”


Obama, in a Thursday White House press conference, announced an administrative fix that would allow insurance companies to extend plans that they have cancelled for another year. After that press conference, White, according to the Post, said Obama’s “action today undercuts the purpose of the exchanges, including the District’s DC Health Link, by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate.”

He also said that he concurred with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’s assessment that Obama’s administrative fix “threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”
According to the Post, “White’s statement was removed from the department’s Web site sometime before Friday morning.”
White was “Gray’s commissioner for the D.C. Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking since February 2011.” D.C. officials said he was removed because any criticism of Obama’s administrative fix needed to be vetted more thoroughly, and White failed acknowledge the misstep of not sending his statement criticizing Obama higher up the chain of command before releasing it. 
After Obama falsely promised Americans that they could keep their insurance plans under Obamacare, he has scrambled after millions received cancellation notices, and he eventually announced on Thursday his administration will allow insurance companies to let those whose insurance plans were cancelled to re-apply and keep their plans for another year. 
Whether insurance companies will be allowed to do so, though, will ultimately rest with the insurance commissioners of the states. And others, like Washington state’s insurance commissioner, have already rejected Obama’s “administrative fix,” vowing to “stay the course” with Obamacare. 
As the Post noted, Obama’s plan “rattled the insurance industry, which had set prices for next year based on many of its products changing to comply with the health-care law,” because “allowing some plans to continue beyond Jan. 1 could also run afoul of provisions in laws passed by dozens of states and the District to implement” Obamacare.

Our Johnny-on-the-spot media elite are all over the devilish details of ObamaCare this week. The three-year anniversary of the signing of the bloated government grab is tomorrow, and what better time to point out its massive failures and punitive complications than after it is too late to do anything about it? 
In the media’s defense, some of the failures being reported on now weren’t apparent in 2009 and 2010, but that’s not my complaint. My complaint — and what should be America’s complaint — is where was this kind of scrutiny and reporting when this terrible bill was being gamed through the all-Democrat federal government? 
As we all know, skeptical, forward-looking media analysis of ObamaCare was pretty much non-existent back then. We also know that those who did read the bill and report on its real and potential horrors (through New Media and in Townhall meetings) were demonized by the media. 


Rather than report on the devilish details or laugh Democrats out of office for submitting fraudulent ObamaCare budgets to the CBO so the monstrosity could be called “deficit neutral,” the media instead played State Pipe Organ and focused on all the “goodies.” 
In the meantime, out here in the real world and contrary to all those cotton candy promises the media assured us would come true, insurers facing all kinds of restrictions and a glut of sick people have boosted our health care premiums, and companies everywhere are cutting back employee work hours to avoid being forced to provide insurance. Moreover, contrary to Obama’s biggest promise, people are losing their insurance because companies would prefer to pay the fine than for the Cadillac plans ObamaCare demands. 
And how can one even begin to count the number of individual ObamaCare horror stories that dribble out almost daily, not from the ObamaMedia, naturally — but from conservative media sites like Drudge? We’re about to face a terrifying shortage of physicians and heaven only knows what this means.  

But if you believe in the philosophy of better-late-than-never, Politico actually summoned a little moral courage Friday morning. One of its morning leads takes a fairly in-depth look at how the bill remains unpopular and the massive uphill battle the government faces (money and tech) to get the ObamaCare pieces in place by October, when people are supposed to start signing up. (ObamaCare’s insurance exchanges and most punishing mandates hit early next year.)
Here’s Wednesday’s Wonk Blog at the Washington Post:
Last week I posted a copy of the draft application for Obamacare benefits, which clocks in at a hefty 21 pages. 
Consumer advocates and Wonkblog commenters had similar questions: Why on earth would the federal government create such a complex form to obtain a public benefit? 
You don’t have to spend much time with the chart to get that, it’s really not simple at all.

And Wednesday’s New York Times:
‘Our revenues are about $8 million, but the food business is a low-margin industry so cutting $108,000 out of our profits, which are just over $200,000, is a big deal,’ said Ms. Shein, who is the chief executive. They are evaluating different ways to comply with the new law and finance the expense.

You get my point. But if you don’t, Sean Hannity has a terrific round-up here. 
Over at Investors Business Daily, they’ve come up with “10 Disturbing Facts Americans Have Learned” about ObamaCare over the last three years. 
A better title might have been “10 Disturbing Facts About ObamaCare the Media Are Still Covering Up.” 

Regardless, “disturbing” is a kind word when you’re talking about skyrocketing premium costs, losing your employer-based insurance, having your hours cut back, and nearly a trillion in new tax hikes that will hit the middle class. 
The damage Obama, Democrats, the media, and the Supreme Court have done to this country is impossible to wrap your mind around. How did so many become so corrupted that they gleefully aided and abetted the likely destruction of our most vital and successful institution: the imperfect but still amazing American health care system? 
And God help us; it is just getting started.

Obamacare’s HHS Mandate lost yet again in a federal appeals court last Thursday, and then lost in a second case on Friday. These cases continue on the long road to the Supreme Court, and President Obama’s new “accommodation” of religious employers will do nothing to stop them. 
There are now at least 12 HHS Mandate cases in the federal courts of appeals, all challenging Kathleen Sebelius’ deeply-unpopular Obamacare regulation that all employers with 50 or more employees must offer healthcare plans that cover birth control, sterilization, and abortion-related services. 
Grote Industries is an Indiana-based company that makes lighting systems for cars. It’s owned and managed by a family of Roman Catholics who object to birth control. On Jan. 31, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an injunction pending appeal in Grote Industries v. Sebelius by a 2-1 vote, holding among other things that there is enough of a chance that the HHS Mandate violates federal religious liberty protections that the Chicago-based appeals court is ordering that this company does not need to comply with the regulation. 


The lead lawyer on the case, Matt Bowman from the Alliance Defending Freedom, said: 


Americans have the God-given freedom to live and do business according to their faith. Forcing employers to surrender their faith in order to earn a living is unprecedented, unnecessary, and unconstitutional. Honoring God is important every day, in all areas of life, including in our work. Freedom is not the government’s to give and take away when it pleases.

Then on Feb. 1, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit also issued an injunction pending appeal in Annex Medical, Inc. v. Sebelius. Annex Medical has less than 50 employees, so it’s not required by the Obamacare law to provide healthcare. Nonetheless, the owner offers healthcare to all his employees. 
But the owner of this Minnesota-based company, Stuart Lind, is again a deeply-religious man who objects to the HHS Mandate. So the federal appeals court in St. Louis likewise held that it’s likely the HHS Mandate violates his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (and possibly the Constitution as well). 
So a dozen such cases are now before different appellate courts, in different stages of appeal. (This doesn’t count dozens more cases that are before the trial-level federal district courts.) Decisions on whether to issue what are called preliminary injunctions in these cases–which will be the next step in the legal process–are likely to start coming down in late spring, meaning that sometime this fall the Supreme Court could vote to take one or more of these cases, and decide the legality of Sebelius’ abortion-related mandate in 2014 once and for all. 
The Obama administration new supposed accommodation for religious employers doesn’t change this equation. Legal experts are still trying to determine if it isn’t just a series of accounting gimmicks. But even if it allowed religious employers to completely opt out of the HHS Mandate, it nonetheless only applies to nonprofit employers. The companies that secured early wins in their cases last week are for-profit, secular businesses. So their cases will continue, and within a year one of the many cases currently on appeal should be before our nation’s highest court.

In an eye-opening six-month investigation into America’s disability program, Planet Money reporter Chana Joffe-Walt uncovered a “disability industrial complex” fraught with fraud that churns out 14 million checks every month to citizens the government has deemed disabled.   
“Since the economy began its slow, slow recovery in late 2009, we’ve been averaging about 150,000 jobs created per month,” said Joffe-Walt in an Public Radio International (PRI) “This American Life” interview. “In that same period every month, almost 250,000 people have been applying for disability.”



Among Joffe-Walt’s findings are the following facts:


The federal government spends more money each year on cash payments for disabled former workers than it does on food stamps and welfare combined; America’s two largest disability programs, including health care for disabled workers, costs taxpayers $260 billion a year
In some parts of the country, such as Hale County, Alabama, one out of every four working-age adults collects a disability check
As of 2011, 33.8% of newly diagnosed disabled workers cited “back pain and other musculoskeletal problems” as their reason for being unable to work.  In 1961, the top reason for being disabled was “heart disease, stroke”
Disabled workers do not get counted in the unemployment figures. If they did, the numbers would be far higher 
Less than 1% of people who went on disability at the beginning of 2011 have returned to the workforce
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program–which covers kids and adults–has exploded.  SSI is now seven times larger than it was 30 years ago.

The report suggests that the much-touted Welfare to Work policies of the 1990s that appeared to successfully move welfare recipients off the public dole may have been a mirage. States have figured out that shifting people from welfare to disability frees up substantial funds, as states have to pay the costs of welfare, but the federal government picks up the tab for disability.
“That’s a kind of ugly secret of the American labor market,” said MIT economist David Autor.  “Part of the reason our unemployment rates have been low, until recently, is that a lot of people who would have trouble finding jobs are on a different program.” 
Joffe-Walt says disability has “become a de facto welfare program for people without a lot of education or job skills.” The reporter notes that the disability program “wasn’t supposed to serve this purpose; it’s not a retraining program designed to get people back onto their feet.”
According to Social Security chief actuary Steve Goss, disability insurance program reserves will run out of money in 2016.

Col. Allen West, former GOP U.S. Congressman from Florida, said at a Thursday morning panel focused on the devastating economic impacts of amnesty that economic policies that displace black youths from jobs–like President Barack Obama’s immigration policies–have led to fads like the “knockout game.”
The panel, hosted by the nonpartisan pro-jobs group Americans4Work and featuring West and other leaders on immigration policy, focused intensely on how the economy has not gotten better around the country for many groups of Americans, including the black community. They noted how the immigration policies proposed by the president and some in Congress would not help the situation.
West and fellow panelist Professor Jan Ting of Temple University were discussing what they called the “new normal” in America–how Americans are not succeeding independent of the government in record numbers.


“What we don’t want to see happening in the United States of America is this second and third generation of welfare,” West said. “That becomes the new normal. When you look and see your mother and your father or your grandmother or your aunt or uncle, whoever is raising you, that they were born in Section Eight housing, their kids were in Section Eight housing. And therefore, you think there is no place else for me to go but Section Eight housing.”
West said such levels of dependency on the government “affects your level of self-esteem.”
“That affects your ability to, to be a part of an American dream,” he said. “And, I think, the big problem that you see if this, a, situation continues to exacerbate itself, then the safety net is no longer a safety net. The safety net becomes a hammock. And therefore, you have to have an increase of government spending because you’re going to expand and grow this welfare nanny-state.”

Wets noted that the “exorbitant amount of spending” from the federal government on means-tested welfare programs, and what he describes as a diversion of the food stamps program from what it was originally intended to accomplish, leads America “in the wrong direction.”
“And, again, it comes to the fundamental question, are we going to promote an opportunity society or are we going to promote a dependency society?” West asked. “What is the problem if we head down this road? You’re going to have more Detroits. And think about what Detroit used to be. Think about what Detroit used to look like. And guess what? You have this–and this is something that is absolutely driving me crazy, this knockout game.”
West noted that many of those teens involved in the knockout game would have, in his day, had jobs in their towns and would not be engaged in this behavior. But since the economic and education systems created by the left–including immigration policy which allows foreign workers into the country to compete with them for jobs–they have nothing to do but engage in violence.
“Well, guess what? If you have all of these inner-city black teenagers that have nothing to do, their education system is failing them. Well, in the summertime, I knew I could go down to McDonald’s or Burger King, you know, Baskin Robbins, somewhere,” he recalled. “I would go and get my little part-time summer job. They don’t even have those options now. So, what are they doing? They’re going out and they’re beating on people. For what? For fun.” 
“This is what happens when the policies are creating more dependence,” West explained. “They’re creating more despair. It’s creating more despondency. And it’s only going to get worse if we don’t turn it around.”

West also addressed amnesty’s devastating impact on the black community’s employment opportunities. When West was asked why the Congressional Black Caucus has been silent on the matter, he responded that “it just goes back to who is your master.”
“I think that they [the Congressional Black Caucus] are more so interested in the interests of the Democratic Party and their agenda rather than the people that they were sent here to Washington, D.C. to serve,” West said. “I’ll go back to a statement that the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Emanuel Cleaver, made, and I asked him about this. But he said that if there was anyone other than President Obama sitting in the White House that we would be marching on the White House when you look at the numbers as far as unemployment in the black community.”

West added that Cleaver said: “We give deference to President Obama for that.”
“So, you know, there is something wrong here,” West said. “And you’re right. When you look at our inner cities, America cannot recover economically unless we do something about our inner cities. If that continues to be the, the weak part of our economy, it will continue to drag the rest of this country down. Because there will be more resources poured into the welfare and nanny state instead of the economic opportunity.”
West said lawmakers and leaders need to be “very careful” with regard to the “trust and confidence that the American people have right now in government.” 

“In 1986, let’s remember, we went down the path,” West said. “We had an amnesty program. But there were certain requirements that the federal government were supposed to undertake and they never did. And so, this problem has been exacerbated.”
The failures of Obamacare, West said, have also played into Americans’ mistrust of government, another reason why an amnesty program would not be a good thing.
“Right now, if anyone goes out before the American people and they say ‘comprehensive,’ everyone is running the other way because we have a comprehensive health care plan that we’re dealing with right now,” West said. “So, again, I think, that you need to look at this in multiple ways.” 
“I mean, it affects your national security. It affects your economy. It affects your education. It affects your health care. It affects your local criminality,” he stated. “We can get to the point where we have some type of guest worker program. There’s no doubt about that especially in the agricultural industry.”
But before any type of immigration legislation adds to the amount of workers in the country, West said there must be “an economy that is growing”; compared to 1986, he said the economy now is in much worse shape.
“We need to have manufacturing coming back to the United States of America,” West said. “And, Senator [Jeff] Sessions talked about the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] numbers being up. Because on average 0.9 percent GDP growth over each year over the past five or six years. This time in Ronald Reagan’s economy, we were 7.2 percent GDP growth, big difference.” 
“So, why are we talking about flooding more people into a workforce where the GDP that is barely, you know, making it, it cannot sustain itself really, a debt to GDP ration which is upside down where we are owing more than we’re, we’re producing, we cannot take more people coming to this workforce,” he explained.

Intentionally or not, Monday on Morning Joe, Time’s Mark Halperin revealed to the world how the American media’s pro-Obama bias will in part be to blame for any coming government shutdown. When asked if President Obama had an incentive to negotiate with the GOP, Halperin explained that, “The White House does not have much incentive. They think the trends are going to go in their direction at the end of the week, or early next week at the latest; because again, the press is largely sympathetic to their arguments on this.”

In short: The government is going to shut down because Obama knows the media has his back and therefore feels no pressure to enter into negotiations that might avert a shutdown. In fact, Obama is apparently okay letting the government shut down because he knows the media won’t make him pay a political price for it. 

So what we have here is the media’s pro-Obama bias as a big factor in a potential shutdown. 
As we have seen all year, when it comes to settled laws on issues such as gun control, voter ID, and immigration, the media are big believers in the kind of “civil bipartisan compromise” that results in changing those laws — as long as all that “civil bipartisan compromise” comes from the GOP. 
But the media have completely abandoned their championing of “civil bipartisan compromise” with respect to this budget crisis, and as a result, Obama knows he has the media on his side and is therefore comfortable in his position not to negotiate. And Obama’s refusal to compromise is hurtling America towards a government shutdown. 
What we have here is a situation wherein media bias is helping to inflame a crisis. In other words, were the media acting responsibly, objectively,  and professionallly, this would actually decrease the chances of a shutdown. Obviously, though, the media wants its cake and to eat it too. The media are behaving in a way that increases the chances of a shutdown and then the media will blame the GOP for what the media helped cause.  
Now we also know why Obama felt so secure golfing during this weekend’s shutdown crisis, instead of rolling up his sleeves like a leader to make a deal. Why not? He knows the media won’t blame him for anything, including shutting down the government.

Word on the Hill is that a Senate deal to end the partial government shutdown and lift the debt ceiling will be reached on Tuesday. Although specific details are murky and subject to change, the broad outlines of the deal indicate a complete victory for Sen. Harry Reid and the Democrat caucus. With the partial government shutdown entering its third week, it looks increasingly likely that the GOP will gain next to nothing from the stand-off. 
The deal negotiated between Reid and GOP Leader Mitch McConnell would reopen the government through January 15th. The GOP had sought to lock-in lower levels of spending due to next year’s sequester cuts, but that seems off the table now. The deal would also raise the debt ceiling until early February. It sets up another contentious fight over spending and debt in the critical 2014 election year. 
In exchange, the GOP secured the creation of a large bi-cameral, bi-partisan commission or committee to explore budget and spending reforms. It also secured a provision to force the Obama Administration to take steps to verify the income of people seeking ObamaCare subsidies. That requirement is in the existing law, but was waived recently by the Administration. 


Democrats also seem to have secured a priority for their union allies. The deal, reportedly, would delay for one year ObamaCare’s “reinsurance” tax on group plans. Repealing this tax was a key policy goal for labor. 

It is hard to see this deal as anything but a complete capitulation by the GOP. The national debt would increase, without corresponding spending cuts or other reforms. Federal spending would resume at a higher level than required by the Budget Control Act, passed in 2011. Given the GOP’s inability to secure any meaningful reforms in these negotiations, it is hard to imagine it would fair better with a commission. 
If a deal is reached Tuesday, it could still take several days to pass the Senate. Any one Senator can object to the deal, forcing the Senate to consider the deal through its Byzantine process. It isn’t likely to pass the Senate until well after Treasury’s October 17 deadline for new borrowing authority. 
If the House gets the deal several days past the debt deadline, the chamber will come under extraordinary pressure to approve the deal.

Earlier this week, GOP Rep. Mick Mulvaney offered the Senate Democrat budget proposal for a vote in the House. The budget plan was defeated, with 35 Democrats crossing the aisle to oppose it. Thursday night, Dem Sen. Patty Murray responded by offering Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget for a vote in the Senate. The measure failed, 40-59, with 5 GOP Senators joining in opposition. Interestingly, among these 5 were Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee.
Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee are providing the nucleus of an emerging conservative opposition in the Senate. While there are other conservatives in the GOP caucus, these three are establishing themselves as reliable voices to articulate the conservative opposition to an ever encroaching government. 
They are becoming skilled at identifying issues to make a stand on principle. I have no doubt that if their votes could have pushed the Ryan budget into passing, they would have voted for it, as it is likely the best option on the table. Frankly, however, the Ryan budget doesn’t go as far as conservatives would prefer. A vote against an amendment that was already going to be defeated was a good moment to stand on that principle. 


The Ryan budget doesn’t cut real spending, but instead lowers the growth rate of spending. That is good, but unless you pull out by the roots wasteful spending and programs, they can always be expanded by a future Congress. Cutting real spending requires choices and priorities. Merely slowing the rate of spending growth keeps much of government in place. 

The most important, and meaningful, proposal in Ryan’s budget is to transition Medicare into a premium support program. Seniors would be free to select the health insurance that best meets their needs and the federal Medicare program would underwrite some portion of the premiums. It curbs unsustainable entitlement spending, but, best, it gives Seniors greater choice over their health care. 
Late Thursday, MI Sen. Debbie Stabenow introduced an amendment that would prevent Medicare being turned into a “voucher” program, the Democrats’ label to describe the Ryan plan. The Stabenow amendment passed 96-3. 
Who were the three Senators to vote against Stabenow? Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee. Hopefully, their principled, conservative opposition will catch on with their colleagues.

Conservatives, and Republicans in general, have been accused of having “no strategy” in the showdown with President Barack Obama and the Democrats over Obamacare, the government shutdown, and the debt ceiling. It might be argued that the Republicans only adopted their strategy by accident, but they do have one, and it is both necessary and long overdue: win back disenchanted voters by fighting for their interests–hard.
The conventional wisdom in Washington, DC, repeated ad infinitum in the opinion pages and on the weekend news shows, is that Republicans blundered by allowing President Obama to cajole them into a government shutdown. Now, the thinking goes, Democrats have a way to shift the weight of policy failures, scandals, and the Obamacare disaster: they can blame Republicans for causing fiscal and economic chaos–and warn of more.
It is true that the public blames Republicans for causing the shutdown–and well they might. It is also true, however, that the public understands that President Obama has been inflicting as much pain on them as possible in an effort to win a political fight. His refusal to negotiate, and his willingness to use petty tactics such as closing open-air war memorials, have caused his approval ratings to drop to nearly unprecedented levels.


Had Republicans followed the conventional wisdom on Obamacare and waited until 2016 to fight the issue, none of the above would have happened. Meanwhile, millions of Americans would have faced the daunting prospect of losing their health insurance or their jobs to a new, unfamiliar, unwieldy, and ultimately more expensive policy. They would have looked to Washington, only to see no one–at all–fighting to protect them.

Amidst the many competing versions of what a new Republican strategy should look like after 2012, the one common theme was that the party needed to learn how to relate to the concerns of ordinary people. There is nothing more basic, no issue more “kitchen table,” than the cost of health insurance. Symbolic votes against Obamacare may look good on campaign literature, but voters are smart enough to see through those tactics.
Another repeated exhortation was the need to reach out to Latino voters. And yet it has gone virtually unnoticed that the man leading the revolt against Obamacare on Capitol Hill, the man who shifted the GOP out of its torpor, is a Hispanic Republican–easily now the most recognizable Hispanic leader in America. For his trouble, he has been vilified by the wiser heads in his own party, who think appealing to Latinos means amnesty.
The major strategic challenge facing Republicans prior to the shutdown fight was the fact that millions of core GOP voters stayed home in 2012 and looked likely to do so again after the party leadership became consumed by debates over immigration reform. With few swing districts at stake in 2014, and Democrats vulnerable in key Senate races, the task–though many GOP leaders ignored it–was to reach out to the base.
Yes, the shutdown exposed Republicans to possible defection by independent voters. But President Obama, who evidently believes that the shutdowns of the 1990s foretell victory today, has missed one of the key lessons of that battle. President Bill Clinton won largely because he cast himself as a savior–of health care, education, and the environment. President Obama, in contrast, has auditioned for the role of executioner.
And so, ironically, Republicans have been able to cast themselves as the protectors of popular government programs by passing “rifle-shot” bills to fund each of them alone. At the very least, the GOP has prevented the damage from being worse. They do not look mean, as Gingrich did in 1995-6; they merely look irresponsible. And in that category, the president is giving them stiff competition by taking an ill-advised hard-line position.
All year, the Republicans’ clear–if quiet–legislative strategy has been to use the Full Faith and Credit Act as a backstop against default, strengthening their position in debt ceiling talks with the president. The only immediate political effect of the shutdown was to move that fight forward a week. But the strategic effect was great, and profound: the GOP is now back on course to connect with its missing voters–just in time for 2014.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican up for re-election in 2014, told the Washington Examiner in an interview published Friday that he believes it is time for the GOP establishment to stop conservatives and Tea Partiers.
McConnell argued it is “utter nonsense” for groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund (SCF), which has endorsed his primary challenger businessman Matt Bevin, to argue that Republicans like him in Congress are not fighting hard enough to defeat Democrats. In the interview, McConnell focused on deriding Tea Partiers for leading the effort to defund Obamacare–something that, coupled with the Democrats’ refusal to compromise on the soon-to-fail Obamacare, resulted in a government shutdown.
“The Senate Conservatives Fund is giving conservatism a bad name,” McConnell told the Examiner for the piece titled “The Establishment Fights Back: Mitch McConnell leads GOP battle against Tea Party insurgents.”


“They’re [SCF] participating in ruining the [Republican] brand,” McConnell said. “What they do is mislead their donors into believing the reason that we can’t get as good an outcome as we’d like to get is not because of a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, but because Republicans are insufficiently committed to the cause–which is utter nonsense.”
McConnell had not only personally opposed, during the shutdown, the effort from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) to defund Obamacare, he actually whipped votes against them, according to a Congressional source. Cruz and Lee had staked their battle on a key cloture vote that would have, if McConnell had united the Republican Party to deliver 41 votes against the use of taxpayer money to fund Obamacare, stopped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid from using a procedural ploy to fund Obamacare with just 51 votes.
McConnell voted with the Senate Democrats in favor of cloture  and reportedly whipped the Senate GOP conference to join him. While a majority of Senate Republicans–25, including McConnell–voted to allow Reid to procedurally fund Obamacare with just 51 votes cloture, 19 stood with Cruz and Lee. Those 19 Republicans included senior GOP senators like Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Jerry Moran (R-KS).

McConnell made an argument for what he termed “electable” candidates that he deems necessary to win back the U.S. Senate for the GOP. “To have the kind of year we ought to have in 2014, we have to have electable candidates on November ballots in every state–people that don’t scare the general electorate and can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home,” McConnell said in his interview with the Examiner. “We can’t just turn the other cheek and hope for the best. It didn’t work in 2010 and 2012 so we’re going to try something different in 2014.”
McConnell is now, according to Bloomberg News, getting financial backing from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in his reelection campaign against Bevin. 
“The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pouring money into a television advertising campaign defending Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, whose primary fight against a Tea Party-backed rival is shaping up as a test of establishment efforts to reclaim the Republican Party,” Bloomberg reported last Wednesday. “The business lobby will spend about $180,000 on a 10-day statewide blitz beginning Dec. 2 on behalf of McConnell, a five-term Republican, said a person familiar with the plans who asked not be identified because the ad buy hasn’t been announced.”
The Chamber of Commerce is leading the GOP establishment’s efforts to undercut the Tea Party movement and is the tip of the spear–along with Crossroads GPS’s Karl Rove–of the establishment’s efforts to strike back against the surging grassroots conservatism across America. 
Bevin has been gaining steam lately, partly due to McConnell’s mistakes in attacking conservatives and also by wrapping up a series of key grassroots support elements like an 85 percent victory in the Boone County, KY, GOP straw poll right before Thanksgiving. In an interview last weekend with Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Breitbart News Sunday, Bevin described his primary challenge against McConnell as a “microcosm” of the national fight between the Tea Party movement and the GOP establishment. 

Rather than embracing conservatism, McConnell’s strategy has been to attempt to isolate and excoriate SCF for backing Bevin. McConnell has been largely unsuccessful in doing so, as his actions have garnered him attention and criticism from other Tea Party-minded organizations who say attacking SCF is attacking the entire conservative movement. 
Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Jenny Beth Martin and Tea Party Express chairwoman Amy Kremer both say it is unfair to attack SCF and try to separate the organization, which was founded by Heritage Foundation president former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) and whose help has directly led to the elections of Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT), among many others.
McConnell’s latest slip-up, as it is being portrayed by Bevin, is a quote that appeared in the Bowling Green Daily News, in which McConnell said that he would be open to allowing Obamacare to remain the law of the land provided significant changes were made to it. 
McConnell said “he is not averse to talking about changes [to Obamacare], provided they are significant ones,” the paper reported.
“I’m just not going to throw somebody a lifeline (by extending the deadline for signup) just to get someone through the election,” McConnell said.
In response to that comment, Bevin held a conference call with reporters both in national and in Kentucky media to point out the Senate Minority Leader has essentially abandoned his previous promises to repeal Obamacare “root and branch.”
“We really want to call attention to the fact that there really is nothing conservative about his approach and there is really nothing with respect to what the American people want, which is a repeal,” Bevin said on the call, according to the Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, Kentucky.

Recent polling shows that an election wave of anti-ObamaCare sentiment is growing, and it is not only likely to hand the GOP control of the United States Senate, but might wipe out as many as 12 Democrat seats–many of which looked safe just a few months ago. 
Back in July, Five Thirty Eight’s election guru Nate Silver believed that control of the Senate was a tossup. That has all changed now that voters got their first real look at the brutal consequences of ObamaCare.


Starting with the generic ballot that simply pits Republican lawmakers against their Democrat counterparts, the movement towards the GOP has been striking. In the Real Clear Politics average of these polls, going back as far as the beginning of the year, Democrats have consistently led by 3 to 4 points. During the government shutdown, Democrats leaped to 6 and 7 point leads. Since the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare, though, Republicans are not only in the lead by 2.5 points; they have led in every poll but one since November 10. 
This generic polling is reflected in the available polling of individual Senate seats. 
Keep in mind that in order to win control of the Senate, Republicans need only pick up six seats, and with Democrat incumbents retiring in the redder than red states of South Dakota, West Virginia, and Montana, Republicans pretty much have three Senate pick-ups in the bag. But thanks to ObamaCare and vulnerable Democrat Senators refusing to put their own promises and the wellbeing of their constituents above slavish devotion to Obama, picking off another three should be fairly easy. 

 
Kay Hagan (D-NC)
In North Carolina, Democrat Kay Hagan looked as though she was cruising to a second term victory. Just a few months ago, polls showed her ahead by double digits against her most likely Republican challengers. 
In September, before ObamaCare started cancelling people’s policies by the millions and boosting the price of their premiums, Hagan was beating potential challenger Greg Bannon by a whopping 16 points. In the most recent poll taken just a couple weeks ago, Bannon picked up an astonishing 17 points and is now ahead by 1. 
All of Hagan’s most likely Republican challengers made similar gains. 

There is a YouTube video of Hagan promising that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance if you like it. Obviously that is not true, which means she either lied or blindly voted for something without understanding the consequences for her constituents.
 

Mary Landrieu (D-LA)
Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu has seen her approval rating collapse by double digits in just six months. Three months ago, Landrieu looked as though she would coast to a fourth term in a state Mitt Romney won without breaking a sweat. The National Journal now lists Landrieu as the third most endangered incumbent facing re-election in 2014. 
In August, Landrieu was polling over 50% in potential match ups (which would avoid a Louisiana runoff that requires the eventual winner hit at least 50%) and beating Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy, her most likely opponent, by a full 10 points. The consequences of ObamaCare have completely flipped that script. 

A recent poll shows the relatively unknown Cassidy behind by only 2 points
There is YouTube video of Landrieu promising her constituents that under ObamaCare, you can keep your insurance. The facts have either proved Landrieu a liar or incompetent. Other than token legislation to keep that promise, Landrieu has been as devoted to Obama and ObamaCare as any liberal Democrat. 
 
Mark Pryor (D-AR)
Thanks to ObamaCare, Senator Mark Pryor’s approval ratings in Arkansas have collapsed to just 33%, the lowest of his 12 years in the Senate. When Democrat Arkansas incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln lost her seat in 2010, her approval ratings were actually higher. The National Journal ranks Pryor as the most vulnerable Senate incumbent facing reelection in 2014. 
Pryor is also on record misleading his constituents about ObamaCare. 
 
Mark Begich (D-AK)
Just before the disastrous ObamaCare rollout, Alaskan Senator Mark Begich was cruising to reelection by as much as 11 points. Post-ObamaCare polls show that Begich has been considerably weakened and is ahead by only a point or two against his likely Republican challengers. Moreover, Begich’s approval rating among Alaskans now sits at a measly 39%. 
Begich is on record misleading his constituents with false assurances that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance. The GOP is already pounding him over that. 
Other than token proposals, Begich has done absolutely nothing to either keep that promise or to mitigate the damage ObamaCare is doing to Alaskans. 
The National Journal lists Begich as the second most vulnerable incumbent in the Senate. 
 
Iowa – Open Democrat Seat
With longtime Democrat Tom Harkin retiring from the Senate, Democrats thought they had made this seat safe with the recruitment of Rep. Bruce Braley. Until the American people were rattled by the consequences of ObamaCare, Democrats were probably right. In matchup after matchup, Braley was ahead by double digits. 
Post-ObamaCare, that lead has shrunk to single digits. 
 
Mark Udall (D-CO)
Prior to the ObamaCare rollout, Udall wasn’t even on the National Journal‘s list of endangered incumbents. Millions of insurance cancellations later, however, and the Democrat has a real fight on his hands. In one likely match up, Udall’s 15 point lead back in June has dropped to just 3 points. 
—

Since the ObamaCare fallout, the National Journal has added Al Franken (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) to its 2014 endangered list. Prior to the country being hit upside the head with the reality of ObamaCare, the idea that any one of these incumbents had anything to worry about was unthinkable. 
Shaheen is vulnerable enough that former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown is considering a challenge. Polls show her under 50% at 48% and Brown only behind by 4%. He hasn’t even made it official and is already within the margin of error. And if he runs, it will be on the issue of ObamaCare. 
Many believe that the worst of ObamaCare has yet to show itself. As the 2014 midterm elections loom closer late next year, so will the employer mandate. The Obama Administration itself has predicted that the fallout from the employer mandate could be tens of millions of cancellations. 
Knowing this is coming, and unless something changes, these vulnerable Democrats are likely to be remembered only as having done nothing to avoid catastrophes mainly afflicting the working and middle class. 
That is, other than hold hands with Obama to watch it all burn.

A new poll released by the Washington Post/ABC News reports very bad news for Obama. The President has hit record disapproval rating (56% among RVs, 55% among adults) and his Affordable Care Act is tanking in the public’s opinion. 
Not only does the public disapprove of Obama’s job performance, more than half do not like him. Fifty-two percent say they have an unfavorable image of the President. To drive that home, the three metrics used to measure Obama’s “leadership and empathy” are all in the red.  



Half or more now say he is not a strong leader, does not understand the problems of “people like you,” and is not honest and trustworthy. Perceptions of the president as a strong leader have dropped 15 points since January, and over the past year the percentage of registered voters who say he is not honest and trustworthy has increased 12 points.

These ratings carry over to opinions on Obamacare. Fifty-six percent say Obama is not a good manager and this is evident when looking at opinions about his health care program specifically. Almost two-thirds (63%) disapprove of of the program’s roll out and 57% straight up oppose the Affordable Healthcare Act, a 10% jump up from last month. The lynchpin of Obama’s program, the mandate to purchase insurance also performs quite poorly with two thirds (65%) opposing it. 
Polls are considered a snapshot in time, so there is no telling if America’s sour outlook on Obama and Obamacare will stick. Obama has promised to “re-brand” his health care program and it remains to be seen if the country will give him a second chance. Certainly the unintended consequences or rather, the particulars of the law which were concealed from the public, are not popular and indicate that if the public had “read the law before they passed it” it might not have ever been approved.

4086	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/30/ben-sasse-nebraska-obamacare	Opinion	1	Elections	Healthcare	Negative	Positive	breitbart.com	"
A novice Republican running in a rural state has shattered fundraising records campaigning as the “anti-Obamacare candidate.” In his first race for public office, Ben Sasse has raised nearly $750,000 in just eight weeks of the first quarter of his nascent candidacy, according to records being filed with the Federal Election Commission.
The massive haul highlights how lucrative campaigning against Obamacare can be for Republicans. It also underscores how deeply motivated conservative voters are to see that the sprawling healthcare law be killed.


A college president in his hometown of Fremont, Nebraska, Sasse is a newcomer to politics, but he has spent much of the past decade working on healthcare issues. As a top advisor to President Bush’s Health Secretary, Sasse worked to cut red tape and pushed market-based solutions over government mandates. Sasse also spent several years traveling the country giving speeches and advising companies about the dangers of Obamacare and how it will hike costs, constrict innovation, and ultimately provide terrible health care.
“I am the anti-Obamacare candidate,” Sasse said cheerfully. “Not only have I read the 2,300-page bill, I have actually spent years studying it and I understand just how devastating this will be to American businesses, families and taxpayers.”
It was Sasse’s health care expertise and his outspoken opposition to Obamacare that inspired former Nebraska GOP chairman Mark Fahleson to draft Sasse to run for the open seat left by Sen. Mike Johann’s retirement.

“2014 and probably 2016 will be about one thing more than anything else,” Fahleson said. “It will be about Obamacare and the false promises and reckless entitlement spending that are set to destroy this country. And I don’t know anybody who knows more about it and is more honest about the problems of Obamacare than Ben.”
Sasse’s campaign comes just as the crusade against Obamacare has hit a fevered pitch in Washington.
“Ted Cruz has finally shown the Republican establishment in Washington just how fed up voters are with the federal government and the notion that bureaucrats know what is best for patients,” said one political consultant who advised the Cruz campaign. “That’s why a guy knowledgeable about healthcare like Ben Sasse being in the Senate would be the most destructive thing to ever hit Obamacare.”
Sasse’s cash haul of nearly $750,000 from individual donors in his first quarter breaks Nebraska’s previous record of $526,000 from individual donors, set in 2007 by Johanns while he was sitting U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.
Shane Osborn, former state treasurer who has been running for the senate seat for six months, raised just $234,000 in his first quarter, according to FEC records.

UPDATE [11/5/2013]: With 99% of all precincts reporting, Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe has won the Virginia governor’s race with 47.9% of the vote. Republican Ken Cuccinelli has garnered 45.5%. The Wenzel Strategies poll has proven an accurate measure of the final days of the campaign, with Cuccinelli losing by a much smaller margin than other polling firms predicted. RealClearPolitics’s average of various polls predicted a McAuliffe win by +6.7. The Washington Post’s final poll predicted a +12 McAuliffe win.
A new poll, provided exclusively to Breitbart News, finds the Virginia Governor’s race a virtual dead-heat, with Democrat Terry McAuliffe leading Republican Ken Cuccinelli 41%-40%. Libertarian Robert Sarvis garners 10% and 9% of likely voters who remain undecided. With less than two weeks to go, the race is a toss-up that will likely be decided by turnout, a critical factor in an off-year election.
The poll comes from Wenzel Strategies, which accurately predicted closing momentum for Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Deb Fischer, among others. The slight edge McAuliffe holds is due mostly to stronger support within his partisan base. 81% of Democrats support McAuliffe, against just 68% of Republicans who support Cuccinelli. 


Cuccinelli’s support seems be building, however, as public attention moves away from the recent government shutdown to the failing implementation of ObamaCare. Cuccinelli was a leading national figure suing to overturn the health care law. 

The closeness of the race is apparent in the millions spent by left-wing groups to support McAuliffe in the closing days. In addition, Hillary and Bill Clinton, close allies of McAuliffe, have made themselves permanent fixtures in the Commonwealth, campaigning on his behalf. 
“There’s a reason the Clintons have been called in to spend a week campaigning for McAuliffe and that Bloomberg is pouring in millions with 2 weeks to go,” Brian Baker, President of Ending Spending Action Fund, which commissioned the poll, told Breitbart News. “Their internals must be showing what our poll indicates — that his unfavorables are high and they must try to suppress Cuccinelli turnout to prevail.  All indications are that the numbers are closing, especially post shutdown. The focus will be where the undecideds go and what will Sarvis draw? With the race this close, the poll indicates a vote for Sarvis is a vote for McAuliffe.”
History also is on Cuccinelli’s side. Since the 1980s, the winner of the Virginia Governor’s race has always been from the opposite party of that occupying the White House.

With ObamaCare revealing that except for lies and incompetence Emperor Obama is naked, all around the country voters are turning against the president’s political party and anyone who made it possible for ObamaCare to rape the middle class. Just a few months ago, the media thought the government shutdown would benefit Democrats in the 2014 midterms. Today the National Journal reports that a wave is building that will hand Republicans control of the United States Senate.
A third of America’s one-hundred U.S. Senators are up for re-election every two years. Of the 33 or 34 facing a 2014 election, the National Journal identifies 15 seats as vulnerable. Thirteen of those seats are held by Democrats. But of the 7 seats most likely to turn over, all 7 are held by Democrats. Republicans need only pick up 6 seats to win the chamber. 


Unlike the shutdown, ObamaCare is almost certain to be the gift that keeps on giving to Republicans as the law rains hell on American voters. By the government’s own calculations, tens of millions more insurance cancellations are expected to hit next year. And if the Administration does get the website functional, that only means that Americans will discover the other bad news about lost doctors, premium increases, and sky-high  deductibles.
The unprecedented — over 225 years — move by Senate Democrats to kill the filibuster for presidential appointees is also a sign that Democrats see the writing on the wall. With only a year of majority control left, and ObamaCare dying a death of a thousand cuts, the nuclear option was the only move Obama had left to secure some kind of legacy by packing the courts and various regulatory agencies. 
In other news, talk of Democrats regaining control of the House was never a very real possibility and is now a distant memory. 

The good news for Republicans is that with control of both chambers, they will have two years to show the American people that they are far from obstructionists and do-nothings. John Boehner’s House has passed a number of bills, but the media refuse to report that fact and Democrat Harry Reid refuses to even allow them to come up for a vote in the Senate. 
With Reid out of the picture, Republicans can craft a real agenda with real alternatives to Obama’s relentless, failed statism. 
If this opportunity is handled well (always a long shot with the GOP), it could help the party heading into 2016.

With ObamaCare revealing that except for lies and incompetence Emperor Obama is naked, all around the country voters are turning against the president’s political party and anyone who made it possible for ObamaCare to rape the middle class. Just a few months ago, the media thought the government shutdown would benefit Democrats in the 2014 midterms. Today the National Journal reports that a wave is building that will hand Republicans control of the United States Senate.
A third of America’s one-hundred U.S. Senators are up for re-election every two years. Of the 33 or 34 facing a 2014 election, the National Journal identifies 15 seats as vulnerable. Thirteen of those seats are held by Democrats. But of the 7 seats most likely to turn over, all 7 are held by Democrats. Republicans need only pick up 6 seats to win the chamber. 


Unlike the shutdown, ObamaCare is almost certain to be the gift that keeps on giving to Republicans as the law rains hell on American voters. By the government’s own calculations, tens of millions more insurance cancellations are expected to hit next year. And if the Administration does get the website functional, that only means that Americans will discover the other bad news about lost doctors, premium increases, and sky-high  deductibles.

4120	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/03/20/Ann-Curry-Ambush-Kirk-Cameron	Opinion	1	Gay Rights	Healthcare	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Shorter Ann Curry: Your religious beliefs represent hate speech! 
Make no mistake about it, this is all about going after the Christian Church. Same-sex marriage, GLAAD’s fascist rampages, and all of this Orwellian political correctness is part of a long-term goal:  to make Christian beliefs a form of bigotry and to force a left-wing agenda on the church–all under a Trojan horse labeled “discrimination.” 
In many respects, Obama forcing the Catholic Church to violate its conscience with respect to providing birth control and abortion drugs through their social service institutions is a dry run for this. The left wants to know if they can persuade the American people that a non-existent right (in this case, free birth control) trumps a First Amendment that declaratively restricts the government from impeding the free exercise of religion. 


The obvious next step will be to attempt an end-run around the First Amendmen, by declaring as bigoted the Church’s refusal to marry same-sex couples. They will also attempt to declare as hate speech any belief held by the church that in any way angers GLAAD. 

What Ann Curry did to Kirk Cameron this morning is the first phase of that war: The shaming campaign. On national television, she brought the actor on to declare that his religious belief’s “hate speech” will encourage others to “mistreat gay people.”
We all know what the next step is, and that’s the outlawing of these opinions under the principle that the speaking of such things will cause harm to others.  
This, of course, would mean the end of the church — which is the whole idea.
Newsbusters:

Leading off an interview with conservative Christian actor Kirk Cameron on Tuesday’s NBC Today, co-host Ann Curry immediately attacked him for recent comments he made to CNN’s Piers Morgan: “I’m going to ask you about this firestorm that you set off…on the topic of gay marriage….Many people are suggesting that this is hate speech. Are you encouraging people to feel hate towards gay people?” [Listen to the audio or watch the video after the jump]
Curry plucked out a single sentence from Cameron’s CNN interview: “…you said, quote, ‘I think that it’s unnatural. I think that it’s detrimental and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.'” Cameron called out her selective framing of the topic: “I love all people. I hate no one. And, you know, when you take a subject and you reduce it to something like a four-second sound bite, and a check mark on a ballot, I think that that’s inappropriate and insensitive.”
Even after Cameron explained that the “edited down” quote “certainly didn’t reflect my full heart on the matter,” Curry still asserted he was encouraging hate: “Do you feel any responsibility saying words like that, that might encourage people to feel that it’s okay to treat – mistreat gay people?”
Cameron pushed back and cited Morgan’s blatant bias on the issue: “Nobody should mistreat anybody….what I think this reveals is that – the interviewer that asked me these questions even used the words with me, “I think your views are destructive” – so what that shows me is that all of us who really think deeply about social issues, like gay marriage, and abortion, and homosexuality, have convictions on issues.” 

Ann Curry and Leftists like her don’t give a damn about gays. If they did, you would see the same amount of hostility directed towards Muslims.

Embattled Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius appeared flustered during Wednesday testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee as she struggled to answer questions about an explosive Politico Magazine report written by Government Accountability Institute President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer. 
The report revealed the White House calendar records a single one-on-one meeting between her and President Barack Obama in over three-and-a-half years.
“How many times did you actually visit with the President since 2009 or 2010 when you came on board?” asked Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is also a medical doctor. “How many personal visits did you have with him at the White House regarding the Affordable Care Act?”


“A lot,” said Sebelius.
“Can you verify that?” asked Gingrey.
The chair then said, “The Gentleman’s time has expired.” 

“I, I…,” a flustered Sebelius said while raising her hands in the air. 

The GAI’s report and Schweizer’s Politico Magazine op-ed revealed the White House’s official calendar and the Politico presidential calendar list just a single meeting between Obama and Sebelius from July 12, 2010 to November 30, 2013. On Friday, HHS spokesperson Joanne Peters released a statement claiming that Sebelius and Obama held “countless” one-on-one meetings together and that “dozens” of those private meetings were held in the last year alone. 
Similarly, when asked by NBC News reporter Peter Alexander and ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl about the GAI’s explosive report, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney claimed Sebelius has one-on-one meetings with Obama “frequently” and that “it’s safe to say that Kathleen Sebelius has been one of the more frequent visitors to and attendants to meetings with the president. 
However, Carney admitted to Jonathan Karl that he had no numbers, figures, or dates of meetings but said, “I think on this case, they’ll [HHS] have information for you.” But today during her testimony, Sebelius could only answer, “A lot,” when questioned how many times she had met with the president. And HHS spokesperson Joanne Peters has yet to release the “countless” and “dozens” of dates she claims Obama and Sebelius met one-on-one over the last three-and-a-half years leading up to the Obamacare rollout. 

Analysts say the GAI report hits at the core question of presidential leadership and executive management, traits that when damaged can do significant damage to a president’s popularity, especially among Independent voters. Former White House adviser to four presidents of both parties, David Gergen, said on CNN that the GAI’s report demonstrated “malfeasance” by the Obama White House. “The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one, I think, frankly, is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation,” said Gergen. “At the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.” 
Other GOP committee members expressed frustration with Sebelius for what they considered evasive and misleading answers. 
“We just don’t get the truth out of you!” Rep. John Shimkus (R-IL) said to Sebelius. “It’s like talking to the Republic of Korea.” 
Democrats on the committee like Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) laughed off Republican criticisms of Obamacare and said GOP concerns over millions of American families receiving insurance cancellations proves Republicans are “living on Mars.” Pallone added: “The reality is the Affordable Care Act is working…I’m proud of this law.” 
“Republicans are afraid this law is going to be popular,” said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA).
Obama claims he was never notified of problems with healthcare.gov prior to the website’s disastrous October 1 launch. 
The White House and HHS have yet to release the dated list of one-on-one meetings each claims occurred between Obama and Sebelius.

***UPDATE: Media reports say that President Obama selected a health insurance ObamaCare plan Monday. This is a symbolic act. The president will continue to get his health care from the military.  
Via Twitter, April Ryan, White House Correspondent and Washington Bureau Chief for American Urban Radio Networks, reports that President Obama will enroll in ObamaCare sometime before the end of the day Monday.The president is currently vacationing in Hawaii. Today is the last day to enroll in ObamaCare if you want coverage to begin at the beginning of the new year.

Just off phone w/Valerie Jarrett @vj44 POTUS will sign up for for Health Insurance on the Market place by the end of today 2 lead by example
— AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) December 23, 2013

Whether the president will risk signing up while cameras are rolling is still unknown. The risk in the president doing so is that HealthCare.gov crashes on him and in front of the entire world. As recently as Friday, the site collapsed. 

Regardless, it certainly can’t hurt for Obama to sign up. Currently, reports show that ObamaCare enrollment is way behind where it needs to be if the program is going to be financially viable.  
Moreover, reports on the number of enrollees the White House releases and the media slavishly repeats are inaccurate. You have to pay your first month’s policy in order to be enrolled and insured. Both the White House and the media are reporting those who have only put a health plan in their shopping cart as “enrolled.” 
Studies show that the online abandonment rate of items placed in a shopping cart is as high as 65%. 
Currently, the media have shown little interest in digging up or demanding the real ObamaCare enrollment numbers.

The massive, coordinated initiative by the Catholic Church to push for comprehensive immigration reform is being run by a group that has the support of the most far-left corners of the Church who often seem to be at odds with actual Catholic doctrinal teachings.
As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn wrote Thursday, Kevin Appleby, Director of Migration Policy for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) is coordinating the Church’s initiative to apply political pressure to Congress to pass an immigration reform law that will include a pathway to citizenship. 
According to its USCCB website, Migration and Refugee Services (MRS) “is charged with assisting the bishops in the development and promotion of migration policy positions within the context of the Church’s social teaching:” 



MRS works with grassroots Catholic networks across the US to promote fair immigration and refugee policies, advocates for the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, engages in the fight against human trafficking, develops initiatives aimed at educating Catholics on the Church’s teaching on migration, and assists the U.S. Catholic bishops in carrying the voice of the Church to Congress and the Administration. 

Among the coalitions with which MRS/USCCB is closely aligned is the Justice for Immigrants Campaign which is the “boots on the ground” group that is “designed to unite and mobilize a growing network of Catholic institutions, individuals, and other persons of good will in support of a broad legalization program and comprehensive immigration reform.” 
Even though support of amnesty is not a doctrinal matter for the Catholic Church, Justice for Immigrants has been so successful in its media campaign that it has positioned even the most conservative Catholic bishops, who have rebuked the Democrat-led federal government on Catholic doctrinal matters, such as abortion and marriage, to place their trust in essentially the same politicians in the area of comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty.  
Even Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who heads the USCCB, publicly criticized Republicans during an MSNBC interview in May of 2012. 


“You need to get your house in order when it comes to immigration,” Dolan said to the GOP. “You have the reputation of being fairly tough on immigrants…you’d better come up with a much saner, more civil, more just immigration policy.” 
However, some of the founding member organizations of Justice for Immigrants are groups whose actions have not been aligned with Catholic doctrinal teachings, such as those on abortion and marriage.
Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) has been under scrutiny for several years for its ties to pro-abortion leaders. 
A Planned Parenthood lobbyist, Alisa LaPolt Snow, recently drew national condemnation when she told Florida state representatives that, if a baby is born alive during a botched abortion, the decision about whether to save its life “should be left up to the woman, her family, and the physician.”

LaPolt Snow’s biography, however, indicated that she served “on the board of Catholic Charities of Northwest Florida – Tallahassee.”


In July of 2011, CCUSA also confirmed to LifeSiteNews that it had hired the firm of gay lobbyist Tom Sheridan, the Sheridan Group, to work on its behalf. 

Earlier that year, Catholic Charities of San Francisco had invited a number of pro-abortion lawmakers to its annual Loaves and Fishes fundraiser, including several with 100 percent pro-abortion voting records with NARAL. In addition, it had been previously discovered that the director of programs of San Francisco Catholic Charities had adopted children with his gay partner and was publicly supported by the charity’s leaders. 
According to LifeSiteNews, Sister Jeannine Gramick, founder of New Ways Ministry, a dissident group, said, “Catholic Charities in general have been the most progressive wing of the church other than the nuns.” 
CCUSA also pressed the Catholic faithful to support passage of ObamaCare “immediately,” even though the law lacked a provision that excluded funding of abortion. 
Pope Benedict XVI had issued an apostolic letter last December that directed Caritas Internationalis, the umbrella group that represents CCUSA and Catholic Relief Services, to cease practices that are inconsistent with Church teaching. The former pope warned diocesan bishops and parish priests about the increase in charitable services to the poor becoming integrated with practices that are inconsistent with Church doctrine. 
Catholic Relief Services (CRS), a Justice for Immigrants member organization, has also been at the center of a scandal this year regarding the funding of organizations that promote abortion and birth control. According to LifeSiteNews, CRS has denied any direct involvement in either funding or the distribution of items related to abortion or contraception. 
Last week, LifeSiteNews reported, however, that CRS is a dues-paying member and on the board of directors of MEDiCAM, an organization that has supported the individual training of abortion providers, and CORE Group, which has devoted half of its total budget to “family planning.”  
CRS reportedly admitted this fact, and responded, “We acknowledge our differences, air our disagreements on these issues, and contribute our Catholic voice to the conversation.” 
Similarly, in July, CRS reportedly gave $2.7 million to a population control organization that uses its work to distribute anti-malaria drugs and mosquito nets as a means of spreading its population control programs. 
The Catholic Health Association (CHA), also a founding member of Justice for Immigrants, last month announced that it would accept the White House’s “accommodation” for religious employers that opposed the HHS contraception and abortifacients mandate, even though the bishops said the final rule failed to resolve several key concerns for them.  
Sister Carol Keehan, president and CEO of CHA had also supported the passage of ObamaCare, even after the USCCB withdrew its backing because of concerns about whether the health reform law would be used to subsidize abortions. 
Though not specifically mentioned as a “member organization” of Justice for Immigrants, the Nuns on the Bus, a group of Catholic nuns that espouses liberal social policies, held a national bus tour for comprehensive immigration reform this summer. 
Last year, the Nuns spoke out against Congressman Paul Ryan’s budget proposal which, they said, favored wealthy Americans at the expense of the poor. Following that tour, Sister Simone Campbell, leader of the Nuns, appeared on “The Colbert Report” and was a prime-time speaker at the Democrat National Convention, despite the fact that the DNC openly promoted abortion and same-sex marriage. 
Given the backing of many well-known “Catholic” organizations, the Church’s political advocacy for immigration is significant. As Breitbart News’ Flynn noted, the “support of amnesty seems broader and more coordinated than its actions against an ObamaCare mandate requiring coverage of contraception. In recent years, the Church has been more vocal in its criticism of abortion, but even that seems muted in comparison with current plans on immigration reform.”

4178	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/30/Cruz-vs-Gregory-5-Lessons	Opinion	1	None	Healthcare	Negative	Positive	breitbart.com	"
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) put on a masterclass in his appearance on NBC News’ Meet the Press with David Gregory on Sunday. In less than twenty minutes, Cruz not only demolished Democrat arguments–as transmitted by the ever-eager Gregory–but also showed a keen insight into debate tactics that Republicans often lack. Here are the five key tactics, which should be studied and drilled into Republican politicians in media training.



1. Question the premise. On two separate occasions, Cruz pushed back against the implicit assumptions in questions Gregory asked–assumptions designed by Gregory to put Cruz on the defensive. In each case, Cruz challenged the question itself before answering, and then used his answer to return to the offensive.
In the first case, Gregory implied Cruz had not engaged in a “debate” about how to “change” Obamacare:

GREGORY: It’s interesting. Democrats say, “You know, the problem with Senator Cruz’s position is that it’s a purist position.” There are problems with Obamacare. The White House admits that. We talked about polling in some quarters indicating great dissatisfaction with the law, as you’re talking about in Town Hall meetings. But you have to engaged in a debate about how they change the law. What you’ve gone out and said is, “Let’s kill the law all together. Let’s de-fund it.”
CRUZ: Actually, with respect, David, I think the premise of your question is wrong. It is the Democrats who have taken the absolutist position. Look, I’ve engaged– I’d like to repeal every word of the law. But that wasn’t my position, even in this fight.

That turnabout created headlines, drawing public attention to the refusal of Democrats to compromise.

In the second case, Gregory brutally distorted a remark by Cruz about Neville Chamberlain:

GREGORY: Do you regret comparing the future of Obamacare to the rise of Hitler in Nazi Germany?
CRUZ: Well, the premise of your question isn’t true. I didn’t make that comparison. What I said is that there have been many voices in Washington who’ve said, “We can’t do this, we can’t do this, we can’t do this.” And I went through the contracts where, over and over again, when facing big challenges, Americans have risen to the occasion, whether it was the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, whether it was going to the moon under John F. Kennedy, or whether it was winning the Cold War.

The addition of Kennedy at the end–to counter Gregory’s false Hitler reference–was a nice touch.
2. Stick to the message. Gregory wanted to make the interview all about a government shutdown. Cruz kept his own answers focused on Obamacare. That frustrated Gregory, who nearly lost his composure: “You’re making an argument….You’ve made all these arguments. My goodness, you went and spoke for 21 hours to make these arguments. You haven’t moved anyone.” Cruz, in contrast, looked calm and focused–and kept the debate on terms where he had the distinct advantage, given Obamacare’s unpopularity.
An additional note on this point: Democrats, having been through the talking-points-factory that is left-wing media training (and produces such robots as Debbie Wasserman Schultz), are very good at sticking to their message, but largely because they simply keep repeating it, regardless of the circumstances. What Cruz did was different, and more effective: he found a way to make his message relevant to each context in the debate.
3. Cite your opponents’ supporters in your favor. Gregory came armed with quotes from Republicans and Beltway conservatives who disapprove of what Cruz is doing. Cruz countered, as he did frequently on the Senate floor, with direct quotes from Democrats’ core constituents, including Teamsters Union leader James Hoffa, who has led a new surge of opposition to Obamacare from the left. Cruz’s ready access to the Hoffa quote also shows the importance of research and preparation, and reflects well on his political staff.
4. Never forget your constituency. My favorite moment in the interview was when Gregory read Cruz an extended quote from George Will, and Cruz responded by saying, effectively, that Will only represents his own view, while a Senator from Texas represents millions of voters who knew what they were getting:

GREGORY: George Will, who’s been a conservative columnist for The Washington Post and others, has been very supportive of you in the past. But he wrote this, this week. I want to have you respond to it…
CRUZ: Look, I’m just trying to fight for 26 million Texans and for the American people. And I’m pretty sure George Will, in that column, argued that what we should be doing is delaying Obamacare, which is exactly what the House of Representatives just voted to do.

5. Believe that your opponent secretly agrees with you. Gregory is certainly on the left, but Cruz never treated him as an enemy. Rather, he approached the host as if he could be brought ’round, given the true facts. The above quote, about George Will, is instructive. Note that Cruz did not say that Will was wrong–instead, he found a point of agreement within Will’s column and emphasized that. By finding ways to show that his opponents might actually agree with him, Cruz encouraged even skeptical viewers to ask themselves whether they might, as well. And his supporters had plenty to cheer without watching yet another Republican guest try to earn points with the press by backtracking on previous convictions.

4200	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/23/Exclusive-McConnell-Cornyn-whipping-votes-against-Ted-Cruz	Opinion	0	Republican Scandals	Healthcare	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"

A source in Congress tells Breitbart News that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn are using their leadership positions to pressure other Republicans to oppose Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in his campaign to defund Obamacare. 
“Right now in the Senate, Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn are actively whipping Senators to shut down debate on the House continuing resolution so that Harry Reid can gut it with just 51 votes,” a senior congressional staffer with intimate knowledge of the situation said in an email to Breitbart News. “Unbelievably, they actually are leading the fight to fully fund Obamacare.”
McConnell and Cornyn stated earlier Monday that they oppose a possible filibuster from Cruz to keep Reid from adding language funding the Affordable Care Act to the continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives.


As Breitbart News reported on Saturday, McConnell and Cornyn could help Cruz win:


First, when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid brings the House continuing resolution (CR) to the floor next week, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell needs to deliver 41 Republican votes to filibuster it until Senator Reid agrees not to try and restore funding for Obamacare. McConnell has the power to ensure that Reid cannot get an amendment onto the bill that strips the Obamacare defunding language with a simple majority vote. As Breitbart News laid out on Friday, McConnell has closed down one pathway that Reid could use:  

If [Reid] introduces an amendment before the Senate votes on cloture for the House CR[, t]hat would require a 60-vote threshold, and McConnell’s spokesman Don Stewart told Breitbart News that if Reid attempted that tactic, all Senate Republicans would stand together to block it.

However, a major avenue is still open through which Reid can get the amendment onto the bill with a simple majority. If McConnell decides Obamacare is worth fighting in earnest on must-pass legislation (ie non-symbolic votes), then he will deliver the 41 necessary votes to filibuster until Reid is forced to agree to a clean up-or-down Senate floor vote on the Obamacare defunding CR the House just passed. There is something McConnell can do using his power that could accomplish this: Filibuster the House CR until there is a unanimous consent agreement that any amendments added to it after cloture is invoked would also each require a 60-vote threshold. The power rests now with McConnell. Delivering the 41 votes is essential to help Ted Cruz.

Instead of helping Cruz with their power as Senate GOP leaders, McConnell and Cornyn are working against him, this senior staffer said. But in the end, they will try to make it appear as though they do not support funding Obamacare by voting against Reid’s amendment after allowing Reid to implement it. “Once it’s a 51-vote threshold, both McConnell and Cornyn will hide behind a ‘no’ vote on Reid’s amendment–so they will have yet another show vote,” the staffer said.
“To be clear, nobody is fighting harder to make sure Obamacare is funded than Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn,” the senior staffer added.

On Sunday, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin called on Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace to release the names of the “top Republicans” that sent him opposition research on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to “hammer” Cruz before his appearance on the program to discuss defunding Obamacare. 
“Keep it TRULY fair & balanced,” Palin tweeted. “Release the GOP names encouraging you to trash @SenTedCruz. No more anonymous sources.”

@FoxNewsSunday Keep it TRULY fair & balanced. Release the GOP names encouraging you to trash @SenTedCruz. No more anonymous sources.
— Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) September 22, 2013


On Sunday, Wallace said that establishment Republicans are so worked up that Cruz is leading the defund Obamacare fight that he immediately got unsolicited questions and research on Cruz from “top Republicans” before Cruz’s appearance.

In an appearance on Washington D.C.’s Fox 5 to preview his Sunday show, Wallace said, “I will tell you I have never in my time in Washington seen a party so upset with one of its own members.”
In an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News on Saturday, Palin urged Cruz to stay strong in the face of the inevitable backlash from fellow Republicans and suggested they compare “shiv marks” the next time they meet:

Welcome to our world, Ted. The same people have been denouncing conservatives like me for years (right after they ask for help fundraising for themselves or endorsing the latest candidate they’ve suckered into paying their exorbitant consulting fees). We can compare shiv marks next time we meet, my friend.”

She also wrote about the “gutless” and “rudderless” permanent political class:

Those of us who hang in there supporting a major political party with our energy, time, and contributions would like to believe that that party would praise principled conservatives like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee for following through on campaign promises. We’d like to believe that the GOP establishment would applaud the way these bold leaders have rallied the grassroots to their cause. But, no, such praise would require a commensurate level of guts and leadership, and the permanent political class in D.C. is nothing if not gutless and rudderless.

4226	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/17/Obama-push-immigration-farm-bill	Opinion	0	Civil Rights	International News	Negative	Positive	breitbart.com	"
On Thursday, President Obama took to the White House podium to triumphantly announce the end of the government shutdown. In doing so, he proclaimed that he wanted to push forward with other legislative priorities, including a budget, immigration reform, and the long-stalled pork-laden farm bill. 
“[I]n the coming days and weeks, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, a budget that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further,” Obama stated. Historically, “balanced” has been code for tax increases. 


Obama then pushed on to immigration reform: “Number two. We should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system.” Naturally, he blamed the Republican House for stalling his preferred immigration bill.

Finally, Obama called for the farm bill to be passed: “Number three. We should pass a farm bill, one that American farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the long-term certainty that they deserve.” And, disingenuously, he called for negotiations.
On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) echoed Obama, saying, “I look forward to the next venture, which is making sure we do immigration reform.” On Thursday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that Obama wanted immigration reform “more than anything else” during his second term. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-CA) said that he trusted that Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) would cave on immigration: “Once again, the speaker for the majority party is going to be placed in a position of deciding whether he’s going to put country before party and get something done. We just need a few courageous Republicans to stand up and say they’re ready.”
Republicans, however, pushed back. “It’s not going to happen this year,” said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID). “After the way the president acted over the last two or three weeks where he would refuse to talk to the speaker of the House…they’re not going to get immigration reform. That’s done.”

Florida taxpayers are set to subsidize a joint venture between Univision and ABC that will try to use a new cable channel to “own” the debate on comprehensive immigration reform. 
According to a report in the Miami Herald, Fusion, the cable channel that will debut on October 28 in roughly 20 million homes, may collect nearly $10 million in subsidies “pledged by Miami-Dade County and Florida for the new venture, with the state contributing $7 million to the package.”
Fusion’s facility opened on Wednesday in Doral, Florida and, in return for the subsidies, Univision has reportedly “pledged to spend $247 million on the new complex over many years.”


Jorge Ramos, the host of Univision’s Al Punto Sunday Show, will anchor a one-hour show at 8 PM on Fusion, and he was clear that the channel will intend to “own” the immigration debate “from the first hour.” On his Sunday show, Ramos has been a fierce advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. On a recent episode, Ramos interviewed citizen-activist D.A. King, a staunch opponent of amnesty. Ramos’s first question to King was, “Why do you hate immigrants so much?”

“We’re going to come out on Oct. 28th, and if the House doesn’t approve immigration reform by then, then there’s going to be a new, very loud voice in Fusion, talking about immigration every single night until immigration reform passes,” Ramos told The Huffington Post in a recent interview.
As the Herald notes, Fusion is “partly a hedge against the aging of Univision’s primetime audience of nearly 4 million Spanish-speaking residents, as their children and grandchildren increasingly turn to English-language programming.”
Though “Nielsen ratings show Univision drawing an average prime-time audience of 3.6 million, large enough for it to be the No. 1 network in any language during the summer re-run season,” a Pew Research poll found that “half of Hispanic Latino adults get their news in both Spanish and English, while the number relying solely on Spanish-language news sources dropped from 22 percent in 2006 to 18 percent in 2012.”
The channel also plans to target so-called millennials, and some of their hosts do not speak Spanish. The network has even hired a former producer for The Daily Show to produce satire programming on news and sports.

UN Human Rights Council “expert” Richard Falk has published a statement saying Bostonians got what they deserved in last week’s terror attack.  He quotes W.H. Auden to make his point: “to whom evil is done/do evil in return.”  
Richard Falk is the UN’s “Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.” He has held the post since 2008, despite exposure as a 9/11 conspiracy theorist. 


In his latest rant, published online on April 21, 2013 by foreignpolicyjournal.com Falk repeats the libel that prior to 9/11 President George W. Bush was seeking a “pretext” for war, and that anything Israel is the opposite of “justice and peace.”
And then he attacks Bostonians head-on. The police action in Boston was a “hysterical dragnet.”  Boston’s dead were “canaries” that “have to die” because of America’s “fantasy of global domination.”  
Falk explains the attacks as justifiable “resistance.” In his words: “The American global domination project is bound to generate all kinds of resistance in the post-colonial world.”

He minimizes the crime and predicts worse if America doesn’t change its ways to better accommodate the demands of “the Islamic world.” As he puts it: “In some respects, the United States has been fortunate not to experience worse blowbacks, and these may yet happen…”.
For years, Falk has been espousing the worst forms of antisemitism from his UN perch, and for his efforts has been rewarded with repeated opportunities by the Council to lecture others on his world view. 
That world view is shared by the 56 member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), who only a week ago at UN Headquarters refused to define terrorism unless an exception clause was created for “legitimate struggle.”
The OIC controls the balance of power at the UN’s top human rights body, by holding majorities in both the African and Asian regional groups. Africa and Asia, in turn, control 26 of the 47 seats on the Council. With the backing of the OIC, therefore, Falk has been encouraged and protected.
The Obama administration has long championed the UN Human Rights Council, which it decided to join as one of its first foreign policy moves in 2009. Thanks to the Obama administration, U.S. began a second three-year term on the Council this past January. At the opening of the Council’s most recent session in March, Assistant Secretary of State Esther Brimmer traveled to Geneva to address what she called “this esteemed body.”
There is nothing about a “human rights” body that countenances the likes of Richard Falk that is “esteemed,” and the United States should resign–effective immediately.

4264	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/05/06/Democrats-Agenda-for-Benghazi-Hearing-Protect-Hillary-at-All-Costs	News	1	Democrat Scandals	International News	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Ahead of Wednesday’s long-awaited hearings at the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about the Benghazi terror attack of Sep. 11, 2012, Democrats have a clear agenda: protect Hillary Clinton at all costs.
Clinton, the former Secretary of State and likely frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, could be severely damaged by testimony about the attacks, which occurred in part because of security lapses for which the State Department is primarily responsible. 


Past testimony about the attacks has also revealed that President Barack Obama did nothing once informed the attacks were under way, and that there was no communication among key members of the administration and military who could have responded.
In her own testimony before Congress in January before leaving office, Clinton was evasive, famously shouting at Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), “What difference does it make?” in reference to the question of who had edited the administration’s talking points to remove references to Islamist terror and emphasize a protest that never happened. 
The media applauded her performance, but her outburst left an impression of apathy about the four Americans who were killed that night in Benghazi, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.

Since the day after the attacks, Democrats and the media have treated Benghazi as an unfair political attack by Republicans, rather than a legitimate national security crisis in its own right. 
Media coverage in the fall focused on Republican Mitt Romney’s response to the attacks, rather than Obama’s actions as commander-in-chief. When questions were raised about whether Obama had lied to the public about the attacks, the media covered Obama’s tracks, with CNN’s Candy Crowley intervening in the second presidential debate to defend the president, and CBS News suppressing damning footage of the president until shortly before the election.
With Obama safely re-elected, the goal is now to protect Hillary Clinton. Last week, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) called upon Speaker of the House John Boehner not only to retract, but to apologize publicly for, an inter-committee report that suggested Clinton had ignored requests for additional security in Libya.
On MSNBC, a channel that serves as the mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, Rev. Al Sharpton–who also serves as an informal White House adviser–described the Benghazi investigation as the “new vast right-wing conspiracy,” a reference to Clinton’s claim, as First Lady, that Republicans were merely out to target her husband and that he had not committed any wrongdoing in the Monica Lewinsky affair that led to his impeachment.
Though there are undoubtedly some political motives present, Democrats’ claims are largely a projection of their own political agenda in Benghazi, which has remained consistent from the start: to shield the party and its leaders from responsibility for a major terrorist attack on American sovereign territory. 

That agenda far exceeds any pursued by Republicans, whose goals, however political, happen to include the national security interests at stake.
On this past weekend’s Sunday shows, Democrats showed unusual willingness to criticize the Obama administration over Benghazi, acknowledging that the Benghazi talking points had been false. 
Yet that willingness to criticize may be a way of inoculating the party against further revelations to come; it may also be easier because new information about the Benghazi talking points has tended to implicate the White House rather than Clinton herself, even if State Department officials have also been listed among those involved.
Clinton’s role in Benghazi is particularly damaging because it risks becoming the signature legacy of her tenure at the State Department. Despite racking up an exhaustive travel record, Clinton had few actual achievements to show for her four years as Secretary of State–a burden as she contemplates her 2016 ambitions.
At least one key witness in Wednesday’s hearing, Mark. I. Thompson, is expected to offer testimony highly damaging to Clinton. He has alleged that Clinton sidelined the State Department’s counter-terrorism operation during the Benghazie attacks: “You should have seen what (Clinton) tried to do to us that night,” he has said, according to Fox News.
Though Democrats seem to have shifted their focus to Clinton’s prospects, Obama himself is not free of the troubles Benghazi presents. Evidence continues to emerge that senior White House officials were directly involved in the manipulation of the Benghazi talking points, suggesting that there had been a deliberate decision to mislead the public. 
Obama has yet to explain his own actions–or inaction–during and after the attack. His activities throughout the evening of Sep. 11 are unknown; he flew to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next day.

A former senior investigator with the State Department’s criminal investigative unit has turned whistleblower and alleged to both the media and Congress that senior staff within State Department covered up investigations into appalling behavior committed by members of Hillary Clinton’s security staff and our ambassador to Belgium. One of those alleged to have interfered was Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s chief of staff. 
The case in which Clinton enforcer Mills allegedly intervened centered upon Brett McGurk, Obama’s nominee to be US ambassador to Iraq. 
McGurk’s expected nomination fell apart after a computer hack exposed his racy e-mails and an extramarital affair with Wall Street Journal reporter Gina Chon.


According to the memo, the SID “never interviewed McGurk, allegedly because Cheryl Mills from the Secretary’s office interceded.”
“Without that interview, SID has been unable to close the case,” the memo concludes.
Mills is a longtime associate of the Clintons, going back to 1992, and was also at the center of the first scandal to hit Hillary’s State Department: Benghazi. Gregory Hicks, the former Deputy Chief of Mission in Libya, testified before Congress that Mills instructed him not to cooperate with the Congressional investigation into the September 11 terror attacks. 

Mills isn’t the only high-ranking official being named. Patrick Kennedy, the Undersecretary of State for Management, is directly accused of killing an investigation into our Ambassador to Belgium, Howard Gutman, who is accused of slipping away from his security detail to solicit sex from minor children. 
Gutman was a big Democratic donor before taking the post, having raised $500,000 for President Obama’s 2008 campaign and helping finance his inaugural. 
* At least seven agents in Clinton’s security detail hired prostitutes while traveling with her in various countries, including Russia and Colombia.
Investigators called the use of prostitutes by Clinton’s security agents “endemic.”
Amid all the other scandals, this latest mess is still picking up some traction in the mainstream media. Here is Chuck Todd’s “Today Show” report:

Speaking in Ireland this week, President Obama stated that Catholic schools were divisive: “If towns remain divided–if Catholics have their schools and buildings and Protestants have theirs, if we can’t see ourselves in one another and fear or resentment are allowed to harden–that too encourages division and discourages cooperation.” On Thursday, the American Catholics for Religious Freedom fired back on President Obama’s words to 2,000 young people at the G8 Summit, stating, “President Obama’s anti-faith, secular agenda was shamefully on full display yesterday when he told the young people of Northern Ireland that Catholic education and other faith-based schools were divisive and an obstacle to peace.  All Americans of faith should be outraged by these comments which clearly telegraph the President’s belief system and are in fact at their core even anti-American.”

American Catholics for Religious Freedom points out that the media has completely ignored the story, and adds, “Secular progressives like President Obama ignore the truth that faith-based education is a component of the Religious Freedom guaranteed by the Constitution.  He can’t bear the thought that Catholic and parochial schools not only teach important values but consistently produce better educational results at lower cost than America’s failing public schools. The President’s troubling values are showing here in a way that demonstrate just how dangerous this Administration is and how committed it is to eroding the rights of all people of faith.”


And, they note, this is the same President who has attempted to cram down anti-Catholic doctrine via Obamacare. “It’s time Americans stood up for Religious Freedom, for the U.S. Constitution and against President Obama’s radical views about the place of faith in American life,” the group concludes.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) will honor former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with this year’s Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center. The award will be presented to Clinton on September 10th, the eve of the first anniversary of the terrorist attack on the United States mission in Benghazi that killed four Americans.
The Christian Science Monitor reports that Bush, a potential GOP contender in the 2016 presidential race, is chairman of the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center located in Philadelphia.  
“Former Secretary Clinton has dedicated her life to serving and engaging people across the world in democracy,” Bush said in a statement. “These efforts as a citizen, an activist, and a leader have earned Secretary Clinton this year’s Liberty Medal.” 


Bush’s decision to honor Clinton, who is considered by some to be a likely Democrat candidate for president in 2016, was condemned by the Independence Hall Tea Party Association of Philadelphia. According to the Christian Science Monitor, the organization released its own statement Monday, referring to the event as “extremely distressing,” and offering, instead, an opportunity for another Liberty Medal recipient. 

According to the statement: 

As all of you undoubtedly know, much of the blame for the Obama Administration’s failure to contain the Benghazi attack and the scandalous handling of its aftermath, can be traced directly to Ms. Clinton. 
Indeed, a Congressional investigation regarding Ms. Clinton’s role in the cover-up of the Administration’s failure is still ongoing. 
A newly formed organization, the Independence Hall Foundation, will hold a “What Difference Does It Make” press conference on Independence Mall, September 10, 4 PM, to denounce the selection of Ms. Clinton as the 2013 Liberty Medal recipient and to offer an alternative award (details below). 
During the conference, the Foundation will name its choice of recipient(s) for the 2013 Defender of Liberty Medal. 
Dom Giordano will headline the presser and we certainly hope you will consider joining us. 
A 5 PM Prayer Vigil for the victims of the Benghazi attack will immediately follow the press conference.  

The National Constitution Center’s announcement, dated June 27th, about the award of the Liberty Medal to Clinton, states: 

As Secretary of State, Clinton advocated for “smart power” in foreign policy, elevating diplomacy and development and repositioning them for the 21st century – with new tools, technologies, and partners, including the private sector and civil society around the world. 

National Constitution Center president and CEO Jeffrey Rosen said, “Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to expanding opportunities for ‘We the People’ not just in this country but around the globe.”  
Upon the announcement of Clinton’s award in June, Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft wrote, “Really Jeb, no one else came to mind?”

When the American mission in Benghazi, Libya was attacked on September 11th, 2012, only one person had the positional authority, legal mandate, and communications apparatus to give the order to defend our personnel on the ground: the President of the United States.
The President did not give that order, and four Americans died in Benghazi that day. All the rest of the nonsense to which we have been treated-from prepared talking points, congressional hearings, and finally to the outright lies-matter not when compared to the ignominious moments in which the President of the United States refused to do his job.
That same day, two other American embassies in the Middle East were also under attack in Sana, Yemen and Cairo, Egypt. As a result, our intelligence systems were on high alert. When the calls, satellite and drone feeds, faxes, and reports began bombarding every command center from Germany to the United States, our nation, already at war for eleven years, was again under siege. Staffs from Africa Command, European Command, the National Military Command Center, the CIA Operations Center, the State Department Operations Center, and the White House Situation Room were fully operational.


This all means that on September 11, 2012, our national security apparatus was on full alert. It means everyone was briefed. This is how it works; no games, no conjecture, no television and movie looks, just real battle in real time with real lives at risk.
The road to that indecision is littered with policy and leadership failures that culminated in an American mission and clandestine CIA base being attacked and the murder of our Ambassador and three dedicated Americans doing their jobs. However, the one person responsible for it all is the one man who could have, but refused to, even try to stop the carnage… the President of the United States.
All the President had to say within the first two hours while being briefed by the Secretary of Defense was, “Send in a response force.” This command, followed by his signature on a paper called Cross Border Authority, would have ordered the Department of Defense to do everything and anything to save lives in Benghazi, Libya. 

Three and a half years earlier, on April 9, 2009, President Obama had done exactly that when pirates hijacked an American flagged merchant ship, Maersk Alabama, sailing off the coast of Somalia. In this earlier incident, the President made the right decision within hours to allow SEAL Team Six the time to plan and go. In the end, we all witnessed a textbook successful rescue operation. 
Fast forward to September 11, 2012, and we have a desperate situation with Americans in jeopardy. The same President, instead of deciding how to respond, disappeared for the evening  and then went to Las Vegas the following day to raise money for his re-election campaign.
Had the President ordered a rescue, he had everything he needed to mount a prompt and forceful response–from F-16’s in Aviano, Italy, to an armed and fueled plane standing by at C Company, 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, training in Croatia-a mere three hours from Benghazi by air. 
When the first shot was fired in Benghazi, no one knew how long the fight would last. Subsequent government claims saying we could not get there within the seven-plus hours that the tragedy lasted are specious at best and an outright lie at worst. We did not even care enough to try; that fact alone should make all Americans who mourn the loss of four of our countrymen very angry.
This ultimate Presidential control–the ability to bring armed American forces to bear anywhere in the world within hours–has existed for over 25 years. It exists precisely because of past mistakes and embarrassing moments brought to us by various governmental agencies, congresses, and presidents.
Since September 11th, 2012, we have been treated to a tractor-trailer load of misdirection, disingenuous speeches, television appearances, and outright lying by public officials at every level of the government of the United States of America. Now with other scandals hitting the news, we are beginning to forget and confuse what is the only important point to know after we acknowledge and pray for the four Americans murdered by terrorists that fateful day.
There is one simple point to be made about Benghazi: the President of the United States is the only human being on the planet that can order a bullet, a missile, a plane, a drone, a boat, a helicopter, a soldier, sailor, spy, or push cart with a squirt gun attached to go into another country and perform an aggressive action.
On September 11, 2012, we know the President failed to give that order. We don’t know where he was, what he was doing, or why he failed to act. But we do know he failed to act, and that inaction cost the lives of four brave Americans.

In an appearance on Face the Nation this morning, Rep. Darrell Issa revealed several new pieces of information about the Obama administration’s controversial description of the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, casting doubt that the White House mischaracterized its cause by mere accident.





“The talking points were right and then the talking points were wrong,” Issa explained in response to a question about reporting at the Weekly Standard. The CIA and Greg Hicks, who took over as Charge d’Affairs in Libya after the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens, both knew immediately that it was an attack, not a protest. 

Hicks, who did not appear on the show but whose reactions were featured based on transcripts of interviews with Issa’s committee, said he was stunned by what UN Ambassador Susan Rice claimed on five different news shows on Sep. 16. When she appeared on Face the Nation, she followed an interview with the President of Libya who claimed he had “no doubt” it was a terror attack. Moments later, Amb. Rice contradicted him and claimed a spontaneous protest was more likely. 
Acting Ambassador Hicks watched the Sunday shows and said he found this contradiction shocking. “The net impact of what has transpired is the spokesperson of the most powerful country in the world has basically said that the President of Libya is either a liar or doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” he accused. Hicks added, “My jaw hit the floor as I watched this…I’ve never been as embarrassed in my life, in my career as on that day.”
Hicks believes the stunning failure of diplomacy on the Sunday news shows explains why ittook the FBI three weeks to gain access to the Benghazi site. The U.S. had effectively humiliated the Libyan President on national TV. That decision, he believed, probably compromised our ability to investigate and track down those responsible. 
According to Hicks, no one from the State Department contacted him about what Amb. Rice would be saying in advance. The next morning he called Beth Jones, Acting Assistant Secretary for Near East Affaris, and asked her why Amb. Rice had made the statements she had. Jones responded, “I don’t know.”
A report published Friday by the Weekly Standard suggests that State Dept. spokesperson Victoria Nuland took issue with the initial talking points and, with backing from the White House, removed any evidence of al Qaeda involvement and of prior attacks on western targets in the region. According to emails reviewed by the Weekly Standard, Nuland said her superiors (unnamed) were concerned about criticism from Congress.

Several members of Congress joined representatives of the special forces military veterans and grassroots organizations on Tuesday to launch an effort to force the House to have a thorough, public investigation into the terrorist attack at Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012.
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) has introduced legislation to create a special select committee to investigate both the terrorist attack and subsequent actions by President Barack Obama’s administration and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department. Wolf’s bill has 161 co-sponsors. House GOP Leadership has not scheduled a vote on the bill. 
Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) plans to harness the support for Wolf’s bill into a “discharge petition” that would force a floor vote on the bill. The petition would need to be signed by 218 members of the House. 


“I’m going to describe what a discharge petition is because a lot of people have asked me questions exactly what it is,” Stockman said at the Tuesday press conference outside the U.S. Capitol building. “It’s to ask our leadership or actually demand from our leadership that we have a vote on Frank Wolf’s bill. [Wolf is] a congressman from Virginia who has a long history of being here and is articulate in demanding that we have an independent investigation.”
Stockman added, while gesturing to blown up photographs behind him of the four Americans murdered in Benghazi, “if Congress is silenced,” then “the blood of these folks behind us is on our hands.”
“We can’t be silent any more,” he said. “It’s been a year going by that we haven’t had justice. These folks demand justice. They cry out for justice. Silence is not an option any more. We’re going to challenge them. We’re going to have a discharge petition. I encourage you to contact your congressman to sign the discharge petition.”  

Stockman expects most or all of the 161 members on Wolf’s bill to support the discharge petition, and at the press conference specifically said House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) is supportive of circumventing House Leadership via the discharge petition.
Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Dick Brauer, the founder of Special Operations Speaks, said the combination of Wolf’s bill and Stockman’s discharge petition “would be done to fully investigate, something that has not been done to date, the national tragedy in Benghazi, where we lost four great citizens in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.”
“You will hear this from me and others today but we need your help and your friends’ help and everybody else’s to make this happen because it’s our one chance to do something before the anniversary of that tragedy which will occur about seven weeks from now,” Brauer said.
At the press conference, Brauer’s group unrolled an enormous scroll of a petition that includes the signatures of about a thousand special forces veterans joining the call for this investigation. “What you see on my left is a one of a kind. I don’t think it’s ever been done before: a four-foot-by-sixty-foot copy of the Special Operations Speaks petition that we sent to the House of Representatives on the Eighth of April asking for this select committee with subpoena power,” Brauer said. “The scroll is signed by nearly 1,000 special operations veterans, from the rank of Lieutenant General Three Stars down to every other rank you can imagine, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, all of them passionate about what we’re trying to do.”
Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), a congressman who supports the discharge petition, said at the press conference that he was asked by a reporter recently about Benghazi: “Gee, that was so long ago. Do we really want to pursue this now?”

“I told the reporter that when I was a judge handling felony cases, I had defendants ask me that question – ‘that was so long ago, do we really need to get into all this now?’ I can tell you when the blood of American patriots cries out, when the blood of individuals who were sent there into harm’s way, knowing how dangerous it was in Benghazi, and especially two former SEALs who were even told to ‘Stand Down’ but they wouldn’t have it,” Gohmert said. “They went to save lives and that’s exactly what they did. They even recruited another State Department man, a former army ranger, to go up there on the rooftop with them. What they knew from the first moment mortars were fired was that this was an organized, well-prepared attack on our people. We need to get to the bottom of it. Their blood cries out for that.”
Former Florida Republican Rep. Allen West concurred with the others there, adding: “If it’s more important to some people in Washington, D.C., to protect President Obama and to protect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I say shame on you. Every single member of the United States House of Representatives should have their name on this discharge petition. If their name is not on that discharge petition, you are complicit in this cover-up of what happened.”
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy said that if the truth is not uncovered in Benghazi, a terrorist attack like it is likely to happen again. “I believe that this is not likely to be an isolated incident,” Gaffney said at the press conference “If we don’t learn the lessons of what happened in Benghazi, how we got to there, what we did on the occasion and what has happened in the aftermath, you can be sure there will be other Americans who end with the same fate.”
Bob Adams, the president and founder of grassroots group Revive America which has been rallying members of Congress behind the calls for a real investigation into Benghazi, placed the blame for the lack of a real investigation at the feet of House GOP leadership.
“When Revive America first joined this fight back in March, only 48 House Republicans had mustered the courage to stand as cosponsors of this bill,” Adams said. “Frankly, the level of support at that time was an embarrassment. But over the next several weeks, after thousands of Americans had deluged Congress with a flood of phone calls, emails and personal visits, support for the House Select Committee soared to what is today 161 cosponsors. That’s over two thirds of all House Republicans.”
“But today only one person really stands in the way of a full and public investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attack in Benghazi. It’s not President Obama. It’s really not even Hillary Rodham Clinton, or Eric Holder. That one person is none other than House Speaker John Boehner.”

As Americans pause today to remember the trauma–and heroism–of September 11, 2001, we have a new reason to commemorate the day: the embassy attacks of September 11, 2012. A year later, there have been no arrests and no responses. Those responsible for neglecting embassy security have been restored, while those who raised concerns are still suffering. And the leaders most responsible pretend nothing happened.
The story of how President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have escaped accountability for what happened in Benghazi, Libya and in Cairo, Egypt a year ago today is one of the great political escapes, and one of the great media scandals, of our history. “What difference does it make?” Clinton railed in January. The difference is profound indeed, both for the dead and the nation as a whole.


The political consequences were decisive. What should have happened is that the media should have asked what President Obama was doing that evening, why he was not in touch with his top national security advisers throughout the evening, why he flew to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next day, why the Secretary denied security to Benghazi, and why her officials were apologetic as crowds stormed the Cairo embassy.

Instead, the media pounced on Mitt Romney’s response late that night, which addressed the Cairo debacle and was issued before the nation knew about the Benghazi deaths. This was to be the latest of Romney’s alleged “gaffes”–none of which were incorrect, and all of which pale in comparison to the incompetence on display a year later in Obama’s response to Syria’s crossing of the chemical weapons “red line.”
Obama and Clinton concocted one of the most audacious lies ever told by an American leader–that the attacks were a reaction to an obscure anti-Islamic video made by a Christian in the U.S. Essentially, he offered fellow Americans to the enemy as scapegoats. When the story unraveled, Obama pretended to have said all along that Benghazi had been a terror attack–another lie, eagerly defended by the media.
Meanwhile, the filmmaker responsible for the video was jailed on an unrelated parole violation–a craven concession to the Muslim Brotherhood–while the terrorists themselves lounged in Libya, secure in the knowledge that Obama was in no rush to pursue them or to deal with the mess that U.S. intervention had left behind. 
The collapse of the U.S. deterrent in Syria today began with Egypt and Libya a year ago.
That, ultimately, is the most important difference that Benghazi made. It showed that America is willing to abandon its own citizens to the barbaric, unabashed violence of our enemies. The culpability goes beyond Obama and extends to the Beltway media and political classes–including those Republicans who resist a full inquiry into the events of September 11, 2012, which ignored the warnings and lessons of the first 9/11.
The consequence is that Americans are less safe–as are people around the world who face the violence of tyrants and terrorists alike. Those who, like President Obama, exhort Americans not to turn away from the children of Syria (despite ignoring children killed there by conventional weapons for over two years) should consider what their own indifference to American lives has contributed to our nation’s new impotence.

4303	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/08/04/Benghazi-Unauthorized-Weapons-Operation-or-Congressional-Cover-Up	News	0	Democrat Scandals	International News	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"
Dozens of CIA operatives were involved in an arms smuggling operation on the ground in Benghazi, Libya during the deadly attack on the U.S. compound last September, reports CNN and the U.K. Telegraph. According to these outlets, the spy agency has gone out of its way to keep the information from the public through intimidation of CIA personnel.  
Four Americans were killed, including U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens that evening in Benghazi almost one year ago. 


In light of this new information, either the Congress’ “Gang of Eight” knew about the operation and misled the public about what they knew, or the Obama administration may have been conducting an unauthorized gun-running operation. Fox News reported in October of 2012 about a Libyan ship, reportedly containing weapons for Syrian Rebels that may have been tied into the attack against the consulate and the CIA annex:

Through shipping records, Fox News has confirmed that the Libyan-flagged vessel Al Entisar, which means “The Victory,” was received in the Turkish port of Iskenderun — 35 miles from the Syrian border — on Sept. 6, just five days before Ambassador Chris Stevens, information management officer Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed during an extended assault by more than 100 Islamist militants. 
On the night of Sept. 11, in what would become his last known public meeting, Stevens met with the Turkish Consul General Ali Sait Akin, and escorted him out of the consulate front gate one hour before the assault began at approximately 9:35 p.m. local time. 
Although what was discussed at the meeting is not public, a source told Fox News that Stevens was in Benghazi to negotiate a weapons transfer, an effort to get SA-7 missiles out of the hands of Libya-based extremists. And although the negotiation said to have taken place may have had nothing to do with the attack on the consulate later that night or the Libyan mystery ship, it could explain why Stevens was travelling in such a volatile region on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. 

According to section 503’s Presidential Approval and Reporting of Covert Actions in the 1947 National Security Act, the President may not authorize covert CIA actions without informing the intelligence committees of Congress.
Legislation implemented in 1980 gave the president the authority to limit advance notification of especially sensitive covert actions to eight Members of Congress–the “Gang of Eight”: the chairmen and ranking minority Members of the two congressional intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House, and Senate majority and minority leaders. These members are: House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA).

By law, such a covert weapons operation in Benghazi should have been known by all eight members. The disastrous results from the events of September 11, 2012 have not made it easy to get answers from these lawmakers regarding this point. 
Many remember when Pelosi, a “Gang of Eight” member, found herself at odds with the Democratic base in 2009 and ridiculed by Republicans, when it was revealed she was actually briefed in 2002 by the Bush White House about the administration’s tactic to water-board terrorism suspects during interrogations. Pelosi denied this fact previously.
Radio host Laura Ingraham asked Boehner on January 24 about Senator Rand Paul’s questioning to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He asked if the secretary was aware of U.S. involvement in the procuring of weapons that were transferred, bought or sold to Turkey out of Libya. Clinton, seemingly confused, told Paul “nobody [had] ever raised” the issue with her before.
Boehner replied to Ingraham, “I’m somewhat familiar with the chatter about this and the fact that these arms were moving towards Turkey, but most of what I know about this came from a classified source and I really can’t elaborate on it.” 
Boehner has refuses to appoint a House Select Committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks and previously refused to support a joint Select Committee to do the same late last year. 

Four members of the “Gang of Eight” have told Breitbart News over the past six months they knew nothing about any CIA operation in Benghazi involving the smuggling of Libyan weapons into Turkey that may have been shipped to Syrian rebels, some of whom were affiliated to al-Qaeda groups.
“I get to see all of that stuff. I have seen nothing that would allow me to conclude that the U.S. government was in any way shape or form involved in gun running in Libya. I looked at it all,” said Congressman Rogers, Chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee to Breitbart News in June.

“If it’s there, I have not seen it. I think I would have found it. I think there were some other things that were happening and people got confused, but the United States government was not running guns (from the annex).”
Senator Chambliss, ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, when asked in February if he knew anything about the gunrunning issue Senator Paul asked Clinton about a month earlier replied to Breitbart News, “I’m not familiar with that.” 
Senator Feinstein, Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Breitbart News in March she “didn’t know what” Senator Paul was talking about in regards to his questioning of Clinton and the Secretary’s knowledge about the gunrunning issue in Benghazi.

Ranking member of the House Intel Committee Rep. Ruppersberger claimed to Breitbart News in May he “didn’t know anything” about U.S. weapons smuggling or if Ambassador Stevens was involved in the operation in anyway, saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Ruppersberger, added, “If I was [privy to such information], I couldn’t talk to you about it. But I have heard no information about what you’re talking about, as far as what [Ambassador Chris Stevens] was there for. I haven’t had briefings on it.”
Ruppersberger also said he knew “nothing about” any U.S. operation to smuggle weapons to Syrian rebels, explaining the secretive “Gang of Eight” briefings from the White House do not go into much detail sometimes.
“I’ve heard nothing about it. When [Stevens] was there. I don’t know. We don’t get to that minutia sometimes. Gang of 8, we get the most sensitive information, that even our own committees can’t [get.] 
When asked if the White House would have had to inform the eight members of such an operation in order for it to be legal Ruppersberger responded, “No. The checks and balances is they give us information–very sensitive information. The check and balance issue,  they don’t have to tell us everything or we’d be sitting having Gang of Eight briefings all day long. That’s the answer. I don’t know.”

On Sunday evening, CBS News’ 60 Minutes featured an investigative report on the Benghazi attacks by Lara Logan. Logan’s reporting confirmed that the Obama administration had been warned, months in advance, about inadequate security at the U.S. facility in Benghazi, and that it knew the story about a YouTube video was untrue. It was a reversal for CBS News, which played a key role in the Benghazi cover-up in 2012.
A year ago, CBS News released a previously unaired clip of an interview for 60 Minutes with President Barack Obama on Sep. 12, the day after the Benghazi attack, in which the president suggests clearly that the attack on the U.S. consulate was premeditated. The interview contradicted Obama’s subsequent claims that the attack had been a response to an anti-Islam YouTube video, repeated to the public for several days.


CBS News had withheld that portion of the Sep. 12 interview until Oct. 19, choosing instead to release a portion in which Obama criticized rival Mitt Romney’s condemnation of the administration’s response to events–a repeated theme as the media helped Obama deflect responsibility. Romney had attacked the White House’s apology for the video during the attack on the Cairo embassy, not knowing of the deaths in Libya.

After the election, Kroft continued to insist that there was “no information that anything’s been covered up” by the media or the Obama administration about the Benghazi attacks. That statement was wrong based on what was known at the time, and looks even worse today, after whistleblowers testified to Congress earlier this year they were pressured by Clinton’s chief of staff not to cooperate with congressional investigators.
Logan’s investigation featured an interview with one of those whistleblowers, Greg Hicks, who had been the deputy to slain U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. Logan also interviewed “Morgan Jones” (pseudonym), a former British soldier who had been advising the U.S. on security in Benghazi and had warned the State Department that Libyan guards being trained to guard the compound were not up to the job.
Morgan’s warnings came to fruition on Sep. 11, 2012, when he saw the guards disperse after being told by the attackers: “We’re here to kill Americans, not Libyans.” Morgan did what little he could to stop the attack. A second attack at the CIA Annex was partly fought off by a small group that saved five American lives and has since, Logan reported, earned “the Distinguished Service Cross and the Navy Cross” for its bravery.
Yet the Obama administration did not send any assistance throughout the night, and is thought to have issued a stand-down order to prevent any intervention. What Logan’s report makes clear is that there is no way that President Obama or his Secretary of State could plausibly claim that a YouTube video had inspired a spontaneous act of violence on that scale against the U.S. consulate, the CIA annex and their personnel.
That story was a lie when it was told–and it was a lie aided and abetted by the mainstream media, including CBS News and 60 Minutes, which could have exploded the administration’s YouTube video alibi even as Obama and Clinton were telling it to the families of the victims, to the voting public, and to the world. The Sunday night report is commendable, but as an attempt to atone for malpractice, it is far too little, too late.

The process for people attempting to enter the country illegally through the Mexican border has often been characterized as grueling, dangerous and even potentially deadly; a trek across smoldering hot deserts led by ruthless ‘coyotes’ who profit from human suffering. 
Meet the new coyotes: immigration attorneys and government rule-writers.


According to the clear guidelines published on the Internet and updated by the Obama administration in mid-June, there’s an easier way to cross to gain entrance to the United States: simply step right up to a border crossing and tell the officials that you have a “crediblee fear” of persecution or torture. Use that exact phrasing and you may be able to enter the USA while you await a hearing before an immigration judge…a process that could take years. 
As Breitbart News reported yesterday in a story that swept through the Internet, that’s exactly what’s been happening recently with a flood of new asylum requests that seem designed to overwhelm the system.

The Obama Department of Homeland Security led by Janet Napolitano updated the information on their article Questions & Answers: Credible Fear Screening on June 18th, 2013. The article explains that if you claim ‘credible fear of persecution or torture’ that you can seek asylum, and that the process is subject to review. 

Individuals Seeking Asylum

If you are in expedited removal proceedings and found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture, you may seek asylum before an Immigration Judge (IJ). (See definition for Credible Fear in the “Glossary” link to the right)

If the asylum officer does not find that you have a credible fear of persecution or torture, you may request that an IJ review that determination. If you do not request review by the IJ or the IJ agrees with the determination, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may remove you from the United States.


It defines with a “credible fear” is:


Q.   What Is a Credible Fear of Torture?

A.   A “significant possibility” that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you would be subject to torture if returned to your country (see definition of Torture in the “Glossary” link to the right).


Elsewhere on the DHS site, the government draws a distinction between a “credible” fear and a “reasonable”fear. The credible fear standard appears to be a lower bar, which is likely why it became the key word used by about 200 people a week ago at the Otay crossing near San Diego.

Q. What is a reasonable fear of persecution?

A. You credibly establish that there is a “reasonable possibility” you would be persecuted in the future on account of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The legal standard is the same standard used to establish a well-founded fear of persecution in an asylum case.

You cannot establish a reasonable fear of persecution based only on past persecution without establishing a “reasonable possibility” of future persecution.  After a reasonable fear of persecution or torture is found, the Immigration Judge will decide if you are eligible for withholding of removal or deferral of removal.  Withholding of removal only provides protection against future persecution and may not be granted without a likelihood of future persecution. However, if you establish past persecution, there is a presumption that your fear of future persecution is reasonable.


The webpage spells out the Catch-22 of the asylum claim: if the asylum officer finds you have a “credible fear,” the next step is a hearing by an immigration judge. However, if the asylum officer does not find you have a “credible fear,” you can then request a appeal hearing by an immigration judge. Either way, you will have a hearing in front of a judge.
This is where the fun begins, because you will wait for your hearing in the United States under some sort of bond. Effectively, you are free to roam about the country for years. This “credible fear” tactic was used by Lizbeth Mateo, Lulu Martinez and the others in the Dream 9 group of illegal alien activists to gain reentry into the Unites States last week. 

As the Los Angeles Times reported:

The protest took root in July when Marco Saavedra of New York, Lizbeth Mateo of Los Angeles and Lulu Martinez of Chicago — all young adults brought into the U.S. illegally as children — voluntarily crossed the border into Mexico as a protest of the administration’s deportation policies. They tried to reenter the U.S. on July 22 with six other dreamers who also had been brought to this country illegally as children but had returned to Mexico more than a year ago for various reasons.


 The Times points out the claim that the Dream 9 are making that pushes the legal envelope:

A person seeking asylum must establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on “that he or she belongs to a race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” according to Citizenship and Immigration Services guidelines.

Some of the Dream 9 are petitioning for asylum, saying that they have family members who have been killed and face death threats themselves.

However, many in the Dream 9 claim they should be granted asylum because they belong to a particular group of people — that they are singled out and persecuted in Mexico because they have lived most of their lives in the U.S. They could become targets for criminal organizations that see them as easy prey for extortion and violence, they claim.


It bears repeating: some in the Dream 9 are claiming that they fear persecution in Mexico because they spent time in the United States as illegal aliens. They are prepared to argue that illegal aliens are are a particular social group that is due asylum consideration for having been illegal aliens.

It’s such an outlandish argument that it’s one only a lawyer could love, but it will be years until an immigration judge hears it. In the meantime, Dream 9 activist Lizbeth Matter remains in the United States and begins her first day of law school at Santa Clara University today.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) is the unsung heroine of the foreign policy debates of the past few months. A Tea Party candidate who was elected in the 2010 wave, Ayotte has been one of the most reliable voices on the Benghazi attacks, the Hagel nomination, and the prosecution of terrorists. She has worked with Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC)–without joining their withering attacks on the party’s libertarian wing.
In the Hagel confirmation process, though much of the mainstream media’s attention focused on the aggressive questioning by McCain, Graham, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), it was Ayotte’s line of questioning that was most effective in exposing Hagel’s position on Iran, which is the most pressing national security challenge the nation faces at the moment. Ayotte eschewed theatrics and flash for patient and yet penetrating questions.


In one particularly revealing exchange, Ayotte pinned Hagel down on his opposition to a “military option” on Iran:


Ayotte: Can you help me understand, when you went to Islamabad, Pakistan in 2006, you said at that time that a military strike against Iran, an military option, is not a “viable, feasible or responsible option.” And it strikes me that what you’re saying about the military option now and even–it seems inconsistent with that statement. And why would you make that statement in Pakistan that it’s not a “viable, feasible or responsible option” in light of your statement today that you do, I have, and I strongly agree that a military option should be on the table?
Hagel : That statement was made in a context of all options regarding Iran. And Pakistan was where I was at the time. And the larger context of that was nuclear powers, which certainly Pakistan is part of that club. And not unlike what Secretary Gates said about a strike on Iran, my point was that this would not be a preferable option. There would be consequences to this option. Things would happen as a result of it. If we could find a better option, a better way to deal with Iran to assure they do not get nuclear weapons, then we’re far better off. That was the context of that statement.
Ayotte: Senator Hagel, I know that my time is up and I know we’ll have an opportunity for a second round of questions, but as I see your quote it didn’t say “preferable option;” it said, was not a responsible option.

During the debate over UN Ambassador Susan Rice’s potential candidacy as Secretary of State, Ayotte joined McCain and Graham in stressing their objections to Rice over her role in spreading the story that the Benghazi terror attack on Sep. 11, 2012 had been a protest over an anti-Islam video. In an effort to characterize opposition to Rice as racist and sexist, the president and his party pointedly ignored Ayotte’s role in the debate.
Ayotte refused to take the bait, remaining focused on the issues at hand. Her remarks after a meeting with Rice–“I want to say that I’m more troubled today”–marked a turning point, after which Democrats knew that Rice’s candidacy would be a losing proposition. 
In her remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference this morning, Ayotte touched on foreign policy but returned to the domestic issues that were the theme of her election campaign in 2010: 

Let me tell you about some of the things that keep me up at night. Too many Americans are out of work. Federal regulations are strangling businesses. Obamacare is increasing health care costs and stopping so many of those businesses from hiring. And I come from a small business family. I know what that’s like. How hard the small businesses work. We have a broken tax code and the president and Senate Democrats, they just want to keep increasing taxes, making it harder and harder, for our small businesses to hire and grow and put people to work in this country. Our nation is drowning in debt. We have had four straight years of trillion dollar deficits.

In 2012, Ayotte was considered a long-shot contender to be Mitt Romney’s running mate. While that may have been premature, it likely portends Ayotte’s future. She is one of the few conservatives who is fluent in both the Tea Party’s constitutionalism and the hawkish policy prescriptions of the national security wing of the Republican Party.

4376	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/10/The-Hill-Tries-to-Smear-Ted-Cruz-on-Syria	Opinion	1	Elections	International News	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"

On Tuesday, The Hill published an article suggesting that Sen. Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of Obama’s plan for military action in Syria, had shifted his position on the conflict with an eye towards running for President in 2016. The article, by Alexandra Jaffe, insinuates that Cruz has abandoned his previous hawkish views for one that better positions him to contest the GOP nomination. It is a complete misreading of Cruz’s consistent views on the issue. 
To build her argument, Jaffe points to a line Sen. Cruz said on the Senate floor back in June:
“We need to be developing right now a clear, practical plan to go in, locate the weapons, secure or destroy them, and then get out. The United States should be firmly in the lead to make sure the job is done right,” Cruz said.


That is not what President Obama is proposing. Obama has called for a “limited,” or in the words of John Kerry “unbelievably small”, military strike with the intention of “punishing” Syrian strong-man Bashar Assad to deter him from using chemical weapons again. Obama’s planned strike would try to “degrade” Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons in the future. 

If Obama’s strike were executed, the Syrian regime would still possess stockpiles of chemical weapons. They would still be vulnerable to seizure by the al-Qaeda-backed terrorists who make up the bulk of Syrian rebels opposing Assad. Obama’s action could even weaken the Assad regime to the point that terrorists in the rebel forces had easier access to these weapons. 
Cruz’s position on Syria has always been predicated on keeping these weapons out of the hands of terrorists. In an interview on the Sean Hannity show in late August, Cruz said:

With 9 major rebel groups, 7 of them may well have some significant ties to Al Qaida. If Assad is toppled and replaced by a radical Islamist regime, what would be truly dangerous for the United States, for our allies like Israel and Jordan, is for a radical Islamic government to seize control of those chemical weapons and to deploy them against us or our allies. That should be the focus of the President, and as we’ve seen throughout the Middle East that has not been the focus of the President. 

And:

[O]ur concern should be those chemical weapons, preventing them from falling into the hands of Hezbollah, preventing them from falling into the hands of Al Qaida, that should be guiding our actions, not expressing some moral outrage from a university facility lounge.

This week, in The Washington Post, Cruz spelled out a situation wherein he would support military action:

Should we in the future have intelligence that al-Qaeda or Hezbollah is on the verge of acquiring chemical weapons or that Iran is nearing a nuclear breakout, I would support aggressive military action to prevent them from acquiring those weapons because the alternative is unacceptable.

The Hill article would have been more correct if it had detailed Cruz’s consistency on Syria, notwithstanding the political calculus of a potential run for President in 2016. That story, however, would hardly be worth Jaffe hitting her keyboard. While Obama’s foreign policy lies tattered, more useful for her to parse the words of Republicans and pull things out of context.

4400	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/14/New-Report-Scales-Back-Global-Warming	News	0	Environment	International News	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

On September 27, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will release part of their fifth assessment report on climate change. For the first time since 1990, this report will scale back the hysteria on global warming.
Matt Ridley at The Wall Street Journal viewed a few leaks from the 31-page document and talked to one of the senior climate scientists. The temperature rise due to man-made carbon dioxide is lower than their prediction in 2007. Originally a three degrees Celsius increase was predicted, but that number is now expected to be between 1-2.5 degrees Celsius. 

Specifically, the draft report says that “equilibrium climate sensitivity” (ECS)–eventual warming induced by a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which takes hundreds of years to occur–is “extremely likely” to be above 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), “likely” to be above 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and “very likely” to be below 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit). In 2007, the IPPC said it was “likely” to be above 2 degrees Celsius and “very likely” to be above 1.5 degrees, with no upper limit. Since “extremely” and “very” have specific and different statistical meanings here, comparison is difficult. 
Most experts believe that warming of less than 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels will result in no net economic and ecological damage. Therefore, the new report is effectively saying (based on the middle of the range of the IPCC’s emissions scenarios) that there is a better than 50-50 chance that by 2083, the benefits of climate change will still outweigh the harm. 
Warming of up to 1.2 degrees Celsius over the next 70 years (0.8 degrees have already occurred), most of which is predicted to happen in cold areas in winter and at night, would extend the range of farming further north, improve crop yields, slightly increase rainfall (especially in arid areas), enhance forest growth and cut winter deaths (which far exceed summer deaths in most places). Increased carbon dioxide levels also have caused and will continue to cause an increase in the growth rates of crops and the greening of the Earth–because plants grow faster and need less water when carbon dioxide concentrations are higher. 

Ridley pointed out that many papers in the last year have come to this same conclusion. Scientists at the University of Illinois and Oslo University in Norway found the ECS levels would be lower than the models showed. Three papers followed, including one produced by 14 lead authors of the IPCC report, that backed the evidence. Francis Zwiers and others at the university of Victoria, British Columbia found that global warming was overestimated by 100% over 20 years.

In a display of utter political incoherence, President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocates in Russia while visiting the Kremlin, even as he attempts to lobby Russian President Vladimir Putin for support on an international military action against Syria. Russian opposition to American intervention in Syria has been a major factor in Obama’s decision to seek approval from Congress for military action in Syria. On Saturday, Obama blasted the UN Security Council, a veiled reference to Russia, by calling it “completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold [Syrian President Bashar] Assad accountable.”
While in Moscow, Obama plans to meet with human rights activists Lev Ponomarev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, legal aid non-governmental-organization director Pavel Chikov, and Coming Out.


Russia and the United States have been at odds over myriad issues over the past few months, including Russia’s grant of asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden, Russia’s law against “gay propaganda,” and Russia’s Middle Eastern policy in support of Iran and Syria.

President Obama’s language has become markedly dismissive of Putin and Russia; in a recent press conference, Obama characterized Putin as demonstrating the body language of a “bored kid in the back of a classroom.” That language was said to have infuriated the notoriously prickly Putin. During that same press conference, Obama said, “One of the things I’m really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we’re seeing there.”
The White House website brags about Obama’s stellar relationship with Russian leadership: “In one of his earliest new foreign policy initiatives, President Obama sought to reset relations with Russia and reverse what he called a ‘dangerous drift’ in this important bilateral relationship.”

This week more than 100 human rights and other groups from around the world signed a joint statement supporting the new Russian law banning gay propaganda aimed at school children. 
The signers are “highly concerned about the heavy attacks that the Russian Federation is facing due to its recent Federal Law…that protects innocence and moral formation of children…”


The signers cite the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the family is the fundamental unit of society and “is entitled to protection by society and State.” 
They assert the new Russian law “protects the innocence of children and the basic rights of their parents recognized in international legislation and treaties.”  They also note that the concepts of “sexual orientation and gender identity” are not outlined in the existing binding international treaties and agreements.
Organizations signing the statement come mostly from Europe, but also from the United States and Latin America. Most consider themselves human rights organizations focused on the rights of children and the family. 

The statement and large number of signatories challenges the assertion made by gay activists in the United States that the West stands united against the new Russian law. 
At the same time that the new statement was released, the Washington Post reports on how the “Russian law isolates gay teenagers.”  
Reporter Kathy Lally tells the story of 16-year-old Maxim of Moscow who came out publically as gay at 13-years-old. He says his classmates called him names and that a teacher tried to cut his “longish hair.” A 15 year-old-girl who says she is a lesbian was picked on in her class and then berated when she came out to her mother. 
Advocates claim the new law puts these children in further danger since they cannot seek help from adults who could be fined for helping them. Advocates define help in only one way, helping these children continue with the notion they are gay and always will be.  But is that the case?
The boy Maxim tells the reporter that he “didn’t become gay. I was born gay.” Someone must have taught him that. An adult taught him that.  A child does not come to such a dubious conclusion by himself. 

Dr. Paul McHugh, former long-time chief of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and an emeritus professor there now, tells a different story in an important friend-of-the-court brief he submitted in the Proposition 8/DOMA cases before the US Supreme Court. 
From his own professional experience and from the scientific literature he concludes that “sexual orientation is not immutable” and is “not solely an accident of birth.” Further he says that “sexual orientation can and often does change over time.” He also makes the case that “social science experts raise serious doubts about the definability of sexual orientation.”

McHugh’s brief quotes academics friendly to gay rights. Lisa Diamond, writing in Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, says, “There is currently no scientific or popular consensus…that definitively ‘qualify’ an individual as lesbian, gay or bisexual.”
Gail S. Bernstein, who has clinical faculty appointments at the University of Denver School of Professional Psychology and the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, writes, “Much of the confusion about sexual orientation occurs because there is no single agreed upon definition of the term…there is not one universally accepted definition of sexual orientation, nor who is bisexual, lesbian or gay.”
What about immutability, the thought that someone put in Maxim’s head that he was born gay?

Letitia Anne Peplau and Linda D. Garnets, writing in the Journal of Social Issues, “Although additional research will fill in gaps in our knowledge, there is no reason to expect that biological factors play anything other than a minor and probably indirect role in women’s sexual orientation.” Rather there is “substantial indirect evidence in support of socialization model at the individual level.”
McHugh and others point out that if genetics were the cause of homosexuality then identical twins would always share the same sexual orientation as they always share the same eye color.  In fact, only roughly 30% of identical twins share a gay orientation, according to Kenneth Kendler’s paper in the American Journal of Psychiatry.  
McHugh cites a plethora of academic research concluding that, “…sexual orientation is influenced by a variety of factors beyond genetics or biology alone.” 
And the most recent statement from the American Psychiatric Association concludes, “Currently there is renewed interest in searching for biological etiologies for homosexuality. However, to date there are no replicated studies supporting any specific biological etiology for homosexuality.”
And what about permanence? Is homosexuality life-long? Once you discover your same-sex desire, does it never change? I am not talking here about therapy to alleviate unwanted same-sex attraction. Rather, academic research shows that quite separate from any such outside influence, that homosexuality is remarkably plastic.
Writing in the Journal of Social Issues, Lisa Diamond and Ritch Savin-Williams write, “Contrary to the notion that most sexual minorities undergo a one time discovery of their true identities, 50% of respondents had changed their identity label more than once since first relinquishing their heterosexual identity.”  
Writing in Developmental Psychology Lisa Diamond found “Half of the young women…relinquished the first sexual-minority they adopted.” In fact, a “10-year study of 79 non-heterosexual women reported that 67% changed their identity at least once and 36% changed their identity more than once.”
So, who is supposed to be talking to Maxim about such a complicated and thorny issue? Should it be gay advocates who have an ax to grind? Certainly, they would like to increase their tribe. And often they do this using phony science that says homosexuality is inborn and never changing.
The Russian people, supported by 100 human rights and other groups from around the world, have determined that such unscientific ideologues should be kept out of schools and out of sight of school children, and that the proper teacher for Maxim and others like him are those who love him most, his family.
Finally there is the question of the certitude of 16-year-olds. They are absolutely certain about a great many things. All of us were certain of things at 16 that seem crazy to us now. But, we grow and we change a great many things in our lives.
No doubt buoyed by sketchy adult advice, young Maxim is certain he wants to be with men and that he always will. But science shows that this question is vastly more complicated than that. Like all young people, Maxim deserves space to grow and learn and change and to be free from ideologies that may not have his best interests in mind.

Gilberton, PA, Police Chief Mark Kessler was suspended after posting videos of himself shooting borough-owned automatic weapons and shouting obscenities about liberal attacks on the Second Amendment. And heading into the August 30 Gilberton Borough Council meeting–where he is expected to learn his professional fate–Kessler makes it clear he is willing to lose his job for the Second Amendment.
As time draws closer to the council meeting that could end his police career, Kessler says: “The support has been overwhelming, both national and international. I find it truly amazing how many people finally say, ‘You know what? This guy’s right.'”
In one of the video’s Kessler posted, he stands with an ‘assault rifle’ slung over his shoulder and reads a few pre-scripted words about Secretary of State John Kerry’s support of the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty–the treaty which undermines the Second Amendment by giving the international body ruling authority over small arms in the U.S. 


Here’s what Kessler says in the video: “They’re at it again. They just don’t know when to quit. …Kerry says, ‘U.S. will sign U.N. treaty on arms regulations despite lawmaker’s opposition.'” Kessler then looks right into the camera and says, “Secretary of State of John Kerry, that piece of shit…who is he to decide what we can and can’t own? And fuck the U.N. Who are they to decide what we, the American people, can own?”

Kessler then adds: “I have a message to Kerry and to these $%#@suckers in the U.N., ….sign anything you want to sign, it’s not going to mean shit. It [doesn’t] mean shit to me.”
Kessler then screams the Gonzales battle cry, “Come and take it!” and turns away from the camera and opens full-auto fire into the hillside right behind him.
The man loves freedom and he does not want an international body taking it away by degrees. He says that if he loses his job for standing up for the Second Amendment he is “willing to pay that price.”

In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama promised that he would “eliminate North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.” His campaign manifesto, Change We Can Believe In, described Obama’s North Korea policy, and the philosophy behind it, in great detail:

North Korea is an example where direct, tough diplomacy that lays out clear choices to rogue regimes for good and bad behavior can lead to change. When the United States was engaged, the pace of Pyongyang’s development of nuclear weapons was slowed; when we were not, it quickened. While there has been some promising progress, it’s important that all of North Korea’s claims are verified. If they are not, we should move quickly to reimpose sanctions that have been waived, and consider new restrictions going forward. As President, Barack Obama will work with diligence and determination with our friends and allied to end the threat of North Korea and to secure a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.

Obama’s pledge to use “tough diplomacy” to “end the threat of North Korea” followed his infamous pledge during a Democratic presidential primary debate in 2007 that he would meet the leaders of rogue regimes like North Korea “without preconditions.”


That thinking matches the pseudo-realist view expressed repeatedly by Obama’s new nominee for Secretary of Defense, former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE)–that the danger of regimes such as Iran and North Korea is amplified by, or even caused by, U.S. failure to “engage.” Obama’s extreme self-confidence emboldened his campaign promise not just to contain North Korea, but to convince it to abandon nuclear weapons entirely.

Obama did not just leave such talk on the campaign trail. In his 2010 State of the Union address, Obama boasted of the success of his policy on North Korea: 


Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That’s why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions–sanctions that are being vigorously enforced. 

He repeated the North Korea boast in his 2011 State of the Union address:

Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before.  And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons.  (Applause.)

Yet today, on the day he is to give the first State of the Union address of his second term, North Korea has tested a nuclear bomb. Not only has Obama failed to “eliminate” the North Korean nuclear weapons program; he has also failed to discourage or deter it.
So much for “tough diplomacy” from the Obama administration.

Partisan loyalty trumped pro-Israel policy as Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) announced, over the objection of many of his constituents, that he would support the nomination of former Sen Chuck Hagel (R-NE) as Secretary of Defense today. Pro-Israel Democrats in the Senate majority who might have voted against Hagel, are now likely to support him in the wake of Schumer’s decision, making Hagel’s confirmation all but certain.
Even as pro-Israel advocates mobilized against Hagel’s appointment, the White House has worked hard behind the scenes to shore up his support. Yesterday, Hagel delivered a letter to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in which he expressed regret for his controversial comments about a “Jewish lobby” (though, as with an anti-gay remark in 1998, Hagel made the apologetic gesture to a third party, not to the target of his offensive comment).
Schumer’s announcement coincides with a long essay by Arianna Huffington in today’s Huffington Post in which she describes Hagel as a “neoconservative nightmare” and attempts to debunk criticisms of his candidacy. As with other defenses of Hagel, the Huffington post article does not make the case for Hagel–whose focus was foreign affairs, not defense, in his Senate days–but rather argues against Hagel’s opponents.


For example, Huffington attempts to dismiss concerns about Hagel’s temperament, calling them a “modern-day male version of the old dig that used to be directed at women.” Yet President Barack Obama himself made John McCain’s “temperament” an issue in the 2008 campaign–even mentioning it in his nomination acceptance speech–and Democrats rejected UN Ambassador John Bolton based on “temperament” concerns.

Huffington makes clear that the primary reason that President Obama nominated Hagel, and that Democrats are willing to overlook his anti-abortion, anti-climate change views, is that Hagel emerged as a potent critic of the Iraq War. Like many on the left, Hagel also has expressed the view that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the “core” of Middle East turmoil, and now supports defense cuts that he once warned strongly against.
Hagel’s supporters have been at great pains (even to the point of concocting outright lies) to defend him against charges of antisemitism–charges prompted by his poor record on Israel and his statement that members of Congress were “intimidated” by the so-called “Jewish lobby.” More than a poor choice of words, his critics argue, Hagel’s statement reflects a particular animus towards Israel and its political supporters.
The 2006 speech on the Senate floor in which Hagel called for a more even-handed approach to Israel and the Arab world is a case in point. Hagel’s words came at a time when Israeli civilians were under attack by Iranian-backed Hebollah, and Israel was isolated at the United Nations. Hagel’s premature call for an immediate cease-fire would have prevented Israel from responding to the threat–and sent a message of opposition.
Other critics, such as Alan Dershowitz, have focused less on Hagel’s position on Israel or his statement about a “Jewish lobby” and have instead questioned his policy towards Iran. Hagel has not only opposed military action to stop the Iranian nuclear program; he has also, at times, opposed sanctions. His appointment as Secretary of Defense sends a signal that the United States is not serious about countering the Iranian nuclear threat.
Huffington’s article barely mentions Iran, but does attempt to deal with another serious problem in Hagel’s record: namely, his staunch opposition to the surge in Iraq, which Hagel predicted would fail. Not only does Huffington defend Hagel’s position, but she even attempts to claim he was right: “Since then it’s become accepted gospel in Washington that the surge was successful. Accepted gospel that is, once again, wrong.”
Hagel’s supporters are not concerned about the facts of the surge, or whether Hagel is qualified for the job. What they want is a weakened Department of Defense, and with the appointment of an anti-war war veteran, they have one. Hagel’s opponents have not given up, but Schumer’s defection from the pro-Israel cause, and the willingness of gay advocates and green activists to overlook Hagel’s contrary past, have virtually sealed the win.

Pew Research released a poll today that should give the White House cause for concern as the days tick by before Senator Chuck Hagel’s senate confirmation vote to become Defense Secretary. The more the public gets to know Hagel, the less they like him. Over the course of a month, as public awareness increased, Hagel’s favorables increased a mere four points, from 18 to 22, while his unfavorables jumped from 17 to 28 points. 
The pressure isn’t letting up, either. Today, Senator Lindsey Grahem sent a letter to Hagel asking for clarification on another round of controversial comments supposedly attached to the nominee:
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) sent a letter to Chuck Hagel today, asking whether he had made the reported comments (or anything like them) that “Israel has violated every UN resolution since 1967, that Israel has violated its agreements with the quartet, that it was risking becoming an apartheid state if it didn’t allow the Palestinians to form a state, … that the settlements were getting close to the point where a contiguous Palestinian state would be impossible …  that Netanyahu was a radical … [and] that Hamas has to be brought in to any peace negotiation.” Moreover, Graham by no means has given up on seeking the financial information Hagel so far has refused to provide.


There’s another development today in the great state of Nebraska. The University of Nebraska-Omaha is refusing to release Senator Hagel’s archives to the media. According to the Weekly Standard, Hagel stands by the university’s decision to keep sealed thousands of his papers, audio, video and transcripts of speeches: 
Chuck Hagel’s record in the Senate is well documented in the public domain,” says Hagel spokesman Marie Harf in an emailed statement.
“Given his extraordinary disclosures to date, which surpass the threshold applied to nominees, there is no need to make this archived material public.”

The archives are not open to the public, university officials say, because not everything there has been processed.
However, the university has also said that with Hagel’s permission, they would grant the Weekly Standard’s Daniel Halper access to the archive.
Thus far, Hagel is refusing that permission.

Yesterday was a red letter day–or perhaps it should be called an Islamic green letter one–for U.S. intelligence. For the first time I can recall, the top legislator on a congressional oversight committee actually made clear what motivates our enemies in what used to be called euphemistically the “War on Terror,” and what Team Obama now dubs even more opaquely as the effort to “counter violent extremism.” 
This breakthrough came in the course of a joint appearance on CNN’s State of the Union by the chairpersons of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), respectively. The media seized on the ostensibly big news from their remarks: bipartisan agreement that the United States is at greater risk of terrorist attack today than two years ago.  


But important, ominous, and accurate as that assessment is, it was not the most important point made by these two respected lawmakers. Instead, it was Sen. Feinstein’s observation in response to a question about what causes the “hatred” that makes our situation more perilous: 

There is a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist jihadist Islamic community, and that is that the West is responsible for everything that goes wrong and that the only thing that’s going to solve this is Islamic shariah law.
What makes this incontrovertible statement so noteworthy? It is the fact that the intelligence community is not allowed to say it. Under Obama administration guidelines, for intelligence officers-and for that matter, law enforcement, Homeland Security and military personnel-to talk about Islamic jihadism and shariah as the motivation for terrorism can be a career-ending offense.  
For example, on May 10, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, used a press conference to denounce a highly decorated and up-and-coming Army officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Dooley, for teaching an elective course at the Joint Forces Staff College using approved curriculum. According to Gen. Dempsey, what prompted this extraordinary action was that a student–who it turns out, had not actually been enrolled in Col. Dooley’s class–“was concerned that the course was objectionable and that it was counter to our values …our appreciation for religious freedom and cultural awareness. And the young man who brought it to my attention was absolutely right. It’s totally objectionable.”
At the core of what was so “totally objectionable” is the fact that students were exposed to information that made plain the gravity of the threat of which Sen. Feinstein warned: the supremacist, totalitarian Islamic doctrine of shariah and the jihad or holy war it obliges adherents to perform. Col. Dooley’s promising career was cut short and the files of his institution and that of the rest of the national security community have been purged of all such information deemed by unidentified “experts” engaged for the purpose to be “counter to our values.”
Sen. Feinstein’s forthright declaration is particularly gratifying as I had an opportunity to discuss the danger posed by shariah with her in the course of testimony I provided the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 24, 2013 at the invitation of her colleague, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). In the course of making the case for keeping the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open, I observed:
We have been obliged to go to war because it was thrust upon us. And, if we are to prevail in this conflict, we must understand the nature of the enemies with whom we are at war. They are shariah-adherent jihadists who believe, in accordance with that doctrine, that it is God’s will that they destroy our way of life and subjugate us to theirs.
At the time, Sen. Feinstein strongly disagreed with my view that shariah’s dictates make it impossible to safely release its adherents from Gitmo or, alternatively, to incarcerate them in this country instead–where they might exploit rights foolishly conferred upon them to secure their freedom and wage jihad here. I hope that the clarity she expressed Sunday about the inexorable nature of the shariah doctrine and the supremacist hatred it impels will cause the senior senator from California to insist that such insights are once again inculcated in those responsible for our security and to reconsider her support for closing Guantanamo Bay.

4557	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/02/20/Benghazi-Survivors-Remained-Gagged-By-Federal-Law	Opinion	1	National Security	International News	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"

Many continue to ask why the media and lawmakers have not spoken to or brought forth those who survived the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi last September. The truth of the matter is the Americans who survived that attack cannot legally reveal to members of the press or most lawmakers that they were even witnesses to the attack in Benghazi.
According to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, immediately following the attack, the FBI, as part of the agency’s investigation, interviewed survivors of the Benghazi attack.
Bill Bransford, a Washington, D.C. attorney at Shaw Bransford & Roth P.C. who specializes in federal employment law told Breitbart News on Tuesday, “First of all, I’m assuming that most of these people who witnessed the attack, except for the State Department folks, would be intelligence people, and they are not covered by the whistle blower protection laws.”


Bransford added, “They are covered by whatever policies their agency has. An executive order that President Obama issued in the late fall in which he ordered the intelligence community to come up with a more effective whistle blower protection system, which has not yet been developed.”
However, as federal employees, State Department personnel must sign non-disclosure agreements. Bransford stressed, “If somebody violates one of these non-disclosure agreements, the consequences could include: interfering with a criminal investigation, obstruction of justice, criminal charges for releasing classified information, and those are pretty serious.”
Serious indeed. The Obama administration’s Justice Department has prosecuted more federal employees for leaking information to the press under the 1917 Espionage Act than all other administrations combined. Bloomberg News reported last September:


Lowell, the Washington defense lawyer who has counted as his clients the likes of Jack Abramoff, the former Washington lobbyist, and political figures including former presidential candidate John Edwards, said the Obama administration is using the Espionage Act “like a club” against government employees accused of leaks.
The prosecutions, which Obama and the Justice Department have defended on national security grounds, mean that government officials who speak to the media can face financial and professional ruin as they spend years fighting for their reputations, and, in some cases, their freedom.

Since Breitbart News first broke in December that the Obama administration was hiding Benghazi attack survivors, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) began demanding the FBI hand over to Congress the interviews the agency conducted with individuals who survived the deadly attack.
Senator Graham spoke to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday last weekend about his frustration regarding the issue:

WALLACE: Senator, let me pick up on one of them I find, frankly, quite astonishing. What is the administration’s explanation for the fact the FBI interviewed the survivors, all the Americans who safely got out of Benghazi, right after the attack, months ago, and that they refused to give the transcripts of the interviews to Congress. What’s their explanation for that?
GRAHAM: This is an ongoing criminal investigation is what they told me. We are going back to the law enforcement model, where we’re treating al Qaeda as sort of a mafia, common criminal element rather than enemy combatants.
And here’s what was really stunning, the FBI interviewed the survivors, two days after the attack in Germany and, the CIA never called the FBI for weeks, wanting the results of the interview before they made their assessments — we are going back to the pre-9/11 mentality of — where we treat it as a law enforcement function, and FBI and the CIA never talk to each other, which is very dangerous.
Benghazi was system failure, before, during and after.

Clinton testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January that there were about 25 to 30 survivors and she only spoke to one. Many of the individuals who worked at the U.S. compound were either CIA or State Department employees.
Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is not only heavily guarded on the outside but on the inside as well, some say. In December 2012, visitors to the amputee ward at the NNMMC (Bethesda Hospital) observed what appeared to be Secret Service personnel moving in and out of a closed wing of the floor that was off-limits to everyone else.

According to Fox News, former Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of State, visited Benghazi survivors at Walter Reed on February 4th. Fox News host Greta Van Susteren asked Senator Graham about Kerry’s visit.

I’ve been asking in November, we wrote to the president. The person I blame above all others is President Obama, did you know president Obama, in April or June why wasn’t the Congress informed. They were interviewed two days by the FBI you know the CIA never called up the FBI and say, what did they say about the attack. If you talk to the survivors, you would have known it was a coordinated terrorist attack and not a mob.

Bransford points out that, to the extent that these potential witnesses are State Department employees, they are governed by the whistle blower protection act as modified by the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, which just went into effect six weeks ago. According to Bransford, it does have a provision in it about non-disclosure agreements, but that some of the changes may not yet be in effect because the law is so new and the employee is supposed to be aware of the non-disclosure policies.

For example, it would be consistent with the law on classified information and what they’re allowed to tell Congress. That’s an area that’s kind of brand new and it would only apply to the non-intelligence people–like diplomatic security agents. The FBI probably interviewed them.
It is customary and probably consistent with valid non-disclosure policy to tell somebody who is a witness in an ongoing criminal investigation, which of course the FBI is there, so it’s criminal and counter-terrorism, to tell (witnesses) they are not to discuss the substance of the interview or what they discussed with the investigating agents with anyone. And that would be consistent with a valid non-disclosure policy. So, at this stage, to get (Benghazi survivors) to talk might be tough.

Is there any recourse for Benghazi survivors to ever tell their stories? Certain members of Congress who are authorized to receive information of an ongoing FBI investigation may be these individuals’ only outlets to do so.
He added, “Does that mean that they can’t release it later? Maybe. Meaning there could be some political stuff going on to try and get that information but I’m not sure what’s going to happen with that.”
Senator Charles Grassley (R – IA), the co-author of the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act sent a statement to Breitbart News on the law:

Unfortunately, whistleblower protection laws are necessary. We’ve seen far too many people who are shunned to a corner, or worse, for simply trying to do the right thing by exposing wrongdoing within the federal government. The Whistleblower Protection Act allows a federal employee to come to Congress, or others as designated by Congress, and provide information about wrongdoing, including waste, fraud and abuse of government programs. There are additional protections for whistleblowers who come forward to Congress, such as the Lloyd-Lafollette Act and the Anti-Gag statute. By coming to a member of Congress, we can create a formal record of the protected correspondence between the member and the whistleblower which should serve as a reminder to the federal agency that actions of retaliation are against the law.

Obama spokesman Jay Carney said the White House is “extremely disappointed” that Russia granted Edward Snowden asylum. Early this morning, Snowden left the Moscow airport after he was granted temporary asylum by Russia. 
Carney also stated that Snowden isn’t a whistleblower or a dissident and described the situation as ‘not a positive development’ for U.S.-Russia relations. The move undermines Russia’s record of law enforcement cooperation with the U.S.
The White House is considering cancelling a planned fall summit between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 



“We are extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and private that Mr. Snowden be expelled and returned to the United States,” said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

Moscow did not give any advanced notice to the White House before they announced their decision to grant a one year, temporary asylum request to Snowden. Relations between the US are already strained because of differences regarding the war in Syria, but Putin did say the request was granted contingent upon Snowden refraining from hurting U.S. interests.

This “disappointment” is a switch from Obama’s cavalier attitude toward Snowden when the leaks were first brought to light. Initially, Obama dismissed Snowden and the NSA leaks to the media by saying “No, I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,” Obama said.
The President also said “I shouldn’t have to” personally call the leaders of China and Russia to have them turn over Snowden after details of classified documents were made public. 
“We’ve got a whole lot of business that we do with China and Russia,” Obama said. “And I’m not going to have one case of a suspect that we’re trying to extradite suddenly being elevated to the point where I’ve got to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a host of other issues, simply to get a guy extradited so that he can face the Justice system here in the United States.”

A group of special operations veterans is demanding House Speaker John Boehner form a Select Committee to uncover the truth behind the Benghazi attacks. The group said that Americans and the world will not be able to trust the Obama administration on Syria until it tells the truth about what happened in Benghazi. 
Larry Ward, the political director of Special Operations Speaks (SOS), told Breitbart News that Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) was “dead on when he linked action in Syria to the Benghazi Massacre and cover up” when he questioned Secretary of State John Kerry before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. 
“How is anyone supposed to believe anything that comes out of this Administration?” Ward said to Breitbart News. He noted that Americans and world leaders do not trust the Obama administration on foreign policy matters after Obama, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and then-Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice lied over and over about “the YouTube video.” The video depicting Muhammed was initially said to be responsible for the attacks. 


Duncan, holding up a photo of former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who died in the attacks, told Kerry that Benghazi was vitally germane to the Syria debate. 

“Before we commit the lives of American sons and daughters into a civil war half way around the globe, we must be told the whole truth about the Benghazi Massacre,” Ward said. 
To uncover that truth, SOS sent an open letter to House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) this week, saying it was “deeply troubling” that Boehner has refused to create a Select Committee on Benghazi. The group urged him to answer the unanswered questions about the Benghazi massacre within a week, form a Select Committee to find the truth, or resign his speakership. 
In the letter, the group claimed Boehner would be complicit in the Obama administration’s Benghazi cover-up if he failed to act.

Via TVNewser, here’s a transcript between Fox News’ Ed Henry and White House spokesman Jay Carney over just how qualified Susan Rice is for her promotion to National Security Adviser. With no good answer, Carney plays to the media crowd and renews the White House attacks on Fox News. 
A full five days after the September 11 terror attack in Benghazi, we are apparently supposed to believe Susan Rice was the only person in America who had no idea whatsoever four Americans might have just maybe/probably been the victims of a terror attack:


Henry: You described (Rice) as one of the most qualified, experienced foreign policy experts in America. If that’s the case, how did she get the information on Benghazi so wrong five days after the attack?
Carney: Ed, I would welcome the opportunity to correct the record especially for some news outlets who persist in misrepresenting the facts. You have seen the so-called talking points. You have seen the testimony of the deputy director of the CIA and the documents that demonstrate that the central point that they made was drafted in the first instance and every instance thereafter.
Henry: Then why did various intelligence officers say that they almost immediately knew that this was terror and if she’s so experienced why wouldn’t she see that as they saw it?

Carney: So you are suggesting that a senior member of the national security team should disagree with the assessments of the intelligence community because somebody appeared on Fox News and said something?
A crucial piece of context the media ignores about Susan Rice is that after her appointment to U.N. Ambassador, President Obama turned that position into a cabinet position. This means she was part of security briefings. 
Still, a full five days after the attack, when everyone but the White House was admitting what we all knew to be true, Rice claimed there was no evidence of a premeditated terror attack. 
That means she is either dumb or dishonest. Either way, she is not qualified to serve fries much less as a top-level adviser to the American president. 
Carney, though, can get away with openly mocking Fox News as a defense because the rest of the lapdogs in that room hate Fox News just as much as Obama does. When it comes to Obama, the media focus is always about hammering those who search for the truth.
Fox has been searching for the truth, and that makes them a media target.

Monday, President Barack Obama picked top counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan to become the next head of the CIA. Brennan’s views on radical Islam may concern hawkish Senators who will scrutinize Obama’s choice for CIA chief.

In May of 2010, Fox News reported Brennan defended Jihad as a “legitimate tenet of Islam.”:



The president’s top counterterrorism adviser on Wednesday called jihad a “legitimate tenet of Islam,” arguing that the term “jihadists” should not be used to describe America’s enemies. During a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, John Brennan described violent extremists as victims of “political, economic and social forces,” but said that those plotting attacks on the United States should not be described in “religious terms.” 
He repeated the administration argument that the enemy is not “terrorism,” because terrorism is a “tactic,” and not terror, because terror is a “state of mind” — though Brennan’s title, deputy national security adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security, includes the word “terrorism” in it. But then Brennan said that the word “jihad” should not be applied either. 
“Nor do we describe our enemy as ‘jihadists’ or ‘Islamists’ because jihad is a holy struggle, a legitimate tenet of Islam, meaning to purify oneself or one’s community, and there is nothing holy or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men, women and children,” Brennan said. 

The Washington Times Opinion Page met with Brennan three months later at an editorial board meeting and asked him about his remarks. Brennan asked for the meeting because he objected to an editorial the opinion page had written previously. 

Brennan lost his temper relatively quickly during the question and answer time between him and then-TWT deputy editorial page editor (now with USA Today) David Mastio:

Then TWT Senior Editorial Writer Jim Robbins questioned Brennan about the issue of jihad. Brennan lost his patience at one point and decided to leave the TWT offices without answering any more questions:


TWT: You mentioned jihad, for example, and would you agree with the lesser and greater and lesser jihad framework? I mean, that’s pretty standard.
BRENNAN: Sure, it is…absolutely.
TWT: Can you give me an example of a jihad in history? Like, has there ever been a jihad…an armed jihad anywhere in history? Has it ever existed for real, or is it just a concept?
BRENNAN: Absolutely it has.
TWT: Example?
BRENNAN: I’m not going to go into this sort of history discussion here.
TWT: But it’s important to frame the concept, because we want to say that what al-Qaeda is doing is not jihad. They say it is, and Abdul Azzam has said, in fact, ‘there’s not even a greater jihad.’ That that’s  just a myth–that hadith didn’t  even really happen. That there’s only armed jihad. Ayatollah Khomeini said ‘there is only armed jihad, and it would be useful to be able to characterize or to contrast what they’re doing and what they claim against a legitimate armed jihad in the past.
BRENNAN: I think we’ve finished. I have to get going.

Fred Hof, the career diplomat who led the US response for much of the Syrian crisis, slammed President Obama this weekend for his “strategically appalling” response to Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons. Hof, who last year was tasked by then Sec. of State Hillary Clinton and Obama to lead US negotiations to resolve Syria’s civil war, said Obama’s last-minute switch to seek Congressional approval for a military strike in Syria undermined US authority in the world.
“By not making it clear from the outset of the crisis that he would seek the approval of the Senate and House for a military response to the Assad regime’s chemical atrocity,” Hof wrote, “the president’s jarring change of direction now runs the risk of thoroughly undermining whatever remains of allied confidence in his leadership.”
Hof writes that, “the events of the past ten days suggest that there was no administration forethought to the possibility of a major chemical incident in Syria; there was no plan in place to respond to a major chemical attack by a regime that had already demonstrated its deep and abiding contempt for the president and his red lines.”


Hof argues that Obama’s recent actions would lead many to believe that the decision to seek Congressional approval “is less a bow to American constitutionality than a further attempt to kick the can down the road.”
Obama didn’t seek Congressional approval for the military action he authorized in Libya. That action was directed at toppling the regime of Libyan dictator Gadaffi, a more intense and much broader objective than Obama says he wants in Syria. In his remarks on Saturday, Obama even stated that he believes he has the authority to order a strike on Syria. That he didn’t, Hof argues, nor call Congress immediately back to Washington, undermines US credibility in the world. 
Hof is not some outside expert observing the seen from afar. He joined the Obama Administration at the start of the President’s first term as a special advisor of the Middle East. He worked closely with Clinton and Special Envoy George Mitchell on Middle East peace negotiations. He was the lead diplomat for issues related to Syria and Lebanon. 

In March, 2012, President Obama elevated him to the rank of Ambassador and gave him responsibility for handling the US response to the deteriorating situation in Syria. He abruptly resigned the position just 6 months later. News of his resignation came just two works after the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya. 
Hof’s critique of the Obama Administration is must reading for anyone trying to understand America’s increasingly feckless response to the events unfolding in Syria. Almost a year ago, President Obama told reporters that Syria’s use of chemical weapons was a “red line” that, if crossed would generate a US military response. It seems inconceivable that no contingency plans were draw up for just such an event. Yet, as Hof argues, that seems to be the case. 
Congress doesn’t return to Washington until next week. Even if strong support builds for military intervention, it will likely be several days before Congress approves action. This gives the Assad regime at least two weeks to prepare for any possible US attack. The regime is no doubt, even today, moving its chemical weapons arsenal to unknown locations. The limited engagement Obama claims he wants may be completely ineffective. 
As Hof laments, “there will be no ‘do-overs.'”

As Americans pause today to remember the trauma–and heroism–of September 11, 2001, we have a new reason to commemorate the day: the embassy attacks of September 11, 2012. A year later, there have been no arrests and no responses. Those responsible for neglecting embassy security have been restored, while those who raised concerns are still suffering. And the leaders most responsible pretend nothing happened.
The story of how President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have escaped accountability for what happened in Benghazi, Libya and in Cairo, Egypt a year ago today is one of the great political escapes, and one of the great media scandals, of our history. “What difference does it make?” Clinton railed in January. The difference is profound indeed, both for the dead and the nation as a whole.


The political consequences were decisive. What should have happened is that the media should have asked what President Obama was doing that evening, why he was not in touch with his top national security advisers throughout the evening, why he flew to Las Vegas for a fundraiser the next day, why the Secretary denied security to Benghazi, and why her officials were apologetic as crowds stormed the Cairo embassy.

Instead, the media pounced on Mitt Romney’s response late that night, which addressed the Cairo debacle and was issued before the nation knew about the Benghazi deaths. This was to be the latest of Romney’s alleged “gaffes”–none of which were incorrect, and all of which pale in comparison to the incompetence on display a year later in Obama’s response to Syria’s crossing of the chemical weapons “red line.”
Obama and Clinton concocted one of the most audacious lies ever told by an American leader–that the attacks were a reaction to an obscure anti-Islamic video made by a Christian in the U.S. Essentially, he offered fellow Americans to the enemy as scapegoats. When the story unraveled, Obama pretended to have said all along that Benghazi had been a terror attack–another lie, eagerly defended by the media.
Meanwhile, the filmmaker responsible for the video was jailed on an unrelated parole violation–a craven concession to the Muslim Brotherhood–while the terrorists themselves lounged in Libya, secure in the knowledge that Obama was in no rush to pursue them or to deal with the mess that U.S. intervention had left behind. 
The collapse of the U.S. deterrent in Syria today began with Egypt and Libya a year ago.
That, ultimately, is the most important difference that Benghazi made. It showed that America is willing to abandon its own citizens to the barbaric, unabashed violence of our enemies. The culpability goes beyond Obama and extends to the Beltway media and political classes–including those Republicans who resist a full inquiry into the events of September 11, 2012, which ignored the warnings and lessons of the first 9/11.
The consequence is that Americans are less safe–as are people around the world who face the violence of tyrants and terrorists alike. Those who, like President Obama, exhort Americans not to turn away from the children of Syria (despite ignoring children killed there by conventional weapons for over two years) should consider what their own indifference to American lives has contributed to our nation’s new impotence.

CBS News is reporting that Benghazi witness Greg Hicks told congressional investigators that  “a team of Special Forces prepared to fly from Tripoli to Benghazi during the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks was forbidden from doing so by U.S. Special Operations Command South Africa.”
Hicks also reported that SOCAFRICA commander Lt. Col. Gibson and his team were prepared to board a C130 from Tripoli before the attack on the Benghazi annex. Gibson received a call saying “you can’t go now, you don’t have the authority to go now.’ And so they missed the flight … They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it.”


If a force had left Tripoli to head to Benghazi, Hicks said it might have saved the the lives of Ty Woods and Glen Doherty. Instead the attacks went unchallenged.  He went on to surmise that the Libyans “would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.” 
Below is an excerpt of the Hicks’ testimony released from the House Oversight Committee: 
Q: But do you think, you know, if an F-15, if the military had allowed a jet to go fly over, that it might have prevented [the second attack]?

A: Yeah, and if we had gotten clearance from the Libyan military for an American plane to fly over Libyan airspace. The Libyans that I talked to and the Libyans and other Americans who were involved in the war have told me also that Libyan revolutionaries were very cognizant of the impact that American and NATO airpower had with respect to their victory. They are under no illusions that American and NATO airpower won that war for them. And so, in my personal opinion, a fast-mover flying over Benghazi at some point, you know, as soon as possible might very well have prevented some of the bad things that happened that night.
Q : The theory being, the folks on the ground that are doing these — committing these terrorist attacks look up, see a heavy duty airplane above, and decide to hightail it?
A: I believe that if — I believe if we had been able to scramble a fighter or aircraft or two over Benghazi as quickly as possible after the attack commenced, I believe there would not have been a mortar attack on the annex in the morning because I believe the Libyans would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.
Q: I just wanted to ask, you mentioned permission from the Libyans. Why is that important? What did you mean by that?
A: Well, it’s their country. And for an American military aircraft to fly over their country, we have to have permission from them to do so.

Q: So what would have been the risk of — do you think it would have been risky for us to send someone, do you think it would have been counterproductive for us to send a fighter pilot plane over Benghazi without that permission?
A: We would have certainly wanted to obtain that permission. I believe we would have gotten it if we had asked. I believe that the Libyans were hoping that we were going to come bail them out of this mess. And, you know, they were as surprised as we were that American — the military forces that did arrive only arrived on the evening of September 12. Yeah.

Q: So, at this point [at approximately 10:00 pm in Tripoli], you are talking to Washington, you are talking to your RSO Martinec, you are talking to RAO. Are you talking to the Defense Attache?
A: The Defense Attache is there, and he is immediately on the phone to Ministry of Defense and to chief of staff of the Libyan Armed Forces. He also notifies Joint Staff and AFRICOM. Our SOCAFRICA lead, Lieutenant Colonel Gibson, connects with SOCAFRICA in Stuttgart, as well. And, obviously, RAO is also connected back home.
Q: Was there ever any thought at that time of the night to have an F-16, you know, fly over?

A: I called — when we knew that — I talked with the Defense Attache, Lt. Col. Keith Phillips, and I asked him, “Is there anything coming?” And he said that the nearest fighter planes were Aviano, that he had been told that it would take two to three hours to get them airborne, but that there were no tanker assets near enough to support a flight from Aviano.
A: And for the second time that night [Before 5:15 AM attack], I asked the Defense Attache, is there anything coming, is there anything out there to help our people from, you know, big military? And the answer, again, was the same as before.
Q: And what was that answer?
A: The answer was, it’s too far away, there are no tankers, there is nothing, there is nothing that could respond.
Q: So you had mentioned that the first team from Tripoli to Benghazi arrived at 1:15?
A: Right.
Q: And was there a second team that was organized? Could you tell us about the second team?
A: Right. The second team — the Defense Attache worked assiduously all night long to try to get the Libyan military to respond in some way. Early in the morning — sorry, after we were formally notified by the Prime Minister, who called me, that Chris had passed, the Libyan military agreed to fly their C-130 to Benghazi and carry additional personnel to Benghazi as reinforcements. Because we at that time — at that time, the third attack, the mortar attack at 5:15, had not yet occurred, if I remember correctly.
Q: So what time did the second rescue team ??
A: Well, again, they flew — I think that flight took off sometime between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m.
Q: At that point, you are the Chief of Mission?
A: Yeah, I’m Chief of Mission effective 3:00 a.m.
Q: Now, did any of the Special Forces folks, were they planning at any time to travel on that second aircraft?
A: On the second, on the C-130? Yes. We fully intended for those guys to go, because we had already essentially stripped ourselves of our security presence, or our security capability to the bare minimum …
A: So Lieutenant Colonel Gibson, who is the SOCAFRICA commander, his team, you know, they were on their way to the vehicles to go to the airport to get on the C-130 when he got a phone call from SOCAFRICA which said, you can’t go now, you don’t have authority to go now. And so they missed the flight. And, of course, this meant that one of the …Q : They didn’t miss the flight. They were told not to board the flight.
A: They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it. So, anyway, and yeah. I still remember Colonel Gibson, he said, “I have never been so embarrassed in my life that a State Department officer has bigger balls than somebody in the military.” A nice compliment.
Q: Now, at this point, are you having communications with Washington?
A: I was in communications with Washington all night long. I was reporting all night long what was happening to Washington by telephone.
Q: When these Special Forces folks were told essentially to stand down, what was your next move? Did you have a recourse? Were you able to call Washington? Were you able to call anyone at this point to get that decision reversed?
A: No, because the flight was — the flight was leaving. And, you know, if they missed — you know, if the vehicles didn’t leave when they leave, they would miss the flight time at the airport. And the airport — you know, we were going all the way to Mitiga. The C-130 is at Mitiga, which is all the way on the other side of Tripoli.
Q: What was the rationale that you were given that they couldn’t go, ultimately?
A: I guess they just didn’t have the right authority from the right.

House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) told radio’s Laura Ingraham on Wednesday that he has told House Speaker John Boehner that he must publicly promise there will be no conference committee on the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. 
“I am not going to go down the road of conferencing with the Senate bill and I told Boehner that he needs to stand up and make that very clear,” McCaul said on Ingraham’s program on Wednesday morning. “We’re not going to conference with the senate period.”
McCaul said that he believes a conference committee on the Senate immigration bill is a “political trap” that President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are trying to set. McCaul said he does not want to be caught in the trap. “I was invited to the White House yesterday and I refused to meet with the President because I saw it as a political trap,” he said.


Boehner, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor have publicly left the door open to conference, with Ryan actually publicly advocating for one. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said in July. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”
The Senate bill’s principal GOP sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), said this weekend in a Breitbart News exclusive that he is opposed to a conference committee and does not think the House should make efforts to save his immigration bill there. Rather, Rubio said, the House should focus on what Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL) have described as a true step-by-step piecemeal immigration reform, whereby individual pieces are passed and then implemented before other pieces are taken up by Congress.

Kevin Kolbye, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Dallas, served as the on-scene commander for the Benghazi investigation but has not yet testified before Congress about what he knows.
Republican Congressman Frank Wolf wants to know why. 
Kolbye addressed the GovSec West Conference in Dallas in late November and discussed various aspects of the Benghazi investigation with attendees. During his presentation, Kolbye noted that, contrary to initial reports, FBI assets were on the scene in Benghazi within a few days after the attack. Breitbart News reported that story when it broke.


Kolbye explained, “We have people in a lot of other foreign countries who are [legal attachés]. We have investigative teams that are well equipped.” In response to claims that the FBI could not access the site because of security clearance issues, he affirmed, “We were there.”

Rep. Wolf was amazed that this information didn’t reach Congress sooner. He told Breitbart News last Thursday:

I’m shocked to find that someone said that they were there in several days and all the reports we’ve had both from the administration and from the news media was that it took several weeks before they got there. Secondly, I don’t understand why this guy, Kevin Kolbye, wasn’t called as a witness by several other committees in Congress.

The Benghazi attacks occurred on September 11, 2012. The Washington Post reported on September 18 that FBI agents had arrived in Libya, but later information indicated that they were delayed en route to Benghazi. On October 4, the Associated Press (AP) reported that a team of FBI agents arrived in Benghazi and stayed for only one day due to clearance issues. “Agents arrived in Benghazi before dawn on Thursday and departed after sunset, after weeks of waiting for access to the crime scene to investigate the Sept. 11 attack,” the report reads. 
Kolbye’s claim that FBI staff was on-site at Benghazi flies in the face of these reports.
Rep. Wolf is leading the charge to untangle the complicated web of circumstances surrounding Benghazi. Wolf has been the driving force behind the idea of forming a Benghazi Select Committee to investigate the 2012 attack. While House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) appears unmotivated to appoint members to one, a recent McLaughlin-Caddell poll showed that two thirds of Americans want a Select Committee; this number includes 83 percent of Republicans as well as 58 percent of independents who “believe it is important for a special committee to get the truth about Benghazi.”
Speaking with Breitbart News, Rep. Wolf expressed his outrage at Congress’s lack of critical information:

If [Kolbye] was the on-scene guy leading this investigation, you would think he would be one of the very first people [Congress] actually called, and I think that’s another reason why I think he should be called. Kevin Kolbye should be called publicly. If he can testify or give a speech at a paid event in Texas where people had to pay, I think we can let the American people know for free. Most members of Congress have no idea what happened. And if they don’t have any idea what happened — the American people, they don’t know what happened. This guy ought to be called, and we need to have a select committee to have all these guys called under oath. Here he was at a conference where people had to pay $400, not under oath. And yet nobody in Congress can even talk to him? That’s crazy.

On Monday, GOP political commentator Karl Rove sharply criticized a recent Breitbart News article on new language in the Senate amnesty bill. Appearing on FoxNews to defend the bill’s security provisions, Rove singled out a Breitbart story which appeared Friday as “simply not true.” Rove’s criticism, however, was factually incorrect. 
The article Rove attacked, detailed a new provision in the then-Corker-Hoeven amendment which would allow immigrants on work visas who overstayed their visas to still apply for a green card. In other words, breaking immigration law in the future would not prevent someone from getting on the “path to citizenship.”   
Rove claimed the article “turned out simply not to be true. It was very narrow provision that said if you’re from one of nine countries that get what’s called ‘Temporary Protective Status’ because of war or conflict inside your country, and you’ve been employed for ten years, the last ten years, you can, like every other person who’s here in the United States get in line to become a citizen, ultimately at the back of the line, and can’t happen for another ten years and so forth.” (emphasis added)


Rove, like many supporters of the Senate bill, clearly has not read the entire bill or simply misunderstands it. The language discussed in the Breitbart article had nothing to do with the TPS program or refugees from war-torn countries. The amendment allowing visa-overstays applies to the overwhelming majority of future immigrants in this country, what’s called the Merit Track-2 path. The CBO estimates that more than half the current 11 million illegals in this country will take this path to citizenship.
That is not a “very narrow provision.” Rove’s attempt to attack the Breitbart News article was totally inaccurate and wrong.

Sen. Rand Paul’s filibuster against the confirmation of CIA Director and “drone czar” John Brennan offers a “teachable moment” to the media and the left about the Tea Party. As they seethe in outrage and confusion that it took a Republican to question the constitutionality of drone attacks, it is important to remind our friends on the other side that it wasn’t just any Republican, but a–gasp!–Tea Party Republican who spoke “truth to power.”
Not only that, but the Senators who were first to offer their assistance were also Tea Party Republicans–the so-called McCarthyist Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco “Water Break” Rubio of Florida. All three of these Senators won their primary elections against candidates favored by the Republican establishment. All three have been attacked by the left and smeared as racist and extremist for belonging to the Tea Party. Yet without them, no one from either party would have questioned a policy that the left once saw as a dangerous abuse of executive power.


Only one Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, supported Paul. (Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois came to the floor very late in the game to offer a few challenging questions and formally end debate when Paul finally yielded.) Ryan Grim and Mollie Reilly of the Huffington Post observed: “…progressives who might have assumed to have been supportive were absent, leaving members of the GOP as the sole defenders of civil liberties. The White House was equally silent.” Some Democrats, notably Maxine Waters, even slammed Paul as “destructive.”

What many on the left and in the media have willfully failed to understand is that the Tea Party exists to defend the Constitution from unconstitutional encroachments on power and dangerous expansions in the size and cost of government. It did not merely arise in opposition to President Barack Obama; it had its roots in conservative outrage at the bailouts of the last months of George W. Bush’s presidency. At its core, the Tea Party is about American values, not Republican politics. It exists not to obstruct the Democrats but to restore the Constitution.
Rand Paul’s filibuster provided a useful contrast between the Tea Party and the GOP establishment. While Paul stood on the Senate floor, unable to leave the chamber to eat, a dozen other Republicans chose to dine with President Obama in a gesture of bipartisanship. (The contrast is not exact; a few Tea Party favorites attended the dinner, too, and joined Paul later in the Senate chamber.) It had already been hours since Wyden joined Paul’s protest, illustrating that true bipartisanship is forged on the basis of shared principles, not just political necessity.
Democrats and journalists like to describe the Tea Party as “hostage-takers,” holding Republican leaders and moderates in their thrall while they try to dismantle the government. But in reality it is the Washington elite that have taken the country hostage, forcing through expansions of government power and spending vast sums of money that the nation will struggle for generations to repay. The Tea Party represents the last chance to escape the zero-sum politics and economic stagnation that has plagued much of Europe for the last several years.
As Paul continued, liberals who once railed angrily against Bush were forced to confront the fecklessness of their own party. Hollywood’s John Cusack asked: “Where are the so-called progressive Democratic senators?” Meanwhile, the supposedly racist Tea Party Senator from Kentucky was leading the charge. It was not a political ploy for votes, or even an attempt to block one of President Obama’s nominees, which Paul acknowledged he would fail to do. It was just a stand on principle–which is what the Tea Party has been about all along.

Pro-amnesty activists trying to co-opt the civil rights messages of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to push immigration reform through Congress seem to be directly contradicting the wishes of the late Dr. King and his wife, Coretta Scott King. Mrs. King carried on her husband’s civil rights activism after he was assassinated.
In a 1991 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Coretta Scott King and other black community leaders argued that illegal immigration would have a devastating impact on the black community. At the time, Hatch was working his U.S. Senate position to undo some enforcement measures laid out in Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty agreement, attempting to weaken interior enforcement and sanctions against employers who hired illegal aliens.  
We, the undersigned members of the Black Leadership Forum, write to urge you to postpone introduction of your employer sanctions repeal legislation until we have had an opportunity to report to you what we believe to be the devastating impact the repeal would have on the economic condition of un- and semi-skilled workers–a disproportionate number of whom are African-American and Hispanic; and until we have had the opportunity to propose to you and to our Hispanic brothers and sisters, what we believe could be a number of effective means of eliminating the discrimination occasioned by employer sanctions, without losing the protection sanctions provide for U.S. workers, especially minority workers.
While the members of the Black Leadership Forum wrote they had “divergent views” at the time on the employer sanctions regarding illegal immigration, they wrote they were “united in three respects.”


First, they wrote they were united in being “fully committed to the elimination of the root causes of national origin discrimination under the Immigration Reform & Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) [Reagan’s amnesty], as well as discriminatory impact.”
Second, they said they stood together in their belief that “there are a number of effective ways to remedy discrimination resulting from IRCA, without tampering with employer sanctions. Some measures we support are contained in the Report and Recommendations of the Taskforce on IRCA-Related Discimination and in the 1990 GAO Report on Immigration Reform: Employer Sanctions and Question of Discrimination.”
Third, the writers said they were unanimous in their request for a discussion with Hatch and other members of Congress on “the importance of employer sanctions to the economic security of African Americans and Hispanic workers.”

The black leaders wrote that they feared lack of interior immigration enforcement would lead to future illegal immigration, and the hiring of those illegal immigrants into jobs that could be occupied by black and Hispanic American citizens.
“We are concerned, Senator Hatch, that your proposed remedy to the employer sanctions-based discrimination, namely, the elimination of employer sanctions, will cause another problem–the revival of the pre-1986 discrimination against black and brown U.S. and documented workers, in favor of cheap labor–the undocumented workers,” they wrote. “This would undoubtedly exacerbate an already severe economic crisis in communities where there are large numbers of new immigrants.”
Coretta Scott King and the other black leaders added that they were “concerned that some who support the repeal of employer sanctions are using ‘discrimination’ as a guise for their desire to abuse undocumented workers and to introduce cheap labor into the U.S. workforce.”
America does not have a labor shortage. With roughly 7 million people unemployed, and double that number discouraged from seeking work, the removal of employer sanctions threatens to add additional U.S. workers to the rolls and drive down wages. Moreover, the repeal of employer sanctions will inevitably add to our social problems and place an unfair burden on the poor in the cities in which most new immigrants cluster–cities which are already suffering housing shortages and insufficient human needs services.
The black leaders then called for education reform to train American workers for jobs, rather than immigration reform to bring in foreigners to fill those jobs while American workers suffered. “Senator Hatch, we believe that what this country needs is not to prematurely scrap employer sanctions, but rather, we need education and training programs designed to prepare the unemployed, especially African Americans, Hispanics, and others at great risk, to meet the market demands of tomorrow,” they wrote. 
The authors added that while “not a panacea for the nation’s illegal immigration problems, employer sanctions are one necessary means of stopping the exploitation of vulnerable workers and the undercutting of American jobs and living standards.”

Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, the new president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, ripped the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” U.S. Senators who are pushing immigration reform during the debut of Breitbart News Sunday with Stephen K. Bannon on Sirius/XM Patriot on Sunday night.
“That’s not the way it should be done, where people go behind closed doors and come up with something that we still haven’t seen,” DeMint said. 
They’re out there selling it. We don’t know what the legislation is but we’re supposed to have an open, democratic process where people can hear the debate, they can see amendments, they can find out what’s in the bill before it’s voted on. So, it’s very frustrating. Obviously, this isn’t the first time this has happened–on the fiscal cliff, and on all these other things they do backroom deals. But I’m tired of it. Frankly, it’s one of the reasons I left the Senate: to try to change things from the outside in. But I know some of these folks involved [in the Gang of Eight] are actually trying to solve a problem, but this is not the way to do it.
DeMint said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) is one of those he thinks is actually trying to solve the problem of illegal immigration but is going about it the wrong way–mainly because the way Washington has evolved is antithetical to transparent and open government.


“Well this is hard because Marco is one of my best friends in the Senate and he’s a great guy, very genuine, and I know he got into this process trying to solve a problem,” DeMint said when asked for his reaction to Rubio’s whirlwind media tour this weekend, in which the Florida Republican appeared on a record seven Sunday shows. 
“He’s just dealing with some folks who have a political objective and it’s very difficult,” DeMint explained. “So, I don’t blame him for trying to sell what’s in it, I’ve just encouraged him from the very beginning to make sure he knows what’s in the legislation and make sure we get what we need out of a new immigration system before we agree to make citizens out of 11 million people.”
The eight senators–Republicans Rubio, Jeff Flake, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham and Democrats Bob Menendez, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, and Michael Bennet–have been meeting in secret since January trying to craft a plan for comprehensive immigration reform. 

White House officials have been involved in the drafting of the legislation, as have representatives from special interest groups like the powerful AFL-CIO  labor union and the big business lobby the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from groups in favor of law enforcement reform, like the president of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents’ union Chris Crane, have been kept out of the discussion, as has anyone opposed to granting amnesty to illegal aliens.
DeMint claimed that the reason those senators keep the deal-making happening in secret is because their plan cannot stand up to public scrutiny. “One of the reasons you do all this behind closed doors is because you don’t want any critics at the party,” DeMint said. 
You want to bring this out and surprise people and do your pre-selling. But, Robert Rector, just about five years ago, when I was helping to fight a similar bill, provided information that was not only credible but it was very provable that there is a high cost to have amnesty. There is a high cost to have unregulated immigration and we need to go ahead. Americans are going to look at this very differently if they know it’s likely to mean they’re going to cut their Social Security and Medicare and raise their taxes which the president seems to be talking about every week.
Heritage Foundation analyst Robert Rector is in the final stages of wrapping up what is expected to be a bombshell analysis breaking down the entire cost of the Gang of Eight’s immigration reform proposal. Preliminary estimates from Rector’s and Senate Budget Committee Republican staff analyses put the Gang of Eight plan at just under $3 trillion in entitlement spending increases, but the final analysis may put the number much higher. 
As the Heritage Foundation continues its work on this, the conservative hallmark has taken heat from several groups around Washington for the forthcoming report–largely because the Heritage report could very well be the poison pill that kills immigration reform.
The libertarian Cato Institute and the GOP establishment-minded Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist’s group, have become unlikely allies, banding together to attack the still-unpublished Heritage analysis from Rector. 

During his media tour this weekend, Rubio himself stabbed at Heritage, saying on Fox News Sunday that Rector’s forthcoming analysis was not accurate. DeMint said he trusts Rector, and added that this report coming out “shouldn’t be controversial.”
“Those who don’t think this has been done correctly should show us their analysis,” DeMint said. “The fact is, there is not any other analysis. Robert Rector has been a scholar for years. He was the one who did the data that actually ended up pushing through welfare reform back in the 1990s,” he explained. “He came out with data that was irrefutable five years ago [on immigration costs], although some are saying it needs to be combined with other types of research.” 
DeMint argued that the report should be a point of open analysis of the plan: “Let’s talk about it. But let’s at least consider the cost. We hope we’ll have our report out within the next week. We’ll be writing and speaking about it a lot but Americans need to understand there’s nothing free about the proposal that’s being talked about.”
As the bill is set to be released on Tuesday, DeMint urged Americans and those in the media to “keep in mind that even if it’s in legislation that does not mean the administration will do it.”
“Over five years we passed into law that there had to be 700 miles of double layer fencing along the volatile areas of our southern border,” DeMint said. “But President Obama has ignored the law.” 
There are only 30 something miles of double layer fencing that have actually been built. The law says that the federal government should support states in the enforcement of federal immigration policy, this administration has decided not to do it. So my point is this: if they promise legal status or citizenship in return for the future fixing of the immigration system, no one can count on that. That’s why this needs to be a step-by-step process where we fix the system first and earn the trust of the American people, then we consider what we’re going to do with those who are already here.
But as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) noted in a Sunday afternoon press release, the Gang of Eight senators admitted throughout their Sunday show blitzkrieg that they want to do amnesty first, then reform the immigration system later.

An illegal alien brutally murdered Laura Wilkerson’s 18-year-old son in Texas, tied his body up, and then doused him with gasoline before burning him. 
Wilkerson recalled the harrowing details on Breitbart News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, yet her story has gone unheard in the broader press.
Maria Espinoza, the director of the Remembrance project that memorializes Americans who were killed by illegal immigrants, told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that such crimes “happen every day” in America, even in states far from the border. But the mainstream media, Espinoza said, often do not report on illegal immigrants who have murdered Americans in states like Virginia, Tennessee, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington.


Espinoza said incidents remain local ones and are “shared” and actually suppressed. 
“We don’t even hear the person was here illegally in the country,” she said. 
Wilkerson told the harrowing tale of how her 18-year-old son was killed on what started out as “just a normal school day.” Wilkerson’s maternal instinct took over when her son did not answer a text from her around 1:30 pm and she went to the school to look for him. While driving around, Wilkerson saw her son’s truck parked by a dumpster at a strip mall. After police found her son’s backpack and shoes in the dumpster, she suspected the worst.

Wilkerson would later find out that an illegal alien, who would  have been eligible for citizenship under the DREAM Act, brutally murdered her son after he offered to give him a ride home. The illegal alien would later testify–without showing remorse–that he punched her son so hard in the nose that he went blind and kicked him in the stomach so hard that Josh’s liver and spleen sliced. After ultimately strangling Josh to death, the illegal immigrant then tied Josh up, took him to a field, doused him with gas and burned him. The illegal immigrant was sentenced to life in prison this January. 
Espinoza said such crimes were 100% preventable if the nation’s immigration laws are enforced. Wilkerson agreed, recalling how her son’s murder had been in court days before he killed her son because the illegal alien had stalked an ex-girlfriend. Similar incidents have occurred in states like Virginia, where the illegal alien who stabbed a Virginia teenager to death after asking her for a ride to the hospital had been detained months before the murder  
Wilkerson emphasized that the country had to “enforce the laws that are in place and secure the border” so even illegal alien criminals who are deported are not able to just walk back into the country because “our borders are open.”
She sad those like Rep. Steve King (R-IA) who have stood up against illegal immigration “were brave” for doing so and those like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) who have supported comprehensive immigration reform that would grant amnesty to illegal immigrants disgust her. 
“That just makes me sick,” Wilkerson said. “Until it happens to one of their children or their grandkids they are not going to see it the same way.”

Espinoza said the Remembrance Project is engaging in a national campaign to memorializing the victims of illegal immigrants–like Wilkerson’s son–on quilts in every state.
She said Americans needed to tell lawmakers to focus on America, Americans, the debt, and citizens who are out of work. 
“There is absolutely no urgency to address illegal aliens or illegal aliens’s children,” Espinoza said. “They need to focus on American families.”
Wilkerson said her son had dreams of going into the military like his brother and was a “compassionate” and “gentle” kid who “did not have an enemy.” 
But now that her son is gone, Wilkerson said the illegal alien who murdered her son had “more rights than he did.” Because the illegal alien lived in a so-called sanctuary city, Wilkerson recalled that police could not even ask him the immigration status of his parents when they arrested him.
“I don’t understand it at all,” Wilkerson said.

Rep. Randy Forbes (R-VA) grilled Defense Sec. Chuck Hagel on a Pentagon email warning Army officers to watch out for soldiers who do not support gay marriage or who disfavor Muslims, equating them with the Ku Klux Klan and Neo-Nazis. 
The Pentagon officer who sent this email reportedly got his information from a radical, leftist anti-Christian organization linked to a convicted terrorist. 
As reported by Fox News’ Todd Starnes, Lt. Col. Jack Rich at Ft. Campbell sent an email warning Army officers to be on the lookout for soldiers connected with “domestic hate groups.” In his 14-page email, Rich identified groups that support traditional marriage or advocate strict border enforcement regarding illegal aliens as domestic hate groups. 


This story is disturbing for several reasons, one of which is this U.S. military email was reportedly using the “domestic hate group” list created by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). This radical-left organization has listed Christian organizations such as the American Family Association and Family Research Council (FRC), immigration reform groups such as FAIR, and various Tea Party organizations as “hate groups.” The SPLC publicly claims they are no different than the KKK and Neo-Nazis, groups that engage in extreme violence and acts of terrorism. 
Yet SPLC has itself now been linked to a domestic terrorist. As we covered in detail, on Aug. 15, 2012, Floyd Corkins attempted to go on a mass-shooting spree at FRC headquarters in Washington, D.C. with 100 rounds of ammunition. Corkins shot building manager Leo Johnson, yet the wounded Johnson disarmed Corkins, who was then captured alive. 
As part of a plea deal, Corkins signed a full confession in which he admitted that he selected his targets from SPLC’s hate group list and used the map SPLC put on its website to find FRC with the intent of murdering everyone in the building (several dozen people). He called himself a political activist and was going to kill everyone in the FRC building because FRC opposes redefining marriage to include gay marriage. 

Corkins was convicted on Feb. 6, 2013, of committing acts of domestic terrorism. 
It is profoundly disturbing that anyone in the U.S. military would use material from such ultra-left zealots, who label organizations that disagree with them on a range of issues–not just social issues like marriage, but also national security issues (immigration) and economic issues (Tea Party groups)–as “hate groups.” 
Yet SPLC is the only group here that has actually been linked to a terrorist, one who was inspired to commit his despicable crime by none other than the same SPLC whose material the Obama administration’s military command is now using. 
The terrible Boston bombing is a reminder what real terrorism looks like. The Obama administration needs to deal with this threat, not associate with radical-fringe organizations that convicted terrorists cite as their enablers.

Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) told Breitbart News he is confident House Republicans as a whole will stop the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill, and take up an alternative aimed at securing the border before handling anything else.
“I can’t say exactly what’s going to happen in the future, but based on what I know now and based on what I know about leadership, I would say that we’re not going to see this thing get watered down [to get a version of it passed],” Kelly said. “Our conference is a very strong and independent conference. 
“Sometimes folks get upset about that and I know why they do. But on the other hand, these folks I serve with are very principled and I don’t think they’re going to yield anything because they were promised a certain process was going to take place. I don’t think the Speaker was going to promise that if he wasn’t going to live up to it. I have a lot of respect for him, but he’s made commitments and I’ve never yet seen him break away on a commitment. I see him remain pretty strong.”  


Kelly said that members of Congress should have learned from the 1986 amnesty that border security needs to come before legalization. He added that Congress should have learned from Obamacare that massive pieces of legislation, like this 1,200-page immigration bill, should not be rushed through to passage.

“If we did not learn anything from 1986, if we didn’t learn anything from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, that big pieces of legislation shoved through in a hurry are dangerous, they are dangerous for people,” Kelly said. 
“I’m disappointed in the Senate. I’m disappointed in our colleagues in the Senate for doing what they did. I think they really made it look like they tried to put it in the House to position it as ‘these Republicans are going to try to hold it up.’ The Speaker has said that we will break this into smaller pieces. We will have a heavy debate, not a conversation–that’s ridiculous–there’s going to be a heavy debate and we’re going to look at it. And I still, I can’t imagine anybody looking at this piece that came out of the Senate and saying ‘you know, I feel pretty good about this.’ If I’m one of the four and a half million [legal immigrants] standing in line, waiting in line and who played by the rules, I’m not feeling very good about it. I’m not feeling very good about this at all.”
Kelly said he thinks much of the misconception about what may or may not happen in the House moving forward is contrived by pundits, especially the common theme that assumes House Republicans will cave and pass a bill like the Senate one. “The pundits say ‘oh no, they’ll cave, they’ll give in to pressure, they’ll do this, they’ll do that, because they know if they don’t they won’t win the next election,'” Kelly said. “I don’t buy that. We lost the last election because we didn’t have enough of our people come out and vote.”
Kelly added: “You and I both know a lot of this stuff comes from these people sitting around drinking brandy and smoking cigars and have never been a part of this but are actually trying to drive opinion and drive policy,” Kelly said. “They say ‘this is the way it’s got to be or it can’t float.'”
“‘Well, you’ve never been in a boat. How do you know what makes it float?'”
“These people are wrong as much as they’re right but they don’t get held accountable for the things that they do that are wrong,” Kelly said.

On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) said children of illegal immigrants who were brought to America by their parents should get opportunities to get legal residence and citizenship.
“It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children and who know no other home,” Cantor said. “I’m pleased that many of my colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle have begun work in good faith to address these issues.”
At a major speech at the American Enterprise Institute that detailed Republican policy proposals to “make life better” for Americans, Cantor called on his colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle to address this issue and urged President Barack Obama to lead on a bipartisan immigration bill. Cantor said one of the “founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents.”


This is a reversal for Cantor, who voted against the DREAM Act in 2010. 
“There are some who would rather avoid fixing the problem in order to save this as a political issue,” Cantor said. “I reject this notion and call on the President to help lead us towards a bipartisan solution rather than encourage the common political divisions of the past.”
Cantor said “there are more than 11 million people here illegally, many of whom have become part of the fabric of our country,” and “they, like us, have families and dreams.” 

“While we are a nation that allows anyone to start anew, we are also a nation of laws, and that’s what makes tackling the issue of immigration reform so difficult,” Cantor said. “In looking to solve this problem soon, we’ve got to balance the respect for the rule of law and respect for those waiting to enter this country legally, with care for the people and families, most of whom just want to make a better life, and contribute to America.”
Cantor also called on Congress to pass the STEM Act, which would give foreign students who have advanced degrees in field such as science, technology, engineering, and math from American universities permanent residency. 
He said discussions about immigration reform have made “border security, employment verification and creating a workable guest worker program immediate priorities.”
“It’s the right thing to do for our families, for our security, and for our economy,” Cantor said. 
Cantor said his “grandparents fled the vicious anti-Semitic pogroms of the czars of Russia to come to America.” He said his grandmother, who was “widowed at a young age,” raised “her two sons in a tiny apartment atop a grocery store she and my grandfather had opened.”
“With little but her faith, thrift and hope for a better tomorrow, my grandma worked seven days a week to ensure that my dad and uncle could realize the promise of this great country,” Cantor said. “And today, my children and I stand as proof of the possibility to what may have seemed to her then like an impossible dream.”

U.S. District Judge David Campbell handed both sides a partial victory at the first stage in a case challenging Arizona Governor Jan Brewer’s executive order that her state will not issue driver’s licenses to illegal aliens allowed to stay in this country temporarily under President Barack Obama’s amnesty program of not pursuing deportation for many illegal aliens. But the judge also signaled that Brewer was likely to lose this case in the end, and these illegal aliens will end up with Arizona licenses. 
In 2012 Obama issued an executive order creating his temporary amnesty program. After Congress refused to pass Obama’s proposed DREAM Act on enact an immigration bill granting amnesty to millions of foreigners who entered this country illegally, the president violated his constitutional duty to take care to faithfully execute the law by announcing that he would not deport large groups of illegals that he thinks should receive amnesty. A federal judge is Texas recently held the administration’s actions illegal, but that issue has not yet been resolved on appeal.
In response to Obama’s executive order and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano’s subsequent halting of deportations, Brewer issued an order to the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles ordering them to stop accepting federal documents from those illegal aliens granted temporary amnesty for purposes of issuing driver’s licenses. An advocacy group for illegal aliens filed a lawsuit challenging Brewer’s actions in Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer. 


Brewer filed a motion to dismiss the suit, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Brewer’s actions while the lawsuit proceeds. On May 16, Judge Campbell denied both motions. 
Campbell rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Brewer’s order violates the Supremacy Clause by conflicting with federal law. He correctly reasoned that Obama’s order and Napolitano’s follow-up actions carry no force of law under the Constitution, and therefore do not amount to a federal law that would trump state law.
However, Campbell held it was very likely that the plaintiffs’ alternative argument that Brewer’s order violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will ultimately succeed. Although he correctly held that the lowest form of judicial scrutiny–called rational-basis review–is the legal standard for a case like this, he then reasoned that Brewer’s order was likely to fail under even that deferential standard when he issues a final ruling on the merits of this case.

Campbell writes:

 “The Governor’s disagreement with the DACA [amnesty] program may be a rational political or policy view in a broad sense–reasonable people certainly can disagree on an issue as complex and difficult as immigration–but it provides no justification for saying that an Arizona’s driver’s license may be issued to one person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status–say for an individual humanitarian reason–while another person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status under the DACA program is denied a license.”

The court noted that both groups of aliens have their deportation actions deferred through prosecutorial discretion, both have temporary status, both are federally eligible to work, and both have documents that have always been accepted by Arizona for driver’s licenses. Campbell noted that Arizona asserts four bases for why Brewer’s law is rational, but concluded that Brewer’s order blocking one group of illegal aliens from getting licenses, but not the other group, undermined the argument of why her order was reasonably related to advancing the public interests she asserted in court.
Campbell has the pedigree of a conservative judge. A Utah native, he clerked for Justice William Rehnquist (before he became chief justice) on the Supreme Court. The opinion is well-written and gives Brewer her due. It seems unlikely that he will change his mind later in this case, or that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will reverse his decision.
And so the latest fight between Obama and Arizona over immigration continues.

While driving around, Wilkerson saw her son’s truck parked by a dumpster at a strip mall. After police found her son’s backpack and shoes in the dumpster, she suspected the worst.

Wilkerson would later find out that an illegal alien, who would  have been eligible for citizenship under the DREAM Act, brutally murdered her son after he offered to give him a ride home. The illegal alien would later testify–without showing remorse–that he punched her son so hard in the nose that he went blind and kicked him in the stomach so hard that Josh’s liver and spleen sliced. After ultimately strangling Josh to death, the illegal immigrant then tied Josh up, took him to a field, doused him with gas and burned him. The illegal immigrant was sentenced to life in prison this January. 
Espinoza said such crimes were 100% preventable if the nation’s immigration laws are enforced. Wilkerson agreed, recalling how her son’s murder had been in court days before he killed her son because the illegal alien had stalked an ex-girlfriend. Similar incidents have occurred in states like Virginia, where the illegal alien who stabbed a Virginia teenager to death after asking her for a ride to the hospital had been detained months before the murder  
Wilkerson emphasized that the country had to “enforce the laws that are in place and secure the border” so even illegal alien criminals who are deported are not able to just walk back into the country because “our borders are open.”
She sad those like Rep. Steve King (R-IA) who have stood up against illegal immigration “were brave” for doing so and those like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) who have supported comprehensive immigration reform that would grant amnesty to illegal immigrants disgust her. 
“That just makes me sick,” Wilkerson said. “Until it happens to one of their children or their grandkids they are not going to see it the same way.”

Espinoza said the Remembrance Project is engaging in a national campaign to memorializing the victims of illegal immigrants–like Wilkerson’s son–on quilts in every state.
She said Americans needed to tell lawmakers to focus on America, Americans, the debt, and citizens who are out of work. 
“There is absolutely no urgency to address illegal aliens or illegal aliens’s children,” Espinoza said. “They need to focus on American families.”
Wilkerson said her son had dreams of going into the military like his brother and was a “compassionate” and “gentle” kid who “did not have an enemy.” 
But now that her son is gone, Wilkerson said the illegal alien who murdered her son had “more rights than he did.” Because the illegal alien lived in a so-called sanctuary city, Wilkerson recalled that police could not even ask him the immigration status of his parents when they arrested him.
“I don’t understand it at all,” Wilkerson said.

The bipartisan Senate group pushing immigration reform, dubbed the “Gang of Eight,” has allowed a representative from President Barack Obama’s White House to be involved in writing their bill but has not even tried to meet with representatives from the law enforcement community, particularly Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.
“While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill,” the Washington Post‘s Scott Wilson and Zachary Goldfarb reported on Sunday.


Even though the Gang of Eight–Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Jeff Flake, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Michael Bennet and Bob Menendez–has allowed the White House into meetings, ICE officers union president Chris Crane notes that his group has been kept completely out of the discussion on immigration reform.

“We have tried for weeks, unsuccessfully, to get a meeting with the Gang of 8 in order to share our deep concerns about the breakdown of interior enforcement in America,” Crane said in the statement released on Sunday.  
“ICE’s political leadership, specifically Secretary Napolitano and Director Morton, have repeatedly and dangerously undermined the ability of ICE officers and agents to do their jobs and ensure the constitutionally established rule of law is upheld. Yet, while the Gang of 8 has, as reported for months, worked extensively with powerful interest groups, ICE officers–like the public–have been shut out. Now we understand from media reports that the Gang of 8 is preparing to drop a 1,500 page bill on Tuesday, and pass it as quickly as possible, without having received any input from rank-and-file ICE officers.
“If the Gang is truly committed to enforcement and public safety they should be eager to provide our officers with an opportunity to review this legislation and offer detailed input before it is introduced,” Crane added. “I would therefore respectfully request that the introduction of the bill be delayed so that ICE officers and others in the law enforcement community can be fully briefed on this 1,500 page bill and offer detailed input regarding some of our nation’s most urgent interior enforcement needs that this proposal seemingly does nothing to address.”
Even though the Gang of Eight has refused meeting requests with ICE officers to discuss real law enforcement reform in the immigration debate, Rubio–the GOP members’ de facto leader–says he wants an open and transparent discussion on this issue. He has still not forced multiple hearings on the legislation, as he previously promised, and has not set up a meeting with ICE officers.
During his Sunday show charm offensive, Rubio continued saying he supports an open and transparent debate.

Via TVNewser, here’s a transcript between Fox News’ Ed Henry and White House spokesman Jay Carney over just how qualified Susan Rice is for her promotion to National Security Adviser. With no good answer, Carney plays to the media crowd and renews the White House attacks on Fox News. 
A full five days after the September 11 terror attack in Benghazi, we are apparently supposed to believe Susan Rice was the only person in America who had no idea whatsoever four Americans might have just maybe/probably been the victims of a terror attack:


Henry: You described (Rice) as one of the most qualified, experienced foreign policy experts in America. If that’s the case, how did she get the information on Benghazi so wrong five days after the attack?
Carney: Ed, I would welcome the opportunity to correct the record especially for some news outlets who persist in misrepresenting the facts. You have seen the so-called talking points. You have seen the testimony of the deputy director of the CIA and the documents that demonstrate that the central point that they made was drafted in the first instance and every instance thereafter.
Henry: Then why did various intelligence officers say that they almost immediately knew that this was terror and if she’s so experienced why wouldn’t she see that as they saw it?

Carney: So you are suggesting that a senior member of the national security team should disagree with the assessments of the intelligence community because somebody appeared on Fox News and said something?
A crucial piece of context the media ignores about Susan Rice is that after her appointment to U.N. Ambassador, President Obama turned that position into a cabinet position. This means she was part of security briefings. 
Still, a full five days after the attack, when everyone but the White House was admitting what we all knew to be true, Rice claimed there was no evidence of a premeditated terror attack. 
That means she is either dumb or dishonest. Either way, she is not qualified to serve fries much less as a top-level adviser to the American president. 
Carney, though, can get away with openly mocking Fox News as a defense because the rest of the lapdogs in that room hate Fox News just as much as Obama does. When it comes to Obama, the media focus is always about hammering those who search for the truth.
Fox has been searching for the truth, and that makes them a media target.

In an appearance on Face the Nation this morning, Rep. Darrell Issa revealed several new pieces of information about the Obama administration’s controversial description of the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, casting doubt that the White House mischaracterized its cause by mere accident.





“The talking points were right and then the talking points were wrong,” Issa explained in response to a question about reporting at the Weekly Standard. The CIA and Greg Hicks, who took over as Charge d’Affairs in Libya after the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens, both knew immediately that it was an attack, not a protest. 

Hicks, who did not appear on the show but whose reactions were featured based on transcripts of interviews with Issa’s committee, said he was stunned by what UN Ambassador Susan Rice claimed on five different news shows on Sep. 16. When she appeared on Face the Nation, she followed an interview with the President of Libya who claimed he had “no doubt” it was a terror attack. Moments later, Amb. Rice contradicted him and claimed a spontaneous protest was more likely. 
Acting Ambassador Hicks watched the Sunday shows and said he found this contradiction shocking. “The net impact of what has transpired is the spokesperson of the most powerful country in the world has basically said that the President of Libya is either a liar or doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” he accused. Hicks added, “My jaw hit the floor as I watched this…I’ve never been as embarrassed in my life, in my career as on that day.”
Hicks believes the stunning failure of diplomacy on the Sunday news shows explains why ittook the FBI three weeks to gain access to the Benghazi site. The U.S. had effectively humiliated the Libyan President on national TV. That decision, he believed, probably compromised our ability to investigate and track down those responsible. 
According to Hicks, no one from the State Department contacted him about what Amb. Rice would be saying in advance. The next morning he called Beth Jones, Acting Assistant Secretary for Near East Affaris, and asked her why Amb. Rice had made the statements she had. Jones responded, “I don’t know.”
A report published Friday by the Weekly Standard suggests that State Dept. spokesperson Victoria Nuland took issue with the initial talking points and, with backing from the White House, removed any evidence of al Qaeda involvement and of prior attacks on western targets in the region. According to emails reviewed by the Weekly Standard, Nuland said her superiors (unnamed) were concerned about criticism from Congress.

The wheels appear to be coming off a two week attempt by the Obama Administration to cover up its fatal security failures at our consulate in Libya and to cover up the very fact that this was a successful pre-planned terrorist attack that cost four American lives, including that of our Libyan Ambassador, Christopher Stevens. 
Not only has the scandal picked up steam in the mainstream press (Jake Tapper’s ABC News report tonight is a must-watch), but high-ranking members of the President’s own party are now demanding answers. This includes the man most often cited as a likely Secretary of State should Obama win a second term, Senator John Kerry:


Senate Democrats joined Republicans Thursday in questioning the Obama administration’s handling of the fatal Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya and why the administration refused for days to acknowledge that it was a terrorist attack linked to al Qaeda.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., circulated a bipartisan letter addressed to Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides, asking for an “accounting of the attacks against U.S. missions in Egypt, Libya and Yemen,” according to a copy obtained by The Washington Examiner. 
The lawmakers are also demanding to know whether the administration had any advance warnings of the Libyan attack and, if so, whether it had shared that information with U.S. personnel on the ground. 

The letter marks the first time congressional Democrats have so directly expressed their dissatisfaction with the administration’s response to inquiries about the attacks, which resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others and raised questions about U.S. security throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa. 
A Kerry aide confirmed that the committee intended to enlist the support of Republicans and Democrats and said the letter would likely be sent Friday. Another aide told The Examiner that the panel’s 10 Democrats and nine Republicans plan to sign it.
The false White House narrative blaming the murders on a protest gone bad over a YouTube video never really passed the smell test. But Obama maintained that illusion straight through to his speech before the United Nations two days ago, even as reports surfaced that our government knew al-Qaeda was behind the attack within 24 hours. Apparently, this has become too much to sweep under the rug for some of the mainstream press and Democrats. 
The behavior of Obama and Secretary of State Clinton over the past 14 days is a scandal of the highest order. Lies, cover ups, and neglect for security of American intelligence and personnel that borders on criminal. 
I’ve been skeptical that the same media, that early on conspired in this cover up by intentionally pouring all of its focus and fire on Mitt Romney’s criticism of the Cairo Embassy apology, would go near this before the election. But the sins are so great and glaring, it doesn’t look as though ignoring it will be possible for another 40 days.

Many continue to ask why the media and lawmakers have not spoken to or brought forth those who survived the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi last September. The truth of the matter is the Americans who survived that attack cannot legally reveal to members of the press or most lawmakers that they were even witnesses to the attack in Benghazi.
According to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, immediately following the attack, the FBI, as part of the agency’s investigation, interviewed survivors of the Benghazi attack.
Bill Bransford, a Washington, D.C. attorney at Shaw Bransford & Roth P.C. who specializes in federal employment law told Breitbart News on Tuesday, “First of all, I’m assuming that most of these people who witnessed the attack, except for the State Department folks, would be intelligence people, and they are not covered by the whistle blower protection laws.”


Bransford added, “They are covered by whatever policies their agency has. An executive order that President Obama issued in the late fall in which he ordered the intelligence community to come up with a more effective whistle blower protection system, which has not yet been developed.”
However, as federal employees, State Department personnel must sign non-disclosure agreements. Bransford stressed, “If somebody violates one of these non-disclosure agreements, the consequences could include: interfering with a criminal investigation, obstruction of justice, criminal charges for releasing classified information, and those are pretty serious.”
Serious indeed. The Obama administration’s Justice Department has prosecuted more federal employees for leaking information to the press under the 1917 Espionage Act than all other administrations combined. Bloomberg News reported last September:


Lowell, the Washington defense lawyer who has counted as his clients the likes of Jack Abramoff, the former Washington lobbyist, and political figures including former presidential candidate John Edwards, said the Obama administration is using the Espionage Act “like a club” against government employees accused of leaks.
The prosecutions, which Obama and the Justice Department have defended on national security grounds, mean that government officials who speak to the media can face financial and professional ruin as they spend years fighting for their reputations, and, in some cases, their freedom.

Since Breitbart News first broke in December that the Obama administration was hiding Benghazi attack survivors, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) began demanding the FBI hand over to Congress the interviews the agency conducted with individuals who survived the deadly attack.
Senator Graham spoke to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday last weekend about his frustration regarding the issue:

WALLACE: Senator, let me pick up on one of them I find, frankly, quite astonishing. What is the administration’s explanation for the fact the FBI interviewed the survivors, all the Americans who safely got out of Benghazi, right after the attack, months ago, and that they refused to give the transcripts of the interviews to Congress. What’s their explanation for that?
GRAHAM: This is an ongoing criminal investigation is what they told me. We are going back to the law enforcement model, where we’re treating al Qaeda as sort of a mafia, common criminal element rather than enemy combatants.
And here’s what was really stunning, the FBI interviewed the survivors, two days after the attack in Germany and, the CIA never called the FBI for weeks, wanting the results of the interview before they made their assessments — we are going back to the pre-9/11 mentality of — where we treat it as a law enforcement function, and FBI and the CIA never talk to each other, which is very dangerous.
Benghazi was system failure, before, during and after.

Clinton testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January that there were about 25 to 30 survivors and she only spoke to one. Many of the individuals who worked at the U.S. compound were either CIA or State Department employees.
Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is not only heavily guarded on the outside but on the inside as well, some say. In December 2012, visitors to the amputee ward at the NNMMC (Bethesda Hospital) observed what appeared to be Secret Service personnel moving in and out of a closed wing of the floor that was off-limits to everyone else.

According to Fox News, former Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of State, visited Benghazi survivors at Walter Reed on February 4th. Fox News host Greta Van Susteren asked Senator Graham about Kerry’s visit.

I’ve been asking in November, we wrote to the president. The person I blame above all others is President Obama, did you know president Obama, in April or June why wasn’t the Congress informed. They were interviewed two days by the FBI you know the CIA never called up the FBI and say, what did they say about the attack. If you talk to the survivors, you would have known it was a coordinated terrorist attack and not a mob.

Bransford points out that, to the extent that these potential witnesses are State Department employees, they are governed by the whistle blower protection act as modified by the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, which just went into effect six weeks ago. According to Bransford, it does have a provision in it about non-disclosure agreements, but that some of the changes may not yet be in effect because the law is so new and the employee is supposed to be aware of the non-disclosure policies.

For example, it would be consistent with the law on classified information and what they’re allowed to tell Congress. That’s an area that’s kind of brand new and it would only apply to the non-intelligence people–like diplomatic security agents. The FBI probably interviewed them.
It is customary and probably consistent with valid non-disclosure policy to tell somebody who is a witness in an ongoing criminal investigation, which of course the FBI is there, so it’s criminal and counter-terrorism, to tell (witnesses) they are not to discuss the substance of the interview or what they discussed with the investigating agents with anyone. And that would be consistent with a valid non-disclosure policy. So, at this stage, to get (Benghazi survivors) to talk might be tough.

Is there any recourse for Benghazi survivors to ever tell their stories? Certain members of Congress who are authorized to receive information of an ongoing FBI investigation may be these individuals’ only outlets to do so.
He added, “Does that mean that they can’t release it later? Maybe. Meaning there could be some political stuff going on to try and get that information but I’m not sure what’s going to happen with that.”
Senator Charles Grassley (R – IA), the co-author of the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act sent a statement to Breitbart News on the law:

Unfortunately, whistleblower protection laws are necessary. We’ve seen far too many people who are shunned to a corner, or worse, for simply trying to do the right thing by exposing wrongdoing within the federal government. The Whistleblower Protection Act allows a federal employee to come to Congress, or others as designated by Congress, and provide information about wrongdoing, including waste, fraud and abuse of government programs. There are additional protections for whistleblowers who come forward to Congress, such as the Lloyd-Lafollette Act and the Anti-Gag statute. By coming to a member of Congress, we can create a formal record of the protected correspondence between the member and the whistleblower which should serve as a reminder to the federal agency that actions of retaliation are against the law.

Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission for the United States in Libya, and the top US official in Libya after the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks, testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today – and he told Congress that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department lawyers tried to stop him from talking to Congresspeople investigating. “I was instructed not to allow the RSO [Regional Security Officer], the acting deputy chief of mission and myself to be personally interviewed by Congressman [Jason] Chaffetz [of Utah],” said Hicks. 

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) couldn’t believe what he was hearing: “So the people at State told you, ‘Don’t talk to the guy who is coming to investigate?'” Hicks’ answer: “Yes, sir.” Jordan pressed: “You’ve had several congressional delegations come to various places you’ve been around the world. Has that ever happened, where lawyers get on the phone to you prior to a congressional delegate coming to investigate … Have you ever had anyone tell you, ‘Don’t talk with the people from Congress coming to find out what took place?” Hicks: “Never.”

Jordan then asked Hicks whether a lawyer from State had been sent with Hicks when the Congressional delegation arrived – whether State had forced a minder on Hicks. “Yes, sir, that’s true,” said Hicks. Hicks went on to describe a classified briefing he had with Rep. Chaffetz in Libya: “The lawyer was excluded from the meeting because his clearance was not high enough, and the delegation had insisted that the hearing not be limited.” Hicks stated that the lawyer attempted to get into the briefing anyway, and the annex chief would not allow it. 

After that meeting, Hicks was called by Cheryl Mills, counselor for the State Department and staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mills was deputy White House counsel under the Clinton administration, and she was termed the “shining star of the defense team” for President Clinton’s Senate impeachment trial. Jordan described Mills as “as close as you can get to Secretary Clinton.” Hicks told the story: “A phone call from that … person is generally not considered to be good news …. She demanded a report on the visit … She was upset … She was very upset.”

Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Fox News over the weekend that the Obama administration is telling individuals who were rescued during the deadly Benghazi attack last September to be quiet about what they know. 
Graham said he “had contact” with survivors and described their accounts as “chilling.” “The bottom line is they feel that they can’t come forth, they’ve been told to be quiet.”
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney refuted that the administration is gagging survivors, telling Fox News last week, “I’m sure that the White House is not preventing anyone from speaking,”


Graham does not buy it and is threatening to hold up all business in the upper chamber if the White House does not release the names of the survivors to Congress. Graham is urging his colleagues in the House to move forward and issue subpoenas of Benghazi survivors if the administration fails to release any information on them. 
“To our leadership in the House, you’re gonna have to up your game on Benghazi,” the South Carolina Republican said. 
Breitbart News first reported in December that Congressman Jason Chaffetz  (R-UT) was being stonewalled by the Obama administration from visiting the injured survivors of the Benghazi attack. 

Since then, Senator Graham has demanded the FBI turn over the interviews with the survivors to no avail. Graham, Senators John McCain (R-AZ), and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) all called for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi assault, while Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA) re-issued a second resolution to form a House Select committee to do the same. 
Wolf and Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA) demanded Sec. Kerry to hand over the contact information of all the State Department employees who worked at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred. Wolf’s resolution currently boasts over 60 co-sponsors.
Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, and Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA), chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee, are looking forward to hear from Benghazi survivors as well.
“We’ll get our chance to talk to Benghazi survivors and get the reports from the FBI. That will happen. I’m confident of that,” Chairman Rogers told Breitbart News. “We want to make sure people have a chance to heal first and we’ll have an opportunity to talk these people before this is over. I’m fairly comfortable this will happen,” he said.
Chairman Issa noted that Secretary of State John Kerry’s visit to a Benghazi survivor opened the door for Congress to question anyone who was on the ground and survived the Benghazi attack. “We expected to speak with all the witnesses and the Benghazi survivors,” he told Breitbart News. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees.” 
Any Benghazi survivor who talks to his committee would be protected from prosecution or job termination from the Obama administration, Rogers said. “We’ll make sure of that. That is whistle bower standard protection. If they’re fired for talking to us, there’ll be some hell to pay.”
Issa agrees, saying, “Any kind of retaliation against any of the witnesses we’ve already had would not be tolerated.” 
Four Americans were killed on site when the U.S. mission in Benghazi was attacked, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens. Questions remain, however, as to the physical health of those who were evacuated from the U.S. compound. Rogers cannot confirm if any evacuee later succumbed to their injuries while being treated at medical facilities.
The Michigan Republican explained, “Like I said, I don’t know. We’ll know before it’s over. My review is not over yet. We’re looking at all the information. We still have cables and emails that we still haven’t gone through one hundred percent yet. It’s voluminous.”  He added, “Were going through it painstakingly. I’m just an old FBI guy, so I’m going through it painstakingly to find to find the truth. My goal is to find the truth. And wherever those facts and leads takes us.”

During her testimony on the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano declared that she, President Barack Obama and other political officials at the top of this administration have the authority to decide which laws to enforce, and which ones to ignore. 
Napolitano made the declaration in an exchange with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) when he was questioning her on how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have alleged that political officials in the Obama administration, including her, have blocked them from enforcing the law.
Sessions noted that ICE agents’ union president Chris Crane had testified on Monday “that agents are prohibited from enforcing the law and, indeed, the ICE officers have filed a lawsuit [to that effect].”


“I started out as a federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice in 1975,” Sessions said. “I have never heard of a situation in which a group of law officers sued their supervisor and you for blocking them from following the law. They weren’t complaining about pay, benefits, working conditions. They were saying their very oath they took, to enforce the law, is being blocked by rules and regulations and policies established from on high and that this is undermining their ability to do what they’re sworn to do.”
In her response to those remarks from Sessions, Napolitano said she believes she and other political officials have the authority to tell law enforcement agents which laws to enforce and which ones to ignore. 
“There are tensions with union leadership, unfortunately, but here’s what I expect as a former federal prosecutor and attorney general, and that is that law enforcement agents will enforce the law in accord with the guidance they’re given from their superiors,” Napolitano said. “That’s what we ask of ICE, that’s what we ask of Border Patrol, that’s what we ask throughout the Department and I believe that would be consistent with all law enforcement. Agents don’t set the enforcement priorities. Those are set by their superiors and they are asked then to obey that guidance in accord with the law.”

Sessions was not pleased with Napolitano’s response, so he followed up by asking: “”Well, what Mr. Crane testified to was that there are law provisions that say an agent shall do this, that and the other, and that the policies set by their political supervisors refuse to allow them to do what the law plainly requires. You are not entitled to set policies, are you, that violate the mandates of congressional law?”
Napolitano answered that question by saying she “disagree[s] with almost everything” Sessions has said, “but we’ll just have to respectfully disagree with each other.”
“But, I think it does point to why this bill needs to be passed, because what we want our officers doing is focusing on narco-traffickers and human smugglers and money launderers and others who misuse our border and our immigration system,” Napolitano said. “By having a process by which those in the country illegally can pay a fine, pay fees, register so we know who they are, by dealing with the employer demand for illegal labor, by opening up the visa system, that will have the effect, basically, of confirming the focus of resources where they need to be.”
Despite Napolitano’s and the administration’s belief that they can tell law enforcement agents which laws to enforce and which ones to ignore, the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill cedes even more authority away from Congress and gives it to the administration.
In their lines of questioning with Napolitano during Tuesday’s hearing, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) focused on how the bill cedes authority. In a statement he issued after the hearing indicating he is not satisfied with the bill’s so-called “border security triggers” that are supposedly meant to ensure the border actually gets secured, Cruz said he does not trust the bill will actually secure the border. 
“As it stands, the border security component – which numbers only 58 pages of the 844-page bill – largely cedes authority to the Department of Homeland Security to determine when and how the border would be secure,” Cruz said. “However, today’s hearing revealed that the last clear metric for border security – ‘operational control’ – reflected that in 2010, DHS had secured 873 miles of the more than 2,000 mile border. When that metric did not demonstrate success, DHS decided to simply abandon the metric. In order for a metric to be real, it must be meaningful. Currently, there are no objective metrics in place to ensure any triggers in this bill will be meaningful, all while the pathway to citizenship component remains contingent on this undefined border security.”
Lee similarly questioned why the Gang of Eight bill gives Napolitano and the administration so much authority. “Some of the questions that I have as I’ve read through this bill over the last few days relate to the amount of discretion you are given, you and your successors will be given over time, should this become law,” Lee opened his line of questioning with Napolitano on Tuesday.
Even Gang of Eight member Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) admits the amount of authority the bill would cede to the administration is controversial. “Biggest challenge on #immigrationreform has been well founded lack of trust that Obama administration will enforce the law,” Rubio Tweeted on Tuesday. “Its [sic] a big problem”

Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission for the United States in Libya, and the top US official in Libya after the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks, testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today – and he told Congress that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department lawyers tried to stop him from talking to Congresspeople investigating. “I was instructed not to allow the RSO [Regional Security Officer], the acting deputy chief of mission and myself to be personally interviewed by Congressman [Jason] Chaffetz [of Utah],” said Hicks. 

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) couldn’t believe what he was hearing: “So the people at State told you, ‘Don’t talk to the guy who is coming to investigate?'” Hicks’ answer: “Yes, sir.” Jordan pressed: “You’ve had several congressional delegations come to various places you’ve been around the world. Has that ever happened, where lawyers get on the phone to you prior to a congressional delegate coming to investigate … Have you ever had anyone tell you, ‘Don’t talk with the people from Congress coming to find out what took place?” Hicks: “Never.”

Jordan then asked Hicks whether a lawyer from State had been sent with Hicks when the Congressional delegation arrived – whether State had forced a minder on Hicks. “Yes, sir, that’s true,” said Hicks. Hicks went on to describe a classified briefing he had with Rep. Chaffetz in Libya: “The lawyer was excluded from the meeting because his clearance was not high enough, and the delegation had insisted that the hearing not be limited.” Hicks stated that the lawyer attempted to get into the briefing anyway, and the annex chief would not allow it. 

After that meeting, Hicks was called by Cheryl Mills, counselor for the State Department and staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mills was deputy White House counsel under the Clinton administration, and she was termed the “shining star of the defense team” for President Clinton’s Senate impeachment trial. Jordan described Mills as “as close as you can get to Secretary Clinton.” Hicks told the story: “A phone call from that … person is generally not considered to be good news …. She demanded a report on the visit … She was upset … She was very upset.”

Well, if it is Thursday, there must be a new Obama scandal. But one thing is for damn sure: whatever that scandal is, you can bet the American mainstream media will be playing catch up and not having the glory of breaking a story about a major White House scandal. 
Fact: Over the past few weeks, four major scandals have broken over the Obama administration, and it is a very sad (and frightening) truth that our pathetic, American, lapdog mainstream media are not responsible for breaking even a single one. 
Verizon? Nope, not our guys. That was the Brits over at The Guardian.  


IRS? Nope, not our guys. The IRS broke their own scandal with a planted question. 
The Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press phone records? Nope, not our guys. Believe it or not, the Associated Press didn’t even break that story. Like the IRS, we only found out because the Justice Department outted itself in a letter notifying the AP of what it had done. 
Benghazi? Are you kidding. With a couple of rare exceptions (Jake Tapper, Sharyl Attkisson) the media have spent the last eight months attacking those seeking the truth (Congress, Fox News)–not seeking the truth. It was the GOP congress that demanded the email exchanges concerning the shaping of the talking points, not the media. 

Left up to the media, we wouldn’t know anything about Libya. All of the media’s energy was collectively poured into ensuring the truth was never discovered. 
And do you want to know what makes this realization especially pathetic? In three of the four scandals (the AP being the exception), had our media been less interested in protecting Power and more interested in holding Power accountable, these huge, career-making stories were right there for the taking. 
For over a year now, conservative Tea Party groups have been complaining about IRS harassment. But because Obama told them to, the media hate the Tea Party. So in the face of these complaints and even a few Congressional inquiries, the media either ignored the harassment reports or openly sided with the IRS. (No joke. Click the link.)
Obviously, you can say the same about Libya. All the dots were there to connect: Security failures, two weeks of lies, the midnight arrest of some hapless filmmaker… But rather than connect the dots, the media played goalie for Obama against Fox News and Darrell Issa. Besides, there was a re-election to win and Todd Akin got something wrong about The Womanparts. 
Moreover, there are still plenty of dots to connect about Libya. But the new SQUIRREL is OVERREACH, and already the lapdogs are back in goalie formation. 

As for the Verizon story, members of Congress, specifically Democrat Senators Ron Wyden (OR) and Mark Udall (CO), have been hint-hint-wink-winking to the media that something is horribly amiss going back to December:
In a Senate floor speech in December, Wyden hinted at classified information he had received but could not share due to Senate rules that indicated the law “on Americans’ privacy has been real, and it is not hypothetical.”

“When the public finds out that these secret interpretations are so dramatically different than what the public law says, I think there’s going to be extraordinary anger in the country,” he told The Huffington Post the following month.
That is from today’s Politico report on the Verizon scandal. Apparently, Politico knew of this back in December but had all their investigative researchers digging into why those short-skirted Tea Partiers had it coming, so they missed another one of the biggest stories of the year. 
Politico shouldn’t feel bad, though, because when it comes to missing the four biggest scoops of the Obama administration, they have plenty of lazy, lapdog, sycophant company in that department. 

Our media are not only biased; it is an utter and complete failure and embarrassment. And although there are plenty of remaining table scraps to make meals out of, the media are already losing interest in the IRS, Libya, and AP scandals, but for only one reason–they are absolutely terrified of where they might lead. 
During the Bush years, it was the New York Times, Washington Post and Sy Hersh breaking story  after story after story about the White House. And yes, some of that reporting was–ahem –overreach, but at least Power knew it was being watched; our democracy was safe because an overzealous media  is what you call a luxury problem. 
Today, it is the complete opposite, and the result is an administration run amok. 
Get down on your knees and thank your Maker for conservative New Media, Roger Ailes, and for the few true liberals left in the media, like Glenn Greenwald–who works for the Brits.

The former chief strategist for left-wing billionaire George Soros has joined Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg in an effort to push amnesty for America’s illegal immigrants, Bloomberg reports.
Stanley Druckenmiller, who Bloomberg reports served as Soros’s “chief strategist” for “more than 10 years” as a client money manager, has joined Zuckerberg’s efforts at FWD.us to push for comprehensive immigration reform. 
Druckenmiller served as the lead portfolio manager for Soros’ Quantum Fund from 1988 until 2000. According to Bloomberg, he “produced average annual returns of 30 percent at his hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management LLC” from 1986 through 2010.


In addition to hiring Druckenmiller, Zuckerberg funds former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour’s “Americans for a Conservative Direction.” According to the New York Times, that group has been one of the many special interests at the forefront of trying to push conservatives in the House of Representatives to support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The Times wrote recently that Barbour’s Zuckerberg-funded group “has been running ads in Iowa lately that implore those watching to ‘stand with Marco Rubio to end de facto amnesty.'”

The Mexican government once paid Barbour to lobby on behalf of amnesty for illegal immigrants inside the United States.
Other special interest groups are lobbying for the House to pass an amnesty program, as well. 
The American Action Network, a group led by former Minnesota Republican Sen. Norm Coleman, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on television and radio ads pushing the Senate’s immigration bill in the House. Coleman founded the American Action Network with Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign National Finance Committee co-chair Fred Malek. In addition to his various roles in politics, Malek is the founder and chairman of Thayer Lodging Group.
Karl Rove is similarly spending money pushing amnesty. “Certainly the way in which the bill is perceived and Rubio’s own political fortunes are closely entwined,” Steven Law, the president of Rove’s American Crossroads, said a few weeks ago. “Our first priority is to promote and advance immigration reform, and to talk about the ways this advances conservative goals. If we do that we will not only be helping to move legislation, but it will also protect those who stuck their necks out like Rubio.”
Before those special interests started their lobbying and advertising campaigns for amnesty in the House, most of House GOP leadership seemed to brush off the Senate’s bill. After weeks of pressure from these special interests, however, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will hold a hearing on his version of the “DREAM Act” on Tuesday, an amnesty provision for young illegal immigrants. 
Beyond Druckenmiller’s role, several Soros-backed groups are involved in the effort to pass amnesty. As Breitbart News has reported, the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) and the National Immigration Forum (NIF) are funded by the progressive billionaire.

One of the more insignificant, yet pernicious, spending cuts in the Ryan-Murray budget is a reduction in military pensions. The changes would apply to current active-duty and retired military personnel under the age of 62. Many military families view these changes as a broken promise and, Breitbart News has learned, are convening a “Twitter Town Hall” Monday night in opposition to the budget deal. The grass roots event is targeting Senators up for reelection next year with the hashtag #KeepYourPromise.
“The President and Congress’s failure to watch the back of those who have served their country for twenty or more years in the military, particularly over the last twelve years of war, will ensure the next generation of potential recruits understands that their word means nothing,” Jeremy Hilton, an organizer of the event told Breitbart News. 
Hilton is a Navy veteran and in 2012 was named “Military Spouse of the Year” by Armed Forces insurance. His wife currently serves as an officer in the Air Force. 


“Military families understand that costs must be constrained,” Hilton continued. “[B]ut all of us have watched DoD flush money down the drain in Afghanistan, here in the states by buying Aeron chairs “because we have to spend it before the end of the year”, or multi-billion congressional boondoggles….we have seen waste that borders on the obscene.”

The Ryan-Murray deal pushes active-duty and veterans into a new pension plan that lowers their yearly cost-of-living adjustment. Instead of keep pace with inflation, the new yearly adjustment would be equal to inflation minus 1%. Once the veteran turns 62, the yearly adjustment would fully account for inflation going forward. 
The change is expected to save around $7 billion over the next decade. The money coming out of veterans’ pension checks wouldn’t go to deficit reduction or paying down debt, however. It would go to finance increased government spending. 
Rep. Paul Ryan defended the cut to military pensions over the weekend. “We give them a slightly smaller adjustment for inflation because they’re still in their working years and in most cases earning another paycheck,” Ryan said. 
Ryan’s defense is beside the point. It isn’t really a question of whether or not a veteran can “afford” the pension benefit cut. It’s a question of whether the government should honor a commitment it’s made to its military personnel, especially at a time when the demands on them and their families are so great. 
“So, at the end of twelve years of fighting,” Hilton told Breitbart News, “you are going to break faith with the men and women who have spent half of that time away from their families?”

If there are any questions remaining about the changing of the guard in the GOP, Senator John McCain’s answer to a simple question about whom he would support in a potential 2016 presidential match-up between Hillary Clinton and Rand Paul should answer that. When asked for which one he would vote, McCain laughed and said: “It’s gonna be a tough choice.”
It is quite telling that McCain would say such a thing to the left-wing New Republic, especially after he seemed so outraged after the bungling and subsequent cover up surrounding the September 11 anniversary attacks on our consulate in Libya. 
Whatever differences McCain and Paul might have over policy, four people were murdered on Hillary Clinton’s watch at the State Department, and her reaction to those trying to get to the bottom of it were famously met with Clinton screeching, “What difference does it make?” 


Moreover, you would think Clinton’s indifference to repeated requests for increased security for our diplomatic team in Libya would border on something close to unforgivable for a former POW. Not to mention the fact no one in the administration even tried to rescue or reinforce a group of Americans under attack. 

But we are undoubtedly in the middle of a changing of the guard in the GOP. The McCains, Roves, and Grahams see their time coming to an end, and in response they have, at times, launched nihilistic campaigns against the Tea Party, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, etc. 
Rove runs to the New York Times to attack his own, McCain runs to the New Republic to slash away at one of our rising stars by giving The Grand Dame of Libya  a credibility boost…
Seems that the mayors of the village are willing to burn it down rather than see themselves replaced.

5439	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/02/15/Left-Targets-Cruz-Conservatives-but-Case-Against-Hagel-Stronger-than-Ever	Opinion	0	Elections	National Security	SomewhatPositive	Negative	breitbart.com	"
Decrying yesterday’s filibuster of the confirmation of former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) as Secretary of Defense, the White House and the media have decided to target his critics, especially Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Yet they should welcome the extension of debate, which provides an opportunity for Senators who once expressed concerns, such as Chuck Schumer (D-NY), to revisit their conclusions in light of new information.
The case for Hagel remains exceedingly weak. Some Democrats claim that he has the necessary qualifications to lead the Pentagon, but not even the Obama-friendly Politico supports that argument, noting Jan. 31 that Hagel’s main qualification was “politician.” Hagel’s supporters keep citing his admirable military record, but it is not a qualification for a primarily civilian post which requires an intimate knowledge of defense policy.


Hagel, by his own admission, does not know much about the Department of Defense. During his two terms in in the Senate, he served on the Foreign Relations Committee, not the Armed Services Committee. He has some broad views about how the country’s defenses ought to change, but these are shifting, and vague. He has argued both for and against defense cuts, for example, and does not understand the defense sequester.
The case against Hagel, on the other hand, grows stronger every day. From a left-wing point of view, his weaknesses were obvious from the start. He had expressed hostile views toward gays and supported “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” He had led the fight to block climate change from moving through the Senate, and would now be stepping in to lead a Pentagon that has committed in recent years to the use of green fuels and technology.
Hagel also had subscribed to the slate of socially conservative views demonized by the Democrats as a “war on women,” such as opposition to abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother. The Armed Services Committee also quietly examined criticisms about how Hagel had dealt with allegations of sexual harassment among members of his staff–a bad sign when the military is trying to stamp out such abuse.

For Democrats, an additional irritation was that Hagel’s nomination sent a signal that the party still lacked the self-confidence to run the Pentagon. As Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos wrote in December: 

Hagel is a Republican who voted for all of George W. Bush’s pet wars….And yes, while he has reneged on his past support for our nation’s disastrous wars, there are plenty of good qualified Democrats who weren’t idiotic enough to support them in the first place.  
It’s time for Democrats to embrace the fact that yes, they know what the hell they’re doing on matters of national security.

The only case for Hagel, from a left-wing perspective, was that the “neoconservatives”–i.e. those who favored a dominant military, an assertive foreign policy, and a strong U.S.-Israel alliance–were opposed to him. Hagel’s nomination offered the anti-war movement, especially its anti-Israel elements, a chance to shift the debate in their favor.
The Obama administration worked hard to prevent Democrats from defecting, sending Hagel to consult with Schumer and to write regretful letters to the likes of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), expressing regret for having used such phrases such as “Jewish lobby” and reassuring her of his commitment to carry out President Barack Obama’s policies, with which his own previous views were in apparent conflict on a variety of subjects.
But the administration could not head off Republican queries, especially as more new information about Hagel’s past positions, much of it unearthed by the conservative new media, began to surface. Even the mainstream media began to take a skeptical view, with editorials opposing Hagel in both the Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune.
The principal worry was Hagel’s views on Iran. Not only had Hagel opposed the use of military force, if necessary, to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, but he had also opposed the use of sanctions. He had also advocated “engaging” the Tehran regime, which to this day shows no interest in direct talks. Hagel’s appointment was therefore a sign of weakness in opposing Iran–the worst possible signal at the worst possible time.

Hagel’s views on Israel were also troubling–not least because of their implications for the American military. He had opposed designating Iranian-backed Hezbollah as a terror group, and advocated U.S. talks with Hamas in Gaza. He also denounced Israel’s war of self-defense against Hezbollah in 2006, calling it “disproportionate” and equating it with terror against Israeli civilians, undermining the basis of the U.S. war against terror.
Much controversy centered around Hagel’s use of the term “Jewish lobby,” a misnomer that implies Jewish control over U.S. foreign policy, and which was in vogue among the extreme left at the time as a scapegoat for the war in Iraq. Hagel now says that he misspoke, but new allegations that he claimed in 2007 that Israel controlled the U.S. State Department reinforce worries that he may have entertained antisemitic bias.

Perhaps the most self-destructive position Hagel had previously adopted was support for global nuclear disarmament, including the specific idea that the U.S. should begin to disarm unilaterally if necessary. In his confirmation hearing, Hagel attempted to deny that he had endorsed that view, but patient cross-examination by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) demonstrated that Hagel had, in fact, affixed his name to that radical suggestion. 
The most recent nuclear test by North Korea, the ongoing atrocities by a Syrian regime that Hagel once suggested the U.S. should court, the continued belligerence of Iran and persistent terrorism by Hamas are all evidence that Hagel’s views on defense and foreign policy were naive at best, and dangerous at worst. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) also took Hagel to task for his strident opposition to the successful surge in Iraq.
In his confirmation hearing, Hagel not only failed to defend his views, but failed to show familiarity with the official policies of the administration he hoped to enter, mistakenly referring to a policy of “containment” with Iran and describing the Tehran regime as a “legitimate” government. Having failed to demonstrate that his recent shifts on several issues were sincere, he meekly asserted that his own views on policy would not matter.

The problem with Hagel’s performance at the hearing was not just that he stumbled, but that he dissembled, making a number of assertions that were shown to be untrue. Hagel also failed to provide more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given in previous years, and explained that he had “given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there, every video that I have that’s out there.”
Yet in the days that followed, several speeches emerged about which Hagel had not informed the committee, including some within the five-year timeframe that members of the committee had requested. Hagel and the Obama administration maintained that these speeches had been “informal,” but the fact that Hagel spoke extemporaneously did not make the speeches any less official, as video of one such speech confirmed.
Hagel also refused to provide complete information about possible sources of possible foreign income over the past five years, particularly indirect compensation he may have received through organizations or funds with which he has been affiliated. The Atlantic Council, which he chairs, is known to have accepted large donations from the Hariri family, which is active in Lebanese politics and supportive of the Hamas organization. 
After missing the deadline that Senators had imposed for disclosure, Hagel provided a list of foreign government and corporate donors to the Atlantic Council. He refused to provide additional information, saying he could not force other organizations to do the same. Democrats charged that Republicans were holding Hagel to an unprecedented standard; Republicans cited Democrats’ own demands that Henry Kissinger provide a list of his firm’s clients when he was nominated to the 9/11 commission, as well as the case of Hillary Clinton, who released a list of foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation.
It was Hagel’s refusal to come clean–and his evident attempts to evade transparency–that ultimately united the Republican caucus in the Senate behind a filibuster, including some members who had initially expressed strong reservations about using the tactic.
The resulting delay will provide the Senate with several more days in which to consider Hagel’s candidacy, and for the White House to consider other options. The very fact that Hagel’s nomination has proved so divisive, and has exposed so many weaknesses in the nominee, is itself an argument for withdrawal. In a time of rising threats and looming budget challenges, the Pentagon will not be served by a perception of weak leadership.
Any one of the many factors above should, by itself, have disqualified Hagel from even being considered for the post. But President Obama has thrown out the rules many times before in his quest to transform America. Hagel is, in a sense, the Obamacare of Cabinet nominations: a deeply problematic policy choice that may have the votes to pass but lacks broad public support and may ultimately cost far more than advertised.
The Republican filibuster may hold; it may not. But if even a few Democrats make the right choice–the kind of well-considered choice made by moderate Sen Susan Collins (R-ME), for example–then Hagel’s nomination will collapse on the merits. If they are honest with themselves, Democrats must admit that they would not even think about confirming Hagel except for the fact that Obama has staked his political capital on it.
The left’s attacks on Sen. Cruz, on conservative media, and on pro-Israel activists may serve the president’s political interests. He relishes opportunities to paint the opposition as intransigent. Yet the Hagel nomination is a good example of why the filibuster is necessary as a restraint on the majority, a way to help it correct its mistakes before they become irrevocable. Obama and his party have one last chance to do the right thing.

While conservatives grapple with Obama’s nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel to head the Defense Department, the Left is struggling with Obama’s decision to nominate John Brennan as the new CIA Director. Dubbed the “Assassination Czar” by the far-left program Democracy Now, Brennan was Obama’s original choice to head the CIA when he was first elected in 2008. An uproar from the left, however, caused Brennan to withdraw his nomination. With reelection safely behind him, though, Obama clearly feels emboldened to push again for Brennan. 
The left’s ire was particularly acute four years ago, because Brennan had been a high-level CIA official during the Bush Administration. At the time, the left was consumed with moral urgency to reverse many Bush anti-terror policies. Brennan was seen as a key player in the development of those policies.

Brennan spent years at the CIA and served as chief of staff to former director George Tenet during the creation of the post-9/11 detention and interrogation programs. The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer described him as a “supporter” of the programs, which included torture and the use of secret prison “black sites.”

After he withdrew his name for consideration for the CIA job, Brennan was appointed by Obama to be his chief counter-terrorism advisor. In that role, he has overseen a sweeping expansion of the drone program and adoption of a “kill list,” where the President can order targeted assassinations of terrorists. 



Brennan has helped construct and justify the Administration’s claim that it can kill people, including American citizens, abroad on its own authority, even when those people are not in countries with which we are at war. His speech in April was a sort of catechism, culminating in “targeted strikes are wise.” We have done it in Pakistan and Yemen; could we do it in London or Paris?

In the aftermath of Brennan’s nomination yesterday, the ACLU cautioned the Senate not to proceed with confirmation “until it assesses the legality of his actions in past leadership positions in the CIA during the early years of the George W. Bush administration and in his current role in the ongoing targeted killing program”. ACLU’s statement is telling, since the organization doesn’t usually take positions on nominees for the executive branch. 

Obama’s decision to forge ahead with Brennan’s nomination suggests he feels he has a personal political mandate following his reelection. Brennan’s legacy hasn’t changed in the four years since his name was first floated as CIA Director. If anything, the civil libertarian critique of his record has strengthened, given the increased use of drone strikes and targeted assassinations. 
Obama understands, however, that much of the left’s outrage directed against Bush wasn’t as much about his specific policies as his political affiliation. Obama has continued most of the Bush-era anti-terror policies, as even staunch leftists now wearily acknowledge. 

Although I actively opposed Brennan’s CIA nomination in 2008, I can’t quite muster the energy or commitment to do so now. Indeed, the very idea that someone should be disqualified from service in the Obama administration because of involvement in and support for extremist Bush terrorism polices seems quaint and obsolete, given the great continuity between Bush and Obama on these issues. Whereas in 2008 it seemed uncertain in which direction Obama would go, making it important who wielded influence, that issue is now settled: Brennan is merely a symptom of Obama’s own extremism in these areas, not a cause. This continuity will continue with or without Brennan because they are, rather obviously, Obama’s preferred policies.

A tiredness usually settles in during a President’s second term. Even the left gets weary of its moral outrage. While the usual suspects are expressing outrage over Brennan’s nomination, his confirmation fight will likely end with a whimper. As Greenwald notes, these are “obviously Obama’s preferred policies.”

Some of you younger folks might not remember this, but there was a time when the media questioned Power. No, really, once upon a time, the media saw it as its duty to be forever questioning and skeptical of Power, especially when Power was in pursuit of more power. 
For example, Obama is attempting to grab more power for The State and criminals by way of gun control laws that infringe on our Second Amendment civil rights. In order to make his case, Obama is attempting to appear reasonable on the issue of guns, and one way he did this was to reassure Americans that he too is a sport shooter, and enjoys skeet shooting at Camp David. 


Now, to those familiar with Obama’s record of opposing guns at every turn and lying about almost everything, that struck us as odd. 
Today, however, the White House released a photo that purports to show Obama (love that tucked-in shirt) shooting skeet last August. Except… he’s shooting straight ahead, which means that there’s either a barn door somewhere in need of some patching, or Obama is such an awesome skeet shooter, he hits them as they come out of the firing device. 
I keed, I keed. There are legitimate reasons that would explain the angle of his gun, but….

Because the photo is odd, some are asking perfectly legitimate questions.  
But not the media. 
What did the media do? 
Because the media no longer questions or is skeptical of Power, and instead sees its role as protector of The State, the media mocked those who were skeptical:

That doesn’t include tweets mocking skeptics that the likes of Ben Smith and a number of Politico reporters are gleefully retweeting. 
Thus far, I haven’t seen a single tweet from the media making the point that a single photo doesn’t quite square the circle of Obama making it sound as though he regularly shoots skeet. 
Couple important things to keep in mind: Again, Obama is using skeet-shooting as a political talking point to further an agenda. So this is not an inconsequential matter, as some claim. 
Secondly, while firing off this talking point, Obama made it sound as though he regularly shoots skeet. But it won’t matter that the White House has only released a single photo and thus far refuses to disclose how many times Obama’s actually shot skeet. 
You see, the media is proud to publicly proclaim that it doesn’t matter if Obama lies. No, really. How depressing to know a White House reporter at a major news outlet doesn’t give a “rat’s a**” if  the president of the United States is lying: 
—

Question isn’t whether Obama ever shot skeet. The question is did he shoot skeet to get a photo shot… And who gives a rat’s ass?

So why so much immediate mockery from the media? Well, rather than pushback against a White House trying to shut down skeptics, as soon as this tweet was released from a top Obama guy, the media did as it was told:

Under the Gang of 8’s backroom immigration deal with Senators Schumer, Corker and Hoeven, formerly illegal immigrants who are amnestied will be eligible to work, but will not be eligible for ObamaCare. Employers who would be required to pay as much as a $3,000 penalty for most employees who receive an ObamaCare healthcare “exchange” subsidy, would not have to pay the penalty if they hire amnestied immigrants. 
Consequently, employers would have a significant incentive to hire or retain amnestied immigrants, rather than current citizens, including those who have recently achieved citizenship via the current naturalization process.
The issue is really an “interaction effect” of the immigration proposal and ObamaCare itself.  


Beginning in January, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees, that do not currently offer healthcare benefits that are considered “acceptable” by the Obama administration, must pay a penalty if at least one of their workers obtains insurance on a new government-run “exchange.” The penalty can be as much as $3,000 per employee.  

Many employers have been preparing to cope with the new regulations by slashing the hours of full-timers to part-time status. Since “full-time,” in the language of ObamaCare, is averaging 30 hours per week, employers will, in general, receive the penalty if they have 50 or more employees who are working an average of 30 hours per week.  
If the immigration bill becomes law, many employers could receive incentives of hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire amnestied immigrants over American citizens. In addition, these newly legalized immigrants could work “full-time,” an advantage for companies and businesses as well, while employers could lay off or diminish to “part-time” status, American workers. 
Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner explains that he spoke with Alex Conant of Sen. Marco Rubio’s staff in April about the wrinkle, and was told that this was an issue that could be addressed during the legislative process. 
“[T]he scenario you raise illustrates both the absurdity of ObamaCare, and why we have insisted on a lengthy process to review this legislation before any votes are taken,” Conant emailed Klein. “We always expected there might be a need for amendments to fix technical problems, and we’ll be interested in seeing what sort of amendments might be offered to improve this part of the legislation without giving ObamaCare to illegals- something Sen. Rubio has always said he will not support.” 
However, as Klein said a couple of weeks ago, the issue has not been addressed and, in fact, the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven deal carries out what appears to be a major complication for American workers. Klein said that Conant did not respond to further requests for comment on this issue.  
As for Conant’s comment in April about Rubio insisting on a “lengthy process to review this legislation before votes are taken,” that seems to have gone with the wind as well.

Fred Hof, the career diplomat who led the US response for much of the Syrian crisis, slammed President Obama this weekend for his “strategically appalling” response to Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons. Hof, who last year was tasked by then Sec. of State Hillary Clinton and Obama to lead US negotiations to resolve Syria’s civil war, said Obama’s last-minute switch to seek Congressional approval for a military strike in Syria undermined US authority in the world.
“By not making it clear from the outset of the crisis that he would seek the approval of the Senate and House for a military response to the Assad regime’s chemical atrocity,” Hof wrote, “the president’s jarring change of direction now runs the risk of thoroughly undermining whatever remains of allied confidence in his leadership.”
Hof writes that, “the events of the past ten days suggest that there was no administration forethought to the possibility of a major chemical incident in Syria; there was no plan in place to respond to a major chemical attack by a regime that had already demonstrated its deep and abiding contempt for the president and his red lines.”


Hof argues that Obama’s recent actions would lead many to believe that the decision to seek Congressional approval “is less a bow to American constitutionality than a further attempt to kick the can down the road.”
Obama didn’t seek Congressional approval for the military action he authorized in Libya. That action was directed at toppling the regime of Libyan dictator Gadaffi, a more intense and much broader objective than Obama says he wants in Syria. In his remarks on Saturday, Obama even stated that he believes he has the authority to order a strike on Syria. That he didn’t, Hof argues, nor call Congress immediately back to Washington, undermines US credibility in the world. 
Hof is not some outside expert observing the seen from afar. He joined the Obama Administration at the start of the President’s first term as a special advisor of the Middle East. He worked closely with Clinton and Special Envoy George Mitchell on Middle East peace negotiations. He was the lead diplomat for issues related to Syria and Lebanon. 

In March, 2012, President Obama elevated him to the rank of Ambassador and gave him responsibility for handling the US response to the deteriorating situation in Syria. He abruptly resigned the position just 6 months later. News of his resignation came just two works after the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya. 
Hof’s critique of the Obama Administration is must reading for anyone trying to understand America’s increasingly feckless response to the events unfolding in Syria. Almost a year ago, President Obama told reporters that Syria’s use of chemical weapons was a “red line” that, if crossed would generate a US military response. It seems inconceivable that no contingency plans were draw up for just such an event. Yet, as Hof argues, that seems to be the case. 
Congress doesn’t return to Washington until next week. Even if strong support builds for military intervention, it will likely be several days before Congress approves action. This gives the Assad regime at least two weeks to prepare for any possible US attack. The regime is no doubt, even today, moving its chemical weapons arsenal to unknown locations. The limited engagement Obama claims he wants may be completely ineffective. 
As Hof laments, “there will be no ‘do-overs.'”

New footage of a speech by Chuck Hagel in 2008 has surfaced, in which the former Senator mocked the idea of continuing the U.S. policy of confronting Iran and supporting Israel. “When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran, you can’t talk with Syria and we’re, we should stay where we are and support Israel, and so on, well you miss the point,” he told the laughing audience at an event for his book, America: Our Next Chapter.
Hagel added that the U.S. “shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran,” even in the event of a nuclear attack on Israel, and suggested Israel would be the first to attack Iran with a nuclear weapon.


Hagel told the Senate on Jan. 31 that he could not provide records or video for more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given over the previous five years because they had not been transcribed or recorded:


We have given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there, every video that I have that’s out there. On paid speeches, most every one of those paid speeches–in the contract it says that they are private and not videotaped. That wasn’t my decision. That was the contract of the group I spoke to. I believe every paid speech I gave I didn’t have a prepared text. I gave it extemporaneously, which is something I’ve been doing for long before I left the Senate.

However, records and recordings of many of those speeches do exist, suggesting the administration either did not perform the due diligence necessary to comply with the Senate’s request, or that Hagel misled the Senate.
In the new footage, which was uploaded to YouTube and is apparently from a question-and-answer session after his formal remarks, Hagel fields a question about whether the U.S. would attack Iran to help defend Israel from an attack by Iran or one of its proxies that threatened Israel’s existence. He says that the U.S. should not attack Iran, and that the U.S. should “engage” Iran instead–even in those circumstances:

Q: [I]f Israel is attacked by Iran or an Iranian proxy like Hezbollah in a way that existentially threatens Israel, almost to the extent that Israel was attacked in ’73 and it’s existentially threatened, would you support an American airstrike using U.S. forces, B2s, whatever on Iran?”
A: I’ll answer the question as honestly as I can. That’s a hypothetical question that somehow frames up the simplicity of the hypothetical question. The complications in the Middle East, and I’m certainly not an expert there, I have a chapter on the Middle East, I do know [laughter], I know a little something about the Middle East. I spent a lot of time there. And I spent a lot of time in Israel with the prime minister and others. You, who are well informed on this issue know the complexities starting with–go back to the Bible, go back to ancient times, thousands of years. I mean that, if you really want to start trying to understand the Middle East, Paul, or David Aaron Miller, who you may know, has a new book out on this, The Not So Promised Land, [sic]. And if you want to read something that is very, very enlightening, this guy, he’s getting tremendous reviews on it. He’s Jewish. He worked in the State Department , worked for Baker, worked for Albright, I think he’s worked for four Secretaries of State, different Democrats, Republicans. But it’s a great, great book.
But your question, I mean the complication of what’s going on there, Hamas is already attacking Israel. Iran supports Hamas. Iran supports Hezbollah. What I would much rather see is this administration, or hopefully the next administration, engage Iran, engage Syria. When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran, you can’t talk with Syria and we’re, we should stay where we are and support Israel, and so on, well you miss the point. 
Our policy has been so successful I believe, hasn’t it [laughter], that the Middle East is far better off today than it’s ever been, isn’t it? [Laughter.] I mean all those countries, Lebanon is in great shape, Gaza is in great shape, Israel is in good shape, Iran, Iraq, things have never looked better, because we won’t talk to anybody. We are not going to have peace, stability, security or anything that even hints of it in the Middle East until Iran and Syria and all the players are part of it.
Now that doesn’t apologize for, or doesn’t close our eyes to what Iran has been doing, what Iran does do. But unless they are engaged in some way, then I don’t see this getting any better. And where this could go, where this could eventually go–somebody was asking me the other day about a nuclear exchange in the world, where that would come from? And I said, well, I’ll give you a scenario that’s very real. If Israel gets backed up enough into a corner, and Israel uses a tactical theater nuclear weapon–you want to talk about seeing some things unravel in the world. The United States shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran or anybody else. I mean, we got our hands full right now… [Applause]

Last week, Iranian “Supreme Leader” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei bluntly rejected the suggestion by Vice President Joe Biden that the U.S. and Iran should meet for direct, bilateral talks on Iran’s nuclear program.

Hundreds of Egyptians – Christian and Muslim alike – gathered outside the White House Thursday afternoon to call attention to the plight of Coptic Christians and denounce what they see as the Obama administration’s tepid response to a recent spate of church burnings.
“Down, Down with Ikhwan!” they chanted in reference to the Muslim Brotherhood. Since Egypt’s army cracked down on Muslim Brotherhood protesters, the Islamist group and its supporters have torched dozens of churches and attacked Christians.


Muslim women in hijabs could be seen mingling among their Christian neighbors and joining in the chants.
Protesters later marched to the headquarters of the Washington Post and CNN to express anger at the lack of coverage given to the attacks on Egyptian Christians. Then they went to the Council on American Islamic Relations’ (CAIR) headquarters. Protest organizers consider CAIR to be the Muslim Brotherhood’s “embassy” in Washington.
The sight of hundreds of angry protesters outside its building prompted theWashington Post to lock down its lobby.

Protesters defended the Egyptian military’s decision to forcefully clear out the Muslim Brotherhood protesters staging sit-ins in Cairo, and they chided the Obama administration for condemning the military’s action.

“Egypt right now is dealing with terrorists,” said protester Sherif Mina. “I mean, he’s talking about peaceful demonstrations in Egypt by the Muslim Brotherhood. Is it peaceful when you carry machine guns, and artillery weapons – and all these kinds of torture that they’ve done to the Egyptian people, and the neighborhoods that they were sitting in?”
Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged the popular Egyptian belief that the military intervened at the request of the people. But talk of cutting off U.S. aid in the wake of the army’s crackdown – in which hundreds were killed – seems to have reinforced protesters’ perceptions that the Obama administration has sided with the Brotherhood.
Many Egyptians now consider the Muslim Brotherhood to be a terrorist organization that destroyed the fabric of Egyptian society during its year in power, protesters said. That belief was proven by street protests against President Mohamed Morsi – the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate – which drew an estimated 30 million Egyptians. American foreign policy should back the majority of Egyptians who do not want the Muslim Brotherhood back, protesters said.

They also called for a secular, free and democratic Egypt.
Basic necessities became scarce under Muslim Brotherhood rule, electricity became sporadic, gas lines were common, and poor Egyptians were being hurt by the declining value of the Egyptian Pound by the time 30 million Egyptians took to the streets to say they had enough.

As the army violently clamped down, Islamists turned to Egypt’s Christian minority as easy scapegoats or accused the military of promoting “Islamophobia.” But that didn’t fly with Muslims who joined Thursday’s protest in Washington.

“All of the Egyptians they are found the Muslim Brotherhood they are just failures and liars about everything they are told us they will do it in my country,” said Nessma Salem, an Egyptian Muslim woman who came from New York to attend the rally. “Unfortunately they make a lot of other things. They don’t want to even admit they are liars. So the problem is all the Muslims, and all the Christians, and all of the Egyptian people they are just go to all of the street again after two years. They told us they do not want the Muslim Brotherhood to control the whole country again because they are failures and unfortunately they are support definitely terrorists.”

Other protesters shared her angst about the damage done to Egypt’s economy under Muslim Brotherhood rule. Given the massive popular outcry, Morsi’s removal from office was not a coup.

“[30] million people came out in the street saying we don’t want this regime. It’s a terror regime – a terrorist regime killing everyone,” said protester Fred Soliman. “They tried to rule the country by themselves and not share it with anyone else, so the whole country, the whole country [30] million people all over Egypt. They say no to that regime.”
President Obama has not mentioned Coptic Christians by name since the violence began. The closest he came was a brief, veiled reference to churches being attacked by Islamists last week. “We call on those who are protesting to do so peacefully and condemn the attacks that we’ve seen by protesters, including on churches,” he said. The State Department has issued several statements condemning the attacks on the over 60 churches over the past week, but the Copts feel these statements have not been forceful enough.
These tepid statements, together with the perception that the Obama administration was excessively deferential to the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in power, fueled their resentment.

“We as the Coptic Christians of Egypt would like to live in peace, would like the Egyptians to decide their future. We don’t want anyone to interfere in our future, would like the American government as well to the media to listen to all of the parties and to decide it by themselves,” said Fr. Mikhail E. Mikhail of St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in Seven Hills, Ohio. “…We are here to say that what happened in Egypt is a revolution from the people, not a military rebellion.”
“The army is not going to rule in Egypt,” Mikhail said. “They chose a Supreme Court judge to be in the transition period, and at the same time they have a plan to give it to a civilian government. We want Egypt to be civilian and for Egypt to separate between religion and state like you do here in the United States of America.”

Obama spokesman Jay Carney said the White House is “extremely disappointed” that Russia granted Edward Snowden asylum. Early this morning, Snowden left the Moscow airport after he was granted temporary asylum by Russia. 
Carney also stated that Snowden isn’t a whistleblower or a dissident and described the situation as ‘not a positive development’ for U.S.-Russia relations. The move undermines Russia’s record of law enforcement cooperation with the U.S.
The White House is considering cancelling a planned fall summit between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 



“We are extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and private that Mr. Snowden be expelled and returned to the United States,” said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

Moscow did not give any advanced notice to the White House before they announced their decision to grant a one year, temporary asylum request to Snowden. Relations between the US are already strained because of differences regarding the war in Syria, but Putin did say the request was granted contingent upon Snowden refraining from hurting U.S. interests.

This “disappointment” is a switch from Obama’s cavalier attitude toward Snowden when the leaks were first brought to light. Initially, Obama dismissed Snowden and the NSA leaks to the media by saying “No, I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,” Obama said.
The President also said “I shouldn’t have to” personally call the leaders of China and Russia to have them turn over Snowden after details of classified documents were made public. 
“We’ve got a whole lot of business that we do with China and Russia,” Obama said. “And I’m not going to have one case of a suspect that we’re trying to extradite suddenly being elevated to the point where I’ve got to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a host of other issues, simply to get a guy extradited so that he can face the Justice system here in the United States.”

5615	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/11/26/Valerie-Jarrett-Chicago-and-the-Iran-Deal	Opinion	1	International News	National Security	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Last week, the Times of Israel reported that senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett had been leading talks with Iran in secret for a year before the formal negotiations in Geneva this month. While the White House denied the report “100 percent,” the existence of back-channel talks has been confirmed by other reporting. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that President Barack Obama had “personally overseen” the talks.
Almost anything “personally overseen” by the President Obama is likely to bear the heavy stamp of Ms. Jarrett, who is the president’s closest adviser, despite a shocking track record of failure. In foreign policy, her most important mistake was her effort to dissuade the president from proceeding with the raid on Osama bin Laden. It was one of the few times that President Obama overruled her counsel–and one of his few successes.


Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is cause for concern for three additional reasons–two minor and one major. One minor reason is that she was born there. That should not automatically disqualify anyone, of course, any more than being born in the Soviet Union would have disqualified an anti-Soviet dissident. But Jarrett was born in 1956 to American expatriates in the aftermath of the CIA-assisted coup that deposed Mohammad Mossadegh.

The Iranian regime remains obsessed with the Mossadegh coup as proof of America’s innate evil–and for decades, some Americans have felt a sense of post-colonial guilt about it. That feeling may be particularly acute for an American born in the shadow of that event. The temptation to show contrition by acceding to Iran’s goals, as a kind of restorative justice, could well shape Jarrett’s involvement, and Obama’s approach.
The second minor reason to worry about Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is her political background. Her entrée into the world of left-wing politics in Chicago was through her father-in-law, Vernon Jarrett, a journalist with somewhat radical views. Jarrett spoke out against antisemitism in the black community, for example, but also took anti-Israel stands, accusing pro-Israel Jews of “support of genocide” in the Lebanon War, for example.
These two reasons for concern are fairly minor, because they are based on mere speculation, and would have to be balanced out by other factors, such as Ms. Jarrett’s personal associations with leaders of the pro-Israel community in Chicago. But the major reason for concern about her role is simply that Jarrett has banished, and repulsed, most of the Obama administration’s most competent appointees from the White House.
One of the most important departures was that of Dennis Ross, who was brought into the White House early in the Obama presidency to advise the president on the Middle East. Ross, who advocated a tough approach to Iran, is widely thought to have been marginalized by the president’s inner circle. He left the White House in 2011, ostensibly because he had only promised to serve two years, but likely because he was not being utilized.
Finally, it is worth noting that Jarrett, despite her expatriate origins, has little experience in international affairs, and is said to manage Obama’s policies through a domestic political lens. If she was as involved in the talks as reports suggest, that could be a major reason for the president’s eagerness to sign almost any deal, even one the French rejected as too weak. In any other administration, she likely would have been ignored.

5626	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/18/Poll-Over-Two-Thirds-Back-Investigations-Into-Benghazi-IRS-Scandal	Opinion	1	International News	National Security	Negative	Positive	breitbart.com	"

The President of the United States might not believe there is any “there” there regarding his administration’s now-admitted mishandling of the September 11 terror attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, but a new Gallup poll seems to indicate the America people aren’t quite as sure. A full 52% “strongly agree” that Benghazi is a “serious issue that needs to be investigated,” while 17% “agree.” That’s a total of 69%. 
Because the mainstream media has conspired (it must be noted that there are a number of notable individual exceptions) with the White House over the last eight months to downplay Libya, you might think that particular scandal would generate less interest than the IRS scandal — which the media have taken much more seriously. Surprisingly, though, the numbers aren’t all that different. When asked the same question about the IRS, 56% “strongly agree” and 18% “agree;” for a total of 74% — which is only 5 points higher than Libya. 
The numbers for Libya create a real dilemma for the White House and its lapdog media. The no there “there” Narrative they have spent eight months manufacturing obviously isn’t working. Moreover, the motive behind this Narrative is a sinister one: neither Obama nor his media want the truth to get out, and both know that the more the people learn about the administration’s handling of Libya, the worse it will be for the administration. 


For instance, with the release of the 94 emails earlier this week, we now know for a fact that the White House repeatedly lied with their claim that the administration played no role in shaping the CIA talking points. The media, though, refuse to hold the White House accountable for that lie and prefer to pretend the emails actually do back the administration’s claim.  
The main reason the media have smothered the damning revelations found in the emails, though, is to protect Hillary Clinton. It was the State Department that demanded what amounted to almost a total rewrite of the completed talking points, and won them. But the media see Hillary as the best chance they have for keeping the White House out of Republican hands in 2016, and so they are circling the wagons for her, just like they have for Obama for the last five years.  
Plus, even though the media isn’t demanding more, we still don’t have all the information regarding the shaping of the talking points. These information gaps are critical, and to say we should take the White House’s word for anything at this point is a joke. 

The media are also ignoring and smothering the effort to find out who gave the order to “stand down” when it came to sending help to Americans under attack that night. And when it comes to finding out what exactly the President was doing during those horrific hours during which the attack took place, the media is laughably uncurious.   
To protect the White House from having to reveal the truth, the President and his media have developed a strategy that smears as partisan witch-hunters anyone searching for the truth. This includes any Republican in Congress pushing for investigations and, naturally, Fox News. 
But from the looks of this poll, the witch-hunters have the will of the people on their side–a whopping 69% of them. That’s a huge number, but if you think about, not really a surprising one. When Americans die, decent people believe everything should be fully investigated and made public. 
The American people are, by and large, decent. 
This White House and its media, however, are not. 
Hopefully this poll will only further embolden the GOP and Fox News and the exceptions in the media to continue to do the decent thing: Find and tell the complete truth about what led to the deaths of an ambassador and three other Americans.

Recent events in Egypt put President Barack Obama in a tough spot, even if not as difficult as that of deposed Egyptian President Morsi. At least the latter gentleman knows his own mind, even if paying a high price for it, whereas Obama is at wit’s end to articulate where he stands on the sanctity of democracy and its place in American foreign policy.
Mr. Obama is bound by his own words, international law and the expectations of allies, such as Great Britain, not to acknowledge or support coups that overthrow duly-elected governments. For the president, it is an inconvenient truth that Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, accomplished his office through the ballot box and was as constitutionally legitimate as Obama, but for one small fact.


Morsi pushed through constitutional changes that are rather favorable to the fundamentalist thinking of the Brotherhood. Of course, those views about the desired progress of society and place of religion in the equation are hardly simpatico with the left leaning ideas on Harvard Yard and other American temples of the “progressive” movement.
Like most Americans, I have no truck with the ideas of the Brotherhood, but the mob in the streets objecting to Morsi chose methods other than ballots to remove him. Sadly for him, the Egyptian military is neither under civilian control nor primarily financed by the Egyptian government. It gets its manna from the Obama Administration via more than $1 billion annually in U.S. foreign aid.
Now, the new government, in a fit of liberal tolerance is jailing Brotherhood leaders. And it would seem democracy is accomplishing more progress in U.S. sanctioned Iran than American supported Egypt.

During its recent perils, the Obama White House did not support the elected Egyptian government. It stated the Morsi government must respect the will of all the people, much as the U.S. president did pushing through Obama Care despite the disapproval of the majority of Americans, as expressed through town meetings, polls and a Massachusetts Senate election.
Instead, the U.S. president gave a wink and a nod to a military takeover in Egypt, which the State Department is now indicating may not be a coup, because the generals have not imposed a military leader. Instead, they have put in place as president Egypt’s highest judge, after he was in office but two days. Even if a figurehead, that makes the military removal of a duly-elected Egypt president not a coup, therefore legitimate?
That question has the legal minds at the State Department working overtime.
The upshot, in Egypt Obama’s principal representative, Ambassador Anne Paterson, is vilified by all sides, and the Muslim Brotherhood is likely permanently disabused of the notion that participating in democratic processes can lead to its views taking hold anywhere from Syria to Yemen.
This is a mighty grand mess that will result in untold bloodshed and further reinforce anti-American views across the Middle East.  Now, the Arab Spring could easily become pan-Arab anarchy, and much blood will be on American hands.  Only a fool would think this situation would not inspire new terrorists.
Those remarkable accomplishments notwithstanding, Americans are entitled to know: What is the U.S. policy toward overthrowing democratically elected governments? Is it unacceptable except when it gives rise to fundamentalist social and religious views the prelates within the American academy and mainstream media don’t like?

The UN made me do it. That’s how Obama officials are explaining Secretary Kerry’s intense efforts to move Israel onto the front burner and shove over the bloody turmoil immediately affecting millions of Israel’s neighbors and the imminent catastrophe of an Iranian nuclear weapon. 
Speaking to reporters on July 30, 2013, senior officials said the administration was seeking “to avoid a train wreck” at the United Nations. “Throughout the course of this year Palestinians have been making clear that if they couldn’t see progress on the peace front, their intention would be to seek other elevations of their status… at the UN.” They explained a “new dynamic vis-à-vis the United Nations,” was driving the immediacy for renewed talks.  
The comments mirror Secretary Kerry’s remarks in June: “the Palestinians have said that they will go to the UN and seek to join more UN organizations… And the Palestinians have also threatened to take their case to the International Criminal Court.”


Now Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has generously promised to delay those moves during the next nine months of talks.
The claim that the United Nations – and more specifically, the Arab stranglehold over its output – is genuinely intimidating the President of the United States ought to ring major alarm bells for anyone under the impression that elected American representatives set American foreign policy. 
So how true is it?

The new faux peace negotiations between Israel and a Palestinian leader who doesn’t control the land or the people he purports to represent follow months of hysterical pressure from UN quarters. 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on June 3, 2013 in Washington: “We are approaching a point of no return in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict… This may well be the last chance for the two-State solution.” On June 18, 2013, Ban told a UN Palestinian committee meeting in Beijing: “I cannot stress enough the risk of missing the current window of opportunity.”
No doubt the UN’s goal has been to remove Arabs murdering other Arabs from the top spot on newswires around the world and replace it with stories about Jews constructing apartment buildings. 
But the UN noise-making has been neatly dovetailing with the noises coming from Secretary Kerry, who told the Foreign Affairs Committee on April 17, 2013: “I believe the window for a two-state solution is shutting… We have… a year, a year and a half to two years–or it’s over.” On June 3, 2013, he said: “We’re running out of time… [I]f we do not succeed now, we may not get another chance.” Events, he said, “could literally slam the door on a two-state solution.”
As Kerry worked over Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, periodic announcements issued forth from the UN Secretary-General, such as: “We all need to support Secretary of State Kerry’s courageous initiative.”

From a UN perspective, the drumbeating makes perfect sense. Settled (and fatuous) UN policy has long been that “the Israeli-Palestinian conflict” lies at the heart of the failure to deliver world peace. And the nub of that conflict, as Ban Ki-moon repeated in June, was “the occupation, now nearing half a century.” Even the nomenclature of the “Arab-Israeli conflict,” alluding in part to 65 years of Arab rejection of the Jewish state, has been quietly retired.
But what about the American perspective?

When the Palestinians threaten to use the United Nations to act unilaterally, that is a violation of their obligations under the UN’s own Security Council-endorsed Middle East Road Map which demands a negotiated settlement. The supposed Palestinian “gift” of not using the UN to orchestrate another end run around negotiations is really not giving anything at all. It is reneging on the outcome of prior negotiations.
Actually, those prior agreements were already broken by the Palestinians last year. In the fall of 2012 the Palestinians stage-managed a UN spectacle in which they renamed themselves “the state of Palestine” and acquired the status of UN “non-member observer state.” Instead of a major negative response from President Obama, however, they achieved just the opposite. 
The administration has been doing its damnedest to get Congress to annul the negative financial fallout experienced merely by the UN agency UNESCO. On every other front, U.S. dollars have just kept flowing, and it is diplomatic business as usual. In fact, the ransom floated before Palestinians grew. In April, Kerry gushed about an economic strategy for Palestinians that would “involve the U.S. Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corp., and U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as American corporations.”

The Palestinians got the message: using the UN was a huge success. President Obama and Secretary Kerry were sufficiently cowed by the prospect of more unilateral UN undertakings that the only possible next step was to come down hard on Israel and force it to release convicted Palestinian murderers from Israeli prisons. A hundred are due to be set free in “exchange” for the Palestinians hitting the UN-pause button.
So let’s get this twisted tale straight. Palestinians have magnanimously agreed not to pursue unilateral UN actions – in direct contravention of their previous promises – and not to attempt to prosecute Israel at the “neutral” International Criminal Court (whose statute has a provision written specifically to target Israel). And the Obama administration pretends it is doing Israel a favor by bringing the Palestinians to the table because Washington’s hands are tied by the UN. That would be the same UN that is dependent on American taxpayer dollars for its next breath. 
The reality looks more like this.
The UN and the Palestinians are doing exactly what the President of the United States and his Secretary of State want. Set aside crimes against humanity in Syria. Millions of Egyptians on the streets can wait. Iran’s next terror victims can forget about it. 
Just like UN Israel-haters have always said, it turns out that this American administration also believes that Israel is the root cause of the world’s problems. Bludgeoning Israel is the UN’s – and President Obama’s – game.

An article in the Taliban magazine Azan compares Barack Obama at this point with Michel Gorbachev in 1989–saying both lost in Afghanistan and both lost their own countries. 
The article opens by describing Afghanistan as “the graveyard of empires” which is “bearing witness to the fall of another self-proclaimed ‘Super Power,’ i.e. the U.S.A.”


The Middle East Media Research Institute has provided excerpts of the article in which various examples of Muslim military victories throughout the centuries are highlighted. The article then turns toward contemporary wars, making the point that just as the Soviets left Afghanistan in defeat so too: 


The world is seeing as a handful of mujahideen under the leadership of Mullah Omar are defeating one of the most powerful super powers in the history of the world. …When the U.S. attacked Afghanistan [in October 2001], the people of intellect were wondering how long it would take for America to suffer its inevitable defeat and who would be leading its army when it would eventually drag its defeated tail out of Afghanistan.

The excerpts also show a juxtaposition between the rise of poverty and want in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev in the 1980s and the rise of traditional poverty indicators under Obama during this time in office. Whereas Gorbachev had to introduce a “war-food system of food distribution for his citizens,” America has witnessed a poverty increase from 37.3 million in 2007 to 46.9 million in 2010, according to Azan. 
Moreover, the article touches on the “severe public discontent” under Gorbachev and the movements calling for “separation” which erupted in parts of the Soviet Union at that time. In the same way, the article claims there are “various movements” likewise calling for separation in the U.S. now. According to Azan, “around 30 states [are] calling for separation.”
Although the figure of “30 states” is wrong, the overarching goal of the article may still prove successful–that goal is to show that Obama, like Gorbachev before him, is a weak man who’s losing his grip on this own country while simultaneously facing defeat abroad. 
The tagline is simple–Obama is weak like Gorbachev, the U.S. is being defeated like the U.S.S.R.

The alleged use of deadly chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against civilians and opponents on the anniversary of President Barack Obama’s “red line” statement might have marked the collapse of Obama’s foreign policy–if such policy actually existed. In fact, however, the Obama administration has no foreign policy other than its continued opposition to the perceived postures of George W. Bush, more than four years gone.
Obama’s policy in Syria had been to rehabilitate the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. Well before he won the presidency, Democrats–including current Secretary of State John Kerry–made a point of visiting Assad to show their approach to foreign relations was different from, and more effective than, the allegedly confrontational approach of the Bush administration. Syria’s nuclear weapons program, exposed when Israel destroyed it in 2007, did not prompt any change in Democrats’ approach to the regime.


Therefore Obama renewed diplomatic relations and re-opened the U.S. embassy in Damascus, elevating the status of the regime. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even referred to Assad as a “reformer.” The hope was that doing so would convince him to side with the U.S. over Iran, and to win goodwill in the Arab world more generally.
In Egypt, the Obama administration adopted a similar approach, i.e. appeasing a tyrant with the intention of establishing a clear break with Bush’s pressure for democratic reforms and encourage a new perception of the U.S. as more open to the Arab and Muslim worlds. In the midst of an orgy of federal spending, Obama cut funding for pro-democracy groups in Egypt and prioritized relations with Hosni Mubarak’s regime.
At the same time, however, Obama began trying to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood, not because he wished to encourage a democratic process in Egypt that might include their participation, but because he wished to appease Islamist sentiment in general. His administration refused, for example, to identify radical Islam as the source of terrorism, and even redefined the term “war on terror” itself as “overseas contingency operations.”

Therefore when the Arab Spring erupted in 2011, the Obama administration initially tried to argue that he was not a “dictator.” Then, as media criticism began to mount, Obama switched sides and backed Mubarak’s ouster, all the while claiming that he had not, in fact, changed his policy. His previous efforts to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood as a legitimate organization gave some amount–though not much–of legitimacy to that claim. 
Today, in the aftermath of the Egyptian coup, Obama’s foreign policy has lost even the pretense of principle. He is showing outrage at the Egyptian military’s treatment of the Muslim Brotherhood protestors, cutting some aid and canceling joint military exercises (none of which he did in response to the Brotherhood’s own excesses when in power). Yet he refuses to call the coup itself a “coup,” or to cut all aid to the Egyptian military.
Meanwhile, in Syria, Obama is still refusing to do anything that might actually deter the regime from using banned weapons–such as imposing a no-fly zone, for instance–while accelerating aid to the Syrian rebels, who are dominated by anti-American jihadists. His policies are all half-measures and contradictions. Faced with the fact that his academic anti-colonialism has little real-world relevance, he is just avoiding any real commitments.
In fact, the only real foreign policy priority of the Obama administration is to avoid being blamed for anything that could possibly go wrong. He concluded his remarks on Egypt last week by insisting: “We don’t take sides with any particular party or political figure. I know it’s tempting inside of Egypt to blame the United States or the West or some other outside actor for what’s gone wrong.” The buck stops…with Egypt, he said. Not with me.
That is not to say that the Middle East’s current problems are easy to resolve. Republicans and conservatives have had a tough time coming to a consensus about what should be done. The Arab world presents only bad options and worse options: a genocidal regime in Syria versus brutal jihadist groups; a military tyranny in Egypt versus radical Islamists with hegemonic ambitions. The dangerous temptation to withdraw is strong.
The one point of agreement among conservatives–even the likes of Patrick Buchanan, these days–is that the U.S. should primarily be concerned with shoring up Israel against common enemies such as Al Qaeda and Iran. In other words, the best path might be to focus on the sole U.S. ally in the region. But the Obama administration has done the opposite, pressuring Israel and giving Iran leeway, despite continued frustration.
It is arguable that the Bush administration had a similarly rudderless foreign policy when it took office in 2001, driven only by the desire to do the opposite of its predecessor. Yet it pulled together a new strategy–however flawed–after 9/11, when circumstances had changed. Obama has failed to learn from crisis–whether the Green Revolution in Iran in 2009, or the Arab Spring and its aftermath. “Not Bush” is a non-policy, but a real failure.

A staff report prepared for Rep. Darrell Issa and released today finds numerous failings in the ARB report on Benghazi released last year. The new report overturns some of the conclusions of the official ARB report. It finds that Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy, who was not criticized in the ARB report, should have been held accountable.
The new report is based on public statements but also on transcripts of numerous interviews undertaken since the release of the ARB report. It concurs with some portions of the earlier ARB report and disputes others. For instance, the new report finds that Charlene Lamb was at fault for decisions she made with regard to security in Libya. However the new report also provides a partial basis for exonerating Lamb since evidence suggests that every personnel decisions related to Libya was directly approved (or disapproved) by Under Secretary Kennedy. 


A key exchange appears on page 63 of the report when Committee staff interview Deputy Assistant Secretary for Maghreb Affairs Maxwell about the involvement of Under Secretary Kennedy in events taking place in Libya prior to the 9/11 attack [Emphasis in original]:

Q.The DCM, Mr. Hicks, testified that Ambassador Kennedy was very engaged on a minute level about the incidents that were occurring in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks.
A.Yep.
Q. Does that surprise you?
A. It does not.  We–one of the things that I found interesting was that the Under Secretary approved every person that went in or came out of Tripoli…
*   *   *
A. The DAS Assistant Secretary reports to the Under Secretary for Management. The way the Under Secretary for Management runs things, there is no decision that DS makes that doesn’t have his input and his imprimatur, his approval. There is no decision that DS doesn’t make that doesn’t have his disapproval. DS–the Under Secretary for Management speaks for DS for all practical purposes, and there is no decision that DS makes that the Under Secretary for Management is not involved in.
Q.So, the important decisions about the security posture in Libya leading up to the attacks, if Mr. Boswell was held accountable for those decisions, is it fair to say that the Under Secretary for Management would have had a role in those decisions?
A. Absolutely.

Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell, one of the four individuals named in the ARB report, also told Oversight staff that Kennedy was the “ultimate decisionmaker” when it came to the removal of the SST team from Libya. This was the team of soldiers which Ambassador Stevens and others hoped to keep in Libya but which was removed weeks before the attack. Boswell also told Oversight staffers that “any decision about travel in and out, staffing levels was made by” Kennedy. This included both the assignment of diplomatic staff and security personnel.

Executive Director of the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau Lee Lohman told Oversight that he attended a meeting at which Kennedy personally examined schematics for the villa in Benghazi. Lohman said Kennedy was “heavily” involved in choosing the facility.
The report also points out that Kennedy was the single individual who, based on a staff recommendation, approved keeping the Benghazi post open as a temporary facility for an additional year. It was because the compound was temporary and not a permanent site that its security was staffed on a temporary basis by DS agents on leave from other positions. The temporary staffing system was intended to fill single openings or gaps in staffing on a short term basis, not provide and entire staff indefinitely. As a result, DS never had a full security compliment in place in Benghazi. 
The new report also criticizes Kennedy’s role in presenting a false image of accountability to the public. Under Secretary Kennedy informed Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell that he had been singled out in the ARB report. Boswell offered his resignation and Kennedy accepted it. However Kennedy simultaneously encouraged Boswell to hang on to another position he held. A few days later, Kennedy told Boswell he was being placed on administrative leave. However, quoting Boswell from the Oversight interview, Kennedy told Boswell “he didn’t think it would last long.”
The Oversight report strongly suggests that the ARB report should have assigned blame to Under Secretary Kennedy for his involvement in numerous decisions which created the lax security situation in Benghazi. 
Under Secretary Kennedy is scheduled to testify at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday. Rep. Issa has scheduled a separate hearing with Adm. Mike Mullen and Amb. Thomas Pickering, the authors of the contested ARB report, for Thursday.

The New York Times had a reporter talking to attackers on the ground during the Benghazi attacks that killed four Americans in September of 2012, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, and that reporter may know the identity of some of the murderers and perpetrators.
David Kirkpatrick is the Times reporter who wrote the story that forced the paper’s Editorial page editor to defensively declare on Monday that it has not chosen to endorse Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. The editor said that the paper had a reporter on the ground who was witnessing the attacks. 


That admission is even in Kirpatrick’s story, which, as Breitbart News reported, has received considerable blowback for attempting to “whitewash the Benghazi tragedy.” The Times alleges that there was no al-Qaeda involvement in the attacks that killed four Americans (contradicting the paper’s own reporting), that murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens had “little understanding” of the region, and that the terrorists were motivated by an anti-Muhammed YouTube video:

Soon scores, if not hundreds, of others were racing to the scene. Some arrived with guns, some with cameras. The attackers had posted sentries at Venezia Road, adjacent to the compound, to guard their rear flank, but they let pass anyone trying to join the mayhem. Witnesses said young men rushing inside had left empty pickup trucks from Ansar al-Shariah, but also all the other big militias ostensibly allied with the government.
There is no doubt that anger over the video motivated many attackers. A Libyan journalist working for The New York Times was blocked from entering by the sentries outside, and he learned of the film from the fighters who stopped him. Other Libyan witnesses, too, said they received lectures from the attackers about the evil of the film and the virtue of defending the prophet.

Kirkpatrick tweeted Monday night that the Times had “a reporter on the scene talking to the attackers during the attack.” His tweet prompted those on Twitter, including a former U.N. spokesperson for George W. Bush, to wonder if the Times knew who the attackers were and whether the reporter who was on the ground witnessed the murder of a U.S. Ambassador without calling for help:

In what looks like an off-the-cuff blunder, Secretary of State John Kerry might have accidentally given Russian President Vladmir Putin the opportunity to muddy the international diplomatic waters and buy his friends in Syria some time. 
During a press briefing on Monday, Kerry said that Assad could avoid American air strikes by giving up all his chemical weapons within a week. Within hours, the State Department was forced to walk Kerry’s new red line back with the claim that he was making a “rhetorical argument about the impossibility and unlikelihood of Assad turning over chemical weapons he has denied he used.”
It seems, then, reasonable to conclude that Kerry spoke out of turn. Kerry was not authorized to offer Syria an “out” or a new ultimatum. But Kerry’s hypothetical hyperbole appears to have already backfired. 


In an obvious desire to make Kerry pay for his flub and throw a wrench in Obama’s determination to go to war with Syria, Putin has seized upon Kerry’s hypothetical and called on Syria to accept Kerry’s offer and turn over all of its chemical weapons. No one believes Assad would ever willingly give up his chemical weapons, but should he agree to an offer the Obama administration did not mean to make, it could stall American action for weeks and even months.
Syria is already warming to the idea.  
This complication could be a major blow to all of the Obama administration’s prepared plans to punish Assad for using the weapons and to change the balance of power in the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Public opposition to Obama’s war is already surging. Weeks or months from now, after the torturous international diplomatic process that no one believes would end with Assad giving up the chemical weapons that keep him in power winds down, it is doubtful Congress or the American public would be ready to stomach a renewed push for war. 

But now that Putin has suggested Syria say “yes” to an offer Kerry was sure no one would accept, the Associated Press is reporting that the State Department will take a “hard look” at Russia’s proposal. 
Just like Obama’s unscripted “red line” comment that started this debacle, it looks as though another off-teleprompter administration blunder has shoved America’s foreign policy into a corner.

Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page is one of President Barack Obama’s more reliable defenders–or, more accurately, a reliable critic of Obama’s critics. Yet Page asks a key question in his column Sunday: “Would a younger Obama vote for his new military action?” The answer, Page suggests throughout, is “no”–and highlights the hypocrisy in Obama’s stance.
Noting broad public and congressional opposition to a Syria strike, Page recounts how Obama built his political reputation and his presidential campaign on his vehement opposition to the Iraq War, which was then being justified to the public by President George W. Bush in terms similar to those that Obama is using to justify military action in Syria today:



In a speech at a Chicago anti-war rally in October 2002 that would prove pivotal to his 2008 presidential rise, Obama, than an Illinois state senator, famously made a case against President George W. Bush’s Iraq War that ironically describes why so many people oppose Obama’s proposed Syria attack.
He did not oppose all wars, Obama forcefully pointed out, but he opposed “a dumb war. A rash war.” No question that Saddam Hussein was “a brutal man,” said Obama back then, “… who butchers his own people to secure his own power.” But Obama also pointed out that Saddam “… poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States.”…
The circumstances in Syria are different. Iraq, for example, did not have the weapons of mass destruction that our bogus intelligence reports said they had. By contrast, on Aug. 21 a poison-gas attack in the suburbs of Damascus, Syria’s capital, killed more than 1,400 civilians.
But the “clear rationale,” clear goals and “strong international support” that separates smart policy from “dumb” wars is lacking….

Page goes on to note that Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel made a poor case in the Senate and House last week,  particularly in their fumbling attempts to reassure elected officials that the limited strike that Obama seeks on Syria will not lead to “mission creep” that takes the U.S., unprepared, to a boots-on-the-ground war.
“Team Obama did not want to speculate about that. But those are the kind of questions I think Sen. Obama would have asked,” he concludes.

According to a report from Eric Holder’s Department of Justice, nearly 1/3 of the immigrants making asylum claims last year who were released on bond or their own recognizance never even bothered to appear in immigration court. 
The Executive Office for Immigration Review’s Statisical Yearbook for 2012 says that number is up sharply, with 66% more no-shows than in 2008.
 The asylum system appears to be a magnet for abuse by those who make a claim to get into the country and then vanish. As Breitbart News reported, last week one border crossing near San Diego saw a sudden flood of asylum requests that resulted in the checkpoint being shut down. 


The numbers from the DoJ indicate a growing crisis in the system the United States uses to grant asylum to international refugees, as the immigration courts are overwhelmed by cases from Mexican immigrants that rarely result in asylum being granted.

In raw numbers, Mexican immigrants made 9,206 asylum claims in 2012 but were only found by the immigration courts to have 126 claims worthy of being granted. Compare those numbers to immigrants from a country like China–often accused of human rights violations–11,197 asylum claims were made, 4,705 of which were granted. 
There is no breakdown in the report by nationality for the people who make an asylum claim but don’t bother to show up in court, but in 2012, 29% of all asylum applicants released on bond or their own recognizance were “failure to appears.” 
The cost in court time for frivolous claims is also staggering. For the past five years, cases involving Mexican immigrants rank #1 in the amount of immigration court cases completed in terms of both normal decisions and appeals. However, in terms of the number of actual asylums that were granted, Mexico has never ranked higher than #17 and didn’t even make the list of the top 25 grantees from 2008-2010. 
Over 65% of the asylum cases completed in the immigration courts in 2012 involved nationals from Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala, with Mexicans being the vast majority of all cases completed at 42%. Additionally, 67% of all immigration court proceeding are completed in Spanish.
The Executive Office for Immigration Review is a division of the Department of Justic that oversees immigration courts. According to the EOIR’s website, their stated mission is: 

The primary mission of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) is to adjudicate immigration cases by fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly interpreting and administering the Nation’s immigration laws. Under delegated authority from the Attorney General, EOIR conducts immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative hearings.

A rash war.” No question that Saddam Hussein was “a brutal man,” said Obama back then, “… who butchers his own people to secure his own power.” But Obama also pointed out that Saddam “… poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States.”…
The circumstances in Syria are different. Iraq, for example, did not have the weapons of mass destruction that our bogus intelligence reports said they had. By contrast, on Aug. 21 a poison-gas attack in the suburbs of Damascus, Syria’s capital, killed more than 1,400 civilians.
But the “clear rationale,” clear goals and “strong international support” that separates smart policy from “dumb” wars is lacking….

Page goes on to note that Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel made a poor case in the Senate and House last week,  particularly in their fumbling attempts to reassure elected officials that the limited strike that Obama seeks on Syria will not lead to “mission creep” that takes the U.S., unprepared, to a boots-on-the-ground war.
“Team Obama did not want to speculate about that. But those are the kind of questions I think Sen. Obama would have asked,” he concludes.

The Obama administration is considering resettling thousands of refugees who left Syria during the country’s ongoing civil war to multiple towns and cities across the United States, the L.A. Times reports.

A resettlement plan under discussion in Washington and other capitals is aimed at relieving pressure on Middle Eastern countries straining to support 1.6 million refugees, as well as assisting hard-hit Syrian families.
The State Department is “ready to consider the idea,” an official from the department said, if the administration receives a formal request from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which is the usual procedure.
The United States usually accepts about half the refugees that the U.N. agency proposes for resettlement. California has historically taken the largest share, but Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia are also popular destinations.

U.N. refugee officials, along with diplomats and non-governmental relief groups, are scheduled to meet in Geneva this week to discuss potential resettlement plans. Germany has already agreed to take 5,000 refugees. 
“It was probably inevitable that in this crisis, with these overwhelming numbers, governments would start moving in this direction,” Lavinia Limon, chief executive officer of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a Virginia-based advocacy and service group, told the L.A. Times. Limon added, “But there will be resistance.”


Congress is unlikely to warm up to the idea of agreeing to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees into the U.S. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who are currently pushing immigration reform bills, particularly aimed at Latinos who are in the country illegally, will need to explain why they may favor or oppose resettling thousands of Syrian refugees. 

It should be noted that Congress resisted accepting Iraqi refugees in 2003 following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Between 1983 and 2009, the U.S. resettled a total of 76,205 Iraqis. Meanwhile, seventy percent of total refugees in the U.S. were on food stamps in 2009. Within that number, 95 percent of Iraqi refugees were food stamp recipients. Additionally, the report shows an unemployment rate of 46 percent in 2009 among Iraqi refugees. A total of 219 Syrian refugees were resettled in the U.S. between 1983 and 2009.
More importantly, President Obama’s administration supports Syrians who are attempting to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad, but the emergence of Islamic extremist groups with ties to al Qaeda among the Syrian opposition presents a serious security concern. The L.A. Times alludes to the potential danger with such a resettlement: 

Homeland security officials require careful vetting of refugees, with multiple interviews and background checks before they are allowed to enter the country. Under normal circumstances, the screening process can take a year or longer.
U.S. officials are likely to be extra careful with Syrian refugees. As Islamic militants take a more prominent role in the rebel forces, officials worry about fighters with Al Qaeda ties trying to enter the country. Two resettled Iraqis were convicted of trying to send arms to Al Qaeda from their home in Bowling Green, Ky.

New National Security Advisor Susan Rice and President Obama’s nominee for U.N. ambassador Samantha Power are both refugee advocates and will likely push for the resettlement.

The UN made me do it. That’s how Obama officials are explaining Secretary Kerry’s intense efforts to move Israel onto the front burner and shove over the bloody turmoil immediately affecting millions of Israel’s neighbors and the imminent catastrophe of an Iranian nuclear weapon. 
Speaking to reporters on July 30, 2013, senior officials said the administration was seeking “to avoid a train wreck” at the United Nations. “Throughout the course of this year Palestinians have been making clear that if they couldn’t see progress on the peace front, their intention would be to seek other elevations of their status… at the UN.” They explained a “new dynamic vis-à-vis the United Nations,” was driving the immediacy for renewed talks.  
The comments mirror Secretary Kerry’s remarks in June: “the Palestinians have said that they will go to the UN and seek to join more UN organizations… And the Palestinians have also threatened to take their case to the International Criminal Court.”


Now Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has generously promised to delay those moves during the next nine months of talks.
The claim that the United Nations – and more specifically, the Arab stranglehold over its output – is genuinely intimidating the President of the United States ought to ring major alarm bells for anyone under the impression that elected American representatives set American foreign policy. 
So how true is it?

The new faux peace negotiations between Israel and a Palestinian leader who doesn’t control the land or the people he purports to represent follow months of hysterical pressure from UN quarters. 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on June 3, 2013 in Washington: “We are approaching a point of no return in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict… This may well be the last chance for the two-State solution.” On June 18, 2013, Ban told a UN Palestinian committee meeting in Beijing: “I cannot stress enough the risk of missing the current window of opportunity.”
No doubt the UN’s goal has been to remove Arabs murdering other Arabs from the top spot on newswires around the world and replace it with stories about Jews constructing apartment buildings. 
But the UN noise-making has been neatly dovetailing with the noises coming from Secretary Kerry, who told the Foreign Affairs Committee on April 17, 2013: “I believe the window for a two-state solution is shutting… We have… a year, a year and a half to two years–or it’s over.” On June 3, 2013, he said: “We’re running out of time… [I]f we do not succeed now, we may not get another chance.” Events, he said, “could literally slam the door on a two-state solution.”
As Kerry worked over Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, periodic announcements issued forth from the UN Secretary-General, such as: “We all need to support Secretary of State Kerry’s courageous initiative.”

From a UN perspective, the drumbeating makes perfect sense. Settled (and fatuous) UN policy has long been that “the Israeli-Palestinian conflict” lies at the heart of the failure to deliver world peace. And the nub of that conflict, as Ban Ki-moon repeated in June, was “the occupation, now nearing half a century.” Even the nomenclature of the “Arab-Israeli conflict,” alluding in part to 65 years of Arab rejection of the Jewish state, has been quietly retired.
But what about the American perspective?

When the Palestinians threaten to use the United Nations to act unilaterally, that is a violation of their obligations under the UN’s own Security Council-endorsed Middle East Road Map which demands a negotiated settlement. The supposed Palestinian “gift” of not using the UN to orchestrate another end run around negotiations is really not giving anything at all. It is reneging on the outcome of prior negotiations.
Actually, those prior agreements were already broken by the Palestinians last year. In the fall of 2012 the Palestinians stage-managed a UN spectacle in which they renamed themselves “the state of Palestine” and acquired the status of UN “non-member observer state.” Instead of a major negative response from President Obama, however, they achieved just the opposite. 
The administration has been doing its damnedest to get Congress to annul the negative financial fallout experienced merely by the UN agency UNESCO. On every other front, U.S. dollars have just kept flowing, and it is diplomatic business as usual. In fact, the ransom floated before Palestinians grew. In April, Kerry gushed about an economic strategy for Palestinians that would “involve the U.S. Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corp., and U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as American corporations.”

The Palestinians got the message: using the UN was a huge success. President Obama and Secretary Kerry were sufficiently cowed by the prospect of more unilateral UN undertakings that the only possible next step was to come down hard on Israel and force it to release convicted Palestinian murderers from Israeli prisons. A hundred are due to be set free in “exchange” for the Palestinians hitting the UN-pause button.
So let’s get this twisted tale straight. Palestinians have magnanimously agreed not to pursue unilateral UN actions – in direct contravention of their previous promises – and not to attempt to prosecute Israel at the “neutral” International Criminal Court (whose statute has a provision written specifically to target Israel). And the Obama administration pretends it is doing Israel a favor by bringing the Palestinians to the table because Washington’s hands are tied by the UN. That would be the same UN that is dependent on American taxpayer dollars for its next breath. 
The reality looks more like this.
The UN and the Palestinians are doing exactly what the President of the United States and his Secretary of State want. Set aside crimes against humanity in Syria. Millions of Egyptians on the streets can wait. Iran’s next terror victims can forget about it. 
Just like UN Israel-haters have always said, it turns out that this American administration also believes that Israel is the root cause of the world’s problems. Bludgeoning Israel is the UN’s – and President Obama’s – game.

In 2008, then-candidate Barack Obama promised that he would “eliminate North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.” His campaign manifesto, Change We Can Believe In, described Obama’s North Korea policy, and the philosophy behind it, in great detail:

North Korea is an example where direct, tough diplomacy that lays out clear choices to rogue regimes for good and bad behavior can lead to change. When the United States was engaged, the pace of Pyongyang’s development of nuclear weapons was slowed; when we were not, it quickened. While there has been some promising progress, it’s important that all of North Korea’s claims are verified. If they are not, we should move quickly to reimpose sanctions that have been waived, and consider new restrictions going forward. As President, Barack Obama will work with diligence and determination with our friends and allied to end the threat of North Korea and to secure a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.

Obama’s pledge to use “tough diplomacy” to “end the threat of North Korea” followed his infamous pledge during a Democratic presidential primary debate in 2007 that he would meet the leaders of rogue regimes like North Korea “without preconditions.”


That thinking matches the pseudo-realist view expressed repeatedly by Obama’s new nominee for Secretary of Defense, former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE)–that the danger of regimes such as Iran and North Korea is amplified by, or even caused by, U.S. failure to “engage.” Obama’s extreme self-confidence emboldened his campaign promise not just to contain North Korea, but to convince it to abandon nuclear weapons entirely.

Obama did not just leave such talk on the campaign trail. In his 2010 State of the Union address, Obama boasted of the success of his policy on North Korea: 


Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That’s why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions–sanctions that are being vigorously enforced. 

He repeated the North Korea boast in his 2011 State of the Union address:

Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before.  And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons.  (Applause.)

Yet today, on the day he is to give the first State of the Union address of his second term, North Korea has tested a nuclear bomb. Not only has Obama failed to “eliminate” the North Korean nuclear weapons program; he has also failed to discourage or deter it.
So much for “tough diplomacy” from the Obama administration.

On Sunday evening, CBS News’ 60 Minutes featured an investigative report on the Benghazi attacks by Lara Logan. Logan’s reporting confirmed that the Obama administration had been warned, months in advance, about inadequate security at the U.S. facility in Benghazi, and that it knew the story about a YouTube video was untrue. It was a reversal for CBS News, which played a key role in the Benghazi cover-up in 2012.
A year ago, CBS News released a previously unaired clip of an interview for 60 Minutes with President Barack Obama on Sep. 12, the day after the Benghazi attack, in which the president suggests clearly that the attack on the U.S. consulate was premeditated. The interview contradicted Obama’s subsequent claims that the attack had been a response to an anti-Islam YouTube video, repeated to the public for several days.


CBS News had withheld that portion of the Sep. 12 interview until Oct. 19, choosing instead to release a portion in which Obama criticized rival Mitt Romney’s condemnation of the administration’s response to events–a repeated theme as the media helped Obama deflect responsibility. Romney had attacked the White House’s apology for the video during the attack on the Cairo embassy, not knowing of the deaths in Libya.

After the election, Kroft continued to insist that there was “no information that anything’s been covered up” by the media or the Obama administration about the Benghazi attacks. That statement was wrong based on what was known at the time, and looks even worse today, after whistleblowers testified to Congress earlier this year they were pressured by Clinton’s chief of staff not to cooperate with congressional investigators.
Logan’s investigation featured an interview with one of those whistleblowers, Greg Hicks, who had been the deputy to slain U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. Logan also interviewed “Morgan Jones” (pseudonym), a former British soldier who had been advising the U.S. on security in Benghazi and had warned the State Department that Libyan guards being trained to guard the compound were not up to the job.
Morgan’s warnings came to fruition on Sep. 11, 2012, when he saw the guards disperse after being told by the attackers: “We’re here to kill Americans, not Libyans.” Morgan did what little he could to stop the attack. A second attack at the CIA Annex was partly fought off by a small group that saved five American lives and has since, Logan reported, earned “the Distinguished Service Cross and the Navy Cross” for its bravery.
Yet the Obama administration did not send any assistance throughout the night, and is thought to have issued a stand-down order to prevent any intervention. What Logan’s report makes clear is that there is no way that President Obama or his Secretary of State could plausibly claim that a YouTube video had inspired a spontaneous act of violence on that scale against the U.S. consulate, the CIA annex and their personnel.
That story was a lie when it was told–and it was a lie aided and abetted by the mainstream media, including CBS News and 60 Minutes, which could have exploded the administration’s YouTube video alibi even as Obama and Clinton were telling it to the families of the victims, to the voting public, and to the world. The Sunday night report is commendable, but as an attempt to atone for malpractice, it is far too little, too late.

When the American mission in Benghazi, Libya was attacked on September 11th, 2012, only one person had the positional authority, legal mandate, and communications apparatus to give the order to defend our personnel on the ground: the President of the United States.
The President did not give that order, and four Americans died in Benghazi that day. All the rest of the nonsense to which we have been treated-from prepared talking points, congressional hearings, and finally to the outright lies-matter not when compared to the ignominious moments in which the President of the United States refused to do his job.
That same day, two other American embassies in the Middle East were also under attack in Sana, Yemen and Cairo, Egypt. As a result, our intelligence systems were on high alert. When the calls, satellite and drone feeds, faxes, and reports began bombarding every command center from Germany to the United States, our nation, already at war for eleven years, was again under siege. Staffs from Africa Command, European Command, the National Military Command Center, the CIA Operations Center, the State Department Operations Center, and the White House Situation Room were fully operational.


This all means that on September 11, 2012, our national security apparatus was on full alert. It means everyone was briefed. This is how it works; no games, no conjecture, no television and movie looks, just real battle in real time with real lives at risk.
The road to that indecision is littered with policy and leadership failures that culminated in an American mission and clandestine CIA base being attacked and the murder of our Ambassador and three dedicated Americans doing their jobs. However, the one person responsible for it all is the one man who could have, but refused to, even try to stop the carnage… the President of the United States.
All the President had to say within the first two hours while being briefed by the Secretary of Defense was, “Send in a response force.” This command, followed by his signature on a paper called Cross Border Authority, would have ordered the Department of Defense to do everything and anything to save lives in Benghazi, Libya. 

Three and a half years earlier, on April 9, 2009, President Obama had done exactly that when pirates hijacked an American flagged merchant ship, Maersk Alabama, sailing off the coast of Somalia. In this earlier incident, the President made the right decision within hours to allow SEAL Team Six the time to plan and go. In the end, we all witnessed a textbook successful rescue operation. 
Fast forward to September 11, 2012, and we have a desperate situation with Americans in jeopardy. The same President, instead of deciding how to respond, disappeared for the evening  and then went to Las Vegas the following day to raise money for his re-election campaign.
Had the President ordered a rescue, he had everything he needed to mount a prompt and forceful response–from F-16’s in Aviano, Italy, to an armed and fueled plane standing by at C Company, 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, training in Croatia-a mere three hours from Benghazi by air. 
When the first shot was fired in Benghazi, no one knew how long the fight would last. Subsequent government claims saying we could not get there within the seven-plus hours that the tragedy lasted are specious at best and an outright lie at worst. We did not even care enough to try; that fact alone should make all Americans who mourn the loss of four of our countrymen very angry.
This ultimate Presidential control–the ability to bring armed American forces to bear anywhere in the world within hours–has existed for over 25 years. It exists precisely because of past mistakes and embarrassing moments brought to us by various governmental agencies, congresses, and presidents.
Since September 11th, 2012, we have been treated to a tractor-trailer load of misdirection, disingenuous speeches, television appearances, and outright lying by public officials at every level of the government of the United States of America. Now with other scandals hitting the news, we are beginning to forget and confuse what is the only important point to know after we acknowledge and pray for the four Americans murdered by terrorists that fateful day.
There is one simple point to be made about Benghazi: the President of the United States is the only human being on the planet that can order a bullet, a missile, a plane, a drone, a boat, a helicopter, a soldier, sailor, spy, or push cart with a squirt gun attached to go into another country and perform an aggressive action.
On September 11, 2012, we know the President failed to give that order. We don’t know where he was, what he was doing, or why he failed to act. But we do know he failed to act, and that inaction cost the lives of four brave Americans.

A group of special operations veterans is demanding House Speaker John Boehner form a Select Committee to uncover the truth behind the Benghazi attacks. The group said that Americans and the world will not be able to trust the Obama administration on Syria until it tells the truth about what happened in Benghazi. 
Larry Ward, the political director of Special Operations Speaks (SOS), told Breitbart News that Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) was “dead on when he linked action in Syria to the Benghazi Massacre and cover up” when he questioned Secretary of State John Kerry before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. 
“How is anyone supposed to believe anything that comes out of this Administration?” Ward said to Breitbart News. He noted that Americans and world leaders do not trust the Obama administration on foreign policy matters after Obama, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and then-Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice lied over and over about “the YouTube video.” The video depicting Muhammed was initially said to be responsible for the attacks. 


Duncan, holding up a photo of former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who died in the attacks, told Kerry that Benghazi was vitally germane to the Syria debate. 

“Before we commit the lives of American sons and daughters into a civil war half way around the globe, we must be told the whole truth about the Benghazi Massacre,” Ward said. 
To uncover that truth, SOS sent an open letter to House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) this week, saying it was “deeply troubling” that Boehner has refused to create a Select Committee on Benghazi. The group urged him to answer the unanswered questions about the Benghazi massacre within a week, form a Select Committee to find the truth, or resign his speakership. 
In the letter, the group claimed Boehner would be complicit in the Obama administration’s Benghazi cover-up if he failed to act.

Dozens of CIA operatives were involved in an arms smuggling operation on the ground in Benghazi, Libya during the deadly attack on the U.S. compound last September, reports CNN and the U.K. Telegraph. According to these outlets, the spy agency has gone out of its way to keep the information from the public through intimidation of CIA personnel.  
Four Americans were killed, including U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens that evening in Benghazi almost one year ago. 


In light of this new information, either the Congress’ “Gang of Eight” knew about the operation and misled the public about what they knew, or the Obama administration may have been conducting an unauthorized gun-running operation. Fox News reported in October of 2012 about a Libyan ship, reportedly containing weapons for Syrian Rebels that may have been tied into the attack against the consulate and the CIA annex:

Through shipping records, Fox News has confirmed that the Libyan-flagged vessel Al Entisar, which means “The Victory,” was received in the Turkish port of Iskenderun — 35 miles from the Syrian border — on Sept. 6, just five days before Ambassador Chris Stevens, information management officer Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed during an extended assault by more than 100 Islamist militants. 
On the night of Sept. 11, in what would become his last known public meeting, Stevens met with the Turkish Consul General Ali Sait Akin, and escorted him out of the consulate front gate one hour before the assault began at approximately 9:35 p.m. local time. 
Although what was discussed at the meeting is not public, a source told Fox News that Stevens was in Benghazi to negotiate a weapons transfer, an effort to get SA-7 missiles out of the hands of Libya-based extremists. And although the negotiation said to have taken place may have had nothing to do with the attack on the consulate later that night or the Libyan mystery ship, it could explain why Stevens was travelling in such a volatile region on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. 

According to section 503’s Presidential Approval and Reporting of Covert Actions in the 1947 National Security Act, the President may not authorize covert CIA actions without informing the intelligence committees of Congress.
Legislation implemented in 1980 gave the president the authority to limit advance notification of especially sensitive covert actions to eight Members of Congress–the “Gang of Eight”: the chairmen and ranking minority Members of the two congressional intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House, and Senate majority and minority leaders. These members are: House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA).

By law, such a covert weapons operation in Benghazi should have been known by all eight members. The disastrous results from the events of September 11, 2012 have not made it easy to get answers from these lawmakers regarding this point. 
Many remember when Pelosi, a “Gang of Eight” member, found herself at odds with the Democratic base in 2009 and ridiculed by Republicans, when it was revealed she was actually briefed in 2002 by the Bush White House about the administration’s tactic to water-board terrorism suspects during interrogations. Pelosi denied this fact previously.
Radio host Laura Ingraham asked Boehner on January 24 about Senator Rand Paul’s questioning to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He asked if the secretary was aware of U.S. involvement in the procuring of weapons that were transferred, bought or sold to Turkey out of Libya. Clinton, seemingly confused, told Paul “nobody [had] ever raised” the issue with her before.
Boehner replied to Ingraham, “I’m somewhat familiar with the chatter about this and the fact that these arms were moving towards Turkey, but most of what I know about this came from a classified source and I really can’t elaborate on it.” 
Boehner has refuses to appoint a House Select Committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks and previously refused to support a joint Select Committee to do the same late last year. 

Four members of the “Gang of Eight” have told Breitbart News over the past six months they knew nothing about any CIA operation in Benghazi involving the smuggling of Libyan weapons into Turkey that may have been shipped to Syrian rebels, some of whom were affiliated to al-Qaeda groups.
“I get to see all of that stuff. I have seen nothing that would allow me to conclude that the U.S. government was in any way shape or form involved in gun running in Libya. I looked at it all,” said Congressman Rogers, Chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee to Breitbart News in June.

“If it’s there, I have not seen it. I think I would have found it. I think there were some other things that were happening and people got confused, but the United States government was not running guns (from the annex).”
Senator Chambliss, ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, when asked in February if he knew anything about the gunrunning issue Senator Paul asked Clinton about a month earlier replied to Breitbart News, “I’m not familiar with that.” 
Senator Feinstein, Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Breitbart News in March she “didn’t know what” Senator Paul was talking about in regards to his questioning of Clinton and the Secretary’s knowledge about the gunrunning issue in Benghazi.

Ranking member of the House Intel Committee Rep. Ruppersberger claimed to Breitbart News in May he “didn’t know anything” about U.S. weapons smuggling or if Ambassador Stevens was involved in the operation in anyway, saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Ruppersberger, added, “If I was [privy to such information], I couldn’t talk to you about it. But I have heard no information about what you’re talking about, as far as what [Ambassador Chris Stevens] was there for. I haven’t had briefings on it.”
Ruppersberger also said he knew “nothing about” any U.S. operation to smuggle weapons to Syrian rebels, explaining the secretive “Gang of Eight” briefings from the White House do not go into much detail sometimes.
“I’ve heard nothing about it. When [Stevens] was there. I don’t know. We don’t get to that minutia sometimes. Gang of 8, we get the most sensitive information, that even our own committees can’t [get.] 
When asked if the White House would have had to inform the eight members of such an operation in order for it to be legal Ruppersberger responded, “No. The checks and balances is they give us information–very sensitive information. The check and balance issue,  they don’t have to tell us everything or we’d be sitting having Gang of Eight briefings all day long. That’s the answer. I don’t know.”

Gregory Hicks was the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) of the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli during the September 11, 2012 assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. On Wednesday, he told the House Government Oversight Committee that the State Department went out of its way to keep Hicks from communicating with Congressman Jason Chaffetz and Oversight Committee staff without a State Department lawyer. 
The State Department seemingly made Hicks unavailable to the media, as the State Department switchboard had no information on Hicks’ whereabouts or contact information when Breitbart News asked for it in December and January. 
“I was instructed not to allow the RSO, the acting Deputy Chief of Mission, and myself to be interviewed by Congressman Chaffetz,” Hicks told Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). 


Chaffetz, along with a congressional delegation, visited the U.S. embassy in Tripoli following the attacks. 
“You had several Congressional delegations come to you from various places around the world. Has that ever happened, when lawyers get on the phone to you prior a congressional delegation, coming to investigate a time when we’ve had four Americans lose their lives?” Jordan questioned. “Have you ever had anyone tell you, ‘Don’t talk with the people from Congress coming to find out what’s at play?'”
“Never,” Hicks responded. He said that it was the first time such an incident ever occurred.

According to Hicks, one of the State lawyers on the phone call tried to accompany the members of the delegation and staff from the Oversight Committee to every meeting Hicks attended.
The State Department lawyers were excluded from a classified briefing Hicks attended with the delegation because the attorneys did not have clearance to attend. The incident provoked a phone call from then-Sec. Clinton’s State Department Counsel, Cheryl Mills.
“You had another conversation on the phone with Cheryl Mills. She’s the counselor for the Department of State. She’s the staff counsel to Secretary Clinton,” Jordan clarified. He asked, “Is that a pretty important position?” Hicks responded affirmatively on both accounts.
“She is the fixer for the Secretary of State. She’s as close as you can get to Secretary Clinton?” Jordan asked.
Hicks agreed, saying Mills was “very upset” about State lawyers being excluded from the classified briefing with Chaffetz and the rest of the delegation.
“She demanded a report on the visit,” Hicks said. Mills served as the Counselor and Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton since January of 2009.

The Obama administration has been forced to admit that the nuclear deal to which Iran agreed last weekend in Geneva, Switzlerland has not actually been finalized. In the interim, Iran is continuing its enrichment of uranium, as well as continuing construction on the Arak nuclear plant it is meant to suspend. And the White House is being criticized for misleading the public about the terms of the Iran deal, which keep getting worse.
The Washington Post noted, in an editorial otherwise supportive of the deal, that the Obama administration had not told the whole truth: “What the White House didn’t report is that the text of the accord makes several major concessions to Tehran on the terms of a planned second-stage agreement…the United States and its partners have already agreed that Iranian enrichment activity will continue indefinitely. In contrast, a long-standing U.S. demand that an underground enrichment facility be closed is not mentioned.”


Iran clearly expects that the deal will eventually lead to the end of all sanctions against the regime for its repeated violations of UN Security Council resolutions that ban any nuclear enrichment, and that it will see its so-called “right” to enrich uranium recognized either explicitly or de facto, without restrictions–and not in 15-20 years, as the administration has implied, but in a mere five years from the signing of the deal.

No one is quite sure when the deal begins, and when the six-month window contemplated under the terms will be over. So Iran continues to play for time, and the Obama administration, having accepted Iran’s nuclear enrichment in principle, is forced to accept interpretations of the deal that favor Iran, having lost the leverage sanctions once provided. As the line from The Empire Strikes Back goes: this deal’s getting worse all the time.

            NYT: July 14th 2013- CAIRO — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived in Egypt on Saturday for meetings with its newly elected Islamist president and the chief of its still-dominant military council, declaring that the United States “supports the full transition to civilian rule with all that entails.”
But after weeks of internal debate across the Obama administration over how to respond to the ongoing struggle between the president and the generals, Mrs. Clinton touched on it only lightly, saying she looked forward to working “to support the military’s return to a purely national security role.”


State Department officials said the meeting itself sent a historic message. Seated in an ornate room in the presidential palace, Mrs. Clinton smiled for cameras and traded pleasantries with President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist jailed more than once by the American-backed autocracy overthrown 18 months ago. She became the highest ranking United States official to meet Mr. Morsi since he was sworn in two weeks ago as Egypt’s first democratically elected president.

But her outreach to the new president appeared constrained by evident reluctance to address his struggle to pry power from the generals. Her muted tone, State Department officials said, reflected a growing sense that American attempts to intercede may be futile in a contest where the outcome remains uncertain, all the players are deeply suspicious of American motives, and almost any statement could elicit a popular backlash.
Instead of calling for an immediate handover of power as American officials have in the past, Mrs. Clinton instead emphasized only the need for “building consensus across the Egyptian political spectrum.” In brief remarks after the meeting with Mr. Morsi, her sole reference to the military decrees dissolving the Islamist-led Parliament and eviscerating his powers was a call for “consensus” among all sides in order “to work on a new constitution and Parliament, to protect civil society, to draft a new constitution that will be respected by all, and to assert the full authority of the presidency.”
A senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in a briefing to reporters, said Mrs. Clinton planned to deliver virtually the same message in a private meeting with Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Egypt’s top military commander, as she did in public remarks on Saturday.

In what looks like an off-the-cuff blunder, Secretary of State John Kerry might have accidentally given Russian President Vladmir Putin the opportunity to muddy the international diplomatic waters and buy his friends in Syria some time. 
During a press briefing on Monday, Kerry said that Assad could avoid American air strikes by giving up all his chemical weapons within a week. Within hours, the State Department was forced to walk Kerry’s new red line back with the claim that he was making a “rhetorical argument about the impossibility and unlikelihood of Assad turning over chemical weapons he has denied he used.”
It seems, then, reasonable to conclude that Kerry spoke out of turn. Kerry was not authorized to offer Syria an “out” or a new ultimatum. But Kerry’s hypothetical hyperbole appears to have already backfired. 


In an obvious desire to make Kerry pay for his flub and throw a wrench in Obama’s determination to go to war with Syria, Putin has seized upon Kerry’s hypothetical and called on Syria to accept Kerry’s offer and turn over all of its chemical weapons. No one believes Assad would ever willingly give up his chemical weapons, but should he agree to an offer the Obama administration did not mean to make, it could stall American action for weeks and even months.
Syria is already warming to the idea.  
This complication could be a major blow to all of the Obama administration’s prepared plans to punish Assad for using the weapons and to change the balance of power in the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Public opposition to Obama’s war is already surging. Weeks or months from now, after the torturous international diplomatic process that no one believes would end with Assad giving up the chemical weapons that keep him in power winds down, it is doubtful Congress or the American public would be ready to stomach a renewed push for war. 

But now that Putin has suggested Syria say “yes” to an offer Kerry was sure no one would accept, the Associated Press is reporting that the State Department will take a “hard look” at Russia’s proposal. 
Just like Obama’s unscripted “red line” comment that started this debacle, it looks as though another off-teleprompter administration blunder has shoved America’s foreign policy into a corner.

In the White House’s latest efforts at transparency, the administration announced to reporters that it would brief reporters on the latest shocking developments about the Benghazi situation … behind closed doors. Politico reports that the meeting started at approximately 12:45 PM ET, and that it moved the normal press briefing to 1:45 PM ET. Jay Carney, White House press secretary, did not comment on whether the meeting took place.

Politico reports:

The off-the-record session was announced to reporters in the wake of an ABC News report showing that White House and State Dept. officials were involved in revising the now-discredited CIA talking points about the attack on Benghazi.

The administration routinely exerts pressure on reporters it feels are not kind enough in their coverage. Reporters like Cheryl Attkisson of CBS News have felt the hand of their bosses for “wading dangerously close to advocacy” with regard to Benghazi. No doubt this “off-the-record” meeting was designed to get all the president’s horses and all the president’s men to put the Benghazi humpty dumpty together again.
UPDATE: Reporters not invited to the off-the-record briefing are reportedly incredibly unhappy about it:


UPDATE II: Jake Tapper of CNN reports that the regularly scheduled press briefing has been delayed even further:

UPDATE III: Politico now reports that the meeting has been characterized as “deep background.” The existence of the meeting itself is considered “off-the-record.” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, “Deep background means that the info presented by the briefers can be used in reporting but the briefers can’t be quoted.” So expect a fair number of “White House sources” to appear in reportage for the next few days.
UPDATE IV: Jay Carney began his on-the-record press briefing by announcing that 14 news organizations were invited to the closed door briefing, but that it was not a substitute for the on-the-record briefing. He then announced that it was “erroneous” to describe the briefing as “off-the-record,” and instead suggested it was “deep background.”

On August 26, President Obama will present Ty Carter with the Medal of Honor. Carter initially joined the Marines in 1998; he joined the Army a decade later in 2008 after being honorably discharged in 2003 and has attained the rank of Staff Sergeant.
Carter earned the Medal of Honor by running back and forth between Combat Outpost Keating and a disabled Humvee while serving in Afghanistan. Three American soldiers were stuck in the disabled humvee without any ammunition to defend themselves or strike back at the enemy.
Carter and his platoon were deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009. Once there, Carter found himself at Combat Outpost Keating, which he described as “a death trap” because it sat deep within a valley surrounded by mountains. The outpost was there to keep insurgents from slipping into Pakistan, and Carter was there to help man it until it could be shut down on October 4, 2009.


But as CNN reports, the Taliban struck the day before the outpost was to be closed. Carter and his fellow soldiers were forced to defend their lives in what is arguably one of the most intense firefights of the war in Afghanistan.

As the Taliban targeted mortars and large guns at Combat Outpost Keating in an attempt to render the location defenseless, they kept a constant barrage of small arms fire on the troops as well. By using this tactic, they were able to kill eight of the 53 American soldiers stationed there.
With the worst of the fire coming in, Carter realized three fellow soldiers–Sgt. Bradley Larson, Spc. Stephan Mace, and Sgt. Justin Gallegos–“[were] trapped in a Humvee and they needed more supplies to return fire.”
Carter ran “through that deadly gauntlet three times to get supplies to the men.”
By the time the attack on Combat Outpost Keating ended, two of the soldiers in the Humvee–Mace and Gallegos–were dead, and Carter says he is haunted by his belief that he could have done more. He says the faces of the dead soldiers pop into his head and he thinks, “I shoulda [sic] done this, I could of done that.”
Breitbart News salutes Staff Sgt. Ty Carter for his courage under fire. We are free because of men like him. God bless the families of the troops who were lost at Combat Outpost Keating. Breitbart News refuses to allow their sacrifice to be forgotten.

Yesterday, Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) attended a private meeting with President Barack Obama on the subject of immigration reform. They emerged all smiles: “It’s one of the best meetings I’ve ever had with the president,” Graham said. President Obama “understands the parameters of what we’re dealing with,” said McCain. Both senators are supporters of immigration reform efforts now under way in the Senate.
Those efforts themselves are the product of separate negotiations outside “regular order” in the Senate. A group called the “Gang of Eight,” which includes both McCain and Graham, has agreed to the broad principles of a bipartisan compromise on immigration that would include both border enforcement and a “path to citizenship”–though the question of whether, and for how long, the enforcement stage would come first remains unresolved.


It is not the first time a “gang” effort has been used to pressure the rest of the Republican caucus, but it is the first time such an effort has been coordinated with the president. McCain and Graham’s endorsement of the president’s efforts is particularly striking given their persistent push for answers on the Benghazi scandal, and their strong opposition to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (though they both refused to sustain a filibuster).

The Republicans’ “gang problem” has contributed to the growing frustration that conservative voters feel with the GOP. In McCain’s case, the frustration is compounded by the fact that he ran for re-election in 2010 while promising to crack down on illegal immigration. In the House of Representatives, Speaker John Boehner agreed to stop separate talks with Obama, and to commit to “regular order.” The Senate has added no such discipline.
Even in the House, Boehner has abandoned a promise to observe the “Hastert rule”–to ensure that any vote that comes to the floor is approved by the majority Republican caucus first. The result has been a string of capitulations that lead in turn to bad policy. The noble cause of bipartisanship first requires two parties. If Republicans cannot establish minimal policy discipline–even personal discipline–the country’s frustrations will grow.

Moments after President Obama made his briefing room statement about race and Trayvon Martin, CNN’s BREAKING NEWS graphic swirled, faded, and cut to anchor Brooke Baldwin, who was visibly flushed with excitement. Brooke announced, “Wow, what a surprise we have all witnessed, if you have been tuned in the last half-hour, we were watching THE President surprise everyone…” 
She went on to describe Obama’s statement as “very, very personal; very heartfelt.” Baldwin then assured her audience that Obama had “not used a teleprompter,” because he had “given much thought and much time to making this message VERY personal.”


The CNN anchor then went to a video clip saying, “But FIRST, here’s the president, making this personal.” 
Apparently, Baldwin thought Obama’s statement was personal. 
After the clip, Breathless Brooke returned with her panel: Candy Crowley, Sonny Hostin, Jessica Yellin, and Gloria Borger. 

After another “Wow!”,  Baldwin (who looked like she might have been trembling) turned things over to Chief White House Correspondent, Yellin. 
If you hadn’t known what she was talking about, based solely on Yellin’s awe-inspired melodramatic rhetoric, you would think that something had happened on the level of the first man walking on the moon. Barely able to contain herself, Yellin described Obama’s statement as something “as personal and as bluntly as I have ever heard him speak about racism in America and his own experience of racism in his life.”
Yellin later added that this was “an important moment for this president, and an important moment for America.” 
After again reminding us of how “incredibly personal” Obama was, Baldwin then turned things over to Candy Crowley. 
As excited as the rest, Crowley jumped right in to tell us that Obama is a “thoughtful guy” and the “sort of person who thinks these things through.” 

Crowley obviously missed Obama’s “acted stupid” racial debacle. 
Crowley closed her comment by pointing out that Obama has just “elevated the discussion.” 

Sonny Hostin, the only legal analyst in the country who was shocked by the Zimmerman verdict,  was left a little speechless due to the “so many thoughts she had running through her mind. After mentioning that she was the mother of a “young, brown boy,” she then put those thoughts together and used Obama’s words to trash our country and judicial system as racist. 
Finally, it was political analyst Gloria Borger’s turn, and she started out with some hysterical nonsense about how Obama didn’t want this conversation to be about him — even though this is the second time he has chosen to interject both himself and his race into a local crime that had nothing to with him or racism. Borger found this, “stunning.”
Borger than narrowed her eyes and talked about how Obama came to the podium as an “African-American male and reflected soberly about some important issues we have to discuss in this country.” Borger was in awe over how Obama “distilled ” all of these complicated issues one statement. 

My favorite part of the discussion, though, was Borger’s non sequitar. Baldwin had a good moment when she said that she wanted to make clear that the “Stand your Ground” law had nothing to do with Zimmerman’s defense. 
Borger then jumped in to say, “But it is the law in thirty states.” 
Huh?
Bottom line: For almost fifteen minutes it was hard to tell if you were watching a cable news network, or a slumber party-cam with five breathless Beliebers after a Justin Bieber concert. 
The gushing was as non-stop as the criticism and intelligent insight was non-existent.
Throughout the segment, Obama was constantly referred to as an “African-American.”
Like George Zimmerman, Obama has one white parent. 
CNN, however, only refers to Zimmerman as a “white Hispanic.”
UPDATE: 90 minutes later, CNN is still at it.

Karl Rove and more than one hundred Republican donors sent a letter to Republican members of Congress on Tuesday, urging them to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would include, among other provisions, granting “legal status” to illegal aliens who meet certain criteria.
Anticipating that lawmakers will face resistance to the bill when they go home for the August recess, the letter marks the escalation of a campaign in which Republican leaders and donors are pressuring House Republicans to act on an immigration reform bill.
The letter begins: “We write to urge you to take action to fix our broken immigration system.” According to the New York Times, those who have signed include Rove; “former Vice President Dan Quayle; Tom Stemberg, a founder of Staples; and Frank VanderSloot, the founder of Melaleuca Inc.” Romney campaign finance director Spencer Zwick was also signed the letter. 


The Times reports that Carlos Gutierrez, former Commerce Secretary for President George W. Bush and a founder of the Republicans for Immigration Reform super PAC, organized the effort. Gutierrez, who has said in the past that English should not be the official language of government, said the letter was “the beginning of a campaign to lobby Republican lawmakers in favor of a broad immigration bill as they return to their districts for the August break.” 

“What tends to happen during the month of August is that members go home and they go to town hall meetings and they check up on their offices in terms of phone calls and letters, and that’s where they get bombarded,” Gutierrez told the Times. “So Republicans who are for immigration reform–and I believe there are many–we need to make our voice known in August.”
The letter also says: 

“To fix our immigration system we need meaningful reforms that will (1) secure our borders, (2) provide a legal way for U.S.-based companies to hire the workers they need while making it impossible to hire workers here illegally, and (3) take control of our undocumented immigration problem by providing a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who pay penalties and back taxes, pass criminal background checks, and go to the back of the line.”

Florida taxpayers are set to subsidize a joint venture between Univision and ABC that will try to use a new cable channel to “own” the debate on comprehensive immigration reform. 
According to a report in the Miami Herald, Fusion, the cable channel that will debut on October 28 in roughly 20 million homes, may collect nearly $10 million in subsidies “pledged by Miami-Dade County and Florida for the new venture, with the state contributing $7 million to the package.”
Fusion’s facility opened on Wednesday in Doral, Florida and, in return for the subsidies, Univision has reportedly “pledged to spend $247 million on the new complex over many years.”


Jorge Ramos, the host of Univision’s Al Punto Sunday Show, will anchor a one-hour show at 8 PM on Fusion, and he was clear that the channel will intend to “own” the immigration debate “from the first hour.” On his Sunday show, Ramos has been a fierce advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. On a recent episode, Ramos interviewed citizen-activist D.A. King, a staunch opponent of amnesty. Ramos’s first question to King was, “Why do you hate immigrants so much?”

“We’re going to come out on Oct. 28th, and if the House doesn’t approve immigration reform by then, then there’s going to be a new, very loud voice in Fusion, talking about immigration every single night until immigration reform passes,” Ramos told The Huffington Post in a recent interview.
As the Herald notes, Fusion is “partly a hedge against the aging of Univision’s primetime audience of nearly 4 million Spanish-speaking residents, as their children and grandchildren increasingly turn to English-language programming.”
Though “Nielsen ratings show Univision drawing an average prime-time audience of 3.6 million, large enough for it to be the No. 1 network in any language during the summer re-run season,” a Pew Research poll found that “half of Hispanic Latino adults get their news in both Spanish and English, while the number relying solely on Spanish-language news sources dropped from 22 percent in 2006 to 18 percent in 2012.”
The channel also plans to target so-called millennials, and some of their hosts do not speak Spanish. The network has even hired a former producer for The Daily Show to produce satire programming on news and sports.

6430	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/05/27/The-Ailes-Manifesto	Opinion	0	Civil Rights	None	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Fox News CEO Roger Ailes’ May 23 stirring letter to Fox employees will be remembered as a turning point in the battle for freedom of the press in the age of Obama.  
The Ailes letter, denouncing the Obama administration’s trampling on the First Amendment, should be seen, of course, as a strong defense of Fox correspondent James Rosen. In addition, the Ailes letter–in truth, a manifesto–is a staunch vindication of Fox News and its “speak-truth-to-power” approach to journalism. Finally, the Ailes Manifesto should be seen as a clarion call for freedom–for freedom of the press, and also for the right of all Americans to think freely, liberated from the MSM thought-monopoly.  


As Patrick Caddell has pointed out here at Breitbart News, the Obama Administration has never truly been worried about leaks, because the Administration itself has been the main source of leaks. Why? For political advantage, of course. That is, to make the Administration look good, especially in regard to the war on terror in the run-up to the 2012 election. 
The Obamans wanted to maintain their exclusive “franchise” on leaks, rewarding friendly reporters, such as The New York Times’ David Sanger, with information on highly-classified programs, including the Stuxnet virus used against Iran. In fact, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, upon reading Sanger’s book Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, said, “You learn more from the book than I did as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and that’s very disturbing to me.” In other words, US national security was a distant second, well behind the primary goal, which was the President’s re-election.  
To be sure, the Obama Administration leaked for other reasons, as well. As Breitbart News’ Matthew Boyle reported, the Obama Justice Department was happy to leak documents to advance its own interests in the “Fast and Furious” scandal.  

It is obvious that the Obama Administration will leak any information regardless of its sensitivity to national security or to individuals’ reputations when it is expedient for political gain. The facts are incontrovertible, over a broad range of issues, over a long period of time.  
While the Obama administration has been playing this dangerous game, Roger Ailes has been clear and straightforward. The Ailes Manifesto is, indeed, fierce in its defense of freedom. As the Fox News founder–at the helm, now, for 17 years–wrote: 

The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time. We will not allow a climate of press intimidation, unseen since the McCarthy era, to frighten any of us away from the truth.

Even amidst the greatest threat to press freedom in six decades, neither Fox, nor its friends and allies, are going to back away, or back down. The fight for freedom is a fight for all of us.  
Indeed, as the Ailes Manifesto continues to reverberate through the media and political landscape, we can observe three kinds of reaction: first, strong awareness and support from the activist public; second, a surprising amount of solidarity from the other journalists and journalistic organizations; and third, a cringing U-turn by some notorious Obama administration lackeys and lapdogs.  
So let’s look at each of these three categories in turn. 

First, support from the activist public. Social media showed a huge outpouring of support for reporter Rosen and the Ailes letter. “Ailes’ letter give you a sense of him as a boss,” one Twitter user said. “Kind of man that inspires real loyalty out of respect.”
“Simply put, Roger Ailes, a true principled Leader,” said another. One response read, “The Roger Ailes memo might be the most badass thing I’ve ever read.”

Another reader remarked, “Roger Ailes sounds downright Churchillian.”
Second, others in the MSM have chosen to side with Fox, at least on this one issue. Urged on by press leaders–including Fox News’ Ed Henry, who said to fellow pressies, “let’s not be a bunch of lemmings”–many MSM-ers have chosen to do the right thing, even if it pains them. As Joel Pollak noted, stalwart liberal Alex Seitz-Wald of Salon.com was moved to tweet, “I understand lib cognitive dissonance on Obama admin going after Fox reporter, but only right answer is #TeamRosen.”
Fox News Opinion summed up much of this diverse media support in a May 23 compendium titled, “They All Stand with Fox News’ James Rosen.” The piece took note of supportive comments from staffers of CNN, The New Yorker, The Washington Post–even former anchor Keith Olbermann. Remarkably, the tabloid-y TMZ, not known for its political coverage, had to agree that the controversy, and the Ailes Manifesto, constituted a hot story. 

On May 21, the White House Correspondents Association issued a strong statement: 

Reporters should never be threatened with prosecution for the simple act of doing their jobs. The problem is that in two recent cases, one involving Fox News’ James Rosen and the other focused on the Associated Press, serious questions have been raised about whether our government has gotten far too aggressive in its monitoring of reporters’ movements, phone records, and even personal email.

Meanwhile, the support keeps coming. On Saturday, The Washington Post wrote a tough pro-Rosen editorial titled, “The freedom to ask,” in which the Post quoted the Justice Department’s own stated policy on leak investigations, which declares, “The prosecutorial power of the government should not be used in such a way that it impairs a reporter’s responsibility to cover as broadly as possible controversial public issues.” The Post then added, “The Obama administration should recommit to its spirit.” 
Third, even some of Obama’s most groveling fans have had to adjust course in light of the new knowledge about his administration’s bullying methods. In fact, support for Ailes and Fox has been so broad and strong that even mortal enemies of Fox have had to come around, however grudgingly. For example, Media Matters for America (MMFA), the George Soros-funded anti-Fox smear operation run by David Brock, has been forced to do a 180 from its original pro-Obama position.  
On May 14, as the news about the Justice Department investigations was breaking, MMFA slavishly published talking points in support for the Obama administration. In other words, the MMFA Obama-propaganda operation was trying to teach others how they, too, could be Obama-propagandists. Yet after a firestorm of criticism, MMFA shifted its position, albeit over ten long days. 
On May 24, MMFA Senior Fellow and Andrew Breitbart bête noire Eric Boehlert, reflecting this new line, complained that “federal law enforcement seems preoccupied with snooping around, in increasingly clandestine ways, and ensnaring reporters in criminal investigations.” Well, yes; better late than never.  
Boehlert continued in this manner, even allowing for the heretical thought that Fox News might not be at fault in everything: 

Whether it was the Department of Justice’s wild overreach in seizing phone records of more than 20 separate telephone lines used by Associated Press editors and reporters, or the Department’s more focused, yet even more troubling, information grab of a Fox News reporter, the practice is wrong and shortsighted. It’s also un-American.

One can only imagine the drama inside MMFA before those anti-Obama Administration words were printed on its site. Which was more gut-wrenching for David Brock, criticizing the Obama Administration or defending Fox News from it?
Of course, as Pollak wrote, the pro-Ailes/pro-Fox sentiment, while welcome, is unlikely to last for long:   

Now that Holder has been caught in a hacking scandal of his own–first of telephones at the Associated Press, then of Rosen and other Fox News journalists–the playing field is leveled. And even though the wider media solidarity with Fox News is doomed to be short-lived, from now on the White House will face bolder, fearless conservative media, confident in the knowledge that they are defending universal principles.

Still, Ailes and Fox have made their point, and it will be an enduring point. The impact of the strong Ailes Manifesto and the unyielding Fox stance may be felt only briefly among the MSM, but it will remembered forever in conservative, libertarian, and constitutionalist circles.   
On this Memorial Day, these words of Ailes have it exactly right: 

Too many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of press freedom. We can’t and we won’t forget that. To be an American journalist is not only a great responsibility, but also a great honor. To be a Fox journalist is a high honor, not a high crime.

And we here at Breitbart News might humbly add: it’s a high honor to be an American on the same side as Roger Ailes, James Rosen, and Fox News, in this historic fight for freedom. Together, we will win, because victory begets victory.

Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Pat Leahy (D-VT) is using the Republican National Committee (RNC) to bolster his attack on Republicans opposed to rushing through an unexamined comprehensive immigration reform package.
Leahy made the move in his letter berating Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions for joining all his Senate Judiciary Committee GOP colleagues except for the two who are members of the so-called “Gang of Eight” in calling for an open and transparent immigration reform process.
“I am encouraged by the recent recommendations in what is being called its ‘autopsy’ of the last election, in which the Republican National Committee wrote that your party ‘must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,'” Leahy wrote to Sessions.


The full quote from the RNC “autopsy” report reads: “We are not a policy committee, but among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.”

Now that the RNC, which admits it is not a vehicle from which policy should be drafted, has taken to advocating a specific policy proposal, such advocacy is being used by Senate Democrats to drive a wedge between Republican lawmakers.
“I hope that you and other Republican Senators on the Committee will do so [support immigration reform],” Leahy chided Sessions. “I am encouraged that after two resounding presidential defeats, some Republican politicians are concerned enough about the growing Hispanic voting population that they are abandoning their former demagoguery and coming to the table.”
“I welcome Republicans to this effort,” Leahy continued. “I am glad that Senator McCain is once again interested in supporting comprehensive immigration reform. I still worry that too many congressional Republicans continue to oppose a straightforward pathway to citizenship, but that is a discussion we need to have out in the open, in front of the American people.”

In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) attended a fundraiser where he blasted President Bush, telling the crowd, “I was a constitutional law professor, which means unlike the current president I actually respect the Constitution.” President Obama, however, has been far less respectful of the Constitution that Senator Obama purportedly was. In fact, Obama has steadily violated a bevy of Constitutional provisions ranging from separation of powers to specific elements of the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments.

This week, Obama unilaterally decided to tell insurance companies that they could now allow sale of plans in the individual insurance market that Obamacare had prevented, forcing five million Americans off the health plans they liked. As Ken Klukowski of Breitbart News has written, this is a violation of the Constitutional separation of powers: 

Obama’s announcement is a flagrant and undeniable violation of his constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause. The provisions of Obamacare causing enormous trouble for insurance plans are mandatory, and only Congress can change those parts of the Affordable Care Act.

But President Obama has a history of violating the Constitutional balance of powers. As Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal has noted, he has unilaterally suspended enforcement of immigration law; he has refused to prosecute drug law violators; he simply stopped defending federal laws he didn’t like, like the Defense of Marriage Act, in court; he issues waivers on Obamacare and the No Child Left Behind Act; Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency has attempted to regulate carbon emissions when Congress didn’t push through a global warming bill; he appointed members of the National Labor Relations Board in violation of law; his administration rammed through an auto bailout that screwed bondholders, as well as a slush fund from British Petroleum. Strassel writes, “Mr. Obama came to office promising to deliver a new kind of politics. He did–his own, unilateral governance.”
President Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not extend to freedom of religion – his administration has forced religious businessowners to pay for insurance plans that cover activities in violation of religious precepts. It does not extend to freedom of speech – Obama has condemned exercises of speech he doesn’t like as violative of American principles (see, for example, the infamous YouTube video Obama said caused violence in the Middle East). It does not extend to equal protection under the laws – Obama has personally intervened in criminal cases like that of George Zimmerman. 

Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not apply to protections against unreasonable search and seizure, as Obama’s deeply intrusive National Security Agency programs prove. It does not apply to Fifth Amendment protections against taking of private property. It does not apply to the Second Amendment, as Obama’s executive orders on guns show. And it most certainly does not extend to the Tenth Amendment, which protects states’ rights. 
Obama has never respected the Constitution. In fact, he sees it as a barrier to his ambitions. That’s why, as a senior law lecturer at the University of Chicago, he lamented the fact that the Warren Court “never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth, and of more basic issues such as political and economic justice in society.” That’s why Obama repeatedly emphasizes that the Constitution stops him from doing things he wants to do — it’s an obstacle to be overcome, not the greatest governmental structure ever created.

The new film Lee Daniels’ The Butler depicts President Ronald Reagan as indifferent to the suffering of blacks as well as the country’s civil rights progress.
Breitbart News has debunked that cinematic meme, but Reagan’s commitment to racial equality began long before he even considered a life in politics.


John D. Morris, Director of Development at Eureka College’s Ronald W. Reagan Society, suspects those who malign Reagan today are fearful of his legacy and impact on the next generation of conservatives. And the facts simply don’t bear out their version of reality.
Morris describes a yearbook displayed on Eureka’s campus featuring a photograph of “Dutch” along with classmate Willie Sue Smith, a black woman Reagan would consider a dear friend.
“I have spoken with both of her children who said that Ronald Reagan and their mother corresponded for years. She had passed notes in class between Dutch and his girlfriend, Mugs Cleaver,” Morris says. “Reagan saw Willie Sue as a classmate and friend and, more than anything, another child of God.”

Another college pal, football standout William Franklin Burghardt, became one of Reagan’s lifelong chums.
Morris says one Reagan anecdote illustrates where the actor turned politician learned the value of equality. Jack Reagan, the future president’s father, one day witnessed a store clerk rudely deny a black man’s son from using the bathroom.
“The attendant next turned to Jack Reagan to ask for help. ‘Your services are no longer required by us,’ Jack replied. Taking his children outside, he told Moon and Dutch that no human beings should ever receive such treatment,” Morris says, adding the president would often share that meaningful moment with others.
Morris says it’s a shame the film industry is reluctant to tell the true nature of Reagan the man.
“Hollywood will someday see the virtues of making films based on the inspiring stories of the most consequential member of its own talent pool in history,” he says.

Over at the Atlantic Garance Franke-Ruta has a thoughtful article arguing that the GOP’s current “war on women” response is ill-considered at best.

Five different Republican committees this morning released a joint memo
pushing back on the “Democrats’ War on Women” messaging to highlight
the sex scandals of a group of Democratic men and argue that Democrats
are hypocrites who only care about women when it is politically
convenient.

It’s a fine message as far as it goes, which is as a kind of a summer
doldrums GOP base-riling play, reminding Republican women that there
are a bunch of Democratic men out there who they — and others! — think
are creeps.

Two things about this. First, Democrats underestimate how much stuff like this really gets under the skin of people on the other side. The entire “war on women” campaign is offensive to GOP women and to men who have wives and daughters. 


But making a political point by crafting an obnoxious bit of hyperbole is something Democrats excel at lately. Whether it’s comparing the GOP to hijackers or terrorists over budget negotiations, the party has fully embraced argument by demonization. I’m not talking about a loose comment here or there, which always happens on both sides, I mean a coordinated campaign from the top down which includes the President. 
Franke-Ruta argues that instead of acting on our entirely justifiable irritation with the left’s obnoxious memes we should design a more reasoned campaign built around women and security issues. I think it’s well intended and probably even a good idea. But–and this is point two–it fails to appreciate the extent to which policy arguments are merely backdrops for more energetic attacks in our elections these days.
To give a current example, these “no slutbags” flyers appearing around NYC are going to do more to hurt Anthony Weiner than any policy argument about his 64 points for a strong middle class. And the same applies to the 2012 election. 

The left is kidding itself if it thinks the “war on women” was about expanded funding for birth control. It was about Rush calling Sandra Fluke a slut. That was the headline and the source of outrage onto which all the policy baggage was later loaded. Similarly, Todd Akin’s comments about rape did more to make the war on women a reality than any policy papers posted by the DNC. Populist outrage first, policy backstopping afterwards. 
Don’t believe me? Have a look at this move on ad from last year. Notice the focus is on offensive statements not policy arguments. In fact, American Crossroads tried to respond
with their own “war on women” policy arguments, not
unlike what Franke-Ruta is suggesting the GOP try now. But as we all
know, those arguments did not get nearly the same level of media or popular traction. 
Rush and Akin’s comments are to Democratic cultural politics what Jaws was to movies about killer sharks. The fascination on the left may have devolved into Sharknado-level parody by now, but there’s no doubting that a new genre was spawned. And to extend that metaphor, there’s no point responding to these memes with policy prescriptions anymore than there is giving the Sharknado sequel a stern and serious negative review. There is no policy response to “binders full of women.” None that matters. 
Filner, Weiner and Spitzer give the GOP an easy (and potentially effective) opportunity to respond in kind. It may not be a reasoned policy argument but as we
learned in 2012 that’s not what wins elections.

6603	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/01/Exclusive-US-Civil-Rights-Commissioner-Amnesty-would-violate-blacks-civil-rights	News	0	Civil Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, told Breitbart News that Attorney General Eric Holder’s claims that amnesty for illegal immigrants is a civil rights issue “profoundly ahistorical.”
“If you take a look at the basis of the civil rights movement, it was to have blacks treated in all respects the same as whites or everybody else,” Kirsanow (pictured) said in a phone interview. “What amnesty is doing is setting aside a special class of individuals who are going to put forward and treated more favorably than others. In other words, they’ve already broken the law and are being given amnesty.  
“In terms of immigration policy… it would severely affect the rights of blacks generally and all low-income Americans. What it is going to do is displace those individuals from the labor market.”


The U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Kirsanow said, has held extensive hearings in recent years detailing how amnesty would economically impact American workers, especially the black community.
“We had a hearing before the Civil Rights Commission on the effects of illegal immigration on black employment levels, both wage levels and unemployment rates,” Kirsanow said. “What we had were a number of experts from just about every sphere you can think of: business, academia and immigration experts in general. They spanned the ideological spectrum. We had individuals from the far left, individuals in the middle, individuals on the right.
“They disagreed in some respects about certain policy prescriptions but they were unanimous in their conclusion, backed by copious amounts of data,” he recalled, “that illegal immigration had a deleterious effect on the wage and employment levels of black Americans. And it’s not a small effect. It’s a clearly sizable effect.”

Kirsanow and some of his fellow U.S. Commission on Civil Rights members have pushed for members of Congress and key political figures in the national immigration debate like President Barack Obama himself to address these issues, but they have ignored the calls thus far. 
“What’s interesting is those who have described themselves as the champions of civil rights are doing enormous damage to the ranks of black Americans by supporting and shepherding through comprehensive immigration reform that does nothing to control the borders, that grants amnesty and is going to create a legal population of individuals who are going to undercut the employment and wage prospects for low income Americans, generally, and specifically black Americans and more specifically black males,” he asserted.
Kirsanow questions who the lawmakers in Washington, D.C., on both sides of the political aisle are really representing, given that they have not substantively discussed the issue in their legislative deliberations. “I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee back in April on immigration reform on the same thing that we’re talking about right now,” he stated. “What was amazing is the number of senators who were either cavalier about it or they gave grudging acknowledgment to the fact that ‘yeah, there’s a possibility that there might be some dislocation to American workers as a result of illegal immigration’ and then just kind of moved on. 
“The question I have is: Who do they represent? They are United States Senators. They represent Americans, presumably. Yet, what they’re proposing is they’re going to have a decided negative effect on Americans. What reason? What? Who do they represent? Do they represent illegal immigrants? Or do they represent lawful Americans? And that’s a question that needs to be posed to them.”
Kirsanow was originally one of only three witnesses who were going to be called to testify on the immigration situation before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He; GOP establishment figure Doug Holtz-Eakin of American Action Forum (AAF), a group advocating in favor of amnesty; and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were going to be the only ones who testified were it not for public outcry about the rushed process. 

Originally, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Pat Leahy (D-VT) and Senate Democratic Party leadership were not even going to call any hearings. “On a matter this large, it is an insult to the American people that only three people were going to testify regardless of how knowledgeable they may be about the subject matter,” Kirsanow said. “This is such a complex matter that they needed perspectives from so many different places. What we had was a bill that was gigantic. It was almost the size of Obamacare and yet it was released barely 36 hours before our testimony. 
“In other words, we were testifying in an information vacuum on a momentous piece of legislation. Only after there was a bit of hue and cry did Senate leadership understand that they needed to open up the testimony to more witnesses.”

Kirsanow and others members of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission have written letters on this matter to President Obama and to Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH), among other lawmakers, and they have received no response. Similarly, advocates opposed to amnesty like Leah Durant have written letters to members like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the chairman of the House Budget Committee, raising these same concerns–which have gone ignored, as well. 
Kirsanow said that while there are likely a number of reasons why members of the Congressional Black Caucus have ignored this real threat to their constituents, he thinks the most prevailing is that President Barack Obama, America’s first black president, is pushing the policy so they have no ability to stand up to him politically.
“I have asked them why they are not standing up for the needs of their constituents,” Kirsanow said. “We’ve sent these letters to Marcia Fudge. We’ve sent them to members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Radio silence. Complete radio silence.”

“I wish reporters asked members of the Congressional Black Caucus what the heck they’re thinking,” he said. “They’ve not been challenged on this. One of the dynamics at play is the fact that we have the first black president who is in support of this. If he is in support of it, a lot of black Americans will reasonably presume that he is looking out for their best interests. So, the Congressional Black Caucus can use that as cover. 
“If President Obama supports amnesty, and therefore 90 percent of the Congressional Black Caucus’ constituents will believe it’s in their best interests, those members of the Congressional Black Caucus are unlikely to be questioned by their constituents about whether it’s a good idea on that because they will have believed ‘Barack Obama looks out for my interests, it must be a good idea.'”
Kirsanow said the president is not sticking up for the black community and argued it might be because of special interests and potential future voter pools. “You know that old line, when you want to figure out why something is being done, follow the money? Well, in politics, you not only follow the money, but you follow the votes or potential votes,” he explained. “I think what a lot of sides see, both on the Republican side and the Democratic side, is this vast untapped pool of votes that they expect are going to materialize as a result of amnesty. 
“Republicans don’t want to be seen as being anti-Hispanic, Democrats see this as a giant new constituency group and, so, what you’ve got I think, and I don’t know if this pertains to President Obama, but you’ve got a political class looking out for their interests. ‘I want more votes,’ as opposed to current interests of their constituents. 
“I don’t necessarily want to ascribe that motive to them, but it’s as plausible and probably more rationale than anything else because I can’t figure out why it is representatives of the United States of America are doing something that is harmful to their constituents.”
While Kirsanow argues members of the political class in the black community like members of Congress and leaders of black groups like the NAACP and others do not stick up for their rank and file on this issue, he said he does get the impression many ordinary black citizens are aware of this threat to their economic well-being.
“A lot of folks do,” Kirsanow, who lives in inner-city Cleveland and used to serve as a member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), said. “I was in Washington, D.C., and I also appear of black radio shows from time to time, and other radio shows, and what you get without question and what you used to get for quite some time was whenever the issue of illegal immigration came up, black callers were outraged because they feel the effects,” he declared. 
“They see it with their own eyes. You get calls from people who have been displaced by illegal immigrants, people who can’t find jobs because they can’t compete against low wages offered to illegal immigrants and it’s fairly vigorous.”

Shorter Ann Curry: Your religious beliefs represent hate speech! 
Make no mistake about it, this is all about going after the Christian Church. Same-sex marriage, GLAAD’s fascist rampages, and all of this Orwellian political correctness is part of a long-term goal:  to make Christian beliefs a form of bigotry and to force a left-wing agenda on the church–all under a Trojan horse labeled “discrimination.” 
In many respects, Obama forcing the Catholic Church to violate its conscience with respect to providing birth control and abortion drugs through their social service institutions is a dry run for this. The left wants to know if they can persuade the American people that a non-existent right (in this case, free birth control) trumps a First Amendment that declaratively restricts the government from impeding the free exercise of religion. 


The obvious next step will be to attempt an end-run around the First Amendmen, by declaring as bigoted the Church’s refusal to marry same-sex couples. They will also attempt to declare as hate speech any belief held by the church that in any way angers GLAAD. 

What Ann Curry did to Kirk Cameron this morning is the first phase of that war: The shaming campaign. On national television, she brought the actor on to declare that his religious belief’s “hate speech” will encourage others to “mistreat gay people.”
We all know what the next step is, and that’s the outlawing of these opinions under the principle that the speaking of such things will cause harm to others.  
This, of course, would mean the end of the church — which is the whole idea.
Newsbusters:

Leading off an interview with conservative Christian actor Kirk Cameron on Tuesday’s NBC Today, co-host Ann Curry immediately attacked him for recent comments he made to CNN’s Piers Morgan: “I’m going to ask you about this firestorm that you set off…on the topic of gay marriage….Many people are suggesting that this is hate speech. Are you encouraging people to feel hate towards gay people?” [Listen to the audio or watch the video after the jump]
Curry plucked out a single sentence from Cameron’s CNN interview: “…you said, quote, ‘I think that it’s unnatural. I think that it’s detrimental and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.'” Cameron called out her selective framing of the topic: “I love all people. I hate no one. And, you know, when you take a subject and you reduce it to something like a four-second sound bite, and a check mark on a ballot, I think that that’s inappropriate and insensitive.”
Even after Cameron explained that the “edited down” quote “certainly didn’t reflect my full heart on the matter,” Curry still asserted he was encouraging hate: “Do you feel any responsibility saying words like that, that might encourage people to feel that it’s okay to treat – mistreat gay people?”
Cameron pushed back and cited Morgan’s blatant bias on the issue: “Nobody should mistreat anybody….what I think this reveals is that – the interviewer that asked me these questions even used the words with me, “I think your views are destructive” – so what that shows me is that all of us who really think deeply about social issues, like gay marriage, and abortion, and homosexuality, have convictions on issues.” 

Ann Curry and Leftists like her don’t give a damn about gays. If they did, you would see the same amount of hostility directed towards Muslims.

Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) has won a major battle against the politically correct left’s “War on Christmas,” he announced in a press release on Christmas Eve on Tuesday.
Since 1973, U.S. House rules made it an ethics violation for any official congressional communications to contain the phrase “Merry Christmas.” This month, after battling the system for the more than two years since he took office in 2011, Huelskamp was able to get the House to determine it will not consider use of the phrase “Merry Christmas” an ethics violation.

“For decades the PC Police have intimidated Christians throughout America with their attacks on the symbols and language of Christmas,” Huelskamp said in a statement released midday on Christmas Eve. “From nativity scenes to Christmas trees, those opposed to Christmas has sought to eradicate any reason for the season from the public square.  And Congress has not been exempted.”


Huelskamp noted the history of the U.S. House’s War on Christmas before detailing how he has won this battle in the war.
“Amazingly since 1973, the U.S. House of Representatives has forbidden the use of ‘Merry Christmas’ and deemed use of such words in any official mailing or e-mail an ethics violation,” Huelskamp said. “Instead, they demanded the use of ‘Happy Holidays.’ This month, the House Franking Commission accepted the position I have fought for since arriving in Congress–ignore the PC Police and let us use ‘Merry Christmas.'”
Huelskamp added that since 2011, he has fought against the politically correct people in the U.S. Congress who implemented and still attempted to enforce this rule. “In 2011 during an interview on Fox News, I stated my refusal to comply with this decades-old policy, which reflects the continual leftist war on Christmas,” Huelskamp said. 

I have continued that refusal through today, even as it has cowered many other public officials and private industry alike. The new refusal of the U.S. House to cater to the PC Police moves us one small step away from that carefully crafted secular society devoid of any reference to our religious and cultural heritage. I am glad that finally Members of Congress can express their holiday joy in a manner that they see fit and consistent with our American history–without an ethics threat.

Huelskamp ended his statement with a warm Christmas greeting for his constituents and all Americans: “As I have done for the past two years, I personally wish you and all of America a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.”
Merry Christmas, folks.

As the House begins to take up comprehensive immigration reform legislation, Richard Viguerie’s Conservative HQ sent a warning to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI): don’t commit political suicide by becoming the House’s version of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).
“We are still astonished and disappointed in how Florida Senator Marco Rubio squandered his conservative and Tea Party movement base by becoming the face of S. 744 – [the Senate’s bill],” the outlet wrote on Thursday. 
Rubio’s support among conservatives and Republicans has plummeted since he championed the Senate’s bill, and he has not mentioned the bill since it passed the Senate more than three weeks ago. 


Conservative HQ does not want to see Ryan meet the same fate. The site’s staff members write that “it looks like another promising Republican,” Ryan, “is about to follow Rubio down the plank and over the side into the shark-infested waters of granting amnesty to illegal immigrants.” Ryan, they argue, “should be smarter than to get sucked-into supporting anything remotely resembling the corrupt pork and special interest favor bloated Senate bill.”
Ryan recently told the Associated Press that he is keeping in touch with the House’s “Gang of Seven,” a group of bipartisan lawmakers focusing on immigration law. The “Gang” includes Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), who said Ryan is his “guiding light. I know I get him in trouble every time I say it.” Ryan has also clashed with conservative talk radio hosts Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin about the immigration bill’s impact on working-class Americans. 
Senior White House aides reportedly “often mention” Ryan “as crucial to the prospects for legislation this year” and hope that Ryan could “sway recalcitrant House members.” In addition, Ryan is associated with business and Catholic groups who are “backing an overhaul of immigration laws.” The Associated Press states Ryan urged House Republicans in a closed-door meeting last week to seize the moment to pass sweeping immigration reform. 

Conservative HQ claims that Ryan has a “penchant for granting the kind of deference to the interests of the establishment Republican Party’s corporate paymasters,” which include the “shills for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the cheap labor opportunists and the inside-the-Beltway party hacks of the ‘buy the Hispanic vote’ wing of the Republican Party.”
According to Conservative HQ, while Tea Partiers and conservatives want to have honest discussions about how to solve the country’s immigration problem but are wary of harmful side effects which could result from the current legislative push: 

What they are not prepared to do is dole out millions of dollars in slush funds to radical Hispanic political organizations like La Raza, grant vast new powers to the federal executive branch, insulate it from Congressional direction and oversight, bring millions of new clients for the welfare state from illegal and ineligible for benefits status to legal and eligible for benefits status and grant blanket amnesty to illegal immigrants who are in jail.

The authors urge Ryan to preserve his political capital and reject attempts to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation akin to the Senate bill.
“We welcome Paul Ryan to the debate on how best to apply conservative principles to immigration reform – something that eluded Senator Rubio,” Conservative HQ writes. “However, if Paul Ryan wants to avoid Marco Rubio’s fate he must begin by publicly and forcefully rejecting the corruption, pork and special interest favors of Rubio’s Gang of Eight bill.”

On Monday, GOP political commentator Karl Rove sharply criticized a recent Breitbart News article on new language in the Senate amnesty bill. Appearing on FoxNews to defend the bill’s security provisions, Rove singled out a Breitbart story which appeared Friday as “simply not true.” Rove’s criticism, however, was factually incorrect. 
The article Rove attacked, detailed a new provision in the then-Corker-Hoeven amendment which would allow immigrants on work visas who overstayed their visas to still apply for a green card. In other words, breaking immigration law in the future would not prevent someone from getting on the “path to citizenship.”   
Rove claimed the article “turned out simply not to be true. It was very narrow provision that said if you’re from one of nine countries that get what’s called ‘Temporary Protective Status’ because of war or conflict inside your country, and you’ve been employed for ten years, the last ten years, you can, like every other person who’s here in the United States get in line to become a citizen, ultimately at the back of the line, and can’t happen for another ten years and so forth.” (emphasis added)


Rove, like many supporters of the Senate bill, clearly has not read the entire bill or simply misunderstands it. The language discussed in the Breitbart article had nothing to do with the TPS program or refugees from war-torn countries. The amendment allowing visa-overstays applies to the overwhelming majority of future immigrants in this country, what’s called the Merit Track-2 path. The CBO estimates that more than half the current 11 million illegals in this country will take this path to citizenship.
That is not a “very narrow provision.” Rove’s attempt to attack the Breitbart News article was totally inaccurate and wrong.

Attorney General Eric Holder faces new questions about racial bias at the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as about the veracity of his testimony before Congress, as the result of a new Inspector General report and documents obtained by Judicial Watch. 
The Inspector General’s report, covered extensively by former DOJ official J. Christian Adams, reveals that many Civil Rights Division attorneys do not believe that the Voting Rights Act ought to be enforced to protect white victims as well as black victims, and that black employees who were willing to help prosecute black defendants–such as the New Black Panther Party–were subject to alleged threats and intimidation by DOJ officials.


The Judicial Watch documents suggest that political appointees at DOJ were involved in the decision to drop the case against the New Black Panther Party, contrary to Holder’s sworn testimony before Congress, in which he said: “The decisions made in the New Black Panther Party case were made by career attorneys in the department. And beyond that, you know, if we’re going to look at the record, let’s look at it in its totality.”

The documents also contradict the testimony of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez, who claimed that there was no political intervention in the case. 
Perez is currently considered the frontrunner to be President Barack Obama’s next Secretary of Labor, despite a controversial history that includes heavy involvement with the pro-amnesty group La Raza as well as the New Black Panther Party case.
Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, who fought the DOJ in court for access to the documents, called for “an independent investigation into whether Messrs. Holder and Perez committed perjury in testifying under oath about the Black Panther controversy.”

The New Black Panther Party is in Sanford, Florida organizing rallies and gatherings to be held after the jury reaches a verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. The jury began its second day of deliberations on Saturday. 
Jurors are deliberating whether Zimmerman committed second-degree murder when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman has claimed he had to shoot Martin in self-defense. 


The Washington Times noted the group has tweeted, “New Black Panther Party will not give you specific details on anything other than to say we have rallies and street maneuvers planned.” The group has even tweeted about a planned Sept. 7 rally for Trayvon Martin: “We can’t and WON’T try to control the general dissatisfied population. For sure we are ORGANIZING.”

“If Zimmerman is acquitted there is likely to be unrest all over America. It will be way beyond the capacity of the NBPP,” the group tweeted. “From what we are hearing there is a HIGH chance of rebellion across the nation if Zimmerman is acquitted on all charges.”
The Times flagged some tweets that showed the group’s disdain for Zimmerman. The NBPP tweeted that Zimmerman was “exposed on closing arguments as a lying, conniving, manipulating scheming underhanded profiling devil” and that the prosecution’s “withering” closing argument “wiped that smile off his [expletive] face.”
On Friday, Malik Shabazz, Chairman of the the New Black Panther Party, appeared on the David Webb Show on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, which Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon guest-hosted. Shabazz claimed the New Black Panthers are in Sanford because President Barack Obama has encouraged more “traditional” civil rights groups and leaders, like Al Sharpton, to not play active roles in organizing protests during the trial. He said groups like the New Black Panthers have had to replace the more “traditional” civil rights groups who he claimed have been “silenced.”

It begins.
There is no question that rank-and-file gay couples of all political stripes are sincere in their desire to enjoy the benefits and status that come with marriage. There is no sinister agenda at work in the issue of same-sex marriage among the masses. But the same cannot be said of  the organized left who have always intended to use the issue of gay marriage as a vehicle to destroy the Christian Church and marginalize Christians. 


Faithfulness to the Bible and the Christian faith will very soon be declared bigotry by the media and a de facto civil rights violation by the State. 
What is currently happening to the Boy Scouts of America at the hands of the organized left is nothing more than a trial run for what is surely coming next against the Church. The small ball has already begun: lawsuits, harassment, and media campaigns against those who preach what the Bible says. The Big Leagues, however, don’t launch until the State lights the torchfor the witch hunt, and that has already happened in the state of Washington. 
Although America’s most protected right is freedom of religion, that didn’t stop the state attorney general from filing a suit against Baronelle Stutzman,  a florist who said it was a “violation of conscience” to service a same-sex wedding. 

JD Bristol, attorney for Arlene’s, said his client has many customers and employees who are gay and the claim that she is “discriminating on the basis on sexual orientation is nonsense.” 
“This is about gay marriage, it’s not about a person being gay,” Bristol said. “She has a conscientious objection to homosexual marriage, not homosexuality. It violates her conscience.”
According to the florist, in response to standing by her Christian beliefs, she has received hate mail and threats to burn down her business. 
This is not an isolated incident, either. Back in February a baker who wouldn’t provide a cake for a lesbian wedding not only faced protesters but  is (or was) under investigation by the Oregon Attorney General. Back in 2006, a Catholic adoption service in Boston had to shut down after the government demanded the religious entity service same-sex couples. 
For those skeptical of the organized left’s desire to destroy the Church; one question: is it really a leap to believe that the same government currently attempting to force the Church and other religious business-owners to pay for the abortion pill will soon use the same arguments and precedents to force same sex marriage on these institutions?

6700	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/10/07/Breitbart-Horowitz-launch-TruthRevolt	Opinion	1	Civil Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
On Monday, Breitbart News editor-at-large Ben Shapiro, in conjunction with the David Horowitz Freedom Center, launched TruthRevolt.org, dedicated to destroying the media where they stand. “The goal of TruthRevolt is simple: unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public, and devastate their funding bases,” TruthRevolt.org states.
Shapiro says that TruthRevolt.org is launching by targeting Al Sharpton of MSNBC’s PoliticsNation. Their petition, which will be sent to stockholders and board members of Sharpton’s advertisers, states:


Al Sharpton is one of the greatest race hoaxers and divisive demagogues of the last half-century….Now it’s time to let his advertisers know that we won’t stand for our purchases backing his propaganda. TruthRevolt is leading the fight to inform Sharpton’s financial backers just who Sharpton is – and what the consequences will be for continuing to support his race-baiting.

TruthRevolt.org has launched a Twitter campaign to tweet @RitzCrackers with hashtag #SharptonsCrackers.
The Daily Beast reports:
The first Sharpton sponsor the group is targeting is Ritz Crackers, owned by Chicago-based Mondelez International. Shapiro said Truth Revolt chose Mondelez because it bills itself as a “family-friendly company” and because it was one of the few advertisers to respond to the group’s inquiries about why it supports the Sharpton show. 
As part of its response, Mondelez International said in a statement to Truth Revolt: “At Mondelez International we demonstrate our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship by participating in programs that best serve a wide range of local communities and their interests and needs. We extend our responsibility to the sponsorship of tasteful, believable television programming and we avoid sponsorship of programs that would be unacceptable in terms of generally accepted social or community standards.”
Shapiro says, “If anyone believes that Al Sharpton is tasteful and believable, they are delusional. The American people must wake Sharpton’s advertisers to their delusions. This is war – and for the left, the shock troops are those in the media who live off of advertiser and donor dollars. We must not be afraid to go after their funding sources. And we will.”

Saying a decision by a federal court to remove the famous Mt. Soledad Cross from a Southern California veterans memorial on Thursday was the latest skirmish in the war against religion and faith, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said not even Congress can protect landmark symbols from “angry atheists armed with attorneys.” 
“This is just more reason why we need to stand up for our constitution and the religious liberty it protects,” Palin said.


Palin urged her followers on Friday to read a Breitbart News report on the decision, and said that the attacks on veterans’ memorials mean those “who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms can’t even be honored with a symbol embodying one of those freedoms.”
In her blockbuster bestseller Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, Palin has said these attacks are the tip of the spear in a larger fight to fundamentally transform America. Palin noted that in “Good Tidings and Great Joy,” she “mentioned a lawsuit taken against a World War I veterans memorial cross in California’s Mojave Desert”: 

In the 1930s, the Veterans of Foreign Wars put up a cross in the Mojave Desert– in an isolated area known as Sunrise Rock– to honor our brave soldiers who died in World War I. The modest cross, made out of eight-foot metal pipes painted white, sat on 1.6 acres of desert, 90 percent of which is federal land. Though it was ‘in the middle of nowhere,’ it meant such a great deal to many people. In 1983, when a World War I veteran lay on his deathbed, he asked his best friend, Henry Sandoz, to take care of the cross. And that’s exactly what Henry faithfully did every year after his friend’s death. 
Henry was in his seventies by the time Frank Buono, helped by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit claiming that this lovingly maintained old cross unconstitutionally promoted the Christian faith. As the case bounced from one court to another, the cross was enclosed with plywood, covered like an adult magazine in the back of a bookstore. Over the course of the court battle, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, it was even stolen. Finally, after eight long years of battling, the cross was able to remain on the land by transferring the property surrounding it to a private citizen.

Though the Mojave Desert cross was saved, the Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial cross in San Diego was not, even though in 2004, Congress, as Palin noted, “passed a law protecting its right to exist as a national memorial to the brave men and women in uniform ‘who sacrificed their lives in the defense of the United States.'”

“But apparently even Congress can’t stop angry atheists armed with attorneys. As I’ve said repeatedly in interviews about ‘Good Tidings and Great Joy,’ the so-called ‘war on Christmas’ is just the tip-of-the-spear in the larger efforts to strip God from the public square and banish all expressions of faith from public life,” she wrote.
Palin has consistently stood up against the “PC police.” On Thursday, hours after Palin told Breitbart Sports that she was disappointed that ESPN had rejected a commercial from a Catholic hospital because the station found the words “God” and “Jesus” to be “problematic,” ESPN reversed course and accepted the original ad, which it will air on Saturday. 
Palin also posted a statement from the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) that said the decision was “deeply flawed” because the “federal court decision declaring the memorial unconstitutional and ordering its removal does not square with the facts” and the “memorial is part of the historic landscape of San Diego and is consistent with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.”
The ACLJ has “promised to file an amicus brief in support of an expected appeal to keep the memorial – which includes a commemorative cross – in place.”
“We will continue to aggressively argue in support of this memorial and commemorative cross,” ACLJ President Jay Sekulow said. “We believe the law and precedent are clear: the Supreme Court has concluded in the past that ‘a Latin cross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs. It is a symbol often used to honor and respect those whose heroic acts, noble contributions, and patient striving help secure an honored place in history for this Nation and its people.'”
Sekulow added that “this memorial should not create a constitutional crisis. It is part of the history and heritage of the San Diego area.”

Cornel West said that under President Barack Obama there has been an increase in what he called the “new Jim Crow” and claimed his presidency has thus been a failure.
Appearing in a Monday interview on Al Jazeera America’s Talk to Al Jazeera with David Shuster, West said 2.5 million new prisoners have been incarcerated while Obama has been in office mostly “because of soft drugs” and the disparity in “crack cocaine versus regular cocaine” users. West referred to this phenomenon as the “new Jim Crow” because he said minority communities and the poor are disproportionately impacted. 
West blasted the level of corruption on Wall Street that has seen few people to go jail and said there has been a “two-tiered” system of justice under Obama. 


West said that disparity applied to Obama’s economy as well, as corporations have made record profits while there has been “massive unemployment” and “increasing wealth inequality.” He said struggling Americans are “giving up work” or “working part time” in Obama’s economy and those numbers are not reflected in the official unemployment numbers. 

Shuster, conversely, gushed over Obama’s accomplishments, saying Obama’s presidency should be considered a success if his presidency was judged by “morality” because Obama prevented a depression, passed Obamacare, ended the Iraq War, ended “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” and appointed the first Latina Supreme Court justice. He continued to defend Obama, saying Obama saved the economy and the unemployment rate would have been worse without Obama. 
But West disagreed, saying Martin Luther King Jr. would not approve of the “vanilla suburbs” at home that symbolize the income inequality that he said has gotten worse since King’s “I Have a Dream Speech” 50 year ago. West acknowledged that Appalachia also had problems with income and crime inequality.

Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) has won a major battle against the politically correct left’s “War on Christmas,” he announced in a press release on Christmas Eve on Tuesday.
Since 1973, U.S. House rules made it an ethics violation for any official congressional communications to contain the phrase “Merry Christmas.” This month, after battling the system for the more than two years since he took office in 2011, Huelskamp was able to get the House to determine it will not consider use of the phrase “Merry Christmas” an ethics violation.

“For decades the PC Police have intimidated Christians throughout America with their attacks on the symbols and language of Christmas,” Huelskamp said in a statement released midday on Christmas Eve. “From nativity scenes to Christmas trees, those opposed to Christmas has sought to eradicate any reason for the season from the public square.  And Congress has not been exempted.”


Huelskamp noted the history of the U.S. House’s War on Christmas before detailing how he has won this battle in the war.
“Amazingly since 1973, the U.S. House of Representatives has forbidden the use of ‘Merry Christmas’ and deemed use of such words in any official mailing or e-mail an ethics violation,” Huelskamp said. “Instead, they demanded the use of ‘Happy Holidays.’ This month, the House Franking Commission accepted the position I have fought for since arriving in Congress–ignore the PC Police and let us use ‘Merry Christmas.'”
Huelskamp added that since 2011, he has fought against the politically correct people in the U.S. Congress who implemented and still attempted to enforce this rule. “In 2011 during an interview on Fox News, I stated my refusal to comply with this decades-old policy, which reflects the continual leftist war on Christmas,” Huelskamp said. 

I have continued that refusal through today, even as it has cowered many other public officials and private industry alike. The new refusal of the U.S. House to cater to the PC Police moves us one small step away from that carefully crafted secular society devoid of any reference to our religious and cultural heritage. I am glad that finally Members of Congress can express their holiday joy in a manner that they see fit and consistent with our American history–without an ethics threat.

Huelskamp ended his statement with a warm Christmas greeting for his constituents and all Americans: “As I have done for the past two years, I personally wish you and all of America a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.”
Merry Christmas, folks.

With a happy Iran at the negotiating table and plenty of reasons to take the spotlight off health care, the Obama administration now seeks to tie the hands of political opponents by limiting spending by tax-exempt groups with political messages.
The Treasury and IRS announced they were currently working on adapting the tax code to limit what kinds of groups could apply for 501(c)(4) status, a category designated for political non-profits and “social welfare” groups that follow less stringent spending rules than political action committees (PACs). The Obama administration’s proposed changes to the code would prevent 501(c)(4)s from engaging in advocacy for a specific candidate and political advocacy generally, including paying for campaign ads on television. Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur called the move “a first critical step toward creating clear-cut definitions of political activity by tax-exempt social welfare organizations.”
Unlike PACs, 501(c)(4)s do not currently have to disclose donors legally. They have surpassed unions and trade associations in political spending and become a pivotal part of the post-Citizens United campaign finance landscape. They do not aid candidates directly, but take on issues and buy ads that directly argue to the public one way or another. While the groups can be of any political stripe, spending by conservative groups has greatly surpassed that by liberal organizations like Organizing for America. And although the measure would crack down on bigger organizations like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, the strength of smaller, Tea Party-central advocacy groups who rely on their tax exempt status to promote messages mainstream political figures would otherwise ignore would most likely be among the hardest hit.


Conservatives both complying with the law in their roles running 501(c)(4)s and those in office have responded to the measure with uniform outrage. A spokesman for the NRA, a 501(c)(4), called the measure a “blatant abuse of the tax code designed to muzzle the American people’s free speech rights.” Rep. Darrell Issa described the move as a “crass political effort,” and placed emphasis on the fact that unions and trade organizations– often much more likely to contribute to liberal efforts– were left to their own devices while the IRS and Treasury turned on these particular political non-profits.

This isn’t the first time the IRS proposes to crack down on political groups voicing opposition to President Obama’s policies, but it is the most sweeping attempt. Controversy with such groups came to a peak this year when it was discovered that more than 80% of 501(c)(4) groups on the IRS’ watch list between 2010 and 2012 were conservative and/or Tea Party affiliated organizations. 
While the administration promises careful scrutiny of the tax code before making any large changes, President Obama’s vocal disapproval of the expressive freedoms protected by the Citizens United ruling and his administration’s targeting of opposition groups through the IRS leave little room to expect tax reforms to have anything but a chilling effect on the national political discourse.

The September issue of Vogue magazine, billed as The Fall Fashion Blockbuster, features a lengthy profile of Texas State Senator Wendy Davis. Davis gained nationwide notoriety after she filibustered for 12 hours in an attempt to block the passage of an omnibus anti-abortion bill known as SB5, which was eventually signed into law by Governor Rick Perry on July 18.
Her celebratory profile in Vogue has real significance. Not because the writer reveals that Davis’ filibustering outfit consisted of pink Mizuno running shoes and a sky-blue Escada day coat. Not because the caption for the article’s featured picture reads Wendy Davis in a Carolina Herrera dress and Reed Krakoff pumps. Not because the opening paragraph of the piece references the Super Bowl, HBO’s Girls, and 7 for All Mankind jeans as elements of her life.


Actually, these mentions are precisely why the profile is significant. Each one a different brush stroke creating a portrait of the left’s latest heroine fighting for all women in the face of a fabricated war, in which the villains are simply those who simply do not support federally subsidized contraception or unrestricted abortion on demand. And what better venue in which to view the portrait than the iconic pop culture platform that is Vogue.

The left understand and embraces a very simple concept: culture is upstream from politics. It is a message delivery system that reaches millions and millions of registered voters and those who soon will be. The message can be overtly ideological but what’s often more effective is the celebration of an ideology through other means…simply by presenting the owner of that ideology in a way that is accessible:

A crowd of thousands has assembled for the Fourth of July parade in Arlington. Davis waves to them from the back of a teal-blue vintage Thunderbird draped with bunting. She’s comfortable in the high-80s heat (she goes running in it most mornings), wearing an American-flag scarf from Urban Outfitters, a white tank top, blue-striped linen shorts, and red Toms slip-ons. “Thank you!” can be heard. Also: “Our state loves you!” Occasionally a hiss or a boo filters in, but mostly there are cries of “We love you, Wendy” and “Wendy for governor!”

So as the millions of Vogue readers (87% of which are female) turn its pages in search of unattainable freakish beauty, they will be treated to a profile of Wendy Davis and whether they know it or not, the notion of a war on them is reinforced. And what’s more, the villain becomes clear simply because the hero has been hoisted…in a white tank top, blue-striped linen shorts and red Toms slip-ons.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) made a move to formally kill an amendment Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) offered to the immigration bill. It would require border security before America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants are granted amnesty.
Reid filed a motion to “table” the amendment, a move that he used to quickly push for an up-or-down vote. A vote in favor of tabling the amendment would kill it. A vote against tabling the amendment would allow it to move through for debate. Essentially, a vote for Reid’s motion is a vote against securing the border before amnesty. Likewise, a vote against Reid’s motion is a vote for securing the border before granting amnesty.
The Senate Reference guide describes a motion to table as: “The motion is used to dispose quickly of questions the Senate does not wish to consider further.”


Reid’s motion to table the amendment passed 57-43, with Gang of Eight Republican Sens. John McCain (R-AZ). Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) voting with Reid. Democrat Sens. Joe Manchin and Mark Pryor voted against Reid in favor of border security before amnesty, as did Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH). Ayotte had previously indicated support for the Gang of Eight bill.

Reid’s decision to derail an open process on the immigration bill comes during the first week of debate on what will likely drag on until close to the Fourth of July recess. Losing Grassley’s support up front on process is dangerous for Reid, too, as Grassley is a key Republican leader on issues that involve immigration.  
On the floor on Thursday, Grassley argued that the “so-called open and fair process” the Democrats and the “Gang of Eight” Republicans have promised “is a farce.”
“This is not the right way to start off on a very important bill,” Grassley said.

The First Amendment served us well for a time, but now it’s outdated.
Remember reading that England had arrested a guy for anti-Muslim Twitter postings in the aftermath of the Woolrich slaughter?  And remember thinking, “Well, this is America, that can’t happen here”?


Oh yes it can.  Obama’s Attorney for the Eastern district of Tennessee wants you to know that if you say something untoward about Muslims, the Federal government may imprison you.
Killian and Moore will provide input on how civil rights can be violated by those who post inflammatory documents targeted at Muslims on social media….Killian said Internet postings that violate civil rights are subject to federal jurisdiction. 
The posting he offers as a “for instance” is an egregious one.  And yet this country has long protected, absolutely, egregious speech, such as hardcore pornography, for a simple reason:  Either you are at liberty to say what you will or you are not.  If you are constantly double-thinking every word you might say, for fear of being prosecuted, you are self-censoring, in anticipation of a possible prosecution by the government.
Rather than having a system in which people were constantly worried about imprisonment for speech, our country has evolved a simple bright-line code:  Speech of all kinds, with a few exceptions that can be counted on three fingers, is absolutely protected.

Remember, the importance of this bright-line, no-exceptions rule of free speech was preached to us, even when some of us might not have liked it so much, as when hardcore pornography was afforded absolute protection under the First Amendment.  In the case of hardcore pornography, it was argued — successfully — that having each artist weigh the possibility of an obscenity prosecution was too much of a burden on his free speech rights, and would have, unavoidably, a chilling effect on speech.
That was the rule then, and that was the rationale.
But now comes the Obama Administration to tell you that Yes, you just might be imprisoned for something you say online, so you’d better Watch What You Say.
Remember when Ari Fleischer said that, without suggesting any kind of legal penalties?   Remember how the media freaked out?
But now comes the US Attorney for the Eastern district of Tennessee explicitly telling you that you may be imprisoned if a political appointee decides your political speech has crossed a line.
Somehow, I don’t think Tim Robbins will be portentously howling us that a “chill wind” is blowing across our rights of free expression this week.

The new film Lee Daniels’ The Butler depicts President Ronald Reagan as indifferent to the suffering of blacks as well as the country’s civil rights progress.
Breitbart News has debunked that cinematic meme, but Reagan’s commitment to racial equality began long before he even considered a life in politics.


John D. Morris, Director of Development at Eureka College’s Ronald W. Reagan Society, suspects those who malign Reagan today are fearful of his legacy and impact on the next generation of conservatives. And the facts simply don’t bear out their version of reality.
Morris describes a yearbook displayed on Eureka’s campus featuring a photograph of “Dutch” along with classmate Willie Sue Smith, a black woman Reagan would consider a dear friend.
“I have spoken with both of her children who said that Ronald Reagan and their mother corresponded for years. She had passed notes in class between Dutch and his girlfriend, Mugs Cleaver,” Morris says. “Reagan saw Willie Sue as a classmate and friend and, more than anything, another child of God.”

Another college pal, football standout William Franklin Burghardt, became one of Reagan’s lifelong chums.
Morris says one Reagan anecdote illustrates where the actor turned politician learned the value of equality. Jack Reagan, the future president’s father, one day witnessed a store clerk rudely deny a black man’s son from using the bathroom.
“The attendant next turned to Jack Reagan to ask for help. ‘Your services are no longer required by us,’ Jack replied. Taking his children outside, he told Moon and Dutch that no human beings should ever receive such treatment,” Morris says, adding the president would often share that meaningful moment with others.
Morris says it’s a shame the film industry is reluctant to tell the true nature of Reagan the man.
“Hollywood will someday see the virtues of making films based on the inspiring stories of the most consequential member of its own talent pool in history,” he says.

In 2012, the FCC contracted with the left-leaning Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism to study “entry barriers” to the media and see whether or not minority groups had enough access to the media. This year the FCC is launching a wide-ranging study that will require news agencies to inform the government on what stories they cover. 
What may follow that is a push for a new “fairness doctrine” as the FCC makes recommendations intended to force the media to air stories which the government wants reported.
The 2012 study was carried out by University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism–a school operated by the same group that employed a pre-President Barack Obama and domestic terrorist William Ayers in Chicago in the late 1990s and early 2000s.


The study, as part of the Federal Communication Commission’s 2012 Report to Congress about the barriers to participation in the communications industry (also known as the Section 257 Report), was intended to “identify market entry barriers and whether such barriers impact the public’s critical information needs.” A second goal was to help the FCC make “proposals to eliminate statutory barriers to market entry by those entities, consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity.” The FCC intended to begin the process of laying down in the regulations definitions of what constitutes “critical information” and what doesn’t.
In 2013, the second leg of that project was announced as a “Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs.”
A study, titled “Research Design for the Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs,” was released in April. The study was produced by a company called Social Solutions International, Inc.. SSI has been awarded hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars in federal contracts.

One of the goals of this new project is to conduct a “media census” on just what is being broadcast in the electronic media and published in magazines, newspapers, and on the Internet.
“Researchers will analyze the content of broadcasts, newspaper articles, and website postings to determine the extent to which eight defined ‘Critical Information Needs’ (CINs) are being covered,” reported Eve Reed.
In a May 24 announcement of the project, Acting FCC Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn said that the FCC has a “duty” to find out what news is being broadcast.
The FCC has a duty to make sure that the industries it regulates serve the needs of the American public no matter where they live or what financial resources they have. The research design we announce today is an important next step in understanding what those needs are, how Americans obtain the information critical to their daily lives in a dynamic technological environment, and what barriers exist in our media ecologies to providing and accessing this information.
The FCC also issued the following comment: “The commission needs to conduct or commission research that illuminates the diversity of views available to local communities, the diversity of sources in local markets and the diversity of critical information needs of the American public, including women and minorities.”
Some of the eight CINs are telling as to what sort of criteria the FCC is using to quantify what is supposed to be useful information for a community. Two of the categories being assessed are whether or not a media outlet is properly informing customers about “the environment” and what “economic opportunity” news is reported–the latter as opposed to plain economics or news on the economy.

To determine if the media is fulfilling these CINs, media outlets will be required to fill out a very long survey to report to the government about what stories they are airing or publishing in the several categories being assessed.
Among other criteria, the study will ascertain: what “news philosophy” is pursued by the media outlet (i.e. it’s ideological direction); how the media outlet defines “critical information”; see if the media includes “community input” into its stories; and review the “decision making process” to find out how the media outlet determines what stories to cover.
Critics of this study, however, worry that with this government-enforced, intrusive survey into what stories the media is covering and how they are covering them, some freedoms will be lost.
Chuck Sweeny, for instance, wrapped up his recent report on the FCC’s study saying, “When ‘Big Brother is watching’ over reporters’ and editors’ shoulders, freedom of the press will be gone, and our liberty with it.”
For her part, Eve Reed also raised concerns. “But the questions that the researchers will be asking suggest a renewed interest on the part of the FCC in the inner workings of station and newspaper editorial decision-making, which may itself raise concerns,” she said.
All this raises worries that the FCC is looking for a backdoor way of re-instituting the Fairness Doctrine–the repeal of which gave us radio programs like the Rush Limbaugh show and paved the way for Fox News–in a new effort to control what goes on the air and who can own what media.

Over at the Atlantic Garance Franke-Ruta has a thoughtful article arguing that the GOP’s current “war on women” response is ill-considered at best.

Five different Republican committees this morning released a joint memo
pushing back on the “Democrats’ War on Women” messaging to highlight
the sex scandals of a group of Democratic men and argue that Democrats
are hypocrites who only care about women when it is politically
convenient.

It’s a fine message as far as it goes, which is as a kind of a summer
doldrums GOP base-riling play, reminding Republican women that there
are a bunch of Democratic men out there who they — and others! — think
are creeps.

Two things about this. First, Democrats underestimate how much stuff like this really gets under the skin of people on the other side. The entire “war on women” campaign is offensive to GOP women and to men who have wives and daughters. 


But making a political point by crafting an obnoxious bit of hyperbole is something Democrats excel at lately. Whether it’s comparing the GOP to hijackers or terrorists over budget negotiations, the party has fully embraced argument by demonization. I’m not talking about a loose comment here or there, which always happens on both sides, I mean a coordinated campaign from the top down which includes the President. 
Franke-Ruta argues that instead of acting on our entirely justifiable irritation with the left’s obnoxious memes we should design a more reasoned campaign built around women and security issues. I think it’s well intended and probably even a good idea. But–and this is point two–it fails to appreciate the extent to which policy arguments are merely backdrops for more energetic attacks in our elections these days.
To give a current example, these “no slutbags” flyers appearing around NYC are going to do more to hurt Anthony Weiner than any policy argument about his 64 points for a strong middle class. And the same applies to the 2012 election. 

The left is kidding itself if it thinks the “war on women” was about expanded funding for birth control. It was about Rush calling Sandra Fluke a slut. That was the headline and the source of outrage onto which all the policy baggage was later loaded. Similarly, Todd Akin’s comments about rape did more to make the war on women a reality than any policy papers posted by the DNC. Populist outrage first, policy backstopping afterwards. 
Don’t believe me? Have a look at this move on ad from last year. Notice the focus is on offensive statements not policy arguments. In fact, American Crossroads tried to respond
with their own “war on women” policy arguments, not
unlike what Franke-Ruta is suggesting the GOP try now. But as we all
know, those arguments did not get nearly the same level of media or popular traction. 
Rush and Akin’s comments are to Democratic cultural politics what Jaws was to movies about killer sharks. The fascination on the left may have devolved into Sharknado-level parody by now, but there’s no doubting that a new genre was spawned. And to extend that metaphor, there’s no point responding to these memes with policy prescriptions anymore than there is giving the Sharknado sequel a stern and serious negative review. There is no policy response to “binders full of women.” None that matters. 
Filner, Weiner and Spitzer give the GOP an easy (and potentially effective) opportunity to respond in kind. It may not be a reasoned policy argument but as we
learned in 2012 that’s not what wins elections.

The Department of Justice has summarily removed federal funding from two Louisiana youth programs because a local official refused to sign a pledge stating he would require the programs to ban mentions of God.
Julian Whittington, the sheriff of Bossier Parish, LA, told Fox News that Obama’s Justice Office of Civil Rights de-funded the Young Marines chapter and another youth program over mentions of religion. In the case of the Young Marine program, chartered in 1965, the funding was cut off because the group features an oath that mentions “God.” In the other case, it was because a program for at-risk youth featured a voluntary, student-led prayer session as one of its activities.
Sheriff Whittington says that the DOJ withdrew a combined $30,000 from the programs because the groups refused to remove God from their activities. The sheriff said this was evidence of the government’s “aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms.”


Whittington told Fox, “We were informed that these are unacceptable, inherently religious activities and the Department of Justice would not be able to fund the programs if it continued. They wanted a letter from me stating that I would no longer have voluntary prayer and I would also have to remove ‘God’ from the Young Marine’s oath.”
The oath from the Young Marine organization reads:

From this day forward, I sincerely promise, I will set an example for all other youth to follow and I shall never do anything that would bring disgrace or dishonor upon God, my Country and its flag, my parents, myself or the Young Marines. These I will honor and respect in a manner that will reflect credit upon them and myself. Semper Fidelis

Both the U.S. Army enlistment oath and its commissioning oath end with “so help me God.”

As to the at-risk youth program, Whittington said,”We’re not promoting any specific religion, this is just voluntary prayer, mention of God, how offensive and bad can that be?”
In response to the DOJ’s message insisting that he sign the anti-God pledge, Sheriff Whittington sent a letter of his own to LA Governor Bobby Jindal.
“As a Christian, Sheriff and American citizen, I am writing to express my frustration and concern over the persistent aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms which have been imposed upon the law enforcement grant programs, specifically related to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement,” wrote the Sheriff.
In cutting off the funding, the DOJ claimed it was a violation of Church and State rules for the government to fund any group that mentions God.
Fox’s Todd Starnes says that, “Both youth programs have been hailed as a successful way to reach at-risk young people. Since 2002 more than 1,000 young people have graduated from the program, directed by a Bossier Parish deputy who is a former U.S. Marine.”
Like Sheriff Whittington, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) was troubled by the DOJ’s actions.

“There is a very wide effort coming out of the administration that seeks to stamp out freedom of expressions – particularly religion and especially freedom of Christian expression,” Fleming said. “They are willing to throw the youth overboard and remove the funding just in the name of making this an atheist, agnostic, secular organization.”
“They (DOJ) don’t want anything to have any sort of religious support – even down to prayer,” Fleming said. “It’s sad and it’s inconsistent with the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.”

Sheriff Whittington is not taking this lying down. “When something is not right and you know it’s not right and you keep bowing down, nothing is ever going to change,” he said.

6884	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/01/Exclusive-US-Civil-Rights-Commissioner-Amnesty-would-violate-blacks-civil-rights	Opinion	1	Civil Rights	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, told Breitbart News that Attorney General Eric Holder’s claims that amnesty for illegal immigrants is a civil rights issue “profoundly ahistorical.”
“If you take a look at the basis of the civil rights movement, it was to have blacks treated in all respects the same as whites or everybody else,” Kirsanow (pictured) said in a phone interview. “What amnesty is doing is setting aside a special class of individuals who are going to put forward and treated more favorably than others. In other words, they’ve already broken the law and are being given amnesty.  
“In terms of immigration policy… it would severely affect the rights of blacks generally and all low-income Americans. What it is going to do is displace those individuals from the labor market.”


The U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Kirsanow said, has held extensive hearings in recent years detailing how amnesty would economically impact American workers, especially the black community.
“We had a hearing before the Civil Rights Commission on the effects of illegal immigration on black employment levels, both wage levels and unemployment rates,” Kirsanow said. “What we had were a number of experts from just about every sphere you can think of: business, academia and immigration experts in general. They spanned the ideological spectrum. We had individuals from the far left, individuals in the middle, individuals on the right.
“They disagreed in some respects about certain policy prescriptions but they were unanimous in their conclusion, backed by copious amounts of data,” he recalled, “that illegal immigration had a deleterious effect on the wage and employment levels of black Americans. And it’s not a small effect. It’s a clearly sizable effect.”

Kirsanow and some of his fellow U.S. Commission on Civil Rights members have pushed for members of Congress and key political figures in the national immigration debate like President Barack Obama himself to address these issues, but they have ignored the calls thus far. 
“What’s interesting is those who have described themselves as the champions of civil rights are doing enormous damage to the ranks of black Americans by supporting and shepherding through comprehensive immigration reform that does nothing to control the borders, that grants amnesty and is going to create a legal population of individuals who are going to undercut the employment and wage prospects for low income Americans, generally, and specifically black Americans and more specifically black males,” he asserted.
Kirsanow questions who the lawmakers in Washington, D.C., on both sides of the political aisle are really representing, given that they have not substantively discussed the issue in their legislative deliberations. “I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee back in April on immigration reform on the same thing that we’re talking about right now,” he stated. “What was amazing is the number of senators who were either cavalier about it or they gave grudging acknowledgment to the fact that ‘yeah, there’s a possibility that there might be some dislocation to American workers as a result of illegal immigration’ and then just kind of moved on. 
“The question I have is: Who do they represent? They are United States Senators. They represent Americans, presumably. Yet, what they’re proposing is they’re going to have a decided negative effect on Americans. What reason? What? Who do they represent? Do they represent illegal immigrants? Or do they represent lawful Americans? And that’s a question that needs to be posed to them.”
Kirsanow was originally one of only three witnesses who were going to be called to testify on the immigration situation before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He; GOP establishment figure Doug Holtz-Eakin of American Action Forum (AAF), a group advocating in favor of amnesty; and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were going to be the only ones who testified were it not for public outcry about the rushed process. 

Originally, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Pat Leahy (D-VT) and Senate Democratic Party leadership were not even going to call any hearings. “On a matter this large, it is an insult to the American people that only three people were going to testify regardless of how knowledgeable they may be about the subject matter,” Kirsanow said. “This is such a complex matter that they needed perspectives from so many different places. What we had was a bill that was gigantic. It was almost the size of Obamacare and yet it was released barely 36 hours before our testimony. 
“In other words, we were testifying in an information vacuum on a momentous piece of legislation. Only after there was a bit of hue and cry did Senate leadership understand that they needed to open up the testimony to more witnesses.”

Kirsanow and others members of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission have written letters on this matter to President Obama and to Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH), among other lawmakers, and they have received no response. Similarly, advocates opposed to amnesty like Leah Durant have written letters to members like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the chairman of the House Budget Committee, raising these same concerns–which have gone ignored, as well. 
Kirsanow said that while there are likely a number of reasons why members of the Congressional Black Caucus have ignored this real threat to their constituents, he thinks the most prevailing is that President Barack Obama, America’s first black president, is pushing the policy so they have no ability to stand up to him politically.
“I have asked them why they are not standing up for the needs of their constituents,” Kirsanow said. “We’ve sent these letters to Marcia Fudge. We’ve sent them to members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Radio silence. Complete radio silence.”

“I wish reporters asked members of the Congressional Black Caucus what the heck they’re thinking,” he said. “They’ve not been challenged on this. One of the dynamics at play is the fact that we have the first black president who is in support of this. If he is in support of it, a lot of black Americans will reasonably presume that he is looking out for their best interests. So, the Congressional Black Caucus can use that as cover. 
“If President Obama supports amnesty, and therefore 90 percent of the Congressional Black Caucus’ constituents will believe it’s in their best interests, those members of the Congressional Black Caucus are unlikely to be questioned by their constituents about whether it’s a good idea on that because they will have believed ‘Barack Obama looks out for my interests, it must be a good idea.'”
Kirsanow said the president is not sticking up for the black community and argued it might be because of special interests and potential future voter pools. “You know that old line, when you want to figure out why something is being done, follow the money? Well, in politics, you not only follow the money, but you follow the votes or potential votes,” he explained. “I think what a lot of sides see, both on the Republican side and the Democratic side, is this vast untapped pool of votes that they expect are going to materialize as a result of amnesty. 
“Republicans don’t want to be seen as being anti-Hispanic, Democrats see this as a giant new constituency group and, so, what you’ve got I think, and I don’t know if this pertains to President Obama, but you’ve got a political class looking out for their interests. ‘I want more votes,’ as opposed to current interests of their constituents. 
“I don’t necessarily want to ascribe that motive to them, but it’s as plausible and probably more rationale than anything else because I can’t figure out why it is representatives of the United States of America are doing something that is harmful to their constituents.”
While Kirsanow argues members of the political class in the black community like members of Congress and leaders of black groups like the NAACP and others do not stick up for their rank and file on this issue, he said he does get the impression many ordinary black citizens are aware of this threat to their economic well-being.
“A lot of folks do,” Kirsanow, who lives in inner-city Cleveland and used to serve as a member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), said. “I was in Washington, D.C., and I also appear of black radio shows from time to time, and other radio shows, and what you get without question and what you used to get for quite some time was whenever the issue of illegal immigration came up, black callers were outraged because they feel the effects,” he declared. 
“They see it with their own eyes. You get calls from people who have been displaced by illegal immigrants, people who can’t find jobs because they can’t compete against low wages offered to illegal immigrants and it’s fairly vigorous.”

Cornel West said that under President Barack Obama there has been an increase in what he called the “new Jim Crow” and claimed his presidency has thus been a failure.
Appearing in a Monday interview on Al Jazeera America’s Talk to Al Jazeera with David Shuster, West said 2.5 million new prisoners have been incarcerated while Obama has been in office mostly “because of soft drugs” and the disparity in “crack cocaine versus regular cocaine” users. West referred to this phenomenon as the “new Jim Crow” because he said minority communities and the poor are disproportionately impacted. 
West blasted the level of corruption on Wall Street that has seen few people to go jail and said there has been a “two-tiered” system of justice under Obama. 


West said that disparity applied to Obama’s economy as well, as corporations have made record profits while there has been “massive unemployment” and “increasing wealth inequality.” He said struggling Americans are “giving up work” or “working part time” in Obama’s economy and those numbers are not reflected in the official unemployment numbers. 

Shuster, conversely, gushed over Obama’s accomplishments, saying Obama’s presidency should be considered a success if his presidency was judged by “morality” because Obama prevented a depression, passed Obamacare, ended the Iraq War, ended “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” and appointed the first Latina Supreme Court justice. He continued to defend Obama, saying Obama saved the economy and the unemployment rate would have been worse without Obama. 
But West disagreed, saying Martin Luther King Jr. would not approve of the “vanilla suburbs” at home that symbolize the income inequality that he said has gotten worse since King’s “I Have a Dream Speech” 50 year ago. West acknowledged that Appalachia also had problems with income and crime inequality.

One month ago the Pentagon assured the public it was not being advised by anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein. Yet two days ago Weinstein called the Pentagon demanding that a Christian painting be removed from a dining hall in an Idaho Air Force base, and the Pentagon complied with his demand–in less than one hour.
On Apr. 28, Breitbart News reported that Pentagon brass met with Weinstein and his Military Religious Freedom Foundation. That was shortly after Weinstein published an article in which he called observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek to impose “a rapacious reign of theocratic terror” in the military through their “putrid theology.”


While he opposes all religion in the military, Weinstein reserves his most caustic language for observant Christians. And the one thing he objects to above all things is proselytizing in the military, which Christians call evangelism. 
Regarding evangelism, Weinstein told the Washington Post that, “What is happening aside from sexual assault is spiritual rape. And what the Pentagon needs to understand is that it is sedition and treason. It should be punished.” (Emphases added and brackets omitted.)
Weinstein said service members who evangelize in the military should be court-martialed, and added, “You need a dozen court-martials real quick.” A court martial is a criminal prosecution in the military, which depending on the crime can carry punishments ranging from fines, to expulsion from the military, to imprisonment. In case anyone missed the point, he also said, “We would love to see hundreds of prosecutions.”

It must be noted that the Pentagon says it would not take this drastic step called for by Weinstein. It should also be noted, however, that the Pentagon continues to change its story on what its policy is on evangelism. 
Nevertheless, the latest example of Weinstein’s influence with the Obama-Hagel Pentagon came last week, as reported by Fox News’ Todd Starnes. In the dining hall of Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho there was a painting-style picture of a U.S. Airman with imagery of the cross, above the word “Integrity” and with a reference to Matthew 5:9. (That verse reads, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”)
Weinstein called the Pentagon directly to complain about the picture. Less than one hour later, the picture was permanently removed. 
Col. Christopher Short, the base commander, told Fox News the artwork was removed because, “We make reasonable accommodations for all religions and celebrate the religious diversity of our Airmen.” It’s an odd statement to say that accommodating religion and celebrating diversity means tearing down Christian artwork.  
Weinstein has previously boasted that he has special status with the leadership of the Air Force Academy similar to the “bat signal” from Batman. He explains that:


… he and Superintendent Lt. Gen. Mike Gould devised a code word only they know in case Weinstein needs to reach Gould with concerns about religious liberty on campus. “We have our own bat-signal,” Weinstein said Friday, referring to the beam of light used to summon Batman in the DC Comic series…. Having a means to reach Gould with any concerns is a positive step in the work to make the academy religiously neutral ground, he said. “We had a bad 96-hour period where I felt like we had fallen back to the bad old days,” he said. “Our relationship [now] is stronger than ever.”

Given Weinstein’s published anti-Christian statements, his relationship with top military officials should raise eyebrows. 
And it has done so on Capitol Hill. After Breitbart News’ reporting on this relationship, 59 congressmen sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel demanding to know who approved these meetings and what was discussed. A group of 72 congressmen then sent a second letter demanding to know what the Pentagon is doing to protect the First Amendment rights of service members. 
Also last week, one of Weinstein’s staff members published a column denigrating Congress’ efforts, and mocking Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) for coauthoring with Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) the letter signed by 59 Members of Congress. Taunting congressional leaders who are probing this situation may provoke lawmakers to amend federal law to clarify and reinforce service members rights regarding sharing their faith. 
The Obama-Hagel Pentagon insists that it would never court-martial a Christian for sharing his faith, but fails to explain why it would accept advice from someone aggressively demanding that action. The Pentagon also claims that Weinstein cannot be called a consultant because he’s not paid for his advice and holds no official position. Yet the dictionary defines a consultant as, “a person who gives professional or expert advice.” There is nothing about having an official status or getting a paycheck. 
Mikey Weinstein has been meeting with top Pentagon officials during the Obama administration since 2009. He continues to communicate with them at will, and they immediately respond to his demands. He is therefore an unpaid advisor to the Obama-Hagel Pentagon, with considerable influence. 
Not only that, but it’s been more than two weeks since roughly 100 congressmen demanded answers from Hagel, but have not heard a word in response. Yet this anti-Christian extremist brags about how the Pentagon leaps into action when he makes a demand, removing Christian artwork in less than an hour. 
Lawmakers are likely to intensify their efforts to find out what’s going on here, and what they can do to stop this assault on Christians in the military.

6973	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/06/Good-Day-for-Prayer-at-Supreme-Court	News	1	Civil Rights	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Supporters of religious liberty clearly had the upper hand today at the U.S. Supreme Court, as the lawyers representing those offering invocation prayers at town board meetings overpowered those who tried to have the Court declare those prayers unconstitutional. 
On Wednesday, the Court heard arguments in Town of Greece v. Galloway, which Breitbart News explained in detail yesterday. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does not allow government to establish a national religion, and the plaintiffs in this case argued that allowing opening prayers does just that. 
As Breitbart News explained in our previous report, the Supreme Court upheld this practice–called legislative prayer–in the 1983 case Marsh v. Chambers. Today, the plaintiffs sought to have the Court say that Marsh only permits prayers that have no faith-specific content (such as mentioning the name of Jesus Christ), or that only Congress and state legislatures are permitted to have such prayers, not local government. 


The plaintiffs here evidently knew they did not have five votes on the Court to overrule Marsh, so they sought instead for the Court to rule that all governmental bodies need to adopt a policy forbidding prayer-givers from making faith-specific references. 

Justice Antonin Scalia spent considerable time discussing the problem with that argument that there are no statements with which all people agree because some are atheists. Justice Samuel Alito proved this point even among those who believe something, by challenging the plaintiffs’ lawyers to specify some prayer with which followers of every religion would agree. Their lawyer could not find one. 
The critical swing vote in this case is Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has previously spoken favorably of public prayers but was the decisive vote in 1992 in declaring prayers unconstitutional at public school graduation ceremonies when children are likely present. 
Justice Kennedy possibly tipped his hand today when he said the plaintiffs’ proposed rule “involves the state very heavily in the editing and censorship of prayer.” As a rule of thumb, when Justice Kennedy says that your proposal involves “censorship,” that means you lost. 
Breitbart News will publish a full report on the argument later today.

“I can’t hear you, America! Good morning!” black conservative activist and media personality Wayne Dupree, known online as “News Ninja 2012,” said as he fired up the crowd at Freedom Plaza in downtown Washington, D.C. “I still can’t hear you! Good morning, America!”
Dupree walked through how he served in the U.S. military and how he “can say, proudly say, that I have great personal interest in what goes on in my country.”
“We fight for this country because we believe in its greatness,” Dupree said. “We believe in this Democracy. And we believe in freedom for all citizens. And we will continue to fight and defend and preserve those freedoms for our citizens.”


Dupree went on to argue that “the real reason why we’re here today, July 15, here on Freedom Plaza, is because we hear the battle cries, and Washington calling for us Americans to stand up and fight.”

Dupree then railed on the “Gang of Eight” Senate immigration bill. “This legislation is nothing but a wish list written by corporate lobbyists and checked off by career politicians in order to exploit cheap labor and fill campaign coffers for the next election,” he said. “This legislation robs us of the American dream and it undermines our Democratic process. We the People have been called upon to protect our freedom, and we do this with a smile on our faces and patriotism in our hearts.”
“This is not racist,” Dupree added later in the speech. “Let me say that again: This is not racist! This is an American thing. It’s not because we’re ‘hate-mongers who discriminate against those that want a better life.’ We cannot allow people who defy our laws, threaten our national security, and threaten our economy to redefine what America stands for. No way. Not without a fight.”
  Here’s video of Dupree’s whole speech.

Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) has officially left the House version of the “Gang of Eight” after Democrats–led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a House aide familiar with the discussions told Breitbart News–went back on a prior agreement-in-principle during the talks.
Originally, according to Labrador, the House group had agreed hat illegal immigrants would be required to cover their own health care costs and not have access to Obamacare. When the talks moved along, though, the Democrats went back on their promise and began insisting that illegal immigrants get access to government healthcare. 


That prompted Labrador to abandon the group on Wednesday evening, as the left was not negotiating in good faith, he said. A House aide confirmed to Breitbart News that Pelosi–who was not a member of the House immigration group–was the leader of the charge in pushing health care for illegal immigrants, even though the Democrats in the group had originally agreed to the compromise.

“I have tremendous respect for the members of the bipartisan group who have been working with me to fix our broken immigration system,” Labrador said in a statement. “But after today’s meeting, the framework of the bill has changed in a way that I can no longer support. Like most Americans, I believe that health care is first and foremost a personal responsibility. While I will no longer be part of the bipartisan ‘Group of Eight’ House negotiators, I will not abandon my efforts to modernize our broken immigration system by securing our borders and creating a workable guest worker program. I remain hopeful that the House can pass a bill around these principles and I will keep fighting to make it happen.”
Pelosi’s office has not returned a request for comment from Breitbart News for this story. 
Labrador had been working with Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), John Carter (R-TX), Sam Johnson (R-TX), Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), Xavier Becerra (D-CA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and John Yarmuth (D-KY). 
Labrador’s move comes on the heels of a report from Breitbart News that a high-ranking Senate aide said Rubio is searching for a way out of the Senate Gang of Eight.
“Rubio and his staff are trying to get out of the Gang of Eight,” the aide said. “They’re looking to use other Republican members as their parachute to get out.”

The story of John A. Logan, the founder of Decoration Day, later to be known as Memorial Day, is the fascinating tale of a man who was once a racist Democrat and later became one of the favorite generals of Ulysses S. Grant, an ardent Republican. 
General Logan, who later became a senator from Illinois and was the Republican vice-presidential nominee on the ticket with James Blaine in 1884, was a member of the House of Representatives in the Legislature of Illinois in 1853. 


Logan originally introduced a bill prohibiting “the immigration of free persons of color to the State of Illinois, or the setting free of slaves within the limits thereof.” It was passed in 1855, and the bill, with its supplementary enactments, became known as “The Black Laws.” 
Elected as a Democratic Congressman in 1858 and 1860, during his second term Logan denounced “Black Republicans and Know-Nothings.” He later blamed radical abolitionists for John Brown’s attack on Harper’s Ferry in front of Congress: 
Every fugitive slave that has been arrested in Illinois, or in any of the western States – and I call Illinois a western State, for I [am] ashamed longer to call it a northern State – has been made by Democrats. In Illinois the Democrats have all that work to do. You call it the dirty work of the Democratic Party to catch fugitive slaves for the southern people. We are willing to perform that dirty work. I do not consider it disgraceful to perform any work, dirty or not dirty, which is in accordance with the laws of the land and the Constitution of the country.
Yet this same man respected the Union and despised extremists on both sides. He said to those Southerners wanting to secede, “The election of Mr. Lincoln, deplorable as it may be, affords no justification or excuse for overthrowing the republic… We cannot stand silently by while the joint action of extremists are dragging us to ruin.”

At the start of the Civil War, Logan fought at Bull Run in a Michigan regiment, then resigned his congressional seat to become colonel of the 31st Illinois Volunteers. He would later serving under General Grant at the Battle of Belmont (where his horse was killed under him), was wounded at Fort Donelson, and then promoted to brigadier-general in March, 1862. 
When Grant attacked Vicksburg, Logan was the commander of XVII Corps, the first to enter the city; when Vicksburg fell, he became the military governor. 
Logan took over from General Sherman when Sherman left XV Corps and initially commanded the Army of the Tennessee at the battle of Atlanta in 1864. By the end of the war, Logan had become a radical Republican and was elected as a GOP congressman 1867. He would serve in the House until 1871, and then served as a Senator from 1871 until 1877 and again from 1879 to 1886.  
While General Logan, who was known as Black Jack, was in Congress in 1868, he was still the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1868, (a position he held until 1871); on May 5, 1868, he sponsored General Order #11, which designated May 30, 1868, as a day of remembrance:

The 30th day of May, 1868, is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet church-yard in the land. In this observance no form of ceremony is prescribed, but posts and comrades will in their own way arrange such fitting services and testimonials of respect as circumstances may permit.
We are organized, comrades, as our regulations tell us, for the purpose among other things, “of preserving and strengthening those kind and fraternal feelings which have bound together the soldiers, sailors, and marines who united to suppress the late rebellion.” What can aid more to assure this result than cherishing tenderly the memory of our heroic dead, who made their breasts a barricade between our country and its foes? Their soldier lives were the reveille of freedom to a race in chains, and their deaths the tattoo of rebellious tyranny in arms. We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance. All that the consecrated wealth and taste of the nation can add to their adornment and security is but a fitting tribute to the memory of her slain defenders. Let no wanton foot tread rudely on such hallowed grounds. Let pleasant paths invite the coming and going of reverent visitors and fond mourners. Let no vandalism of avarice or neglect, no ravages of time testify to the present or to the coming generations that we have forgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided republic.
If our eyes grow dull, other hands slack, and other hearts cold in the solemn trust, ours shall keep it well as long as the light and warmth of life remain to us.
Let us, then, at the time appointed gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above them with the choicest flowers of spring-time; let us raise above them the dear old flag they saved from dishonor; let us in this solemn presence renew our pledges to aid and assist those whom they have left among us a sacred charge upon a nation’s gratitude, the soldier’s and sailor’s widow and orphan.
It is the purpose of the Commander-in-Chief to inaugurate this observance with the hope that it will be kept up from year to year, while a survivor of the war remains to honor the memory of his departed comrades. He earnestly desires the public press to lend its friendly aid in bringing to the notice of comrades in all parts of the country in time for simultaneous compliance therewith.
Department commanders will use efforts to make this order effective.
By order of
JOHN A. LOGAN, Commander-in-Chief
N.P. CHIPMAN, Adjutant General
Official: WM. T. COLLINS, A.A.G.

Logan is one of three men mentioned in the Illinois State Song, along with Grant and Abraham Lincoln.

In 2012, the FCC contracted with the left-leaning Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism to study “entry barriers” to the media and see whether or not minority groups had enough access to the media. This year the FCC is launching a wide-ranging study that will require news agencies to inform the government on what stories they cover. 
What may follow that is a push for a new “fairness doctrine” as the FCC makes recommendations intended to force the media to air stories which the government wants reported.
The 2012 study was carried out by University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism–a school operated by the same group that employed a pre-President Barack Obama and domestic terrorist William Ayers in Chicago in the late 1990s and early 2000s.


The study, as part of the Federal Communication Commission’s 2012 Report to Congress about the barriers to participation in the communications industry (also known as the Section 257 Report), was intended to “identify market entry barriers and whether such barriers impact the public’s critical information needs.” A second goal was to help the FCC make “proposals to eliminate statutory barriers to market entry by those entities, consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity.” The FCC intended to begin the process of laying down in the regulations definitions of what constitutes “critical information” and what doesn’t.
In 2013, the second leg of that project was announced as a “Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs.”
A study, titled “Research Design for the Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs,” was released in April. The study was produced by a company called Social Solutions International, Inc.. SSI has been awarded hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars in federal contracts.

One of the goals of this new project is to conduct a “media census” on just what is being broadcast in the electronic media and published in magazines, newspapers, and on the Internet.
“Researchers will analyze the content of broadcasts, newspaper articles, and website postings to determine the extent to which eight defined ‘Critical Information Needs’ (CINs) are being covered,” reported Eve Reed.
In a May 24 announcement of the project, Acting FCC Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn said that the FCC has a “duty” to find out what news is being broadcast.
The FCC has a duty to make sure that the industries it regulates serve the needs of the American public no matter where they live or what financial resources they have. The research design we announce today is an important next step in understanding what those needs are, how Americans obtain the information critical to their daily lives in a dynamic technological environment, and what barriers exist in our media ecologies to providing and accessing this information.
The FCC also issued the following comment: “The commission needs to conduct or commission research that illuminates the diversity of views available to local communities, the diversity of sources in local markets and the diversity of critical information needs of the American public, including women and minorities.”
Some of the eight CINs are telling as to what sort of criteria the FCC is using to quantify what is supposed to be useful information for a community. Two of the categories being assessed are whether or not a media outlet is properly informing customers about “the environment” and what “economic opportunity” news is reported–the latter as opposed to plain economics or news on the economy.

To determine if the media is fulfilling these CINs, media outlets will be required to fill out a very long survey to report to the government about what stories they are airing or publishing in the several categories being assessed.
Among other criteria, the study will ascertain: what “news philosophy” is pursued by the media outlet (i.e. it’s ideological direction); how the media outlet defines “critical information”; see if the media includes “community input” into its stories; and review the “decision making process” to find out how the media outlet determines what stories to cover.
Critics of this study, however, worry that with this government-enforced, intrusive survey into what stories the media is covering and how they are covering them, some freedoms will be lost.
Chuck Sweeny, for instance, wrapped up his recent report on the FCC’s study saying, “When ‘Big Brother is watching’ over reporters’ and editors’ shoulders, freedom of the press will be gone, and our liberty with it.”
For her part, Eve Reed also raised concerns. “But the questions that the researchers will be asking suggest a renewed interest on the part of the FCC in the inner workings of station and newspaper editorial decision-making, which may itself raise concerns,” she said.
All this raises worries that the FCC is looking for a backdoor way of re-instituting the Fairness Doctrine–the repeal of which gave us radio programs like the Rush Limbaugh show and paved the way for Fox News–in a new effort to control what goes on the air and who can own what media.

In response to a question at a town hall event this week, Rep. Aaron Schock (R-IL) suggested that a majority of House Republicans support granting amnesty through a GOP version of the DREAM Act to young illegal aliens who were brought to America as minors by their parents.
Schock, a member of the whip team led by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, was laying out for constituents his stances on immigration and the House GOP leadership’s plan to deal with the issue later this year. 
“They’re going to move one bill after another dealing with all the various issues that were contained in the Senate bill,” Schock said to the town hall, as seen in video posted on YouTube. “So first, the border security bill should be the first bill that moves in the House. I think that’s going to be an easy bill to pass. It passed out of the Homeland Security Committee with almost unanimous support. Almost every Republican and Democrat on Homeland Security voted for the House border security bill. I think that will pass the House and I think that’s a done deal and that’s done with. Then, you’re going to deal with your high-tech visas and your ag visa worker programs. I think, again, you’re going to get overwhelming bipartisan support on those provisions. I don’t know what the final language is going to look like.”


Schock’s outline of the preliminary plan matches what other member of GOP leadership have said. When he got to the third part of the plan, a DREAM Act which is currently being drafted by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and will eventually be introduced as the KIDS Act, Schock promised there would be a vote on the DREAM Act in the House and promised it would pass with bipartisan support.
“Then you’re going to have a third bill which is going to deal with your DREAM Act kids, those who were brought here illegally by their parents,” Schock said. “I think, again, you’re going to get a bipartisan vote on a House version of the DREAM Act.”  
For any immigration bill to be brought to the floor for a vote in the House, Speaker John Boehner has mandated that it must have the support of the majority of House Republicans–known as abiding by the “Hastert Rule,” meaning no bill will come to the floor for a vote without the support of the majority of the majority. For Schock to not only promise it would pass, but that there would even be a vote on the bill, says that, he–a member of the House GOP leadership’s whip team–knows or believes that a majority of House Republicans support the DREAM Act.

Schock’s office has not responded to Breitbart News’ request for comment in response to this declaration and has not publicly provided a whip list of which Republicans he and the rest of McCarthy’s whip team expect to support the amnesty for young illegal aliens. 
At the town hall this week, Schock also said he supports a comprehensive immigration bill of the sort opposed by House conservatives. He also promised some kind of amnesty, although not necessarily citizenship, for all illegal aliens would come up for a vote in the House.
“The final bill, which will be the most difficult bill, will be dealing with people who are here currently illegally and the path – what is the solution for that,” Schock said. “There are people in the House who think we should find a way to grant them legal status, but not a path to citizenship. There are other people who say no, it has to be a path to citizenship. My mindset is people should come forward, have to pay a penalty and a fine, there should be a probationary period. I am not in the camp that believes people should have to leave the country in order to get in line. I just happen to believe that’s an unrealistic expectation that 11 million people are going to leave. I think it would be destructive to our economy, number one, and number two, many of them do not have a place to go back to even if they wanted to. And number three, I think it adversely affects the self-identification – if self-identifies and knows now they have to leave. I want whatever we pass to work. I want it to be a real reform bill. And I want it to be constructive to the overall process of having more legal immigration down the road.”
In response to a follow-up question from the town hall audience member who prompted Schock’s immigration remarks, Schock added that he thinks “there should be a pathway to citizenship for anybody who wants to come to America.”
“I think they ought to self-identify, I think they should pay back taxes and I think they should be on a legal probationary program,” Schock said. “So, if you break a law, if you break a law, if you do something wrong, you’re thrown out. But, I don’t think there should be anything stopping anyone who self-identifies, pays their back taxes and continues to pay taxes in our country to get in the back of the line with everyone else who wants to become an American citizen. What I don’t support is giving any kind of preferential treatment to people who are here illegally above those people who are outside our borders currently that are waiting in line.”

Breitbart News reported last week that Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) passed an amendment in the House Armed Services Committee protecting religious speech of service members in the military. President Barack Obama has now threatened to veto the bill if it passes the full House and Senate. 
The White House released a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) on H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014. Among other items, the SAP includes as an objection to the bill:



Expansion and Implementation of Protection of Rights of Conscience of Members of the Armed Forces and Chaplains of Such Members: The Administration strongly objects to section 530, which would require the Armed Forces to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, “actions and speech” reflecting the “conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member.” By limiting the discretion of commanders to address potentially problematic speech and actions within their units, this provision would have a significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale, and mission accomplishment. 

The SAP includes a veto threat: “…if the bill is presented to the President for approval in its current form, the President’s senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.” 

In other words, Obama says he will veto any bill that forbids his appointees or officers from telling a soldier that he cannot mention Jesus during prayer or have a Bible on his desk, or that keeps those appointees from telling a chaplain (who is an ordained clergyman) what religious teachings he is allowed to give in worship services, or what spiritual counseling he can give to another soldier.  
Ambassador Ken Blackwell, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, tells Breitbart News:

President Obama is waging a war on religion. He and Chuck Hagel are denying the most basic rights to those who put their lives on the line to protect all of our rights. It is shameful and appalling. I am confident that congressional leadership will show courage to stand up for our troops against this radical assault on religious liberty in the military.

This is the most compelling expression yet of the aggressive approach of the Obama-Hagel Defense Department to soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are observant Christians or devout members of other peaceful faiths, as seen in Breitbart News’ previous reports regarding the unconstitutional infringements of one of America’s most treasured, fundamental rights. 
All eyes are on House and Senate leadership to see if they stand firm on the bill for those in the military who are facing this new form of pressure. 
Breitbart News legal columnist Ken Klukowski is senior fellow for religious liberty at the Family Research Council and on faculty at Liberty University School of Law.

The Obama administration may have had direct involvement in shaping the Trayvon Martin shooting narrative, including direct involvement in forcing Sanford, FL sheriff Bill Lee to temporarily step down.
An Orlando Sentinel article detailing how the Department of Justice’s secretive Community Relations Service worked to bring about Sheriff Lee’s ouster raises troubling questions about the Obama administration’s involvement, especially when coupled with the cozy relationship that Attorney General Eric Holder has with one of the lead Trayvon Martin agitators, the Rev. Al Sharpton.
What is the DOJ’s Community Relations Service? The Sentinel article, entitled “DOJ ‘peacemakers’ helped Sanford stay cool amid rising tension,” paints a generally rosy, if slightly creepy, picture of the organization and its role during the Trayvon Martin shooting and the aftermath:


In their Navy blue windbreakers, polo shirts and dark sunglasses, they look like federal agents.
Their caps are embroidered with the Justice Department’s seal. They watch and listen silently. But they say little publicly.
When reporters try to chat them up, they remain stoic, saying simply they cannot talk to the media.
The peacekeepers have a specific mandate outlined in the 1964 Civil Rights Act to go into conflict zones within American communities that perceive discrimination or feel wronged because of their particular race, color or national origin.

However, the original mandate of the CRS was expanded with the passage of recent hate crime legislation. A 2010 article by liberal journalist Ryan Reilly on Main Justice quotes former Community Relations Service director Ondray T. Harris as saying the CRS had become more ‘preventative’.
Others give a less positive view of the CRS. One source familiar with the division describes them as “federal spies, federal muscle, all in the guise of mediation.”
The Sentinel quotes a number of people saying positive things about the CRS and their role in Sanford, but all of them appear to be people or organizations who were calling for George Zimmerman’s arrest, such as the Seminole County NAACP.

Despite claiming to be unbiased, DOJ head Eric Holder recently spoke in praise of Al Sharpton, one of the main agitators in the Trayvon Martin story, at an event hosted by Sharpton’s Nation Action Network–at the same time Sharpton was calling for increased civil disobedience.
According to the Sentinel, the Department of Justice and CRS had a hand in bolstering Rev. Al Sharpton’s claim of Police Department bias by helping to facilitate the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee Jr. from the Stanford Florida Police Department, just two days before President Obama’s Rose Garden statement about Trayvon Martin.
As the Orlando Sentinel reported:
They helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee, said Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
“People are more relaxed and satisfied when they know they have someone from the outside, like the DOJ who have no ties to the community to try and relax the emotions,” Clayton said

We have previously reported that in 2006, then Senator Barack Obama was involved in a Florida case with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump and Rev. Sharpton that acted as the publicity blueprint for the Martin case.
That connection has still not been reported in the mainstream media, and itself raises serious questions about the level of coordination between the Obama administration, Mr. Crump and Rev. Sharpton.

A hot microphone caught Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) coordinating which way members of the “Gang of Eight” who serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee would vote on immigration bill amendments, Breitbart News has learned.
“Do our Republicans have a pass on this one if they want?” the microphone caught Schumer saying.
The hot mic remarks came during the Judiciary Committee markup on Monday, when Schumer was talking to his staff while senators were voting on an amendment that would prevent illegal immigrants from gaining access to public benefits, specifically the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).  


The amendment, offered by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), would have barred illegal immigrants from accessing tax credits like the EITC under the bill until they received green cards or citizenship years from now.

The amendment failed along party lines. For one of the first times ever, though, Gang of Eight members Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) joined their Republican colleagues in voting for the amendment. All the Democrats voted against it.
The National Journal recently reported that the Gang of Eight members have coordinated in secret to keep amendments that would strengthen the bill from passing. Sessions expressed outrage at that report, saying that “[o]ne of the things that most upsets the American people about Washington is drafting a bill with special interests in secret and jamming it across the finish line in a way that minimizes public involvement and input. Despite touting their legislation as ‘the toughest border enforcement in history,’ the Gang of Eight bill failed to live up to every major promise of its sponsors–including the promise of enforcement first–resulting in a bill that is even weaker than the rejected 2007 plan. This legislation needs improvement and openness.”

Border security is the only basis for Republican unity. Republicans are divided on all other particulars–path to citizenship, guest worker program, deportation, anchor babies, etc. As I’ve argued before, Republican strategy in the House should be to say “no” on issues where there is consensus, and “no, unless” on issues where there is not. In this case, the House should reject any reform unless it puts border security first.
Law enforcement is the only true bipartisan policy. Conservative Republicans have something in common with unions: a common enthusiasm for enforcing immigration law against employers, particularly through the use of e-verify databases for new hires. In addition, working-class voters are less than enthusiastic about legalizing immigrants who would create instant competition in non-farm sectors of the low-skills labor market.


We have tried amnesty before, and it failed. The reason we have some 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States is that a 1986 amnesty enacted by the Reagan administration failed to improve law enforcement (thanks in part to liberal interest groups) and merely created new incentives for illegal immigration. Enforcement is to amnesty as spending cuts are to tax hikes; unless they come first, they do not happen.
Democrats do not want to “resolve” illegal immigration. If they did, it would have been done already. They do want to pass big legislation: back in 2006-7, Democrat strategist (and ex-con) Robert Creamer prescribed immigration reform as the second step in a series of radical changes (after health care). Yet as Daniel Horowitz writes at RedState, Democrats need new immigration-related grievances to fuel their outrage.
Barack Obama began his community organizing career with a radical immigrants’ group. One of Obama’s first organizing assignments in Chicago was with an Alinkyite group called UNO, the “Mexican-American ACORN.” As Stanley Kurtz has exposed, “Obama personally helped plan” some of the group’s most thuggish activities. He has used this issue his entire career to divide Americans and intimidate political opponents.

Regardless of what passes, Obama will take–and receive–credit. Voters will not remember that Obama blocked immigration reform in the Senate, or that he failed to introduce new legislation in his first term, breaking a solemn campaign promise. They will simply remember that they voted for him in 2012 and he signed immigration reform afterwards. Republicans will continue to average 30% of the Hispanic vote regardless.
Regardless of what passes, Republicans will still be labeled bigots. The president has already attempted to delegitimize opposition to immigration reform as motivated by racism; he will likely do so again. He will do so more often, not less, if Republicans give up their insistence on border security first, because then there will seem to be no other basis for opposition to immigration reform. The media will support him enthusiastically.
Immigration is neither the sole Hispanic issue, nor solely a Hispanic issue. Issues such as education and economic opportunity also top the agenda for Hispanic voters. In addition, as Tony Lee has pointed out, Asian immigrants are the fastest-growing group, even outpacing Hispanics in California. Republicans perform equally poorly among Asian-American voters–not because of immigration but likely because of other issues.
The Obama administration has little interest in law enforcement. Last year, the president used executive action to create a “Dream Act” by fiat, circumventing Congress and creating new incentives for illegal immigration. The administration has also done little over the past four years to patrol the borders beyond perfunctory gestures, and strenuously opposed efforts by the state of Arizona to take matters into its own hands. 
Immigration does need to be reformed–for skilled immigrants. The area in which U.S. immigration policy is most lacking concerns skilled immigrants, who are choosing other destinations. The Obama administration has not made it easier for skilled students to stay in the country when finished their degree, nor has it removed the cap on H1-B visas. The Democrats’ primary concern is not the economy, nor justice, but new votes.

According to an ABC News report, senators from the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” pushing immigration reform are expected to drop their bill, estimated at around 1,500 pages, on Tuesday, mere hours before the only scheduled Senate hearing on the topic.
“A bipartisan group of senators plans to introduce its long-awaited immigration bill on Tuesday, Senate sources confirmed to ABC News,” Jim Avila and Jordan Fabian wrote on Friday. “Four Democrats and four Republicans, known as the ‘Gang of Eight,’ wrapped up months of hard-fought negotiations this week and will put forth a bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.”  
If the Senators actually do wait until Tuesday to roll out their lengthy proposed overhaul of the U.S. immigration system, that will give members of the Senate Judiciary Committee less than a full day to read it before the only Senate hearing on the topic. Despite ardent pleas from Senate conservatives, including ranking Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee’s chairman, Sen. Pat Leahy, has only agreed to one hearing on the legislation.


Leahy scheduled that single hearing for Wednesday at 2:30 PM, and the hearing’s sole scheduled witness is Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. Napolitano would have less than a full day to read the bill she is scheduled to testify about.

“Gang of Eight” member Marco Rubio (R-FL) has said he supports multiple hearings and an open and transparent immigration reform process, but his actions do not necessarily back his words. He has not pushed Leahy to force multiple hearings; he appears content with the single hearing Leahy has scheduled on the issue and now appears to be backing down from his demand for multiple hearings. 
In a Friday morning report, Politico’s Manu Raju notes that after Rubio was “rebuffed” in his request for multiple hearings, “the senator wants to launch his own public hearing process of sorts to allow Republican senators to question expert witnesses about the plan, a move aimed at alleviating conservative fears that the plan will be jammed through Congress with little public airing.”
Rubio is clearly worried about the perception that this bill will be rushed through, just like Obamacare was a few years ago. On Saturday morning, Rubio’s office issued a press release containing a single quote from Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace: 
The one thing that’s clear is that this isn’t going to be health care reform. It’s not going to be rushed through. It’s going to go through the committee process. There’s going to be hearings. There will be lots of amendments. And I think the only way to get buy in from some of those other 92 senators is going to be regular order, that is a very gradual slow way.
Despite Wallace’s claim, there is only one hearing that is scheduled to happen. At the same time, there are multiple reports that keep surfacing indicating that the Gang of Eight will band together to block amendments to their bill.

Wednesday night on The O’Reilly Factor, Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, broke a series of previously unreleased US Department of Agriculture Videos featuring required “Cultural Sensitivity Training.” The program required employees to chant, “The pilgrims were illegal aliens,” never to use the word “minorities” and to replace it instead with “emerging majorities,” and other similarly leftist tripe.

The sensitivity training sessions taped here were held on USDA premises, and is part of what Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack termed the department’s “new era of Civil Rights” and “broader effort towards cultural transformation at USDA.” The training sessions were created by diversity awareness trainer Samuel Betances at a cost of approximately $200,000.

The video highlights include:


Betances explaining to USDA employees that “If you take a look at all of you here and you think about your salaries and your benefits and what you have left undone – plus my fee – plus the expense of the team that putting the video together, this is a huge expense.”
 
Betances urging to repeat the leftist version of American history: “I want you to say that America was founded by outsiders – say that – who are today’s insiders, who are very nervous about today’s outsiders. I want you to say, ‘The pilgrims were illegal aliens.’ Say, ‘The pilgrims never gave their passports to the Indians.”
  
Betances stating, “By the way, I don’t like the word ‘minorities.’ How about ’emerging majorities’?”
  

The complete video is available through the Judicial Watch website.

Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, told Breitbart News, “This was a pretty straightforward attempt at psychological reconditioning. Underlying the whole program is the theory that white males especially are inherently racist, sexist, or homophobic. It’s a huge waste of taxpayer dollars. 
“This is as objectionable or as significant as the GSA Las Vegas scandal. This is a program blessed at the highest levels of the USDA. We found out about it because of a whistleblower who was forced to undergo this type of training. They’ve obviously selling this left-wing diversity cult,” said Fitton.

Breitbart News reported last week that Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) passed an amendment in the House Armed Services Committee protecting religious speech of service members in the military. President Barack Obama has now threatened to veto the bill if it passes the full House and Senate. 
The White House released a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) on H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014. Among other items, the SAP includes as an objection to the bill:



Expansion and Implementation of Protection of Rights of Conscience of Members of the Armed Forces and Chaplains of Such Members: The Administration strongly objects to section 530, which would require the Armed Forces to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, “actions and speech” reflecting the “conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member.” By limiting the discretion of commanders to address potentially problematic speech and actions within their units, this provision would have a significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale, and mission accomplishment. 

The SAP includes a veto threat: “…if the bill is presented to the President for approval in its current form, the President’s senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.” 

In other words, Obama says he will veto any bill that forbids his appointees or officers from telling a soldier that he cannot mention Jesus during prayer or have a Bible on his desk, or that keeps those appointees from telling a chaplain (who is an ordained clergyman) what religious teachings he is allowed to give in worship services, or what spiritual counseling he can give to another soldier.  
Ambassador Ken Blackwell, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, tells Breitbart News:

President Obama is waging a war on religion. He and Chuck Hagel are denying the most basic rights to those who put their lives on the line to protect all of our rights. It is shameful and appalling. I am confident that congressional leadership will show courage to stand up for our troops against this radical assault on religious liberty in the military.

This is the most compelling expression yet of the aggressive approach of the Obama-Hagel Defense Department to soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are observant Christians or devout members of other peaceful faiths, as seen in Breitbart News’ previous reports regarding the unconstitutional infringements of one of America’s most treasured, fundamental rights. 
All eyes are on House and Senate leadership to see if they stand firm on the bill for those in the military who are facing this new form of pressure.

On Saturday, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin blasted the “scrooges” waging a “war on Christmas” and their “zealot-like” faith in an “arrogant” church of big government run by the supposed best and the brightest that has only caused “irreparable harm” to America.  
She said the “arrogant” church of government does not have “faith in your ability to govern yourself,” so “you should not have faith in it” because “it does not have faith in us.”
Speaking at an Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner, Palin said “enough is enough” of the “politically-correct police out there” and blasted the scrooges waging a “War on Christmas.” 


Palin said Americans needed to take action to resist the “fundamental transformation” of society that many Americans “never signed up for.” Echoing themes from her book, Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, which comes out on Tuesday, Palin said that “religious freedom is under attack,” and religion is “pushed out of the public square” and “censored.” Palin said one will see the censorship and double standards “blatantly come this holiday season.” 
She said that the war on Christmas sounds like an oxymoron but it is real, “a symptom of a bigger issue,” and “just the tip of the spear in a larger battle.”

Palin then noted that the “scrooges who are too enlightened for religion” have a very “zealot-like faith in the church of big government.” 
“What’s that done for you lately?” Palin asked. 
She said the “church of big government” is run by the supposed “best and the brightest,” and she slammed the recent National Security Agency spying scandals, the barricading of the World War II Monument during the partial government shutdown, and the recent failures of Obamacare, which she said was the church of big government’s “crowning achievement” to date.
She blasted the “best and the brightest” in the Obama administration for believing “hicks in flyover country” or “hockey moms in Alaska” do not know what health insurance plans are best for their families or cannot run their own lives without government interference. 
Palin also said the “lapdog media” allow the “best and the brightest” in the church of big government to “get away” with lies and bad policies, which has caused “irreparable damage” to the country. 
She said under the “church of big government,” there have been “shuttered businesses and cities” and “poverty has gone up,” while a “record number of Americans are giving up and no longer bothering to look for work.”
“Where has that gotten you?” Palin asked. 
She then blasted “immoral and unscrupulous” leaders who “ignore the Constitution in favor of their fundamental transformation agenda” while “enriching themselves and their cronies while their nation goes bankrupt… that’s dictatorship.”

Billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg defended President Barack Obama’s troubled Obamacare website HealthCare.gov in an interview with ABC News’ This Week in which he pushed for amnesty.
“You know, sometimes stuff doesn’t work when you want it to. We’ve certainly had plenty of mistakes and things that haven’t worked the way that we want to,” Zuckerberg said of Facebook’s website when asked by ABC News about Obamacare’s website failure. “The right thing here is just to keep on focusing on building the service that you think is right in the long term.”

In the interview, Zuckerberg attempted to frame granting amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal aliens as a “civil rights issue”–a talking point used by Attorney General Eric Holder earlier this year. 


“When you meet these children who are really talented, and they’ve grown up in America and they really don’t know any other country besides that, but they don’t have the opportunities that… we all enjoy, it’s really heartbreaking–right? That seems like it’s one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time,” Zuckerberg said. “There are a lot of misconceptions about that… and a lot of them came here because they just want to work. They want to help out their families and they want to contribute.”

Zuckerberg alluded in the interview that his goal in pushing for amnesty is to get tech workers from abroad for his company, rather than hiring Americans for jobs at Facebook.

“The future of our economy is a knowledge economy,” Zuckerberg said. “And that means that getting the most talented people into this country is the most important thing that we can do to make sure that the companies of tomorrow are founded here.”
Zuckerberg’s interview came as he and a group of illegal aliens last week conducted a “hackathon” to push for amnesty. 
“One of the things that the ‘dreamers’ here today show is that even if, you know, you’re a child of someone who came here who wouldn’t be considered one of the higher-skilled workers… you can be one of the entrepreneurs of tomorrow,” Zuckerberg said of the hackathon. “That’s the American dream.”

Zuckerberg was asked, too, about how thus far amnesty efforts have been stalled in Congress, despite all the money he has spent through FWD.us and other lobbyists have spent through their respective outfits pushing to create support in Washington for comprehensive immigration reform. He said he still thinks there is a possibility an amnesty could be passed into law.
“I’m fundamentally an optimistic person, as an entrepreneur,” he said. “The vast majority of Americans want this to happen.”
Zuckerberg has relaunched advertising efforts to push for an immigration bill out of the House this Congress.

MSNBC host and commentator Touré fired a clear and distinct shot at Dr. Ben Carson Friday, hammering the African-American Presidential Medal of Freedom winner for daring to challenge the Obamadoxy parroted by Touré and progressive journalists bent on supporting the President’s policies at all costs.
Dr. Ben Carson splashed onto the national stage with his blistering criticism of ObamaCare last month at the National Prayer breakfast, with President Obama seated just a few feet away.  Carson is a heroic surgeon, Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery, who performed groundbreaking medical miracles at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  He is a brilliant and passionate advocate for free market principals, individual responsibility, and the freedoms and liberty embodied in resistance to bloated big government programs like ObamaCare.  He also happens to be black.  Therefore, he must be stopped, now.
Like Clarence Thomas, Condi Rice, Colin Powell (until he got the message) and Herman Cain before him, Carson will now be the target of the most vile and reprehensible kinds of criticism from black progressives like Touré and his colleague Al Sharpton.  A black man who doesn’t blindly support the president and the big government programs that has created a dependency on government that has crippled America’s underclass is susceptible to name calling that, otherwise, would not be tolerated in American political discourse.





On his show, Touré said this of Carson: 

Carson is a brilliant medical thinker but he’s got intellectual tumors like a flat tax, which is regressive, and ignorant in the face of wealth inequality where the top 1% own 35% and the bottom 60% own 2.3%. I doubt Jesus would tax them equally. Just as I doubt the GOP would entertain a white non-politician with unserious ideas. But Carson has joined the GOP’s version of affirmative action, where blacks that can speak conservative game get raced to the front of the line because then people get to put a bumper sticker on their car that say, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Carson!’ Which would fit nicely over the bumper sticker saying, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Cain?’ Which fit nicely over the bumper sticker saying, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Allen West!’
Yes, any black friend will do, no matter how far outside the political system they emerge from and no matter how unserious their ideas are. Because it’s all make believe. None of them will ever get a nomination for the Presidency, just as the GOP will never get black votes, because the only thing they care about is winning and not the economic or social needs of black people. But in the meantime, imagine away you guys.
At CPAC Carson said, ‘Let’s say you magically put me in the White House.’ But, my brother, no magic is required to accomplish that. As soon as the sequester ends, you could take a White House tour.

Let’s be clear:  Touré holds black men up to a different (lower or higher, not sure) standard when they criticize the President.  He expects black people to think a certain way and pounces when they step out of line and express a different set of ideas than what Touré believes they should believe, due to their skin color. Because Carson is a black man, he is therefore the beneficiary of affirmitive action, in Touré’s mind, and if he dares to present an opposing view from MSNBC’s Obamadoxy, he is an Uncle Tom and betrayer of his race.  
In short, Touré has a special contempt for black men who criticize President Obama.  There may be many different interpretations of the definition of racial prejudice and/or racism, but my understanding of racism is that it is the belief that humans are divided into distinct groups based upon their skin color and genetic make-up, and those groups are expected to behave and think in certain ways (inferior or superior) solely based upon their race.  Touré’s special loathing of Dr. Carson may not be based upon his race, but it certainly appears to be.  And if that doesn’t fall under the description of racism, then I would really appreciate it if Touré could explain the distinction to me, because I’m having trouble seeing it.

On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) said children of illegal immigrants who were brought to America by their parents should get opportunities to get legal residence and citizenship.
“It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children and who know no other home,” Cantor said. “I’m pleased that many of my colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle have begun work in good faith to address these issues.”
At a major speech at the American Enterprise Institute that detailed Republican policy proposals to “make life better” for Americans, Cantor called on his colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle to address this issue and urged President Barack Obama to lead on a bipartisan immigration bill. Cantor said one of the “founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents.”


This is a reversal for Cantor, who voted against the DREAM Act in 2010. 
“There are some who would rather avoid fixing the problem in order to save this as a political issue,” Cantor said. “I reject this notion and call on the President to help lead us towards a bipartisan solution rather than encourage the common political divisions of the past.”
Cantor said “there are more than 11 million people here illegally, many of whom have become part of the fabric of our country,” and “they, like us, have families and dreams.” 

“While we are a nation that allows anyone to start anew, we are also a nation of laws, and that’s what makes tackling the issue of immigration reform so difficult,” Cantor said. “In looking to solve this problem soon, we’ve got to balance the respect for the rule of law and respect for those waiting to enter this country legally, with care for the people and families, most of whom just want to make a better life, and contribute to America.”
Cantor also called on Congress to pass the STEM Act, which would give foreign students who have advanced degrees in field such as science, technology, engineering, and math from American universities permanent residency. 
He said discussions about immigration reform have made “border security, employment verification and creating a workable guest worker program immediate priorities.”
“It’s the right thing to do for our families, for our security, and for our economy,” Cantor said. 
Cantor said his “grandparents fled the vicious anti-Semitic pogroms of the czars of Russia to come to America.” He said his grandmother, who was “widowed at a young age,” raised “her two sons in a tiny apartment atop a grocery store she and my grandfather had opened.”
“With little but her faith, thrift and hope for a better tomorrow, my grandma worked seven days a week to ensure that my dad and uncle could realize the promise of this great country,” Cantor said. “And today, my children and I stand as proof of the possibility to what may have seemed to her then like an impossible dream.”

What a wonderful character insight it is to discover that David Remnick, the same biographer capable of summoning all kinds of eloquence and empathy for Boston’s accused mass-murdering terrorists, is also the same David Remnick that publicly smeared the ridiculously peaceful Tea Party as something driven by wicked intentions.  
In a 2010 audience Q&A about his (then) new book on Barack Obama, Remnick confessed that what he saw among the everyday moms and dads and grandmothers and grandfathers who populate the Tea Party is an entity motivated mostly by fear and race:


When you hear people in the Tea Party movement saying, ‘I want my country back, I’ve lost my country,’ something is being said there, very often, that has to do with race. It has to do with otherness. It has to do with a nostalgia for an imagined America some time ago.
As I write this, Remnick is being celebrated all throughout the elite media for his morally illiterate New Yorker article that biographies Boston Marathon suspects, Tamerlan and Dzohokhar Tsarnaev. So impressed is the elite media, that George Stephanopoulos has invited Remnick to appear on “This Week” Sunday. 
If you are naively wondering why all this is happening, here is what I wrote earlier today:

Much of this is and will be motivated by the left’s bizarre desire to forever rationalize radical Islam. For some reason, Islamists are the only racist, sexist, homophobic theocrats the media can’t summon outrage against. I suspect it is also the result of industry-wide disappointment over the fact that the bad guys aren’t right-wingers. (Would Remnick have summoned such eloquence for the savage second coming of McVeigh? Would the media be gushing over it?) 
So what we have here is the media still looking for a way to blame the most inviting and inclusive country in the world for not being inviting and inclusive enough.
The same media that sees only evil in the peaceful Tea Party just can’t bring itself to see evil in the kind of terrorism they can’t exploit against the Tea Party or any of their enemies on the right. 
The media will  bend over backwards to shroud monstrous terrorism in lofty nuance. 
You and I, though, are just monsters.

Saturday morning Patrick Howley of The Daily Caller dropped another nuke on the fire that is Benghazi-Gate. Howley connects the dots surrounding a number of recent leaks coming of out CBS News about the fate of its award-winning investigative reporter, Sharyl Attkisson. 
From the beginning, Attkisson has been one of the few mainstream journalists willing to dig into the September 11 terror attack in Libya, and the Administration’s response to it. Fearing the story might lead exactly where it did yesterday with Jonathan Karl’s bombshell report, the mainstream media has poured most if its energy into wishing the story away or playing Palace Guard for the White House. 
Attkisson’s dogged pursuit of the truth has not only pitted her against a media desperate to protect Obama, but also, apparently, against her bosses at CBS News, one of whom is the brother of a top Obama official.


Moreover, CBS News president David Rhoades is not only the brother of President Obama’s national security advisor, Ben Rhodes, but ABC News reports that Ben Rhodes was very much involved in the editing of the now-infamous CIA talking points. 
So…
1. According to ABC News, Obama’s national security advisor Ben Rhodes was deeply involved in the editing of the CIA talking points.  

2. These same CIA talking points are central to what many believe is a White House coverup.
3. Ben Rhodes is the brother of CBS News president David Rhodes.
4. At CBS News, Sharyl Attkisson is one of the only mainstream media journalists with the dogged determination and moral courage to demand the truth about the White House’s involvement in the CIA talking points.  
5. For months now  reports have surfaced that Attkisson’s bosses are unhappy with her, that she has trouble getting her Libya stories on the air, and that she’s being accused of engaging in “advocacy.”

A former senior investigator with the State Department’s criminal investigative unit has turned whistleblower and alleged to both the media and Congress that senior staff within State Department covered up investigations into appalling behavior committed by members of Hillary Clinton’s security staff and our ambassador to Belgium. One of those alleged to have interfered was Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s chief of staff. 
The case in which Clinton enforcer Mills allegedly intervened centered upon Brett McGurk, Obama’s nominee to be US ambassador to Iraq. 
McGurk’s expected nomination fell apart after a computer hack exposed his racy e-mails and an extramarital affair with Wall Street Journal reporter Gina Chon.


According to the memo, the SID “never interviewed McGurk, allegedly because Cheryl Mills from the Secretary’s office interceded.”
“Without that interview, SID has been unable to close the case,” the memo concludes.
Mills is a longtime associate of the Clintons, going back to 1992, and was also at the center of the first scandal to hit Hillary’s State Department: Benghazi. Gregory Hicks, the former Deputy Chief of Mission in Libya, testified before Congress that Mills instructed him not to cooperate with the Congressional investigation into the September 11 terror attacks. 

Mills isn’t the only high-ranking official being named. Patrick Kennedy, the Undersecretary of State for Management, is directly accused of killing an investigation into our Ambassador to Belgium, Howard Gutman, who is accused of slipping away from his security detail to solicit sex from minor children. 
Gutman was a big Democratic donor before taking the post, having raised $500,000 for President Obama’s 2008 campaign and helping finance his inaugural. 
* At least seven agents in Clinton’s security detail hired prostitutes while traveling with her in various countries, including Russia and Colombia.
Investigators called the use of prostitutes by Clinton’s security agents “endemic.”
Amid all the other scandals, this latest mess is still picking up some traction in the mainstream media. Here is Chuck Todd’s “Today Show” report:

With a happy Iran at the negotiating table and plenty of reasons to take the spotlight off health care, the Obama administration now seeks to tie the hands of political opponents by limiting spending by tax-exempt groups with political messages.
The Treasury and IRS announced they were currently working on adapting the tax code to limit what kinds of groups could apply for 501(c)(4) status, a category designated for political non-profits and “social welfare” groups that follow less stringent spending rules than political action committees (PACs). The Obama administration’s proposed changes to the code would prevent 501(c)(4)s from engaging in advocacy for a specific candidate and political advocacy generally, including paying for campaign ads on television. Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur called the move “a first critical step toward creating clear-cut definitions of political activity by tax-exempt social welfare organizations.”
Unlike PACs, 501(c)(4)s do not currently have to disclose donors legally. They have surpassed unions and trade associations in political spending and become a pivotal part of the post-Citizens United campaign finance landscape. They do not aid candidates directly, but take on issues and buy ads that directly argue to the public one way or another. While the groups can be of any political stripe, spending by conservative groups has greatly surpassed that by liberal organizations like Organizing for America. And although the measure would crack down on bigger organizations like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, the strength of smaller, Tea Party-central advocacy groups who rely on their tax exempt status to promote messages mainstream political figures would otherwise ignore would most likely be among the hardest hit.


Conservatives both complying with the law in their roles running 501(c)(4)s and those in office have responded to the measure with uniform outrage. A spokesman for the NRA, a 501(c)(4), called the measure a “blatant abuse of the tax code designed to muzzle the American people’s free speech rights.” Rep. Darrell Issa described the move as a “crass political effort,” and placed emphasis on the fact that unions and trade organizations– often much more likely to contribute to liberal efforts– were left to their own devices while the IRS and Treasury turned on these particular political non-profits.

This isn’t the first time the IRS proposes to crack down on political groups voicing opposition to President Obama’s policies, but it is the most sweeping attempt. Controversy with such groups came to a peak this year when it was discovered that more than 80% of 501(c)(4) groups on the IRS’ watch list between 2010 and 2012 were conservative and/or Tea Party affiliated organizations. 
While the administration promises careful scrutiny of the tax code before making any large changes, President Obama’s vocal disapproval of the expressive freedoms protected by the Citizens United ruling and his administration’s targeting of opposition groups through the IRS leave little room to expect tax reforms to have anything but a chilling effect on the national political discourse.

7265	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/31/Menendez-Prostitution-Scandal-Donor-Melgens-Political-Contributions	News	1	Democrat Scandals	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Ophthalmologist and Democratic political donor Dr. Salomon Melgen may have tried to buy cover from the IRS for the $11.1 million he owes in back taxes from 2006 to present, Breitbart News has learned. Melgen may have intended to court politicians with political donations and prostitutes with the hopes that they would help him wipe his IRS slate clean.
Melgen was a political donor from as far back as the early 1990s. According to Federal Election Commission records published on the Center for Responsive Politics website OpenSecrets.org, Melgen made his first political donation to a young first-term Democratic U.S. Congressman: Bob Menendez. After that $500 donation, Melgen’s friendship with Menendez developed further (the two were reportedly close before Menendez first took office).
Meanwhile, Melgen and his wife Flor started making more political donations to Menendez and other politicians and groups. As the years went by, the donations grew in size. Melgen became a regular on the political circuit. He hosted fundraisers for candidates and became close with the Clinton family throughout the 1990s. Salomon and Flor Melgen donated $2,000 total to President Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign, after having given $3,000 to Hillary Clinton’s brother–Hugh Rodham–for his failed 1994 U.S. Senate bid out of Florida. 


The donations continued to grow in size and quantity before Melgen began facing tax problems with the IRS in July 2002. The Free Beacon reports that the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Melgen for about $1.3 million then for unpaid taxes dating back to 1999, and that lien was released in November 2002.
Melgen continued supporting Democratic politicians from Florida and some other higher-profile Democrats around the country. He and his wife supported now-former Sens. Chris Dodd and Bob Graham, and Sens. Tom Harkin Chuck Schumer and Bill Nelson. He threw some cash to then House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (who reared Nancy Pelosi in House politics in the early 2000s after he lost the House Majority to Newt Gingrich in the 1994 elections.
After that original tax lien was wiped away–at this time, the details of why the lien was removed are unclear–all was going well for Melgen until, in 2008, he got slapped with another lien. According to the Free Beacon, the IRS charges in that lien that Melgen owed $6.2 million in back taxes dating to 1998. That second lien was lifted in August 2011.

It was in the middle of these first two liens–around the beginning of 2006–that Melgen ramped up his political activity. Until then, from that first donation to Menendez in 1993, Melgen and his wife Flor had donated a total of $88,360 to political candidates and groups. Save for two anomalies–a $250 donation to former Florida Republican Rep. Mark Foley, who resigned after his own sex scandal hit him, and a $1,000 donation his wife Flor gave to George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s–Melgen and his family didn’t donate to Republicans.
From the beginning of 2006 to present, Melgen almost quadrupled his political donation activity of the previous decade or longer. In the past seven years, he, his wife, and his daughter Melissa–who is the marketing director for her father’s eye clinic company–donated a total of $324,600 to political figures and groups. Like before, most of that went to Democrats.
According to a current Dominican Republic government official this reporter interviewed while writing for The Daily Caller before joining Breitbart News, Melgen allegedly began hosting sex parties replete with “sex, hookers and drinking.” Menendez allegedly attended these parties. While the senator and his staff deny prostitution parties took place at the villa or that Menendez participated in them–even though two prostitutes have alleged, in an interview with this reporter who broke the original story while at The Daily Caller, that they were paid to have sex with Menendez–Menendez’s staff admitted the senator flew to the Dominican on Melgen’s private plane on three occasions and told NBC News’ Michael Isikoff that Menendez stays at Melgen’s villa while there about twice a year.
The Dominican official told this reporter Menendez has allegedly been attending these sex parties at Melgen’s villa “for at least the past three years, probably longer.”
Back in the United States, Melgen continued increasing his political profile as a donor. In 2011, he expanded his reach outside the Democratic Party to begin funding two prominent Hispanic Republicans’ political efforts. He and his wife pushed Florida Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Over the course of 2011 and 2012, the Melgens donated $10,000 to Diaz-Balart and $9,800 to Ros-Lehtinen–a powerful congresswoman who at the time chaired the House Foreign Relations Committee.

As these sex parties allegedly continued in the Dominican, and Melgen continued building his political profile with bigger and bigger donations to higher and higher profile politicians–all while flying his private jet around–the doctor’s tax problems went from bad to worse. The Free Beacon reports that in May 2011 Melgen was hit with another IRS tax lien, this one for $11.1 million in unpaid taxes dating back to 2006. The previous $6.2 million lien was still in effect for another few months before the IRS released it in August 2011–meaning the doctor had $17.3 million in liens against him at that point.
The $11.1 million lien remains in place to this day. But in April 2011, one month before the IRS filed this additional lien for $11.1 million, and four months before the earlier $6.2 million IRS lien was released, the doctor and journalist Emilio Sanchez founded Hispanic media company VOXXI. Sanchez is the CEO.

“At VOXXI, we aim to fill a void in the mainstream media by delivering great journalism and telling captivating stories that educate, engage and entertain, all with a Hispanic touch and enriched by the power of social media,” VOXXI said in its mission statement. “We will defend the role of Hispanics in this nation by providing a news platform where Latinos can be heard and respected. As an independent voice, VOXXI fosters an open and dynamic dialogue, empowering our community to act and react on current events and trends.”
Documents filed with Florida’s Secretary of State’s office show Melgen is listed as the managing member of La Vox LLC, the limited liability company that owns VOXXI.
A few months later, at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., Melgen and Sanchez threw a bash celebrating VOXXI’s launch. Photos published online from the event show attendees other than Melgen and Sanchez include: Menendez, Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen, among many other politicians.

In a phone interview with Breitbart News on Thursday, Sanchez said the Menendez-Melgen story had nothing to do with his website. “There is no relationship between VOXXI and the Dr. Salomon Melgen–Senator Robert Menendez story,” he said. “We don’t have to make a statement.”
When asked if Melgen owned 100 percent of La Vox LLC or had a controlling interest in the company, Sanchez responded: “I don’t have to give you financial information on the company.”
Sanchez also said an earlier report from LatinoRebels.com that his company would be releasing a statement on the scandal was “not true,” and that his company won’t release a statement.
Through a spokeswoman, Diaz-Balart refused to comment to Breitbart News when asked for details on his connections to Melgen. A spokesperson for Ros-Lehtinen has not returned several requests for comment.
About two months after that event was Easter week. That week is the timeframe in which two women from the Dominican Republic alleged, in an interview with this reporter, they were under-paid to have sex with Menendez; they claim they were promised $500 each but say they only received $100 apiece.
Shortly after that Easter-week incident, a tipster who goes by the name “Peter Williams” alerted the George Soros-funded Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which began investigating. CREW alerted ABC News reporter Rhonda Schwartz, who also started investigating but for reasons unknown never ran a story, and the FBI.
FBI Special Agent Regino Chavez launched an inquiry into the prostitution angle of this scandal as it relates to Menendez and Melgen as early as August 1, 2012, emails show. In September 2012, Chavez emailed “Williams” to tell him that the FBI had been able to “confirm most of” the information he was providing on that front and that the FBI “know[s] that you are providing accurate information.”
As Schwartz never continued to not run a story on the matter and CREW didn’t publish anything either–while the FBI worked its will–this reporter got wind of the allegations floating around there. Early on November 1, 2012, this reporter broke the story in The Daily Caller.
A couple weeks ago, the emails between “Williams” and the FBI’s Chavez surfaced, as did many more details.
Over the ensuing months since the story first broke, ABC News has not run a story. While guest-hosting ABC’s Sunday news show “This Week,” the network’s foreign affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz had Menendez on for six minutes and chose not to ask about the FBI inquiry. Media coverage elsewhere has been scant as well. 
Melgen’s personal media company has ignored the story, something a VOXXI spokeswoman told Breitbart News has been a decision made by leadership. “It was an editorial decision,” VOXXI spokeswoman Julissa Bonfante said when asked why the outlet didn’t cover it.

An April 2013 email from a career Department of Homeland Security official released on Friday by the office of Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) stated that the Department of Homeland Security “absolutely gave special treatment” to green card visa applications filed by foreign national EB-5 investors in GreenTech Automotive, the company Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe served as chairman of from 2010 to 2012.
In the released email, the names of the sender as well as the recipient have been redacted, but both are described as “career DHS officials.” The text of the email also refers to a person called “D1,” which Senator Grassley’s office believes is US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Alejandro Mayorkas. President Obama nominated Mayorkas to become Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on June 27. 
Mr. Mayorkas testified before a Senate committee holding hearings on his nomination on July 25. The hearings were attended by only Democrats. Republicans did not participate because Mr. Mayorkas is the subject of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office.


The email, dated April 12, 2013, is from a “Senior USCIS Career Official” and is sent to “USCIS Career Officials.” It reads as follows:

We absolutely gave special treatment to GreenTech at the directive of D1. D1 was working directly with the RC’s [EB-5 Regional Center] atty, [name redacted]. Additionally, I would call a wholesale rewrite of the AAO’s [Administrative Appeals Office] decision by the front office special treatment. Look at the first draft in the attached email and the final version, attached.

Senator Grassley asked Mr. Mayorkas about an apparent inconsistency between this email and his earlier testimony in a letter he sent to Mr. Mayorkas on Thursday. Grassley wrote to Mayorkas that “you testified [on July 25]: ‘I have never ever in my career exercised undue influence to influence the outcome of a case.'” Grassley noted in his letter to Mayorkas that “D1 [mentioned in the April 12, 2013 email] is an apparent reference to you.” 
Grassley then cited Mayorkas’ testimony to the Senate committee on July 25:


Several documents call into question some of the statements you made regarding preferential treatment in your testimony at last Thursday’s hearing. For example, you were asked in the hearing about communications with Terry McAuliffe with respect to Gulf Coast Funds Management. You testified: “I was asked to attend a meeting with Mr. McAuliffe so that I could hear in person his complaints… two years ago… I heard those complaints, and that was the extent of the interaction… I moved on with my work.” (Emphasis included in Grassley letter)

But, Grassley wrote, “Contrary to the impression left by your answer, documents indicate that both before and after that meeting, you actually engaged in nearly a dozen contacts with Gulf Coast Funds Management between 2010 and 2013, including direct communications with Gulf Coast’s attorneys.” Grassley concluded, “That one meeting with Mr. McAuliffe was clearly not the extent of your interaction on that matter.”
The EB-5 foreign national investor program has come under intense scrutiny over the past several years. Under the program, enacted into law in 1990, foreign nationals may obtain temporary and permanent green card resident visas in return for investing a minimum of $500,000 in an American company.
The possibility that foreign nationals who have invested in GreenTech Automotive have been granted temporary green card visas due to the political influence of the principals involved is a key issue currently under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office. 
Terry McAuliffe, who was chairman of GreenTech Automotive during the period when political influence may have played a role in the granting of visas, is a friend and chief fundraiser for former President Bill Clinton. Anthony Rodham, brother of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is the President and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management, which the Department of Homeland Security designated the EB-5 Regional Center that works exclusively with GreenTech Automotive to help secure green card visas for its EB-5 investors.
Grassley’s letter to Mayorkas was one of two stories about GreenTech Automotive that made headlines on Friday. In a related story, GreenTech Automotive confirmed to Breitbart News on Friday that it has received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce company documents. According to the Washington Post, those documents were subpoenaed as evidence in the SEC’s investigation into claims made by GreenTech Automotive to its investors.

Obama had a bad 2013 but Huff Post’s Sam Stein wants to know why. Among the answers he comes up with is the White House’s own arrogance.
Stein reviews a series of reasons why 2013 broke bad for the President. The Obamacare rollout gets top billing and unexpected events in Newtown and Syria also make the list. But at least a few people see the source of the problem as coming not from outside the White House but within it:



Mike Lux, who served as Obama’s liaison to the progressive community
during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the
administration since, argued that self-assuredness played a damaging
role, preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon.
When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers
of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a
Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination, the advice was heard, but not
necessarily heeded.  

“I feel like the White House goes it alone too much,” said Lux. “In
advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem, it doesn’t
seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion
in the party and with progressive allies.” 

A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: “These guys are
stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn’t smell,
that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt
them.”

Stein concludes that the hinge point of the bad year was Obamacare. That was the place where false promises and foreseeable problems all rushed together in a sickening crunch for the administration. After the government shutdown in October, the Republicans were polling badly and Obamacare was trending up despite the fact that the site did not work at all. Two months later, with the scope of their failure made clear, all of those gains have been reversed and then some.

Tom Brokaw did his very best to contextualize the numerous scandals pummeling the Obama Administration by saying they don’t rise up to the level of Watergate, Iran-Contra, or even Abu Ghraib. 

I was covering Iran-Contra during the Reagan administration when [Peggy Noonan] was working for that president, in which we were funding a war illegally. We were trying to make a deal with the Iranians at the time. That was a pretty big damn scandal.

Brokaw seems to be employing a tactic common among has-been journalists these days. They seem to be afraid that any story seen as “bigger” than the stories they covered in their day somehow diminishes their life work, and therefore any suggestion to this effect must be smacked down immediately. 
So, in Brokaw’s opinion: 



The Department of Justice obtaining secret subpoenas naming reporters as an aider, abetter and co-conspirator and confiscating thousands of reporters’ phone records is not as serious as Abu Ghraib. 
The President’s inaction as our consulate was under attack in Libya, resulting in the death of four Americans at the hands of terrorists, and the Administration’s efforts to mislead the press and American people during a presidential campaign doesn’t rise to the level of Abu Ghraib.
The IRS using their power and intimidation tactics to discriminate against groups and individuals because of their political beliefs is not as significant as Abu Ghraib

Brokaw explained his rationale for making Abu Ghraib the be all and end all of presidential scandals: “Abu Ghraib was a big scandal and how it – no one was really held accountable for it.”

If accountability (or lack thereof) is the new standard for scandals, then Brokaw needs to re-calibrate his memory of Abu Ghraib and the comparison to the Obama scandals. Eleven soldiers were convicted of various charges relating to the Abu Ghraib incident. Meanwhile, every single government employee involved with Benghazi, the IRS, HHS fundraising, AP subpoenas and the Fox News/James Rosen subpoenas continues to cash their paychecks and are in line for full government pensions.

It has to be a beautiful thing being an approved member of the left-wing mainstream media. No matter how boring and unimaginative you are, no matter how many facts you get wrong — all your cronies are always right there to back you up.
Jonathan Alter is a tiresome, washed-up leftist whose latest book — the title of which I forget — isn’t selling so well and didn’t do so well in the facts department. In other words, it has been an embarrassment of Joe McGinniss

 proportions. And yet, over the past couple of weeks, Alter’s media comrades have attempted to come to his rescue to try to pump sales by any means necessary. 

Earlier this week, The Huffington Post and Politico’s Dylan Byers both humiliated themselves with their transparently desperate attempts to help Alter out. And now it appears to be the Washington Post’s turn.

You would think that the sting of humiliation that comes with whiffing on the four biggest stories of the Obama presidency might result in something of a wake-up call for the financially troubled Post. But, as if to prove you can’t teach an old Palace Guard new tricks, yesterday the Post poured its bandwidth and investigative resources into… The Tale of the Fox News Supply Closet.
You see, in order to sell his book — other than groveling like a punk
 — Alter salted his love letter to Obama with the kinds of tidbits he knew his fellow Obama-worshipping, Fox News-hating media pals would love: a bunch of nonsense about how Roger Ailes — one of the most successful network executives in history — is some kind of paranoid freak — you know, like Ted Turner. 
Among a litany of over a dozen falsehoods about Ailes, Alter claimed that the Fox News chief is so paranoid about wiretaps (doesn’t sound so paranoid today!) that he “once worked out of a supply closet.” Ailes outright denied the claim to Politico, saying, “It’s completely false and silly. In fact, I had no idea we have a supply closet.”

Well, that obviously set off alarm bells at the same astute Washington Post that missed the IRS, AP, Verizon, and Benghazi scandals. And the result Friday was an in-depth, source-driven, 500-word investigative report into whether or not there are supply closets within the Fox News HQ.
No, I am not kidding.  
And while it is fun to laugh this stuff off, you have to look at the The Matrix of what is really going on — which is pure character assassination. 
Unlike the shriveling Post, Roger Ailes and Fox News are not only wildly succeeding in a media environment where almost everyone else is faltering, but they have been acting like real journalists in the fine tradition of what we saw from the Post during Watergate.
Unlike the Post, Fox News is not whiffing at these scandals or guarding The State’s palace. Instead, they are digging, asking tough questions, pressing for answers, breaking news, and letting Power know that there is at least one real watchdog among the many lapdogs.
But all Fox News and Ailes get in return is to find themselves being investigated and held accountable by a mainstream media — that not only refuse to do the same to the current administration, but are trying to prevent that from happening to the administration.

On Wednesday, the New York Times ran a blistering investigative report revealing the Clinton Foundation as a nonprofit rife with crony capitalist conflicts of interest and multi-million dollar deficits despite raking in at least $492 million from 1997 to 2007.
In 2007 and 2008, the Clinton Foundation, which is soon to be renamed the “Bill, Hillary, & Chelsea Clinton Foundation,” ran a $40 million deficit. Last year, it ran a deficit of over $8 million despite the Foundation and two subsidiaries generating $214 million in revenues.

Hillary Clinton plans to relocate her offices to the Foundation’s Manhattan headquarters in the weeks to come. Former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Clinton planned to use the Foundation as a “launching pad into 2016,” a reference to her potential presidential run.


The nexus between Clinton Foundation donors, foreign governments, and corporate interests has long been a concern to government watchdog groups. As of 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised at least $46 million from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Brunei, Oman, and other foreign governments–the very governments Secretary of State Hillary Clinton eventually negotiated with. Wealthy foreign investors, like Saudi businessman Nasser Al-Rashid and Indian politician Amar Singh gave at least $1 million each.
Previous news accounts have chronicled how Clinton Foundation donors have profited. In 2004, New York developer Robert Congel donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Shortly thereafter, Sen. Hillary Clinton reportedly helped the developer bag millions in federal assistance for his mall project. Congel and Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson denied any crony pay-to-play connection.
The New York Times says the cronyism and conflicts have reached critical mass. “The Clinton Foundation had become a sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old Clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest,” reports the Times. “It ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in.”

Despite the apparent fiscal mismanagement, well-connected Clinton allies appear to be doing quite well. In 2009, Douglas Band, whom Clinton insiders describe as a “kind of surrogate son to Mr. Clinton,” co-founded Teneo, a consultancy that has since hired Hillary Clinton confidante and disgraced mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner spouse Huma Abedin. As the Times explains:

Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country’s top hedge funds….Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients.  The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encourage4d others to become new foundation donors….Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.

Among Teneo’s earliest clients was now-defunct MF Global, run by disgraced Obama bundler Jon S. Corzine.
The Times says Chelsea Clinton “became increasingly concerned” that Band and Teneo’s outside business were negatively impacting the Foundation.
Now, the Times says Hillary, Bill, and Chelsea Clinton are gearing up for a $250 million fundraising push as Hillary prepares to use the Foundation “as a base for her to home in on issues and build up a stable of trusted staff members who could form the core of a political campaign.”

Senate Democrats, including Senate Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray, are hiding their budget from their Republican colleagues, Breitbart News has learned exclusively. Murray did share her budget plan with her Democratic colleagues on Tuesday. 
The budget is scheduled for markup on Wednesday morning in committee, and senators are only expected to read opening statements at the hearing. It will not be until later on Wednesday that Republicans will be allowed to read the full budget proposal.
House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, on the other hand, shared his budget with his Democratic colleagues ahead of its release. It is unclear why Murray will not show the budget to Republicans ahead of the Wednesday morning markup hearing. A Murray spokesman has not immediately returned Breitbart News’ request for comment.


A Senate Republican aide told Breitbart News it is possible Senate Democrats will not share their budget ahead of its public release with their colleagues across the aisle because it embarrasses them.

“I think it speaks volumes about Senate Democrats’ fear of the American people that they must hide their plan until they’ve first had a chance to mislead the media about it,” the Senate GOP aide said in an email. “If they had courage and confidence their plan would be popular, they would have been on the Sunday shows and holding press conferences bragging about it, as did Chairman Ryan. Instead, it’s leaks and crickets.”
What is known about Murray’s budget is already proving problematic for the Democrats. The Hill reports the budget includes $1 trillion in tax hikes; Murray claims it contains about $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction between spending cuts and tax hikes. Murray’s budget also voids sequester cuts for the next nine years.
The Hill‘s Erik Wasson notes that “once the sequester cuts are turned off, Murray’s budget appears to reduce deficits by about $800 billion, using the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline.” He adds that Murray’s budget “does not contain net spending cuts with the sequester turned off.”
The Murray budget, according to Wasson, also includes “reconciliation instructions on tax reform, a move that could allow the budget, which cannot be filibustered in the Senate, to become the legislative vehicle for a tax reform bill.”
Murray is supposedly moving forward with that idea even though such a stunt is likely to spark massive Democratic Party infighting. Wasson notes that Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, “has opposed including the instructions in the budget, arguing it would tie his hands in tax reform.”
A spokesperson for Baucus has not responded to Breitbart News’ request for comment on how he feels about Murray’s move to include tax reform reconciliation in the budget package.

The curious case of former IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman’s 157 meetings at the White House is now more curious with the revelation that he attended meetings with Stephanie Cutter, Deputy Campaign Manager for President Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. While she technically served a stint as a White House advisor to the President, her role has always been that of an aggressive political operator. That their meetings coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative and Tea Party organizations raises many questions. 
Cutter may have had an official White House title, but she has always been a campaign operative. In 2010, she was named an Assistant to the President, charged with communications and outreach for ObamaCare. Presumably, it is in this role that she was in meetings with Shulman. This itself is odd, because as the IRS is tasked with implementing large swathes of ObamaCare, HHS is responsible for the public outreach and oversight of the public exchanges at the heart of the law. 
Cutter has not revealed the details of the meetings she attended with Shulman. We don’t know the exact dates they met, except that they must have coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative groups. We do know that the targeting began around the time that ObamaCare was enacted.


It is hard to imagine a meeting agenda that would include both the supposedly non-partisan IRS Commissioner Shulman and the hyper-partisan Cutter. The IRS is supposed to develop technocratic rules to implement ObamaCare. Communications and outreach ought not be part of their mission. Could it be that part of the White House’s outreach plan on ObamaCare was to silence opponents?

Cutter should be called to testify under oath before the House Oversight Committee to explain the details of these meetings. Her portfolio at the time, communications and outreach, imply a political component that would not ordinarily be tasked to the IRS Commissioner. What, exactly, were the nature of these meetings?

Pundits examining daily poll numbers to gauge the impact of current scandals on President Obama are missing a bigger trend. Even before recent revelations of misconduct by his Administration, Obama’s approval ratings have been declining throughout the year. On Monday, Rasmussen reported that 47% of likely voters approved of Obama’s handling of his job, while 51% disapproved. This is a massive 20 point negative swing since the first of the year. 
At the end of 2012, 57% of voters approved of Obama, while just 41% disapproved. He garnered good will from voters following his reelection in November. Yet, in just 6 months, the post-reelection honeymoon is clearly over. His approval rating is even lower than President Bush as this point in his second term. In June 2005, 48% of voters approved of the job Bush was doing, while 47% disapproved. As fatigue over the Iraq war grew and conservatives felt alienated, Bush’s approval ratings plummeted into the 30s by the time his term was complete. 
Obama’s approval ratings have remained steady because he has enjoyed the full support of his base. The current scandals engulfing his Administration, however, threaten that support. The expansive government spying revealed in the NSA leak is opposed by a considerable block of Obama’s core supporters. He had campaigned in 2008 against many Bush policies related to the global war on terror. Rather than reverse these policies, in many cases he has expanded them. 


As the full extent of the government spying becomes clearer, it, along with the other scandals, will likely erode some of Obama’s base support. The recent data from Rasmussen makes it clear this base support is all he has left. If part of that goes, Obama won’t just share Bush’s policies, but his approval ratings as well.

Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel noted on Friday that Barack Obama and the IRS have a new plan to target Tea Party groups in advance of the 2014 elections. 
During Thanksgiving week, the Treasury Department announced a proposal to limit the political activity of 501(c)(4) groups. The Obama Administration claimed that the plan was necessary to clarify confusing tax laws. 


The House Ways and Means Committee investigators believe that the proposal was designed by examining Tea Party group applications, figuring out exactly how they proceeded, then limiting those very actions in the new proposal, thus shutting them out of the political process.
House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp said, “The committee has reviewed thousands of tax exempt applications. The new regulation so closely mirrors the abused tea-party group applications, it leads me to question if this new proposed regulation is simply another form of targeting.”
Tea Party groups, just as other tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations, have to prove that the majority of their work is for “primary” social-welfare purpose if they want to keep their tax-exempt status. The primary purpose of most Tea party groups is illuminating for Americans the size of government and the erosion of the Constitution. They do so through nonpartisan voter guides, speakers forums, pamphlets, or voter-registration drives.

Now, however, the IRS is planning to recognize those very activities as “political activity,” not “social welfare,” thus rendering Tea Party groups unfit for 501(c)(4) status. 
Thus, the new proposal is not about clarifying tax laws but rather, as Dave Camp stated, “to put Tea Party groups out of business.”
The new rule only applies to 501(c)(4) groups. The League of Women Voters Education Fund, a Democratic stronghold, is registered as a 501(c)(3), considered a “charity” that is strictly limited regarding its political activity. That same organization claims on its website that it holds “candidate debates and forums,” and its “educational activities” include “understanding candidate views and ballot initiatives.”
The League can still issue its voter guides, registrations, and candidate forums. Any conservative social-welfare organization acting similarly will probably lose its tax-exempt status. And guess which groups are unaffected by the new rule, because they are 501(c)(5)s? 
As Strassel writes:
The same president who in May was “outraged” by the IRS’s actions now says it was all just some confusion over tax law (which his new rule fixes). He told Chris Matthews last week that the media had hyped what was a few poor IRS souls in Cincinnati who were “trying to streamline what is a difficult law to interpret… And they’ve got a list, and suddenly everybody’s outraged.”

A new Fox News poll shows Obama’s disapproval rating among registered voters has spiked to 51%, up from 45% last month. The poll shows an 8-point swing against Obama since April. Another shocking finding, undoubtedly linked to recent scandals, is that 68% of voters think the federal government is “out of control.”
Last month, 47% of voters approved of the job Obama was doing, while 45% disapproved. Disapproval of Obama has jumped 6 points since the latest scandal revelations. Among Independents, only 40% approve of Obama, while 52% disapprove. At this time 4 years ago, 60% of voters approved of Obama and only 30% disapproved. 
The scandals are also taking a toll on voters expectations for Obama’s second term. A plurality 49% believe his is a lame-duck, while 47% think he still has the ability to accomplish things in his final years in office. For the first time ever, also, less than a majority see Obama has “honest and trustworthy.” 


The poll also contained troubling news for embattled Attorney General Eric Holder. Just 28% of voters approve of Holder’s job performance, while 40% disapprove. It is surprising that almost 70% of voters even have an opinion of an Attorney General’s job performance. 

The particular nature of the current scandals, featuring cover-ups and abuses of power, are having a dramatic effect on how voters see the federal government. 68% believe the government is “out of control” and acting in a way that threatens civil liberties. Only 26% of voters report they don’t feel this way. Even a plurality of Democrats, 47-45, say the government is “out of control.”
These are no ordinary scandals and their consequences for Obama and the Democrats are only beginning to be felt.
The poll of 1,013 voters was conducted Saturday through Monday by Republican and Democrat polling firms.

Gregory Hicks was the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) of the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli during the September 11, 2012 assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. On Wednesday, he told the House Government Oversight Committee that the State Department went out of its way to keep Hicks from communicating with Congressman Jason Chaffetz and Oversight Committee staff without a State Department lawyer. 
The State Department seemingly made Hicks unavailable to the media, as the State Department switchboard had no information on Hicks’ whereabouts or contact information when Breitbart News asked for it in December and January. 
“I was instructed not to allow the RSO, the acting Deputy Chief of Mission, and myself to be interviewed by Congressman Chaffetz,” Hicks told Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). 


Chaffetz, along with a congressional delegation, visited the U.S. embassy in Tripoli following the attacks. 
“You had several Congressional delegations come to you from various places around the world. Has that ever happened, when lawyers get on the phone to you prior a congressional delegation, coming to investigate a time when we’ve had four Americans lose their lives?” Jordan questioned. “Have you ever had anyone tell you, ‘Don’t talk with the people from Congress coming to find out what’s at play?'”
“Never,” Hicks responded. He said that it was the first time such an incident ever occurred.

According to Hicks, one of the State lawyers on the phone call tried to accompany the members of the delegation and staff from the Oversight Committee to every meeting Hicks attended.
The State Department lawyers were excluded from a classified briefing Hicks attended with the delegation because the attorneys did not have clearance to attend. The incident provoked a phone call from then-Sec. Clinton’s State Department Counsel, Cheryl Mills.
“You had another conversation on the phone with Cheryl Mills. She’s the counselor for the Department of State. She’s the staff counsel to Secretary Clinton,” Jordan clarified. He asked, “Is that a pretty important position?” Hicks responded affirmatively on both accounts.
“She is the fixer for the Secretary of State. She’s as close as you can get to Secretary Clinton?” Jordan asked.
Hicks agreed, saying Mills was “very upset” about State lawyers being excluded from the classified briefing with Chaffetz and the rest of the delegation.
“She demanded a report on the visit,” Hicks said. Mills served as the Counselor and Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton since January of 2009.

Pundits examining daily poll numbers to gauge the impact of current scandals on President Obama are missing a bigger trend. Even before recent revelations of misconduct by his Administration, Obama’s approval ratings have been declining throughout the year. On Monday, Rasmussen reported that 47% of likely voters approved of Obama’s handling of his job, while 51% disapproved. This is a massive 20 point negative swing since the first of the year. 
At the end of 2012, 57% of voters approved of Obama, while just 41% disapproved. He garnered good will from voters following his reelection in November. Yet, in just 6 months, the post-reelection honeymoon is clearly over. His approval rating is even lower than President Bush as this point in his second term. In June 2005, 48% of voters approved of the job Bush was doing, while 47% disapproved. As fatigue over the Iraq war grew and conservatives felt alienated, Bush’s approval ratings plummeted into the 30s by the time his term was complete. 
Obama’s approval ratings have remained steady because he has enjoyed the full support of his base. The current scandals engulfing his Administration, however, threaten that support. The expansive government spying revealed in the NSA leak is opposed by a considerable block of Obama’s core supporters. He had campaigned in 2008 against many Bush policies related to the global war on terror. Rather than reverse these policies, in many cases he has expanded them. 


As the full extent of the government spying becomes clearer, it, along with the other scandals, will likely erode some of Obama’s base support. The recent data from Rasmussen makes it clear this base support is all he has left. If part of that goes, Obama won’t just share Bush’s policies, but his approval ratings as well.

On Saturday, the New York Times reported that Organizing for Action–the Obama for America presidential campaign structure recently re-organized as a 501 c 4 tax-exempt “issues advocacy” non-profit–is offering access to President Obama to any donors (individuals or corporations) who contribute $500,000 to the group. According to the Times, such contributions place “donors on a national advisory board for Mr. Obama’s group and [gives them] the privilege of attending quarterly meetings with the president, along with other meetings at the White House.” 
The Obama team’s brazen attempt to convert the assets of its political campaign into assets to promote the President’s political agenda and the electoral fortunes of his Democratic allies is unprecedented in American political history. It is clearly a violation of the intent of current federal election laws. 
The Obama team is betting that they’ve cleverly discovered a loophole, one that Republicans will fail to challenge legally. Even if the legality of this unprecedented and highly political attempt to circumvent the intent of federal election law is challenged, Obama’s team is further betting that their attorneys will argue their case successfully before regulators and judges. To date, the Obama tactic has caught Republicans flat footed.


Not only is the conversion of questionable legality, it also is in absolute contradiction to everything President Obama has ever said about the negative influence of large financial donations on the political process in America. In 2010, for instance, when the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision paved the way for SuperPACs that could accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations alike, President Obama was one of the Court’s harshest critics. But the President’s opinion on the evils of unlimited donations to political organizations–especially those that pretend to be “issues advocacy” groups–appears to have changed in the three years since that decision.
The expensive and valuable assets of Obama for America were quickly made available to Organizing for Action, which has already begun to use them extensively in Obama’s “permanent campaign,” hosting State of the Union listening parties and bombarding the internet with pro gun control emails. It is unclear if the new Organizing for Action entity has paid fair market value–or anything at all, for that matter–to the old Obama for America organization for these assets.
The assets include a sophisticated state-of-the-art analytics driven data base that holds extensive information on each of 2 million Obama for America volunteers, 17 million email subscribers,  22 million Twitter followers, and virtually every registered voter in the country. These assets will deployed by the same management team that ran Obama for America, headed up by former campaign manager Jim Messina. At Organizing for Action, Messina will use the technological infrastructure developed over several years at Obama for America to instantaneously deliver communications in multiple formats (email, text, facebook, tweets) using the same methodology to the same vast audience that received those very similar messages during President Obama’s presidential campaigns.

“Issues advocacy” social welfare non-profit groups organized under Section 501 c 4 of the Internal Revenue Service code, which Organizing for Action claims to be, are not subject to the same federal election laws that prohibit corporate donations and limit individual contributions to political candidates to $2,600 per election. In its new iteration, the organization that was until January 17, 2013 known as Obama for America and was governed by these strict campaign laws can now accept unlimited donations from both corporations and individuals. Better yet, it is not required to publicly disclose the names of these donors.

All this is happening while the Organizing for Action management team–and the Obama administration–are pretending and saying out loud with a straight face that it is not a political organization. In reality, it is nothing but a political organization, and its immediate purpose is to advance the President’s second term agenda and defeat Republican House and Senate candidates in 2014. With that accomplished, and Democrats in control of both the House and Senate there will be nothing to stop President Obama and his radical left wing agenda.
Even MSNBC’s Chuck Todd found the cash for access scheme unpalatable. “This just looks bad,” Todd said on Monday. “It looks,” Todd said “like the White House is selling access.It’s the definition of selling access. If you believe money has a strangle hold over the entire political system this is ceding the moral high ground.”
Todd is right. It looks bad because it is bad.
Bob Edgar, the president of the usually liberal advocacy group, Common Cause, agrees with Todd. “It just smells. The president is setting a very bad model setting up this organization,”he said.
White House press secretary Jay Carney tried to sell the administration line that Organizing for Action is just like any other 501 c 4, and this sort of thing is done all the time to the usually compliant White House press corps on Monday, but most of them could barely withhold their incredulity at Carney’s claims. Indeed, Carney became so frustrated at their skepticism that he abruptly curtailed the normal press briefing and walked off unceremoniously as unanswered questioned were left hanging in the air.

The New York Times has vindicated the news sense of Andrew Breitbart and years of Breitbart News coverage of the Pigford scandal with a front page, above the fold blockbuster of investigative journalism that adds new details about the fraud in the USDA farmer settlements and the key role that Barack Obama has played in Pigford dating back to his days as a Senator.
Andrew Breitbart worked tirelessly to expose the Pigford fraud scheme only to have the clear evidence of manipulation by politicians and plaintiff lawyers ignored by the mainstream media. The story involved politicians and lawyers hijacking a lawsuit by black farmers against the USDA designed to make up for years of discrimination and turning it into a multi-billion dollar fraud where people claiming to have ‘attempted to farm’ were able to collect $50,000 checks with no proof. The Obama administration expanded the program for Native Americans, Hispanics, and women, using the same low “attempted to farm” standard that invited massive, undetectable fraud.  
The Times piece was written by a team led by Sharon LaFraniere, who worked on the story for months and according to the article “was based on thousands of pages of court and confidential government documents, as well as interviews with dozens of claimants, lawyers, former and current government officials and others involved in the cases over the past 14 years.”


Here are some highlights from the article, including a number of details not previously reported:
Questionable Legal Moves
The Times story gives a great deal of detail about how the Obama administration certified its own settlement in the cases of the Native American, women, and Hispanic farmer settlements, sidestepping both the legal system ad Congress. Breitbart News has reported on the Obama administration’s expansion of Pigford previously, but the Times brought shocking new information to light. 

For one thing, there were only a total of 91 plaintiffs actually filing suit; 10 women and 81 Latinos. This is a very small number and it certainly would have been possible to handle any actual discrimination claims on a case-by-case basis. However, the Times points out that the government was very skeptical even about those cases. 

“Some of these folks have never made a loan payment in their entire history with U.S.D.A.,” Lisa A. Olson, the lead government litigator against the 81 Hispanic plaintiffs, told Judge Robertson in August 2009. “There may even be folks who are under criminal investigation.”

The Obama Administration made a choice to create a settlement mechanism on their own. The Times says “the Obama administration’s political appointees at the Justice and Agriculture Departments engineered a stunning turnabout: they committed $1.33 billion to compensate not just the 91 plaintiffs but thousands of Hispanic and female farmers who had never claimed bias in court.”
With pressure mounting from some in Congress, “The Obama administration made the ‘legally questionable’ decision to sidestep Congress and pay the woman and Hispanic farmer claims out of a special Treasury Department fund known as The Judgment Fund. “
The small number of actual cases is also significant because of the disparity in the number of actual suits and the number of claims filed so far in the cases; only ten women were actually filing suit but an incredible 24,000 have filed to get $50,000 under the settlement still active at the FarmerClaims.gov website.
Pigford Was About Buying Votes

Even the New York Times has trouble getting Department of Justice officials to speak on record on the story. The Times says, “Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West, who supervised the civil division and oversaw the handling of the cases, canceled an interview. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. also declined to comment.”
This 2008 article from the San Francisco Chronicle profiles Tony West, who was then the California finance co-chair for the Obama campaign and is described as an “Obama power broker.” West, a deep Obama campaign insider, oversaw the settlements for the Obama administration.
This is another indication that the Pigford scandal was about vote buying and elections for the politicians involved. Much of the original Pigford corruption traces to Arkansas. That was no accident but was at the behest of the man who was President when the first Pigford settlement was designed, Bill Clinton. From the Times:

Mr. Clinton asked Carol Willis, then a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee who was known for his expertise in black voter turnout, to get involved. Mr. Willis said the president wanted to make sure his home state, Arkansas, benefited.

During the 2008 elections, the Times details how the Obama administration used Pigford for election purposes. From the Times:

..legislators from both parties, including Mr. Obama as a senator in 2007, sponsored bills to grant the late filers relief.
Mr. Boyd said Mr. Obama’s support led him to throw the backing of his 109,000-member black farmers’ association behind the Obama presidential primary campaign. Hilary Shelton, the N.A.A.C.P.’s chief lobbyist, said Mr. Obama’s stance helped establish him as a defender of the concerns of rural African-American communities.

And the Times makes it clear that others felt the settlements were buying off special interests. A professor from U.C. Berkley testified for the government that there was no pattern of discrimination by the USDA against Native American farmers. 

Professor Rausser was astounded when, with both sides gearing up for trial in late 2009, the government began settlement negotiations. “If they had gone to trial, the government would have prevailed,” he said.
“It was just a joke,” he added. “I was so disgusted. It was simply buying the support of the Native-Americans.”

Obama had a bad 2013 but Huff Post’s Sam Stein wants to know why. Among the answers he comes up with is the White House’s own arrogance.
Stein reviews a series of reasons why 2013 broke bad for the President. The Obamacare rollout gets top billing and unexpected events in Newtown and Syria also make the list. But at least a few people see the source of the problem as coming not from outside the White House but within it:



Mike Lux, who served as Obama’s liaison to the progressive community
during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the
administration since, argued that self-assuredness played a damaging
role, preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon.
When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers
of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a
Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination, the advice was heard, but not
necessarily heeded.  

“I feel like the White House goes it alone too much,” said Lux. “In
advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem, it doesn’t
seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion
in the party and with progressive allies.” 

A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: “These guys are
stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn’t smell,
that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt
them.”

Stein concludes that the hinge point of the bad year was Obamacare. That was the place where false promises and foreseeable problems all rushed together in a sickening crunch for the administration. After the government shutdown in October, the Republicans were polling badly and Obamacare was trending up despite the fact that the site did not work at all. Two months later, with the scope of their failure made clear, all of those gains have been reversed and then some.

House Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) has called on President Barack Obama to fire John Podesta as his senior adviser in the wake of startling revelations about comments he has made.
In an interview with Politico for a Politico Magazine profile, Podesta compared the Republican Party to the Jonestown cult that Jim Jones led in the 1970s, of which 900 members committed mass suicide via cyanide poisoning in 1978.
“They [the Obama administration] need to focus on executive action given that they are facing a second term against a cult worthy of Jonestown in charge of one of the houses of Congress,” Podesta said of what the administration must do in dealing with the Republican controlled House.


Scalise thinks such comments should be a fireable offense. He called on Obama to take action and terminate Podesta’s employment right away.

“It’s disgraceful and telling that President Obama’s new Counselor is not only comparing the Republican Party to a cult that murdered those who disagreed with them, but is also using that comparison as an argument in support of shredding the Constitution and governing like a third-world dictator,” Scalise said in a statement provided to Breitbart News. “The American people will not stand by and allow the Obama White House to destroy the checks-and-balances defined in the Constitution that are critical to a working democracy, and neither will Congress!” 
“The American people elected a divided government in Washington, and the Obama Administration would do well to respect that fact instead of undermining the will of the American people at every turn,” he continued. “President Obama ran to change the tone in Washington, and it’s time for him to live up to that promise by relieving Mr. Podesta of his official duties immediately.”
Scalise is not the only Republican upset about Podesta’s rhetoric. Rory Cooper, the spokesman for House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), said in a statement provided to Breitbart News that such comments make it difficult for House Republicans to work with the administration.
“This type of appalling and inflammatory rhetoric is a very troubling sign of how this White House plans to govern over the next three years,” Cooper said.
Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), a freshman conservative member, said in a statement provided to Breitbart News that the American people should not accept Podesta’s or the White House’s arguments for executive orders and exceeding new authority on the administration’s behalf.
“Faced with an imploding health care law built on a façade of deception, ruling class leftists like John Podesta resort to vitriolic attacks against, and demonization of, their political opponents,” DeSantis said. “This seems like an entirely baseless excuse for the President to act unilaterally in ways that exceed his constitutional authority.”

The liberal media have their knives out for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) after his textbook cross-examination of Secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel at the latter’s confirmation hearing Jan. 31. Jane Mayer of the New Yorker seized on a speech Cruz gave three years ago in which he asserted that when he was at Harvard Law School, shortly after Barack Obama, there were twelve Marxists on the faculty and one Republican.
That, Mayer alleges, is evidence of Cruz’s innate McCarthyism–and hence, she implies, ought to discredit Cruz’s inquiries into Hagel’s beliefs and financial backing. That’s rich coming from the New Yorker‘s resident Koch-obsessive, who launched a McCarthyist assault on the Tea Party in 2010, asserting it was mere Astroturf for the “billionaire Koch brothers’ war against Obama,” and demanding more scrutiny of the Kochs’ ties to it.


Her current campaign against Cruz is a pure political vendetta–a fact she does not even try to deny. In her latest offering, she defends her sudden interest in the 2010 speech as follows: “…Cruz’s hostile questioning of Obama’s nominee for Defense Secretary, Chuck Hagel, and insinuations about Hagel’s loyalties had provided a fresh context for looking more closely at the nature of the accusations he has leveled at political opponents.” 
In terms of accusations against one’s opponents, it’s hard to top Mayer’s suggestion that millions of conservative Americans are paid stooges–or Obama’s numerous attacks on opponents using false accusations and innuendo. Remember the doctors who cut out kids’ tonsils for no reason except greed? The Republican presidential nominee who just might be a felon, and may have killed a man’s wife? Few complaints from Mayer there.
In fact, Mayer gave positive coverage to the anti-Bain Capital ads that ran against Romney in Ohio. In a post-election article on Nov. 19, 2012, “Seeing Spots,” Mayer noted that the ad about a worker’s dead wife was inaccurate. She nonetheless celebrated the company that made it for another ad in the series, “Stage,” which helped “to float the image of Romney as a coldhearted fat cat” and gave Obama a decisive advantage in the polls.

Cruz was absolutely correct that there were, and are, many radicals on Harvard Law’s faculty, and few Republicans. Give the Texan a technical for hyperbole: he may have over-counted the Communist revolutionaries, and undercounted the Republicans. But Mayer turns to two dubious sources to attack Cruz’s assertion. One is Charles Fried, the former Reagan solicitor general; the other is critical legal studies guru Duncan Kennedy.
Fried was a Republican. He is far to the left of that party today. In 2008, Fried voted for Barack Obama. In 2011, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he declared that Obamacare’s individual mandate was constitutional–even agreeing that it would be constitutional for Congress to pass a law forcing people to buy vegetables or buy a gym membership. Though it upheld Obamacare, the Supreme Court rejected that argument. 
As for Kennedy, he is not a Communist, and says he never “believed in the overthrow of the U.S. Government.” Yet he believes in the undoing of much that sustains our system. of laws and institutions. For example, when I was a student, he once told me that the solution to the problem of illegal immigration from Mexico was to end the border entirely, i.e. to be one country. That would have rather radical implications for our government.
One of Kennedy’s colleagues, Roberto Unger, is a fellow member of the critical legal studies movement. He is not a Communist, but a self-described leftist revolutionary nonetheless. I took two classes with Unger while I was an undergraduate, and he attacked the American “cult of the Constitution,” arguing that the world’s present countries with a new system in which each represented a different (leftist) “moral” vision.
Several members of Harvard Law’s faculty espouse other radical left ideas. They are not card-carrying Communists, but some do see themselves as proponents of different forms of Marxist thought, and would like to see revolutionary changes in both the U.S. government and the international order. Saul Alinsky, too, was not a Communist–but he believed in the radical disruption of our political system and the redistribution of wealth.
Those views are distinguishable from formal Communism only by virtue of the fact that they do not call for a proletarian dictatorship. Our contemporary “social democrats” wish to impose such revolutionary changes through our present political system, transforming our Constitution and our society through democratic means. There are far more of such radical professors at Harvard Law School than those who defend conservative thought.
The media’s crusade against Cruz proves that in Obama’s America, it is considered far worse to accuse someone of being a Marxist than to be one. The same journalists who demand full disclosure of every penny that conservative financiers might have put into lobbying or politics now mock Cruz’s attempt to probe Hagel’s financial disclosures–or the lack thereof, since Hagel has refused to supply much of the requested information.
It is certainly of interest that a man who would lead the Pentagon would have close ties to an organization funded by the Saudi government, the Hariri family, and foreign arms dealers, among others. Had Hagel been chairman of Americans for Prosperity, Mayer would no doubt be clamoring for a full-scale investigation into the Kochs. Instead, she is leading a smear campaign against Cruz, one of the few in D.C. actually doing his job.

On Friday morning, President Barack Obama defended his administration’s massive telephone records surveillance programs by explaining that “every member of Congress has been briefed on this program.”

There’s only one problem: both Republican and Democrat Congresspeople say that isn’t true. On Friday afternoon, the press office for Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), one of the authors of the Patriot Act, tweeted, “Obama’s claim that ‘every Member of Congress’ was briefed is FALSE.”


It wasn’t just Sensenbrenner. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said that only certain members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees had been told about the program, and he only knew about it because he received “special permission” to be briefed after hearing about it through the grapevine. “I knew about the program,” he said on MSNBC, “because I specifically sought it out. It’s not something that’s briefed outside the Intelligence Committee.” Merkley added that the administration had ignored the law. “Clearly the administration has not followed what an ordinary person would consider to be the standard of the law here,” he said. 

Merkely summed up: “when the president says all members of Congress were briefed … well, I think a very small number of Senators in Congress had full details on these programs.”
Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) said he only knew about the program after asking for a briefing under “classified circumstances.” The “average member,” he said, had no access to this information. “They don’t receive this kind of briefing.”
Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said they had not been briefed on the phone surveillance program, either. “Not quite!” Rep. Billy Long (R-LA) tweeted after hearing about Obama’s claim.
Obama’s claim was not a slip of the tongue. On Friday, Obama’s White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, “In December of 2009 and in February of 2011, the Department of Justice and the intelligence community provided a document to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to be made available to all members of the House and Senate, describing the classified uses of Section 215 in detail.”

After President Obama’s second inaugural address, Van Jones, former Obama White House “green jobs” czar, praised the speech, calling it “Djobama Unchained” (after the controversial movie Django Unchained, about a freed slave taking revenge). On Wednesday night, during a lecture at Loyola University Chicago, I asked Jones what he meant. He explained that while President Obama is not a socialist, he is, in fact, a “communitarian.”

After a long recapping of the first four years of the Obama’s presidency, Jones elaborated:

It’s very interesting to see him now, actually, free.

Watching this man for four years, for everything he’s done to try to reach out to the other side, and frankly neglect his base, has just been called socialism, and just been called divisive, no matter what he does.
I was happy to see him unleashed and unchained and just be able to speak from his heart.

And what he said was, similar to what I’ve been saying, there is a “New Patriotism.”

(The rest of Jones’s answer is here.)
Jones compared the president’s address to that of Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and recommended that the theater full of college students read Reagan’s “powerful” and “strong,” inaugurals, which he said were “rooted in American tradition and values,” but “unabashedly” and “unapologetically conservative.”

Following Jones’s comparison of President Obama to Ronald Reagan, the “unabashedly conservative” president, I pressed Jones further for some insight into what and who President Obama really is.
Jones replied: “He is a communitarian.” He then elaborated briefly: “I mean you always have individualism, communitarianism, as a part of the, American story, and I think we’ve overbalanced the individualistic direction and I think he’s trying to rebalance toward communitarianism.”
Later, when asked (off tape) to define “communitarian,” Jones was unable to answer or to point toward any source for a definition. He said there wasn’t really a way to look up “communitarianism.” 
He did reiterate, however, that he saw communitarianism as a counterbalance to libertarianism, which he equated to “individualism.”

Jones declined an interview with Breitbart News following the lecture.

That, Mayer alleges, is evidence of Cruz’s innate McCarthyism–and hence, she implies, ought to discredit Cruz’s inquiries into Hagel’s beliefs and financial backing. That’s rich coming from the New Yorker‘s resident Koch-obsessive, who launched a McCarthyist assault on the Tea Party in 2010, asserting it was mere Astroturf for the “billionaire Koch brothers’ war against Obama,” and demanding more scrutiny of the Kochs’ ties to it.


Her current campaign against Cruz is a pure political vendetta–a fact she does not even try to deny. In her latest offering, she defends her sudden interest in the 2010 speech as follows: “…Cruz’s hostile questioning of Obama’s nominee for Defense Secretary, Chuck Hagel, and insinuations about Hagel’s loyalties had provided a fresh context for looking more closely at the nature of the accusations he has leveled at political opponents.” 
In terms of accusations against one’s opponents, it’s hard to top Mayer’s suggestion that millions of conservative Americans are paid stooges–or Obama’s numerous attacks on opponents using false accusations and innuendo. Remember the doctors who cut out kids’ tonsils for no reason except greed? The Republican presidential nominee who just might be a felon, and may have killed a man’s wife? Few complaints from Mayer there.
In fact, Mayer gave positive coverage to the anti-Bain Capital ads that ran against Romney in Ohio. In a post-election article on Nov. 19, 2012, “Seeing Spots,” Mayer noted that the ad about a worker’s dead wife was inaccurate. She nonetheless celebrated the company that made it for another ad in the series, “Stage,” which helped “to float the image of Romney as a coldhearted fat cat” and gave Obama a decisive advantage in the polls.

Cruz was absolutely correct that there were, and are, many radicals on Harvard Law’s faculty, and few Republicans. Give the Texan a technical for hyperbole: he may have over-counted the Communist revolutionaries, and undercounted the Republicans. But Mayer turns to two dubious sources to attack Cruz’s assertion. One is Charles Fried, the former Reagan solicitor general; the other is critical legal studies guru Duncan Kennedy.
Fried was a Republican. He is far to the left of that party today. In 2008, Fried voted for Barack Obama. In 2011, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he declared that Obamacare’s individual mandate was constitutional–even agreeing that it would be constitutional for Congress to pass a law forcing people to buy vegetables or buy a gym membership. Though it upheld Obamacare, the Supreme Court rejected that argument. 
As for Kennedy, he is not a Communist, and says he never “believed in the overthrow of the U.S. Government.” Yet he believes in the undoing of much that sustains our system. of laws and institutions. For example, when I was a student, he once told me that the solution to the problem of illegal immigration from Mexico was to end the border entirely, i.e. to be one country. That would have rather radical implications for our government.
One of Kennedy’s colleagues, Roberto Unger, is a fellow member of the critical legal studies movement. He is not a Communist, but a self-described leftist revolutionary nonetheless. I took two classes with Unger while I was an undergraduate, and he attacked the American “cult of the Constitution,” arguing that the world’s present countries with a new system in which each represented a different (leftist) “moral” vision.
Several members of Harvard Law’s faculty espouse other radical left ideas. They are not card-carrying Communists, but some do see themselves as proponents of different forms of Marxist thought, and would like to see revolutionary changes in both the U.S. government and the international order. Saul Alinsky, too, was not a Communist–but he believed in the radical disruption of our political system and the redistribution of wealth.
Those views are distinguishable from formal Communism only by virtue of the fact that they do not call for a proletarian dictatorship. Our contemporary “social democrats” wish to impose such revolutionary changes through our present political system, transforming our Constitution and our society through democratic means. There are far more of such radical professors at Harvard Law School than those who defend conservative thought.
The media’s crusade against Cruz proves that in Obama’s America, it is considered far worse to accuse someone of being a Marxist than to be one. The same journalists who demand full disclosure of every penny that conservative financiers might have put into lobbying or politics now mock Cruz’s attempt to probe Hagel’s financial disclosures–or the lack thereof, since Hagel has refused to supply much of the requested information.
It is certainly of interest that a man who would lead the Pentagon would have close ties to an organization funded by the Saudi government, the Hariri family, and foreign arms dealers, among others. Had Hagel been chairman of Americans for Prosperity, Mayer would no doubt be clamoring for a full-scale investigation into the Kochs. Instead, she is leading a smear campaign against Cruz, one of the few in D.C. actually doing his job.

Joseph Curl noted in his Sunday column in the Washington Times that many ordinary Americans around the country were upset with the extravagant lifestyles President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and their families are living while most Americans suffer from a still-disastrous economy.
“President Obama had another tough week in a second term filled with bad news and blunders — and he’s only 10 weeks in,” Curl wrote. “While the White House suddenly decided to drop its budget Friday in an effort to control the news, there was no covering up the disastrous jobless numbers: 90 million Americans out of the workforce, the highest level since 1979; another 663,000 joining the ranks of the long-term unemployed; a measly 88,000 jobs ‘created.'”
Curl points out though that, while those economic numbers are catastrophic for this administration, “what seems stuck in the craw of a lot of you readers out there” was his column from the week before “on the Obamas’ 1 percent lifestyle — the endless ski and beach vacations for the couple and their daughters, Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s nights in London and Paris that cost you more than $1 million, even the president’s 118th round of golf while in office.”


Most mainstream media outlets completely ignored the report, first broken by Breitbart News, that first daughters Sasha and Malia were vacationing in the Bahamas at the luxurious Atlantis resort for Spring Break. The story starkly exemplified that President Obama decided Secret Service should be used for that vacation and not for ordinary kids’ tours of the White House. To top matters off, for what Curl calls the Obama family’s “royal lifestyle,” Sasha and Malia sprung from the Bahamas to ritzy Sun Valley, Idaho mid-Spring Break week to get in some skiing before heading back to school.

Curl quoted many of his readers, who wrote to him expressing outrage at the way the first family handles themselves–and taxpayer resources–while most other Americans continue hurting economically.
Curl said, too, that Obama’s decision this past week “to forgo 5 percent of his salary” is not any “coincidence.”

First Lady Michelle Obama has raised eyebrows by likening life in the White House to life in a “really nice prison.” Ms. Obama was speaking at the African First Ladies Summit in Tanzania, where she is traveling with President Barack Obama and their daughters. Former First Lady Laura Bush was also in attendance.
It was not the first time that Ms. Obama has complained about life in the White House–which has afforded her the opportunity to travel with her husband on a $60-$100 million trip to Africa, as well as to vacation in Spain and other exotic locales with a large entourage, all the while enjoying Secret Service protection.


President Obama himself has expressed similar sentiments. A mere two weeks after taking office in 2009, he and Ms. Obama escaped to a school in Washington, D.C., explaining: “We were just tired of being in the White House.” The president also plays golf with great frequency, and takes many vacations–alone and with family.

Ms. Obama’s remarks were particularly striking, coming just days after she and her children joined President Obama on a tour of the Robben Island prison facility where Nelson Mandela had been held for two decades. Following the visit, President Obama said that he and his family were “deeply humbled” by their experience.
In his 2012 book The Amateur: Barack Obama in the White House, author Ed Klein said of Obama: “”We come to know a strange kind of politician, one who derives no joy from the cut and thrust of politics, but who clings to the narcissistic life of the presidency.” 
It is responsibility, not just politics, that Obama avoids.
Obama’s Africa tour sums up his absentee presidency perfectly. He tries to emulate world figures like Nelson Mandela; he is driven in a motorcade down Barack Obama Drive in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; he gives speeches declaring that he will not meddle in African affairs, as if Libya–and the past four years–never happened.
And yet, even as he takes his family on tours of historic sites and extols the virtues of the African Union, a member of that Union–Egypt–is being rocked by the largest political demonstrations in the history of the world, Obama has had little to say. 
The Obamas certainly love the perks of the presidency. But they hate the office.

Eight months into President George W. Bush’s second term, the Washington Post wrote that Bush’s frequent trips to his Texas ranch symbolized “a lackadaisical approach to the world’s most important day job” and gleefully noted that Bush was intent on setting the record for being on “vacation”–or away from Washington, D.C.–for the most number of days of any president. 
But when President Barack Obama vacations in Hawaii, sets up a fantasy golf vacation for himself with Butch Harmon and Tiger Woods, averages more than a vacation a month in 2013 while purporting to be a man of the people and demanding the rich pay their fair share, and playing sequester politics by shutting down White House tours, the mainstream media is silent. 
And while Bush spent more time outside of Washington than Obama, it is also worth nothing that nearly all of Bush’s vacations were trips back to his Texas ranch or family vacation homes in Maine. 


The Post, in 2005, conceded that Bush’s vacations–unlike Obama’s–were not lavish and he did not “make time for fun.”

“Bush rarely takes the type of vacation one would consider exotic — or, to some, even appealing,” the Post wrote. “His notion of relaxation is chopping cedar on his ranch or mountain biking through rough terrain, all in 100-degree-plus temperatures in dusty Texas where crickets are known to roast on the summer pavement. He seems to relish the idea of exposing aides and reporters to the hothouse environment.”
Obama, on the other hand, has traveled to Hawaii every winter. The Obama daughters are vacationing at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas this week with a full Secret Service detail, as Breitbart News reported, even as the White House claimed they could not afford to pay Secret Service agents to continue the popular White House tours for other students who are on their spring vacations in Washington, D.C. 
The Obamas have gone to Martha’s Vineyard multiple times while the country was in recession and Americans were struggling to find jobs. Michelle Obama has taken a whirlwind trip to Spain and a ski trip to Aspen. 
Obama took 13 vacations in his first term, which spanned all or part of 83 days. But they have been much more lavish than Bush’s. His annual vacations to Hawaii alone have cost taxpayers at least $20 million during his first term. In 2011 alone, Michelle Obama may have cost taxpayers $10 million on vacations herself. Obama’s fantasy golf outing this year cost local law enforcement in Florida a reported $78, 205. 
Bush was content to work from home during his vacations. And for doing so, the mainstream media tagged him as lazy and disinterested. The Obamas gallivant around, making plenty of “time for fun,” and the mainstream media does not call them out for wasting taxpayer dollars or even for the terrible “optics.”

It has to be a beautiful thing being an approved member of the left-wing mainstream media. No matter how boring and unimaginative you are, no matter how many facts you get wrong — all your cronies are always right there to back you up.
Jonathan Alter is a tiresome, washed-up leftist whose latest book — the title of which I forget — isn’t selling so well and didn’t do so well in the facts department. In other words, it has been an embarrassment of Joe McGinniss

 proportions. And yet, over the past couple of weeks, Alter’s media comrades have attempted to come to his rescue to try to pump sales by any means necessary. 

Earlier this week, The Huffington Post and Politico’s Dylan Byers both humiliated themselves with their transparently desperate attempts to help Alter out. And now it appears to be the Washington Post’s turn.

You would think that the sting of humiliation that comes with whiffing on the four biggest stories of the Obama presidency might result in something of a wake-up call for the financially troubled Post. But, as if to prove you can’t teach an old Palace Guard new tricks, yesterday the Post poured its bandwidth and investigative resources into… The Tale of the Fox News Supply Closet.
You see, in order to sell his book — other than groveling like a punk
 — Alter salted his love letter to Obama with the kinds of tidbits he knew his fellow Obama-worshipping, Fox News-hating media pals would love: a bunch of nonsense about how Roger Ailes — one of the most successful network executives in history — is some kind of paranoid freak — you know, like Ted Turner. 
Among a litany of over a dozen falsehoods about Ailes, Alter claimed that the Fox News chief is so paranoid about wiretaps (doesn’t sound so paranoid today!) that he “once worked out of a supply closet.” Ailes outright denied the claim to Politico, saying, “It’s completely false and silly. In fact, I had no idea we have a supply closet.”

Well, that obviously set off alarm bells at the same astute Washington Post that missed the IRS, AP, Verizon, and Benghazi scandals. And the result Friday was an in-depth, source-driven, 500-word investigative report into whether or not there are supply closets within the Fox News HQ.
No, I am not kidding.  
And while it is fun to laugh this stuff off, you have to look at the The Matrix of what is really going on — which is pure character assassination. 
Unlike the shriveling Post, Roger Ailes and Fox News are not only wildly succeeding in a media environment where almost everyone else is faltering, but they have been acting like real journalists in the fine tradition of what we saw from the Post during Watergate.
Unlike the Post, Fox News is not whiffing at these scandals or guarding The State’s palace. Instead, they are digging, asking tough questions, pressing for answers, breaking news, and letting Power know that there is at least one real watchdog among the many lapdogs.
But all Fox News and Ailes get in return is to find themselves being investigated and held accountable by a mainstream media — that not only refuse to do the same to the current administration, but are trying to prevent that from happening to the administration.

The Obama-Hagel Pentagon is trying to minimize Breitbart News’ blockbuster story last week of top brass meeting with anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein, whom we reported calls Christians “monsters” imposing a “rapacious reign of theocratic terror” and says sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in the military an act of “sedition and treason” that must be punished. 
The Pentagon sent out an email suggesting the Apr. 23 meeting with Weinstein in the Pentagon was a one-time event, saying only, “Weinstein requested, and was granted, a meeting at the Pentagon [on] April 23, with the Air Force Judge Advocate General and others, to include the Deputy Chief of Chaplains, to express his concerns of religious issues in the military.”  


However, this was not a single meeting. Instead it was part of a relationship that began one month after Barack Obama was sworn in as president. And it goes much higher up the military food chain than was reported last week: Weinstein met with a four-star general who was the highest-ranking officer in the United States Air Force. 
The New York Times reported on Mar. 1, 2009, in a story entitled, “Questions Raised Anew About Religion in Military,” that Weinstein met with the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Norton Schwarz, on Feb. 24, 2009. The story noted this was the first time Weinstein and his Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) had “gotten an audience with a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.”
Weinstein had sued the Defense Department during the Bush administration as part of his anti-Christian crusade, so Pentagon top brass knew exactly who he was and what he was about when the new Obama administration met with him in 2009. This means he had been fully-vetted when the Obama-Hagel Defense Department decided to meet with him again on Apr. 23, 2013, to discuss how to stop evangelizing (that is, Christian proselytizing) within the military. 

The Bush administration had fought Weinstein, saying that any instances of senior officers pressuring subordinates on religious matters were “not systematic problems, but isolated instances.” And biblical Christians fully object to any coercion, since evangelism is about people embracing the Christian faith wholeheartedly and sincerely, which no person could ever force upon another. It’s a matter of the heart, between every human being and their creator. 
By contrast, while the Bush administration fought Weinstein, the Obama administration has embraced this anti-Christian activist. 
The NYT story gives a laundry list of Weinstein and MRFF’s grievances against the Defense Department during the Bush administration, including a, “ceremony that began and ended with a Christian prayer…the appearance of uniformed officers at religious events, [and] displays of crucifixes at military chapels…”.
The story indicates that “Christian prayers” are prayers offered “in Jesus’ name.” It goes without saying that whenever anyone prays, they pray according to their own religious faith. (For example, you’re not likely to find a Muslim imam offering a Jewish prayer.) It’s just as common to hear a Christian mention Jesus in a prayer as it is to find a Muslim invoking the name of Mohammed. 
It’s also no surprise that troops might be wearing their uniforms when they attend church services. Again, the Constitution does not forbid such things, since those troops have the right to peacefully practice and express their personal faith just like any other American. 
But the fact that Weinstein has become an unpaid advisor to the Obama-Hagel Pentagon is evidence of how hostile an environment parts of the Defense Department are becoming to Christian service members under this administration, and possibly devout adherents of other peaceful faiths as well. 
Article I of the Constitution empowers Congress to set the rules of conduct and discipline within the military, and Congress must do so now to protect the rights of our troops to live and share their faith.

In a classic tale illustrating the “law of unintended consequences,” a new report concludes that President Barack Obama’s $3 billion “Cash for Clunkers” taxpayer-funded boondoggle artificially drove car prices up, not down, and unleashed an “environmental nightmare” through shredding, not recycling, many of the 690,000 cars people traded in for an up to $4,500 car credit.
In 2009, Mr. Obama proudly declared that his Cash for Clunkers program, officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), was a stunning success.  “There were skeptics who weren’t sure that this ‘Cash for Clunkers’ program would work,” said Mr. Obama. “But I’m happy to report that it has succeeded well beyond our expectations and all expectations, and we’re already seeing a dramatic increase in showroom traffic at local car dealers…So I’m very pleased with the progress that’s been made in the House today on the “Cash for Clunkers” program.” 


But as Yahoo News notes, the program’s decision to shred, not recycle, many of the trade-in vehicles unleashed an “environmental nightmare”: 


Shredding vehicles results in its own environmental nightmare. For each ton of metal produced by a shredding facility, roughly 500 pounds of “shredding residue” is also produced, which includes polyurethane foams, metal oxides, glass and dirt. All totaled, about 4.5 million tons of that residue is already produced on average every year. Where does it go? Right into a landfill.
E Magazine states recycling just the plastic and metal alone from the CARS scraps would have saved 24 million barrels of oil. While some of the “Clunkers” were truly old, many of the almost 700,000 cars were still in perfectly good condition. In fact, many that qualified for the program were relatively “young,” with fuel efficiencies that rivaled newer cars.

A study conducted by Resources for the Future further underscored the program’s failure economically and environmentally:

Approximately 45 percent of the spending went to consumers who would have purchased a new vehicle anyway. Our results suggest no gain in sales beyond 2009 and hence no meaningful stimulus to the economy. In addition, the program will reduce CO2 emissions by only 9 to 28.4 million tons, implying a cost per ton ranging from $91 to $288 even after accounting for reduced criteria pollutants.   

And E–The Environmental Magazine says the Department of Transportation’s declaration that Cash for Clunkers was a success is simply a case of smoke and mirrors:

The Department of Transportation reported that Cash for Clunkers was an environmental success…In general, drivers traded in inefficient SUVs and trucks for more efficient passenger cars. However, it’s quite easy to negate this small difference in gas mileage purely by the fact that people will be more likely to drive a vehicle that takes less money to fill up with gas. It’s an efficiency paradox: as we get more efficient at using energy, the overall cost of energy goes down, but we respond by using more of it. Auto emissions of carbon dioxide are directly proportional to gasoline consumed. With only 690,000 fuel-efficient vehicles purchased and over 250 million cars registered in the U.S., that is a negligible difference in overall greenhouse gas emissions.

As the Washington Post even conceded, Mr. Obama’s Cash for Clunkers scheme was an economic and environmental failure: “So were the naysayers right?” asked the Post.  “It seems so.”

Attorney General Eric Holder may have violated federal law when he did not put his recusal from the secret Associated Press phone records seizure case in writing, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) suggested during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.
Holder said he was not involved in the secret collection of AP phone records because he had recused himself from the investigation which led to the seizure. The Department of Justice hoped to find the source of leaked confidential information, and Holder claims he recused himself because he had access to that information and therefore was a suspect.
“[I] have heard you several times talk about ‘best practices and proprieties.'” Labrador said during his questioning of Holder. “When you decided to recuse yourself, did you look at best practices? I think you admitted already it would have been a better practice for you to put it in writing.”


Labrador then cited federal law, specifically 28 USC § 591, and noted that it requires the Attorney General to put a recusal in writing in “certain circumstances.”

“Frankly, I’ve read it a couple times, I don’t know if it applies to your situation right now, but don’t you think it would have been the best practice for you to just put it in writing especially on an issue of such significance?” Labrador asked.
Holder answered that he would consider putting recusals in writing in the future. 
Federal law requires that the U.S. Attorney General sign off on the type of subpoena used in situations such as the AP investigation, but Holder claimed that when he recused himself, that responsibility fell to Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Asked directly if he put his recusal in writing, Holder said no. He claimed he only informed Cole of the decision.
The law that Labrador cited notes that when the Attorney General decides his recusal is necessary, he must put such a determination in writing. The exact text of that section of law is as follows:

“Recusal of Attorney General.– 
(1) When recusal is required.– 
(A) If information received under this chapter involves the Attorney General, the next most senior official in the Department of Justice who is not also recused shall perform the duties assigned under this chapter to the Attorney General. 
(B) If information received under this chapter involves a person with whom the Attorney General has a personal or financial relationship, the Attorney General shall recuse himself or herself by designating the next most senior official in the Department of Justice who is not also recused to perform the duties assigned under this chapter to the Attorney General. 
(2) Requirements for recusal determination.– Before personally making any other determination under this chapter with respect to information received under this chapter, the Attorney General shall determine under paragraph (1)(B) whether recusal is necessary. The Attorney General shall set forth this determination in writing, identify the facts considered by the Attorney General, and set forth the reasons for the recusal. The Attorney General shall file this determination with any notification or application submitted to the division of the court under this chapter with respect to such information. “

A Department of Justice spokeswoman has not immediately responded to Breitbart News in response to Labrador’s line of questioning.

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez has denied soliciting prostitutes in the Dominican Republic but admitted he traveled at least three times on a donor’s private plane to and from the country. 
The statement comes on the heels of an FBI raid on wealthy ophthalmologist Dr. Salomon Melgen’s Miami office late Tuesday evening and internal FBI emails showing the bureau is investigating the Senator’s alleged solicitation of allegedly underage prostitutes in the Dominican.



“Dr. Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of Senator Menendez for many years,” Menendez’s office said in a Wednesday statement, according to the Washington Post. “Senator Menendez has traveled on Dr. Melgen’s plane on three occasions, all of which have been paid for and reported appropriately. Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog and are false.”

When the story first broke, National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) executive director Rob Jesmer called on Menendez to release all his travel records. He has not done that, and his spokeswoman Tricia Enright did not immediately respond to a Breitbart News request for the travel records. 
Jesmer said the allegations against Menendez are “very serious and deserve examination.”
“Fortunately, there is a simple way for Senator Menendez to begin addressing these questions, and that is by releasing his schedule and travel records related to Easter Week of this year, as well as the other dates in question,” Jesmer said.
This reporter broke the story while writing for The Daily Caller last year and interviewed two Dominican Republic women in November who claimed Menendez paid them for sex around Easter-time last year. The encounter apparently took place at Casa de Campo, a posh 7,000-acre resort in the Dominican Republic. Each woman told this reporter that Menendez had agreed to pay them $500 for sex but only paid them $100.

A new poll conducted jointly by The Washington Post and ABC News revealed some interesting trends. Among other findings, more Americans feel that Obama and his administration are lying about Benghazi. A majority feel that the IRS acted inappropriately by targeting conservative groups.  The media are still distrusted, with a majority feeling that the Justice Department’s seizure of the AP’s phone records was justified. Despite all this disapproval, Obama’s approval rating is still just over 50 percent positive.
An important metric in the ABC/WashPost poll was the question of whether or not government is doing more to protect or threaten our rights. 54% felt that the government had become a threat to our rights while only 34% said that the government was acting properly to protect our rights. The American people’s faith in government is at a low ebb.
This distrust is echoed when the poll turned to the specific cases of Benghazi and the IRS.


55% said that they feel that Obama is trying to cover up what happened during the terror attacks on our facilities in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012. Only 33% felt he was honestly disclosing what he knew.
This doesn’t seem to have helped the GOP too much though. 45% still felt the GOP was just engaging in political posturing by criticizing Obama’s actions on that fateful day. 44% felt the GOP was raising legitimate concerns.
Granted this close 50/50 split tends to shadow how the nation feels about Obama, Congress and the two parties.

As to the IRS scandal, a large majority felt that the tax agency was inappropriate in its targeting of conservative groups. 74% said it was inappropriate while only 20% said that it was appropriate. Further, 37% felt the IRS acted illegally with another 32% said they felt it was inappropriate but maybe not illegal.
Also, 56% felt that the IRS was acting in a partisan manner, deliberately trying to harass conservative groups, and 45% feel that Obama is trying to cover up the facts about that targeting.
The other most recent scandal in the news was Obama’s Justice Department seizing the personal and business phone records of some 100 reporters from the Associated Press. It appears that the media are still not well liked by these respondents.
52% said that the DOJ’s spying on the phone calls of the AP reporters was justified. Only 33% said it isn’t justified. Worse for the media, most respondents weren’t concerned at all that the DOJ might be improperly intruding on the freedom of the press. 32% said they were very concerned that freedom of the press was being trampled upon, but 37% said they were only somewhat concerned, and an additional 29% said they weren’t concerned about it. In a blow to the media, here, more are not very concerned about the AP phone records scandal than are.
Finally, despite that a majority of 57% feel the country is on the wrong track, Obama is still hovering around the break even line in approval. More respondents approved of his work as president (51% to 44%), he split even on his handling of the economy (48% to 48%), and in the matchup between Obama and the Republicans, 46% felt he was handling the economy well compared to only 37% who thought that the GOP was handling it better.
The GOP is not succeeding in getting their message across, clearly.
As to Hillary Clinton, she is still enjoying a relatively high approval rating. 62% of respondents felt she handled her job as Secretary of State well, while only 28% disapproved of her actions.
The poll, conducted in the middle of May, was taken among respondents that self-identified as 33% Democrat, 22% Republican, with 38% self-identifying as independents.

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez has denied soliciting prostitutes in the Dominican Republic but admitted he traveled at least three times on a donor’s private plane to and from the country. 
The statement comes on the heels of an FBI raid on wealthy ophthalmologist Dr. Salomon Melgen’s Miami office late Tuesday evening and internal FBI emails showing the bureau is investigating the Senator’s alleged solicitation of allegedly underage prostitutes in the Dominican.



“Dr. Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of Senator Menendez for many years,” Menendez’s office said in a Wednesday statement, according to the Washington Post. “Senator Menendez has traveled on Dr. Melgen’s plane on three occasions, all of which have been paid for and reported appropriately. Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog and are false.”

When the story first broke, National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) executive director Rob Jesmer called on Menendez to release all his travel records. He has not done that, and his spokeswoman Tricia Enright did not immediately respond to a Breitbart News request for the travel records. 
Jesmer said the allegations against Menendez are “very serious and deserve examination.”
“Fortunately, there is a simple way for Senator Menendez to begin addressing these questions, and that is by releasing his schedule and travel records related to Easter Week of this year, as well as the other dates in question,” Jesmer said.
This reporter broke the story while writing for The Daily Caller last year and interviewed two Dominican Republic women in November who claimed Menendez paid them for sex around Easter-time last year. The encounter apparently took place at Casa de Campo, a posh 7,000-acre resort in the Dominican Republic. Each woman told this reporter that Menendez had agreed to pay them $500 for sex but only paid them $100.

House Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) has called on President Barack Obama to fire John Podesta as his senior adviser in the wake of startling revelations about comments he has made.
In an interview with Politico for a Politico Magazine profile, Podesta compared the Republican Party to the Jonestown cult that Jim Jones led in the 1970s, of which 900 members committed mass suicide via cyanide poisoning in 1978.
“They [the Obama administration] need to focus on executive action given that they are facing a second term against a cult worthy of Jonestown in charge of one of the houses of Congress,” Podesta said of what the administration must do in dealing with the Republican controlled House.


Scalise thinks such comments should be a fireable offense. He called on Obama to take action and terminate Podesta’s employment right away.

“It’s disgraceful and telling that President Obama’s new Counselor is not only comparing the Republican Party to a cult that murdered those who disagreed with them, but is also using that comparison as an argument in support of shredding the Constitution and governing like a third-world dictator,” Scalise said in a statement provided to Breitbart News. “The American people will not stand by and allow the Obama White House to destroy the checks-and-balances defined in the Constitution that are critical to a working democracy, and neither will Congress!” 
“The American people elected a divided government in Washington, and the Obama Administration would do well to respect that fact instead of undermining the will of the American people at every turn,” he continued. “President Obama ran to change the tone in Washington, and it’s time for him to live up to that promise by relieving Mr. Podesta of his official duties immediately.”
Scalise is not the only Republican upset about Podesta’s rhetoric. Rory Cooper, the spokesman for House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), said in a statement provided to Breitbart News that such comments make it difficult for House Republicans to work with the administration.
“This type of appalling and inflammatory rhetoric is a very troubling sign of how this White House plans to govern over the next three years,” Cooper said.
Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), a freshman conservative member, said in a statement provided to Breitbart News that the American people should not accept Podesta’s or the White House’s arguments for executive orders and exceeding new authority on the administration’s behalf.
“Faced with an imploding health care law built on a façade of deception, ruling class leftists like John Podesta resort to vitriolic attacks against, and demonization of, their political opponents,” DeSantis said. “This seems like an entirely baseless excuse for the President to act unilaterally in ways that exceed his constitutional authority.”

A staff report prepared for Rep. Darrell Issa and released today finds numerous failings in the ARB report on Benghazi released last year. The new report overturns some of the conclusions of the official ARB report. It finds that Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy, who was not criticized in the ARB report, should have been held accountable.
The new report is based on public statements but also on transcripts of numerous interviews undertaken since the release of the ARB report. It concurs with some portions of the earlier ARB report and disputes others. For instance, the new report finds that Charlene Lamb was at fault for decisions she made with regard to security in Libya. However the new report also provides a partial basis for exonerating Lamb since evidence suggests that every personnel decisions related to Libya was directly approved (or disapproved) by Under Secretary Kennedy. 


A key exchange appears on page 63 of the report when Committee staff interview Deputy Assistant Secretary for Maghreb Affairs Maxwell about the involvement of Under Secretary Kennedy in events taking place in Libya prior to the 9/11 attack [Emphasis in original]:

Q.The DCM, Mr. Hicks, testified that Ambassador Kennedy was very engaged on a minute level about the incidents that were occurring in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks.
A.Yep.
Q. Does that surprise you?
A. It does not.  We–one of the things that I found interesting was that the Under Secretary approved every person that went in or came out of Tripoli…
*   *   *
A. The DAS Assistant Secretary reports to the Under Secretary for Management. The way the Under Secretary for Management runs things, there is no decision that DS makes that doesn’t have his input and his imprimatur, his approval. There is no decision that DS doesn’t make that doesn’t have his disapproval. DS–the Under Secretary for Management speaks for DS for all practical purposes, and there is no decision that DS makes that the Under Secretary for Management is not involved in.
Q.So, the important decisions about the security posture in Libya leading up to the attacks, if Mr. Boswell was held accountable for those decisions, is it fair to say that the Under Secretary for Management would have had a role in those decisions?
A. Absolutely.

Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell, one of the four individuals named in the ARB report, also told Oversight staff that Kennedy was the “ultimate decisionmaker” when it came to the removal of the SST team from Libya. This was the team of soldiers which Ambassador Stevens and others hoped to keep in Libya but which was removed weeks before the attack. Boswell also told Oversight staffers that “any decision about travel in and out, staffing levels was made by” Kennedy. This included both the assignment of diplomatic staff and security personnel.

Executive Director of the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau Lee Lohman told Oversight that he attended a meeting at which Kennedy personally examined schematics for the villa in Benghazi. Lohman said Kennedy was “heavily” involved in choosing the facility.
The report also points out that Kennedy was the single individual who, based on a staff recommendation, approved keeping the Benghazi post open as a temporary facility for an additional year. It was because the compound was temporary and not a permanent site that its security was staffed on a temporary basis by DS agents on leave from other positions. The temporary staffing system was intended to fill single openings or gaps in staffing on a short term basis, not provide and entire staff indefinitely. As a result, DS never had a full security compliment in place in Benghazi. 
The new report also criticizes Kennedy’s role in presenting a false image of accountability to the public. Under Secretary Kennedy informed Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell that he had been singled out in the ARB report. Boswell offered his resignation and Kennedy accepted it. However Kennedy simultaneously encouraged Boswell to hang on to another position he held. A few days later, Kennedy told Boswell he was being placed on administrative leave. However, quoting Boswell from the Oversight interview, Kennedy told Boswell “he didn’t think it would last long.”
The Oversight report strongly suggests that the ARB report should have assigned blame to Under Secretary Kennedy for his involvement in numerous decisions which created the lax security situation in Benghazi. 
Under Secretary Kennedy is scheduled to testify at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday. Rep. Issa has scheduled a separate hearing with Adm. Mike Mullen and Amb. Thomas Pickering, the authors of the contested ARB report, for Thursday.

The New York Times has vindicated the news sense of Andrew Breitbart and years of Breitbart News coverage of the Pigford scandal with a front page, above the fold blockbuster of investigative journalism that adds new details about the fraud in the USDA farmer settlements and the key role that Barack Obama has played in Pigford dating back to his days as a Senator.
Andrew Breitbart worked tirelessly to expose the Pigford fraud scheme only to have the clear evidence of manipulation by politicians and plaintiff lawyers ignored by the mainstream media. The story involved politicians and lawyers hijacking a lawsuit by black farmers against the USDA designed to make up for years of discrimination and turning it into a multi-billion dollar fraud where people claiming to have ‘attempted to farm’ were able to collect $50,000 checks with no proof. The Obama administration expanded the program for Native Americans, Hispanics, and women, using the same low “attempted to farm” standard that invited massive, undetectable fraud.  
The Times piece was written by a team led by Sharon LaFraniere, who worked on the story for months and according to the article “was based on thousands of pages of court and confidential government documents, as well as interviews with dozens of claimants, lawyers, former and current government officials and others involved in the cases over the past 14 years.”


Here are some highlights from the article, including a number of details not previously reported:
Questionable Legal Moves
The Times story gives a great deal of detail about how the Obama administration certified its own settlement in the cases of the Native American, women, and Hispanic farmer settlements, sidestepping both the legal system ad Congress. Breitbart News has reported on the Obama administration’s expansion of Pigford previously, but the Times brought shocking new information to light. 

For one thing, there were only a total of 91 plaintiffs actually filing suit; 10 women and 81 Latinos. This is a very small number and it certainly would have been possible to handle any actual discrimination claims on a case-by-case basis. However, the Times points out that the government was very skeptical even about those cases. 

“Some of these folks have never made a loan payment in their entire history with U.S.D.A.,” Lisa A. Olson, the lead government litigator against the 81 Hispanic plaintiffs, told Judge Robertson in August 2009. “There may even be folks who are under criminal investigation.”

The Obama Administration made a choice to create a settlement mechanism on their own. The Times says “the Obama administration’s political appointees at the Justice and Agriculture Departments engineered a stunning turnabout: they committed $1.33 billion to compensate not just the 91 plaintiffs but thousands of Hispanic and female farmers who had never claimed bias in court.”
With pressure mounting from some in Congress, “The Obama administration made the ‘legally questionable’ decision to sidestep Congress and pay the woman and Hispanic farmer claims out of a special Treasury Department fund known as The Judgment Fund. “
The small number of actual cases is also significant because of the disparity in the number of actual suits and the number of claims filed so far in the cases; only ten women were actually filing suit but an incredible 24,000 have filed to get $50,000 under the settlement still active at the FarmerClaims.gov website.
Pigford Was About Buying Votes

Even the New York Times has trouble getting Department of Justice officials to speak on record on the story. The Times says, “Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West, who supervised the civil division and oversaw the handling of the cases, canceled an interview. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. also declined to comment.”
This 2008 article from the San Francisco Chronicle profiles Tony West, who was then the California finance co-chair for the Obama campaign and is described as an “Obama power broker.” West, a deep Obama campaign insider, oversaw the settlements for the Obama administration.
This is another indication that the Pigford scandal was about vote buying and elections for the politicians involved. Much of the original Pigford corruption traces to Arkansas. That was no accident but was at the behest of the man who was President when the first Pigford settlement was designed, Bill Clinton. From the Times:

Mr. Clinton asked Carol Willis, then a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee who was known for his expertise in black voter turnout, to get involved. Mr. Willis said the president wanted to make sure his home state, Arkansas, benefited.

During the 2008 elections, the Times details how the Obama administration used Pigford for election purposes. From the Times:

..legislators from both parties, including Mr. Obama as a senator in 2007, sponsored bills to grant the late filers relief.
Mr. Boyd said Mr. Obama’s support led him to throw the backing of his 109,000-member black farmers’ association behind the Obama presidential primary campaign. Hilary Shelton, the N.A.A.C.P.’s chief lobbyist, said Mr. Obama’s stance helped establish him as a defender of the concerns of rural African-American communities.

And the Times makes it clear that others felt the settlements were buying off special interests. A professor from U.C. Berkley testified for the government that there was no pattern of discrimination by the USDA against Native American farmers. 

Professor Rausser was astounded when, with both sides gearing up for trial in late 2009, the government began settlement negotiations. “If they had gone to trial, the government would have prevailed,” he said.
“It was just a joke,” he added. “I was so disgusted. It was simply buying the support of the Native-Americans.”

With Fox News‘ “declaration of war” on the Obama administration’s anti-journalism policies, the Democrat-Media Complex has been divided against itself. 
Members of the press, who consistently hide behind their own objectivity, have been forced to come out in Fox News’ favor in the Department of Justice targeting of Fox News journalist James Rosen. Democrats have been forced to come out of the woodwork to declare that the Obama administration’s treatment of journalists has indeed been abysmal.
But this is a political set-up that cannot hold. The journalistic establishment is generally all too happy to watch their conservative colleagues burned at the stake. Only the fact that the Associated Press was targeted before James Rosen forces the press to embrace the united front approach against the administration.


So what comes next?

The Obama administration surely will not stop targeting its opponents in the press. Whether they are monitoring James Rosen’s communications, screaming at CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson for daring to cover the Fast and Furious scandal, or giving “advice” to Bob Woodward about covering President Obama, the White House operates through intimidation. For years, the White House has made Fox News its primary target in the anti-media war, recognizing that the rest of the media would play along.
Now Obama and company must win back their traditional media allies. That will start with a coordinated play – likely led by White House ally Media Matters – directed at Fox News. An opinion host will be targeted for destruction, and the White House will jump in with both feet. Other reporters, recognizing the cover provided by the White House targeting an opinion journalist at Fox News rather than a straight reporter, will join in. Soon the alliance between Fox News and their erstwhile friends will be broken completely, even as the mainstream press pretends to back journalistic integrity.
This game is not over. Not by a long shot. The Democrats and their press allies know that turning on Fox News is the only way to prevent the burgeoning Obama scandals from turning their man into an early lame duck. The united front will undoubtedly cave soon.
The question, then, is simple: will the American people hold the members of the Democrat-Media Complex accountable for abandoning their journalistic mission in favor of Obama administration shilling?

The curious case of former IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman’s 157 meetings at the White House is now more curious with the revelation that he attended meetings with Stephanie Cutter, Deputy Campaign Manager for President Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. While she technically served a stint as a White House advisor to the President, her role has always been that of an aggressive political operator. That their meetings coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative and Tea Party organizations raises many questions. 
Cutter may have had an official White House title, but she has always been a campaign operative. In 2010, she was named an Assistant to the President, charged with communications and outreach for ObamaCare. Presumably, it is in this role that she was in meetings with Shulman. This itself is odd, because as the IRS is tasked with implementing large swathes of ObamaCare, HHS is responsible for the public outreach and oversight of the public exchanges at the heart of the law. 
Cutter has not revealed the details of the meetings she attended with Shulman. We don’t know the exact dates they met, except that they must have coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative groups. We do know that the targeting began around the time that ObamaCare was enacted.


It is hard to imagine a meeting agenda that would include both the supposedly non-partisan IRS Commissioner Shulman and the hyper-partisan Cutter. The IRS is supposed to develop technocratic rules to implement ObamaCare. Communications and outreach ought not be part of their mission. Could it be that part of the White House’s outreach plan on ObamaCare was to silence opponents?

Cutter should be called to testify under oath before the House Oversight Committee to explain the details of these meetings. Her portfolio at the time, communications and outreach, imply a political component that would not ordinarily be tasked to the IRS Commissioner. What, exactly, were the nature of these meetings?

In the past week since her filibuster, Sen. Wendy Davis has been asked mostly softball questions by the national media. When David Gregory did give her one tough question on Meet the Press she gave an answer which could be used to undercut her own position.
John McCormack at the Weekly Standard pointed out that the media fawning over State Sen. Wendy Davis has produced more questions about her shoes than challenging her stance on abortion. That’s not an exaggeration. This Week reporter Jeff Zelezny asked 6 questions, two of which were about Davis’ footwear. To his credit, David Gregory did ask Davis one question that no other reporter has:





David Gregory: Senator, do you think a 20-week ban on abortion is acceptable? Do you think it’s reasonable?
Sen. Davis: Right now that ban of course is being talked about because of the idea of fetal pain and at the constitutional level what we of course have assured is that women have the ability to make these reproductive decisions up to the point of viability.  That has to remain the key question here. And of course when we’re talking about that particular issue there are very, very few. It’s used more as an emotional trigger point as part of the argument but remember it’s a huge omnibus bill that involves many other aspects to it that are setting Texas back in time.

 The first part of Davis’ answer is coherent but invites an obvious follow up question. Should we consider fetal pain if there is evidence it begins earlier than viability? But then Davis undercuts her own argument when she says “there are very, very few.” If that’s so then the portion of SB5 which bans abortions after 20 weeks won’t have much impact.  
As for it being an “emotional trigger point” keep in mind that the pro-abortion lobby routinely refers to the equally rare instances of rape and incest as reasons we need to keep abortion legal. NARAL and Planned Parenthood are no strangers to using emotional trigger arguments. A neutral observer might point this out.
As for the remainder of the “huge omnibus bill” one of the main features requires abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical facilities. This is the same determination that was reached in Pennsylvania, Virginia and other states in the wake of the Gosnell trial. As I pointed out here, the grand jury in the Gosnell case explicitly recommended that abortion facilities be regulated as ASFs, noting that failure to do so likely contributed to Karnamaya Mongar’s death.
As we’ve seen recently, leading pro-choice politicians struggle to answer even simple questions about their views. David Gregory got the ball rolling but it’s only one question after a week of mostly fawning coverage. What is needed now is some follow up.

7617	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/02/17/Louisville-courier-journal-fires-dyche	Opinion	1	Democrat Scandals	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
The Louisville Courier-Journal has a long and storied history. Originally the product of a merger between several Louisville newspapers in 1868, the newspaper has been the largest print outlet in the city for well over a century. But of late, the newspaper has undergone severe economic problems, with owner Gannett Company laying off 51 employees in 2008 and 44 more in 2009.

Part of that is the newspaper’s dramatic shift to the left over the past few years. Since the election in November, the newspaper’s editorial board has called for Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to resign as Senate Minority Leader and accused McConnell of being the target of “national ridicule,” and run comics depicting McConnell consigned to the flames of hell; it has suggested that Senate Republicans “smacked down the disabled of this country and the world.”

In the latest symptom of that circulation-killing shift left, the newspaper is laying off longtime columnist John David Dyche, a Harvard Law grad and area lawyer who has been writing the token conservative column on the paper since 2003.

Why are they laying Dyche off? Dyche proposed a column to the newspaper suggesting fixes for their editorial woes, including:

“balanced opinion pages” rather than “stridently liberal”; 
disclosing editors’ and reporters’ politics – “Journalists believe that they, unlike mere mortals, can transcend their personal opinions to be basically fair and objective in presenting the news.  Perhaps, but readers should be the ones to judge”;
open meetings about editorial decisions – “Let the public see how and by whom decisions are made as to what to cover, who should cover it, and what headlines, photographs, and placement it receives.”

The editorial board did not take such suggestions kindly, and rejected the column outright. They told Dyche that the column was not within the purview of his mandate as a conservative columnists. Editorial Director Pam Platt left Dyche a message:

Hi, John David, it’s Pam Platt at the Courier-Journal and I’m just calling to let you know that I’m not going to run your column tomorrow.  To me it goes sort of off of what your column is supposed to be.  My understanding is a conservative take on issues of the day and that’s not what this is.  So, anyway, thanks a lot and I’ll talk to you soon.
Dyche responded by email:

[T]he submitted column is very much about “a conservative take on the issues of the day.”  One of those issues is liberal media bias.  Another such issue is the survival of old line newspapers in a changing media marketplace.  Conservatives think there is liberal media bias and that old line newspapers would fare better in the marketplace if they made changes of the sort I propose.  Indeed, your refusal to run this column vividly illustrates the very issues about which I write!
Dyche added, “If there is no change of mind on the paper’s part we should probably end my decade-old relationship with the paper.” Platt quickly wrote back, “I do want to thank you for the pieces you did on the opinion pages for the past 10 years, and I wish you the very best in your life and your work.”
That’s how the left handles calls for balance. By destroying the only semblance of balance they have left.

Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel noted on Friday that Barack Obama and the IRS have a new plan to target Tea Party groups in advance of the 2014 elections. 
During Thanksgiving week, the Treasury Department announced a proposal to limit the political activity of 501(c)(4) groups. The Obama Administration claimed that the plan was necessary to clarify confusing tax laws. 


The House Ways and Means Committee investigators believe that the proposal was designed by examining Tea Party group applications, figuring out exactly how they proceeded, then limiting those very actions in the new proposal, thus shutting them out of the political process.
House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp said, “The committee has reviewed thousands of tax exempt applications. The new regulation so closely mirrors the abused tea-party group applications, it leads me to question if this new proposed regulation is simply another form of targeting.”
Tea Party groups, just as other tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations, have to prove that the majority of their work is for “primary” social-welfare purpose if they want to keep their tax-exempt status. The primary purpose of most Tea party groups is illuminating for Americans the size of government and the erosion of the Constitution. They do so through nonpartisan voter guides, speakers forums, pamphlets, or voter-registration drives.

Now, however, the IRS is planning to recognize those very activities as “political activity,” not “social welfare,” thus rendering Tea Party groups unfit for 501(c)(4) status. 
Thus, the new proposal is not about clarifying tax laws but rather, as Dave Camp stated, “to put Tea Party groups out of business.”
The new rule only applies to 501(c)(4) groups. The League of Women Voters Education Fund, a Democratic stronghold, is registered as a 501(c)(3), considered a “charity” that is strictly limited regarding its political activity. That same organization claims on its website that it holds “candidate debates and forums,” and its “educational activities” include “understanding candidate views and ballot initiatives.”
The League can still issue its voter guides, registrations, and candidate forums. Any conservative social-welfare organization acting similarly will probably lose its tax-exempt status. And guess which groups are unaffected by the new rule, because they are 501(c)(5)s? 
As Strassel writes:
The same president who in May was “outraged” by the IRS’s actions now says it was all just some confusion over tax law (which his new rule fixes). He told Chris Matthews last week that the media had hyped what was a few poor IRS souls in Cincinnati who were “trying to streamline what is a difficult law to interpret… And they’ve got a list, and suddenly everybody’s outraged.”

Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s longtime confidante and wife of disgraced former Congressman and soon-to-be New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, did not disclose that she consulted for outside groups while still employed by the State Department.
According to reports in the New York Times and Politico, Hillary Clinton “created an arrangement” for Abedin to “work for private clients as a consultant while serving as a top adviser in the department” during her final months at the State Department last year.


The arrangement was reportedly made in June of 2012, when Abedin “quietly left her position” as deputy chief of and became a “special government employee.”
Abedin continued to be publicly identified as Clinton’s “deputy chief of staff,” and she allegedly “did not disclose the arrangement–or how much income she earned–on her financial report” that “requires officials to make public any significant sources of income.”
According to the Times, Abedin “worked for Teneo, a strategic consulting firm, which was founded by Doug Band, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton.” The firm has “advised corporate clients like Coca-Cola and MF Global,” which collapsed while being run by disgraced former New Jersey Governor and top Obama bundler Jon Corzine. 

Abedin also “served as a consultant to the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation and worked in a personal capacity” for Hillary Clinton “as she prepared to transition out of her job as secretary of state.”
Officials in the State Department are reportedly sensitive about the arrangement, which ended in March when Abedin became director of Clinton’s transition office. 
Even liberal watchdog groups like CREW said the arrangement was “unusual.”
“If she was being held out as a deputy chief of staff, it would be highly unusual for her to be a part-time employee or a consultant,” Melanie Sloan, CREW’s director, told the Times. 
These revelations come to light as Abedin’s husband–Weiner–has hired Danny Kedem, a former staffer for Hillary Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential bid, as his campaign manager and is reportedly expected to formally announce next week that he will run for mayor of New York.

Well, if it is Thursday, there must be a new Obama scandal. But one thing is for damn sure: whatever that scandal is, you can bet the American mainstream media will be playing catch up and not having the glory of breaking a story about a major White House scandal. 
Fact: Over the past few weeks, four major scandals have broken over the Obama administration, and it is a very sad (and frightening) truth that our pathetic, American, lapdog mainstream media are not responsible for breaking even a single one. 
Verizon? Nope, not our guys. That was the Brits over at The Guardian.  


IRS? Nope, not our guys. The IRS broke their own scandal with a planted question. 
The Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press phone records? Nope, not our guys. Believe it or not, the Associated Press didn’t even break that story. Like the IRS, we only found out because the Justice Department outted itself in a letter notifying the AP of what it had done. 
Benghazi? Are you kidding. With a couple of rare exceptions (Jake Tapper, Sharyl Attkisson) the media have spent the last eight months attacking those seeking the truth (Congress, Fox News)–not seeking the truth. It was the GOP congress that demanded the email exchanges concerning the shaping of the talking points, not the media. 

Left up to the media, we wouldn’t know anything about Libya. All of the media’s energy was collectively poured into ensuring the truth was never discovered. 
And do you want to know what makes this realization especially pathetic? In three of the four scandals (the AP being the exception), had our media been less interested in protecting Power and more interested in holding Power accountable, these huge, career-making stories were right there for the taking. 
For over a year now, conservative Tea Party groups have been complaining about IRS harassment. But because Obama told them to, the media hate the Tea Party. So in the face of these complaints and even a few Congressional inquiries, the media either ignored the harassment reports or openly sided with the IRS. (No joke. Click the link.)
Obviously, you can say the same about Libya. All the dots were there to connect: Security failures, two weeks of lies, the midnight arrest of some hapless filmmaker… But rather than connect the dots, the media played goalie for Obama against Fox News and Darrell Issa. Besides, there was a re-election to win and Todd Akin got something wrong about The Womanparts. 
Moreover, there are still plenty of dots to connect about Libya. But the new SQUIRREL is OVERREACH, and already the lapdogs are back in goalie formation. 

As for the Verizon story, members of Congress, specifically Democrat Senators Ron Wyden (OR) and Mark Udall (CO), have been hint-hint-wink-winking to the media that something is horribly amiss going back to December:
In a Senate floor speech in December, Wyden hinted at classified information he had received but could not share due to Senate rules that indicated the law “on Americans’ privacy has been real, and it is not hypothetical.”

“When the public finds out that these secret interpretations are so dramatically different than what the public law says, I think there’s going to be extraordinary anger in the country,” he told The Huffington Post the following month.
That is from today’s Politico report on the Verizon scandal. Apparently, Politico knew of this back in December but had all their investigative researchers digging into why those short-skirted Tea Partiers had it coming, so they missed another one of the biggest stories of the year. 
Politico shouldn’t feel bad, though, because when it comes to missing the four biggest scoops of the Obama administration, they have plenty of lazy, lapdog, sycophant company in that department. 

Our media are not only biased; it is an utter and complete failure and embarrassment. And although there are plenty of remaining table scraps to make meals out of, the media are already losing interest in the IRS, Libya, and AP scandals, but for only one reason–they are absolutely terrified of where they might lead. 
During the Bush years, it was the New York Times, Washington Post and Sy Hersh breaking story  after story after story about the White House. And yes, some of that reporting was–ahem –overreach, but at least Power knew it was being watched; our democracy was safe because an overzealous media  is what you call a luxury problem. 
Today, it is the complete opposite, and the result is an administration run amok. 
Get down on your knees and thank your Maker for conservative New Media, Roger Ailes, and for the few true liberals left in the media, like Glenn Greenwald–who works for the Brits.

Former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino told Breitbart News that President Barack Obama was lying when he blamed the cancellation of White House tours on his former agency.
“The president’s absolutely not telling the truth when he said the Secret Service made that decision to cut [the White House] tours,” Bongino said. “That’s the core of it: he is not telling the truth.”


In an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, Obama said the decision, made as a part of sequestration, was not one “that went up to the White House.”
“But what the Secret Service explained to us was that they’re going to have to furlough some folks,” Obama said in the interview. What furloughs mean is–is that people lose a day of work and a day of pay. And, you know, the question for them is, you know, how deeply do they have to furlough their staff and is it worth it to make sure that we’ve got White House tours that means that you got a whole bunch of families who are depending on a paycheck who suddenly are seeing a 5% or 10%–reduction in their pay. Well, what I’m asking them is are there ways, for example, for us to accommodate school groups–you know, who may have traveled here with some bake sales. Can we make sure that- kids, potentially, can–can still come to tour?”
Bongino, who served 12 years in the Secret Service including five years working directly at the White House before leaving to run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Maryland, said Obama is lying because the Secret Service does not make such decisions.

“The Secret Service does not make political decisions,” Bongino said. “The Secret Service makes security decisions. His statement that it was a Secret Service decision internal budget decision–and keep in mind, I’m not speaking for the Secret Service, I’m speaking from experience of being with them. All he’d have to do is cancel one or two of his political trips and his Martha’s Vineyard vacation, which two years ago I was on and helped coordinate, he would save that money times ten. There was just no way this was a sound decision. To insinuate this is the first administration where the White House social office and the Executive Office of the President had no role in cancelling public tours at the White House, that he was the first president who was left out of the decision, is absolute nonsense.”
Bongino said he thinks the president is using “the Washington Monument strategy”–a ploy by a politician who tries to garner public opposition to spending cuts by eliminating popular public services first–in doing this to White House tours. “He wanted to inflict, there is no question in my mind, maximum pain upon the American people. But here’s the caveat: it had to be public pain. If you don’t see it, it doesn’t hurt.”
But Bongino said all the public pressure Obama has taken for the decision to cancel the tours caused the ploy to “backfire.” Regardless, the ex Secret Service agent who served three years at the George W. Bush White House and two years at Obama’s White House said Obama still will not admit he was wrong and is now trying to blame the Secret Service for his own behavior.
“Instead of coming clean and being honest with the American people that your office and likely you as well had a role in this, he’s again pulling the wool over your eyes just like he’s done on Benghazi, the immigration release [of thousands of illegal immigrants] where he said he didn’t know and Janet Napolitano said she didn’t know, this is nonsense,” Bongino said. “These are not security or budget decisions. These are strictly political decisions. Make no mistake about it.”
Bongino said the Secret Service is not correcting Obama because the agency has “a great, elite group of guys and they’re always going to take it on the chin.”
“I don’t speak for them but they’re obviously a patriotic group of men and women and they’re not lying when they say there will be overtime costs saved so it’s not like they’re being disingenuous,” Bongino said. “They’re trying to cover for this guy, I think, because they know it looks bad and they don’t want to get involved in the politics and I don’t blame them.”

The Senate Armed Services Committee has delayed a vote on the nomination of Chuck Hagel to serve as Defense Secretary after he failed to turn over requested financial information. Hagel had been asked to disclose details about foreign funding he had received, either through paid speeches or through entities with which he was involved. In a short statement yesterday, Hagel said he couldn’t comply with the request.  
This information is critical to determining Hagel’s fitness to head the Defense Department. As Secretary, he assumes a lead role in defining, and protecting, America’s national security interests. The Senate is absolutely right to demand details about compensation he received from foreign entities. The disclosure will help allay concerns about possible conflicts of interest. 
The stonewalling on the disclosure is just the latest stumble in Hagel’s path to confirmation. His performance at his confirmation hearing on January 31st was widely panned. Even Democrat supporters reported they were “shocked at how ill-prepared” Hagel was in the hearing. He didn’t seem ready to answer questions that were widely expected to be asked. On other questions he fumbled, having to later clarify his answers. 


The worst part, though, was probably when Hagel admitted “I don’t know enough about [military programs and technology]. There are a lot of things I don’t know about. I, if confirmed, intend to know a lot more than I do.”

Heading the Defense Department is not made for on-the-job training. It is the largest, most complex organization in the world. It is also vital to America’s safety. Hagel has not been nominated for Commerce or Labor, where the nation could easily withstand a failed Secretary. He will be managing America’ military, through a period of budget cuts and reassessment of strategic threats. 
Only a seasoned executive, with intimate knowledge of America’s military, could navigate the department and our country safely through those waters. Regardless of party, each Senator must carefully ask themselves whether they can support a nominee who seemed so ill-prepared and visibly incompetent in his hearing. If they do, then they are at least partly responsible for any calamities that may ensue.

A new Fox News poll shows Obama’s disapproval rating among registered voters has spiked to 51%, up from 45% last month. The poll shows an 8-point swing against Obama since April. Another shocking finding, undoubtedly linked to recent scandals, is that 68% of voters think the federal government is “out of control.”
Last month, 47% of voters approved of the job Obama was doing, while 45% disapproved. Disapproval of Obama has jumped 6 points since the latest scandal revelations. Among Independents, only 40% approve of Obama, while 52% disapprove. At this time 4 years ago, 60% of voters approved of Obama and only 30% disapproved. 
The scandals are also taking a toll on voters expectations for Obama’s second term. A plurality 49% believe his is a lame-duck, while 47% think he still has the ability to accomplish things in his final years in office. For the first time ever, also, less than a majority see Obama has “honest and trustworthy.” 


The poll also contained troubling news for embattled Attorney General Eric Holder. Just 28% of voters approve of Holder’s job performance, while 40% disapprove. It is surprising that almost 70% of voters even have an opinion of an Attorney General’s job performance. 

The particular nature of the current scandals, featuring cover-ups and abuses of power, are having a dramatic effect on how voters see the federal government. 68% believe the government is “out of control” and acting in a way that threatens civil liberties. Only 26% of voters report they don’t feel this way. Even a plurality of Democrats, 47-45, say the government is “out of control.”
These are no ordinary scandals and their consequences for Obama and the Democrats are only beginning to be felt.
The poll of 1,013 voters was conducted Saturday through Monday by Republican and Democrat polling firms.

Attorney General Eric Holder faces new questions about racial bias at the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as about the veracity of his testimony before Congress, as the result of a new Inspector General report and documents obtained by Judicial Watch. 
The Inspector General’s report, covered extensively by former DOJ official J. Christian Adams, reveals that many Civil Rights Division attorneys do not believe that the Voting Rights Act ought to be enforced to protect white victims as well as black victims, and that black employees who were willing to help prosecute black defendants–such as the New Black Panther Party–were subject to alleged threats and intimidation by DOJ officials.


The Judicial Watch documents suggest that political appointees at DOJ were involved in the decision to drop the case against the New Black Panther Party, contrary to Holder’s sworn testimony before Congress, in which he said: “The decisions made in the New Black Panther Party case were made by career attorneys in the department. And beyond that, you know, if we’re going to look at the record, let’s look at it in its totality.”

The documents also contradict the testimony of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez, who claimed that there was no political intervention in the case. 
Perez is currently considered the frontrunner to be President Barack Obama’s next Secretary of Labor, despite a controversial history that includes heavy involvement with the pro-amnesty group La Raza as well as the New Black Panther Party case.
Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, who fought the DOJ in court for access to the documents, called for “an independent investigation into whether Messrs. Holder and Perez committed perjury in testifying under oath about the Black Panther controversy.”

With Fox News‘ “declaration of war” on the Obama administration’s anti-journalism policies, the Democrat-Media Complex has been divided against itself. 
Members of the press, who consistently hide behind their own objectivity, have been forced to come out in Fox News’ favor in the Department of Justice targeting of Fox News journalist James Rosen. Democrats have been forced to come out of the woodwork to declare that the Obama administration’s treatment of journalists has indeed been abysmal.
But this is a political set-up that cannot hold. The journalistic establishment is generally all too happy to watch their conservative colleagues burned at the stake. Only the fact that the Associated Press was targeted before James Rosen forces the press to embrace the united front approach against the administration.


So what comes next?

The Obama administration surely will not stop targeting its opponents in the press. Whether they are monitoring James Rosen’s communications, screaming at CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson for daring to cover the Fast and Furious scandal, or giving “advice” to Bob Woodward about covering President Obama, the White House operates through intimidation. For years, the White House has made Fox News its primary target in the anti-media war, recognizing that the rest of the media would play along.
Now Obama and company must win back their traditional media allies. That will start with a coordinated play – likely led by White House ally Media Matters – directed at Fox News. An opinion host will be targeted for destruction, and the White House will jump in with both feet. Other reporters, recognizing the cover provided by the White House targeting an opinion journalist at Fox News rather than a straight reporter, will join in. Soon the alliance between Fox News and their erstwhile friends will be broken completely, even as the mainstream press pretends to back journalistic integrity.
This game is not over. Not by a long shot. The Democrats and their press allies know that turning on Fox News is the only way to prevent the burgeoning Obama scandals from turning their man into an early lame duck. The united front will undoubtedly cave soon.
The question, then, is simple: will the American people hold the members of the Democrat-Media Complex accountable for abandoning their journalistic mission in favor of Obama administration shilling?

Barack Obama is coming under fire for his willingness to bypass Congress when implementing his agenda in contravention of the Constitution’s desire for three equal branches of government. GOP congressmen speaking at a House Judiciary Committee meeting this week were blunt about Obama’s defiance of the traditional negotiation with Congress.

Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) blasted that Obama “doesn’t have a debate in the Oval Office about what he wants to do … he does what he wants to do, and then you no longer have representative democracy.” GOP members noted that Obama has acted unilaterally on issues ranging from immigration laws, which he ignores, to consistent and enormous revisions of ObamaCare, which was passed as law.


Even Obama supporter Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, had the temerity to question his Obama’s methods, although he felt compelled to include George W. Bush when he commented, “The problem of what the president is doing is that he is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he is becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid: that is, the concentration of power in any single branch.”
Of course, there are the other Obama acolytes who will defend him. Simon Lazarus, Senior Counsel for the Constitutional Accountability Center, said that Obama’s changes to ObamaCare after it was already passed do not conflict with Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which requires the president to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Lazarus loftily intoned,  “I have to say that hyperventilating about how extraordinary and unprecedented and unconstitutional these delays are is just that, it’s hyperventilation and it’s contrary to obvious historical fact.” 

Should we be surprised by Obama’s circumvention? This is the same man who boasted in March 2012, “If Congress refuses to act, I’ll do everything in my power to act without them.” 
Although there was a suggestion before the House Committee that the only way to solve the problem would be to impeach Obama, the reality is that the Democratic-controlled Senate would shoot that down. Those who called for impeachment concluded that the only real answer “comes down to elections.”

Newsmax says there is a reason progressives like former Obama Green Jobs Czar Van Jones are so incensed about a new biography chronicling the life of presidential strategist-turned-Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes: he is “the man Obama fears the most.”
“To say that the president hates Fox News may be an understatement,” writes Newsmax in a book review of Roger Ailes: Off Camera by Zev Chafets. “Early in his first term Obama actually sought to ban Fox News from the White House press corps, ripping away its press credential.”
Chafets, who received unprecedented access to Ailes and his Fox News inner circle, recounts an intense private 2008 meeting at New York’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel between News Corporation Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch, Barack Obama, and Roger Ailes. When Ailes asked Obama about his stated support for unilateral arms reductions, Ailes says Obama looked him square in the eye and denied ever taking such a position.


“He said this looking me right in the eyes. He never dropped his gaze, which is the usual tell. It was as good a lie as anyone ever told me,” said Ailes.

The Newsmax book review says the Ailes biography contains several “surprising revelations,” including:

How Glenn Beck’s exposé on Van Jones led to the White House efforts to ban Fox News;
Obama’s surprising remark at a White House Christmas party, telling Ailes that he was “the most powerful man in the world;”
The truth about the George Soros-backed efforts to torpedo the “two Great Satans” — Roger Ailes and Rush Limbaugh;
Why Beck really left Fox News to start his own network;
Fox and Hollywood: the funny account by Ailes of the time he went to dinner with Al Pacino and Shirley MacLaine;
Ailes’ role in saving Ronald Reagan after his disastrous debate performance against Walter Mondale;
O’Reilly wars: the inside story of how Fox dealt with MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann and why, to this day, Bill O’Reilly hates his liberal critics at NBC

Newsmax is not alone in its praiseworthy book review; Rush Limbaugh said the biography is “great because Ailes opened up to Zev like he hasn’t opened up to anybody else.” Limbaugh encouraged readers who are tired of progressive caricatures of Fox News to “get Roger Ailes: Off Camera.”

On Tuesday, Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer appeared on Fox & Friends and revealed that former Vice President Al Gore and other Obama cronies are cashing in on the Obamacare debacle.
In 2004, David Blood and former Vice President Al Gore co-founded Generation Investment Management. Schweizer says despite the perception that Gore’s investments are all green energy-related, Blood and Gore’s investment portfolio is currently comprised of 27% health care investments and stands poised to score big from Obamacare. 
“David Blood was a bundler for Barack Obama,” said Schweizer. “Even though they talk about being in green technology, 27% of their investment portfolio right now is in health insurance companies designed to profit from this sector.” 


Blood bundled over $500,000 in campaign donations for Obama in 2012.


Schweizer, whose new book Extortion debuted at number eight on the New York Times bestseller list, said other Obama fundraisers are also cashing in on the government health care overhaul. 
“The same thing goes for the private equity firms,” said Schweizer. “Evercore Partners–who is headed by Roger Altman, a bundler for the Obama campaign–they are said to cash in on what everybody is saying is going to be massive mergers between hospital companies, etc. Wall Street firms need to broker those deals and a company like Evercore Partners is perfectly positioned to do that.” 
Even as 4.9 million Americans are losing their health insurance plans under Obamacare, Schweizer says top Obama campaign fundraisers and insiders stand to rake in millions.  
“It’s a great business for them because the law basically creates a market for products that didn’t exist before,” said Schweizer. 
“Your book, Extortion, is going to open a lot of eyes,” said Fox & Friends co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) said Friday that the resignation of President Barack Obama’s Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is not enough. He said Attorney General Eric Holder should step down too.
“One down and one to go,” Gosar said in a statement. “While Secretary Napolitano may be gone she will not be forgotten. Her inaction and incompetence on border security will continue to plague our nation for years to come.”
“‘See no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil’ is no way to govern and yet it is exactly how she and this administration operates,” he continued. “The American public deserve better.”


Gosar added that it is time for Holder to resign as well.
“What the American people need now is for Attorney General Eric Holder to follow her lead and resign,” Gosar said. “The American people have no confidence in him or his ability to do his job. My message to him would be: Better late than never. Today is a good day to go.”
Gosar has a resolution in the House calling for Holder’s resignation that a number of members of Congress have signed onto. During the previous session, 130 House members, eight U.S. Senators, and several governors from around the country called for Holder to resign over Operation Fast and Furious. 

In Fast and Furious, the Obama administration’s Department of Justice and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed 2,000 weapons bought through straw purchases to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. Holder remains in both criminal and civil contempt of Congress for his failure to cooperate with the congressional investigation into the scandal, which left hundreds of Mexican citizens and U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry dead. 
President Obama has asserted executive privilege to continue concealing thousands of pages of documents related to the scandal from Congress.
Fast and Furious is hardly Holder’s only problem moving forward, especially as House Republicans draw closer to obtaining the documents uncovered via a federal court lawsuit. The Attorney General faces multiple scandals, particularly his decision to approve secret investigations into members of the news media. Holder reportedly met with President Obama on a forthcoming report on the DOJ’s activities in regards to that issue on Friday.
The Associated Press noted how Gosar’s harsh words for Napolitano contrast sharply with those of his fellow Arizona Republican, Sen. John McCain. McCain rushed to praise Napolitano for her work, saying she “served our nation with honor.”
Napolitano’s DHS released hundreds of illegal aliens from prisons earlier this year, citing the sequester as the reason.

Eric Holder knows that the only way he can save his job is by currying favor with the media, which is exactly what the embattled Attorney General is doing. The question is, will the media once again cave to the wishes of their beloved Obama administration or do their jobs and demand a full accounting from an out-of-control Justice Department on a chilling rampage to intimidate journalists and their sources? 
Yesterday, the Daily Beast embarrassed itself with a Holder profile so glowing and so obviously aimed at tamping down the media’s frustration with him, that even BuzzFeed’s left-wing Ben Smith raised his eyebrows over it on “Morning Joe” Wednesday. 
We also learned Wednesday that Holder has already set up meetings with various representatives from a number of print and television organizations to discuss how the DOJ will handle leak investigations in the future. 


During his Congressional testimony two weeks ago, Holder didn’t seem at all contrite during questioning about his department’s role in the seizure of phone records from the Associated Press. In fact, the Attorney General came off as cocky, bored, and peevish. 
Holder also didn’t even seem terribly fazed after it was discovered that he was the one who signed an application for a warrant to seize the private emails and phone records of Fox News reporter James Rosen. 
What has come out since, though, has obviously knocked the smug out of him. The House Judiciary Committee is now investigating Holder’s statements during his recent testimony. It seems that Holder’s statement about never hearing or having anything to do with attempting to prosecute a journalist or reporter doesn’t quite reconcile with an application that accused Rosen of espionage. A perjury charge could be forthcoming. 

What has to worry Holder the most, though, is that the revelations surrounding the Justice Department’s hysterical actions toward Fox News have not elicited the kind of reaction from the mainstream media that Holder likely expected. The media hates Fox News almost as much as the Obama administration does, but only almost. 
Rather than let their political hatred and envy of Fox News’s success turn into a Get Out of Jail Free card for Holder, the media has instead rallied around Fox. This means that once Congress is back in session next and the hearings into the Justice Department begin, the press coverage could be very bad for an Attorney General who up till now has been zealously protected by the media in scandal after scandal. 
The Huffington Post has already called for Holder to be fired. If the rest of the mainstream media jumps on board, Holder is toast and Holder knows this. More importantly, so does Obama. In short, Holder’s fate and legacy will be decided by how the media collective chooses to cover this scandal in the coming weeks. 
So starting as early as Thursday, Holder is going to attempt to charm and convince the media to ignore their duty, circle the wagons, and play goalie for him just one more time.

7715	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/05/27/The-Ailes-Manifesto	Opinion	1	Democrat Scandals	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Fox News CEO Roger Ailes’ May 23 stirring letter to Fox employees will be remembered as a turning point in the battle for freedom of the press in the age of Obama.  
The Ailes letter, denouncing the Obama administration’s trampling on the First Amendment, should be seen, of course, as a strong defense of Fox correspondent James Rosen. In addition, the Ailes letter–in truth, a manifesto–is a staunch vindication of Fox News and its “speak-truth-to-power” approach to journalism. Finally, the Ailes Manifesto should be seen as a clarion call for freedom–for freedom of the press, and also for the right of all Americans to think freely, liberated from the MSM thought-monopoly.  


As Patrick Caddell has pointed out here at Breitbart News, the Obama Administration has never truly been worried about leaks, because the Administration itself has been the main source of leaks. Why? For political advantage, of course. That is, to make the Administration look good, especially in regard to the war on terror in the run-up to the 2012 election. 
The Obamans wanted to maintain their exclusive “franchise” on leaks, rewarding friendly reporters, such as The New York Times’ David Sanger, with information on highly-classified programs, including the Stuxnet virus used against Iran. In fact, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, upon reading Sanger’s book Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, said, “You learn more from the book than I did as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and that’s very disturbing to me.” In other words, US national security was a distant second, well behind the primary goal, which was the President’s re-election.  
To be sure, the Obama Administration leaked for other reasons, as well. As Breitbart News’ Matthew Boyle reported, the Obama Justice Department was happy to leak documents to advance its own interests in the “Fast and Furious” scandal.  

It is obvious that the Obama Administration will leak any information regardless of its sensitivity to national security or to individuals’ reputations when it is expedient for political gain. The facts are incontrovertible, over a broad range of issues, over a long period of time.  
While the Obama administration has been playing this dangerous game, Roger Ailes has been clear and straightforward. The Ailes Manifesto is, indeed, fierce in its defense of freedom. As the Fox News founder–at the helm, now, for 17 years–wrote: 

The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time. We will not allow a climate of press intimidation, unseen since the McCarthy era, to frighten any of us away from the truth.

Even amidst the greatest threat to press freedom in six decades, neither Fox, nor its friends and allies, are going to back away, or back down. The fight for freedom is a fight for all of us.  
Indeed, as the Ailes Manifesto continues to reverberate through the media and political landscape, we can observe three kinds of reaction: first, strong awareness and support from the activist public; second, a surprising amount of solidarity from the other journalists and journalistic organizations; and third, a cringing U-turn by some notorious Obama administration lackeys and lapdogs.  
So let’s look at each of these three categories in turn. 

First, support from the activist public. Social media showed a huge outpouring of support for reporter Rosen and the Ailes letter. “Ailes’ letter give you a sense of him as a boss,” one Twitter user said. “Kind of man that inspires real loyalty out of respect.”
“Simply put, Roger Ailes, a true principled Leader,” said another. One response read, “The Roger Ailes memo might be the most badass thing I’ve ever read.”

Another reader remarked, “Roger Ailes sounds downright Churchillian.”
Second, others in the MSM have chosen to side with Fox, at least on this one issue. Urged on by press leaders–including Fox News’ Ed Henry, who said to fellow pressies, “let’s not be a bunch of lemmings”–many MSM-ers have chosen to do the right thing, even if it pains them. As Joel Pollak noted, stalwart liberal Alex Seitz-Wald of Salon.com was moved to tweet, “I understand lib cognitive dissonance on Obama admin going after Fox reporter, but only right answer is #TeamRosen.”
Fox News Opinion summed up much of this diverse media support in a May 23 compendium titled, “They All Stand with Fox News’ James Rosen.” The piece took note of supportive comments from staffers of CNN, The New Yorker, The Washington Post–even former anchor Keith Olbermann. Remarkably, the tabloid-y TMZ, not known for its political coverage, had to agree that the controversy, and the Ailes Manifesto, constituted a hot story. 

On May 21, the White House Correspondents Association issued a strong statement: 

Reporters should never be threatened with prosecution for the simple act of doing their jobs. The problem is that in two recent cases, one involving Fox News’ James Rosen and the other focused on the Associated Press, serious questions have been raised about whether our government has gotten far too aggressive in its monitoring of reporters’ movements, phone records, and even personal email.

Meanwhile, the support keeps coming. On Saturday, The Washington Post wrote a tough pro-Rosen editorial titled, “The freedom to ask,” in which the Post quoted the Justice Department’s own stated policy on leak investigations, which declares, “The prosecutorial power of the government should not be used in such a way that it impairs a reporter’s responsibility to cover as broadly as possible controversial public issues.” The Post then added, “The Obama administration should recommit to its spirit.” 
Third, even some of Obama’s most groveling fans have had to adjust course in light of the new knowledge about his administration’s bullying methods. In fact, support for Ailes and Fox has been so broad and strong that even mortal enemies of Fox have had to come around, however grudgingly. For example, Media Matters for America (MMFA), the George Soros-funded anti-Fox smear operation run by David Brock, has been forced to do a 180 from its original pro-Obama position.  
On May 14, as the news about the Justice Department investigations was breaking, MMFA slavishly published talking points in support for the Obama administration. In other words, the MMFA Obama-propaganda operation was trying to teach others how they, too, could be Obama-propagandists. Yet after a firestorm of criticism, MMFA shifted its position, albeit over ten long days. 
On May 24, MMFA Senior Fellow and Andrew Breitbart bête noire Eric Boehlert, reflecting this new line, complained that “federal law enforcement seems preoccupied with snooping around, in increasingly clandestine ways, and ensnaring reporters in criminal investigations.” Well, yes; better late than never.  
Boehlert continued in this manner, even allowing for the heretical thought that Fox News might not be at fault in everything: 

Whether it was the Department of Justice’s wild overreach in seizing phone records of more than 20 separate telephone lines used by Associated Press editors and reporters, or the Department’s more focused, yet even more troubling, information grab of a Fox News reporter, the practice is wrong and shortsighted. It’s also un-American.

One can only imagine the drama inside MMFA before those anti-Obama Administration words were printed on its site. Which was more gut-wrenching for David Brock, criticizing the Obama Administration or defending Fox News from it?
Of course, as Pollak wrote, the pro-Ailes/pro-Fox sentiment, while welcome, is unlikely to last for long:   

Now that Holder has been caught in a hacking scandal of his own–first of telephones at the Associated Press, then of Rosen and other Fox News journalists–the playing field is leveled. And even though the wider media solidarity with Fox News is doomed to be short-lived, from now on the White House will face bolder, fearless conservative media, confident in the knowledge that they are defending universal principles.

Still, Ailes and Fox have made their point, and it will be an enduring point. The impact of the strong Ailes Manifesto and the unyielding Fox stance may be felt only briefly among the MSM, but it will remembered forever in conservative, libertarian, and constitutionalist circles.   
On this Memorial Day, these words of Ailes have it exactly right: 

Too many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of press freedom. We can’t and we won’t forget that. To be an American journalist is not only a great responsibility, but also a great honor. To be a Fox journalist is a high honor, not a high crime.

And we here at Breitbart News might humbly add: it’s a high honor to be an American on the same side as Roger Ailes, James Rosen, and Fox News, in this historic fight for freedom. Together, we will win, because victory begets victory.

In the past week since her filibuster, Sen. Wendy Davis has been asked mostly softball questions by the national media. When David Gregory did give her one tough question on Meet the Press she gave an answer which could be used to undercut her own position.
John McCormack at the Weekly Standard pointed out that the media fawning over State Sen. Wendy Davis has produced more questions about her shoes than challenging her stance on abortion. That’s not an exaggeration. This Week reporter Jeff Zelezny asked 6 questions, two of which were about Davis’ footwear. To his credit, David Gregory did ask Davis one question that no other reporter has:





David Gregory: Senator, do you think a 20-week ban on abortion is acceptable? Do you think it’s reasonable?
Sen. Davis: Right now that ban of course is being talked about because of the idea of fetal pain and at the constitutional level what we of course have assured is that women have the ability to make these reproductive decisions up to the point of viability.  That has to remain the key question here. And of course when we’re talking about that particular issue there are very, very few. It’s used more as an emotional trigger point as part of the argument but remember it’s a huge omnibus bill that involves many other aspects to it that are setting Texas back in time.

 The first part of Davis’ answer is coherent but invites an obvious follow up question. Should we consider fetal pain if there is evidence it begins earlier than viability? But then Davis undercuts her own argument when she says “there are very, very few.” If that’s so then the portion of SB5 which bans abortions after 20 weeks won’t have much impact.  
As for it being an “emotional trigger point” keep in mind that the pro-abortion lobby routinely refers to the equally rare instances of rape and incest as reasons we need to keep abortion legal. NARAL and Planned Parenthood are no strangers to using emotional trigger arguments. A neutral observer might point this out.
As for the remainder of the “huge omnibus bill” one of the main features requires abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical facilities. This is the same determination that was reached in Pennsylvania, Virginia and other states in the wake of the Gosnell trial. As I pointed out here, the grand jury in the Gosnell case explicitly recommended that abortion facilities be regulated as ASFs, noting that failure to do so likely contributed to Karnamaya Mongar’s death.
As we’ve seen recently, leading pro-choice politicians struggle to answer even simple questions about their views. David Gregory got the ball rolling but it’s only one question after a week of mostly fawning coverage. What is needed now is some follow up.

Newsmax says there is a reason progressives like former Obama Green Jobs Czar Van Jones are so incensed about a new biography chronicling the life of presidential strategist-turned-Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes: he is “the man Obama fears the most.”
“To say that the president hates Fox News may be an understatement,” writes Newsmax in a book review of Roger Ailes: Off Camera by Zev Chafets. “Early in his first term Obama actually sought to ban Fox News from the White House press corps, ripping away its press credential.”
Chafets, who received unprecedented access to Ailes and his Fox News inner circle, recounts an intense private 2008 meeting at New York’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel between News Corporation Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch, Barack Obama, and Roger Ailes. When Ailes asked Obama about his stated support for unilateral arms reductions, Ailes says Obama looked him square in the eye and denied ever taking such a position.


“He said this looking me right in the eyes. He never dropped his gaze, which is the usual tell. It was as good a lie as anyone ever told me,” said Ailes.

The Newsmax book review says the Ailes biography contains several “surprising revelations,” including:

How Glenn Beck’s exposé on Van Jones led to the White House efforts to ban Fox News;
Obama’s surprising remark at a White House Christmas party, telling Ailes that he was “the most powerful man in the world;”
The truth about the George Soros-backed efforts to torpedo the “two Great Satans” — Roger Ailes and Rush Limbaugh;
Why Beck really left Fox News to start his own network;
Fox and Hollywood: the funny account by Ailes of the time he went to dinner with Al Pacino and Shirley MacLaine;
Ailes’ role in saving Ronald Reagan after his disastrous debate performance against Walter Mondale;
O’Reilly wars: the inside story of how Fox dealt with MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann and why, to this day, Bill O’Reilly hates his liberal critics at NBC

Newsmax is not alone in its praiseworthy book review; Rush Limbaugh said the biography is “great because Ailes opened up to Zev like he hasn’t opened up to anybody else.” Limbaugh encouraged readers who are tired of progressive caricatures of Fox News to “get Roger Ailes: Off Camera.”

Eric Holder knows that the only way he can save his job is by currying favor with the media, which is exactly what the embattled Attorney General is doing. The question is, will the media once again cave to the wishes of their beloved Obama administration or do their jobs and demand a full accounting from an out-of-control Justice Department on a chilling rampage to intimidate journalists and their sources? 
Yesterday, the Daily Beast embarrassed itself with a Holder profile so glowing and so obviously aimed at tamping down the media’s frustration with him, that even BuzzFeed’s left-wing Ben Smith raised his eyebrows over it on “Morning Joe” Wednesday. 
We also learned Wednesday that Holder has already set up meetings with various representatives from a number of print and television organizations to discuss how the DOJ will handle leak investigations in the future. 


During his Congressional testimony two weeks ago, Holder didn’t seem at all contrite during questioning about his department’s role in the seizure of phone records from the Associated Press. In fact, the Attorney General came off as cocky, bored, and peevish. 
Holder also didn’t even seem terribly fazed after it was discovered that he was the one who signed an application for a warrant to seize the private emails and phone records of Fox News reporter James Rosen. 
What has come out since, though, has obviously knocked the smug out of him. The House Judiciary Committee is now investigating Holder’s statements during his recent testimony. It seems that Holder’s statement about never hearing or having anything to do with attempting to prosecute a journalist or reporter doesn’t quite reconcile with an application that accused Rosen of espionage. A perjury charge could be forthcoming. 

What has to worry Holder the most, though, is that the revelations surrounding the Justice Department’s hysterical actions toward Fox News have not elicited the kind of reaction from the mainstream media that Holder likely expected. The media hates Fox News almost as much as the Obama administration does, but only almost. 
Rather than let their political hatred and envy of Fox News’s success turn into a Get Out of Jail Free card for Holder, the media has instead rallied around Fox. This means that once Congress is back in session next and the hearings into the Justice Department begin, the press coverage could be very bad for an Attorney General who up till now has been zealously protected by the media in scandal after scandal. 
The Huffington Post has already called for Holder to be fired. If the rest of the mainstream media jumps on board, Holder is toast and Holder knows this. More importantly, so does Obama. In short, Holder’s fate and legacy will be decided by how the media collective chooses to cover this scandal in the coming weeks. 
So starting as early as Thursday, Holder is going to attempt to charm and convince the media to ignore their duty, circle the wagons, and play goalie for him just one more time.

It is difficult to explain to Americans, particularly young Americans, what was wrong with the Clinton era, and why we ought not want to re-live it. The 1990s are sealed into our national memory as a time of great prosperity and expectation–killed off, in Democrats’ rewriting of history, by the 2000 recount and all that followed. 
The truth is that by 2000, Democrats could not run away from Clinton quickly enough. It’s worth revisiting why.


By 2000, President Bill Clinton had survived the scandal that led to his impeachment, but the dot-com bubble had burst and the country had plunged into recession. 
(It never really recovered. A college friend and I recently observed that the career trajectories of our friends were deeply affected by whether they graduated in 1998, at the height of the boom, or 1999, just before the crash, and with little time to gain real work experience.)
The political right, frustrated by the perceived failure of the 1994 revolution, decided to adopt its own version of Clinton’s “third way” politics by embracing George W. Bush and his “compassionate conservatism.” But on the left, those who resented Clinton’s market-oriented, free-trade policies finally gained the upper hand, shutting down the Seattle World Trade Organization talks in 1999, inaugurating the anti-globalization movement.

Things were unraveling overseas, as well. The Oslo Peace Process, which Clinton had pushed, and which promised a “new Middle East,” collapsed, and a new wave of terror began. 
Just days later, the U.S.S. Cole was attacked by Al Qaeda, the follow-up to the embassy bombings of two years before, and a sign that Clinton’s cruise-missile, light-footprint response to those attacks had encouraged rather than placated the enemy.
The party was over. And Americans were tired of it. 
Culturally, for instance, it was a time of stagnation. The Clinton era was a time of classic-rock revival and derivative hip-hop, each mining the past for inspiration as major stars died out. Grunge and alternative rose and fell in an arc of self-loathing. Across the arts, nostalgia for more meaningful times–what Harvard critic Philip Fisher mocked as “nightmare envy”–was a dominant theme.
Beneath the surface of Clinton-era complacency also lay the roots of future crises. The president reauthorized the Community Reinvestment Act in 1999, for example, pushing big banks into subprime lending and setting the stage for the 2007-8 housing crisis. 

At the same time, Clinton cronies like Jack Lew and Rahm Emanuel seized the opportunity of deregulation for self-enrichment at the country’s decrepit “too big to fail” banks.
It was Bill Clinton’s lies about his personal life that led to his impeachment; it was his manipulation and broken promises that led to public disenchantment. And that came at the worst possible time. 

A newly-globalized world, under attack by the far-left, the Islamists, and thinly-disguised nationalists, needed an effective leader to guide it through turbulent times, to affirm the value of freedom despite the great risks involved.
But Clinton had undermined himself, and his collapse left no political successors. His “New Democrats,” who once sought to move the party beyond old labor alliances and leftist dogmas, withered and faded.
Worse, Clinton abandoned his own achievements. Later, when President Obama gutted welfare reform’s work requirements, Clinton refused to criticize him, collaborating in the death of his own legacy–all for the sake of 2016.

Democrats forget all of that now, and the “Clinton fatigue” of 1999-2000. But what they still remembered about the Clintons in 2008 was their dishonesty. 
To moderates, that was a virtue: when Hillary mouthed the new left-wing rhetoric of her party, they knew she was saying what she thought would win primary voters. 
But to others, it was a fatal flaw. They preferred Barack Obama’s apparent left-wing authenticity (though Bill Clinton warned it was a “fairy tale”).
Hillary Clinton has all of the fakery, and none of the charm, of her husband. From her comical pandering to the black community, to her cover-ups at the State Department, she has done little of substance to redeem her duplicity.
After Obama’s many failures, Americans may be content to embrace someone they never trusted anyway. But those lies do make a “difference,” and opponents ought to remind Americans of that, constantly.

Tom Brokaw did his very best to contextualize the numerous scandals pummeling the Obama Administration by saying they don’t rise up to the level of Watergate, Iran-Contra, or even Abu Ghraib. 

I was covering Iran-Contra during the Reagan administration when [Peggy Noonan] was working for that president, in which we were funding a war illegally. We were trying to make a deal with the Iranians at the time. That was a pretty big damn scandal.

Brokaw seems to be employing a tactic common among has-been journalists these days. They seem to be afraid that any story seen as “bigger” than the stories they covered in their day somehow diminishes their life work, and therefore any suggestion to this effect must be smacked down immediately. 
So, in Brokaw’s opinion: 



The Department of Justice obtaining secret subpoenas naming reporters as an aider, abetter and co-conspirator and confiscating thousands of reporters’ phone records is not as serious as Abu Ghraib. 
The President’s inaction as our consulate was under attack in Libya, resulting in the death of four Americans at the hands of terrorists, and the Administration’s efforts to mislead the press and American people during a presidential campaign doesn’t rise to the level of Abu Ghraib.
The IRS using their power and intimidation tactics to discriminate against groups and individuals because of their political beliefs is not as significant as Abu Ghraib

Brokaw explained his rationale for making Abu Ghraib the be all and end all of presidential scandals: “Abu Ghraib was a big scandal and how it – no one was really held accountable for it.”

If accountability (or lack thereof) is the new standard for scandals, then Brokaw needs to re-calibrate his memory of Abu Ghraib and the comparison to the Obama scandals. Eleven soldiers were convicted of various charges relating to the Abu Ghraib incident. Meanwhile, every single government employee involved with Benghazi, the IRS, HHS fundraising, AP subpoenas and the Fox News/James Rosen subpoenas continues to cash their paychecks and are in line for full government pensions.

7749	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/10/19/media-hate-speech-cruz-death-threat	Opinion	0	Democrat Scandals	None	Negative	Positive	breitbart.com	"

After weeks of being vilified by the national media and White House as a terrorist, racist, and radical hostage-taker out to destroy the economy, Ted Cruz (R-TX) is receiving the kind of death threats that are all-too expected after this kind of national demonization campaign. A person who identifies himself on Twitter as Troy Gilmore, Jr. listed the Senator’s homes address and suggested Cruz be taught a “street wise lesson.” Capitol Police are investigating:
 The Hill reported Capitol Police were looking into the post by someone identifying himself as Troy  Gilmore Jr.
 The tweet, posted early Friday, said, “Take down Ted Cruz, at his home” and listed Cruz’s home  address in Houston, The Hill reported.


 It also said, “What goes around comes around CRUZ!!”
 The Hill said the poster — using the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54 — said he had served in the U.S.  Army and Navy, and posted another tweet Friday afternoon saying Cruz “needs tobe [sic] taught a  street wise [sic] lesson.”
In the last couple of weeks, the hate speech directed at Cruz from the elite media has been merciless. Politico mused about drowning Cruz; The Washington Post compared Cruz to an evil, mass-murdering terrorist – “Ted Bin Laden”; a writer for The New Yorker compared Cruz to O.J. Simpson. The media have also made Cruz the face of a movement they have described as a bunch of racists “wearing suicide vests” and “taking hostages.” 

Mind you, this is just what the elite media have been saying. President Obama and top Democrats have been just as bad. 
After all of this, the only surprise is that this is the only death threat against Cruz, or at least the only one we know of. Why would someone not feel a seething hostility towards an individual the national media and our president are wishing dead, comparing to terrorists, and relentlessly demonizing as the leader of a radical, dangerous, arsonist, anarchist, racist, hostage-taking cause that will destroy America?
We sure have come a long way from a media and White House that just two years ago made a national crusade out of finding a New Tone in politics. In the wake of the horrific shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, within an hour, the media blamed Governor Sarah Palin over a standard issue campaign map that placed crosshairs over Giffords’ district. Even after it was clear there was no connection to the map and the deranged killer, the media and President Obama still lectured America over the corrosive effect violent political rhetoric was having on our culture. 
But just two years later, the media are no longer interested in enforcing the New Tone. And just a year after trying to destroy Rush Limbaugh over his labeling of a left-wing activist as a “slut,” the media are currently engaged in a hate speech campaign beyond anything we have seen in years.  
Politics aside, although the media will never publicly acknowledge the possibility that their “othering campaign” might have contributed to a death threat against a U.S. Senator serious enough to involve police, let’s hope that privately there is at least some soul searching going on.

Spring Break is a common ritual for students across the country, and First Daughter Malia Obama is no exception. But, of course, there is an important difference between the First Daughter and other students. When Malia Obama takes a trip, the American taxpayers get stuck with a hefty bill. How hefty? That’s what we’ve been trying to find out.
As you know, JW has kept close watch on the First Family’s extravagant personal trips for the American people, since we’re the ones footing the bill. And last week we released records detailing the government funds expended on Malia’s March 2012 Spring Break vacation to Mexico. According to the records, obtained from the U.S. Secret Service as a result of a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed on September 20, 2012, the total cost of the trip amounted to $115,500.87. 

The following is a breakdown of the costs as detailed in the documents, which are available in full here:


Ground transportation:       $23,964.81
Lodging:                           $21,682.92
Airfare:                             $47,767.34
“Vouchers”:                       $21,636.14 (not itemized)
Support Charges:               $449.66 (travel for one from Mexico City to Oaxaca, not                                             itemized)

Malia Obama’s Spring Break trip evoked a significant amount of controversy after the Obama White House reportedly ordered the removal of press reports detailing the trip. 
On March 19, 2012, numerous online press outlets reported on Malia Obama’s Mexico trip, noting the fact that she was accompanied by 25 U.S. Secret Service Agents and as many as 12 of her friends. However, shortly after the press reports surfaced, they were quickly removed from the Internet. 

As reported by Politico: 
The AFP, the Huffington Post and other websites have scrubbed a report about first daughter Malia Obama’s school trip. On Monday, the AFP reported that Obama’s daughter was on a school trip along with a number of friends and 25 Secret Service agents. The story was picked up by Yahoo, the Huffington Post, and the International Business Times, as well as UK publications like the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and other overseas publications like The Australian. But on Monday night, the story had been removed from those sites.
In an update to this story, Politico published a statement issued by Kristina Schake, Communications Director to the First Lady, indicating that the removal of these news stories was “a White House effort:” 

“From the beginning of the administration, the White House has asked news outlets not to report on or photograph the Obama children when they are not with their parents and there is no vital news interest. We have reminded outlets of this request in order to protect the privacy and security of these girls.”
The trip reportedly took place shortly after the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statement advising students on Spring Break “to avoid Mexico.”  
I think we can all agree that in these economic times, with huge public debt and high unemployment, spending $115,000 in taxpayer funds on a Spring Break trip to Mexico is inappropriate. Is this what Americans are being asked to pay higher taxes for?
This is far from the first time the Obamas have taken advantage of the American taxpayer to enjoy expensive vacations.
We previously obtained records from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing Michelle Obama’s February 2012 President’s Day weekend ski vacation to Aspen, Colorado, with her two daughters. The records indicate U.S. Secret Service costs, including accommodations at the Fasching Haus deluxe condominium and the Inn at Aspen, were $48,950.38.
Judicial Watch also obtained documents from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing costs associated with Michelle Obama’s controversial August 2010 vacation to Spain. According to a Judicial Watch analysis, the records indicate a total combined cost of at least $467,585.  
Judicial Watch also obtained documents detailing costs of a June 21-27, 2011, trip taken by Michelle Obama, her family and her staff to South Africa and Botswana. Judicial Watch received mission expense records and passenger manifests for the Africa trip that described costs of $424,142 for the flight and crew alone. Other expenses, such as off-flight food, transportation, security, etc. were not included.
That’s a total of four trips at a cost of almost $1 million. And these are the trips we know about.
Rest assured, JW will continue to monitor these First Family excursions in a second Obama term. I suspect they will continue.

Not every liberal journalist was brought to tears over the President’s belated statement on the George Zimmerman verdict.  Columnist Rich Benjamin at Salon.com called the effort “safe, over-rated and airy” and compared it unfavorably to Attorney General Eric Holder’s recent address to the NAACP by asking the provocative question: “Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Ni**er. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Ni**er?”

Finally the president has spoken about George Zimmerman’s acquittal. Even as the country waited for his singular response – the nation’s leader and a law professor who once looked like Trayvon Martin – the president danced around the issues. And what a dramatic anti-climax, listening to the president refuse to say anything insightful or profound about the acquittal. In signature professorial style, the president gave us the “context” to the episode and to black people’s “pain.” But he didn’t offer a meaningful opinion on the episode’s hot molten core: racial profiling, vigilantism, and “Stand Your Ground” laws.
Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric Holder delivered trenchant thoughts on the acquittal, demanding action. Before an audience of supporters, Holder recently called for a full investigation of Martin’s death after Zimmerman’s acquittal. Holder vowed that the Justice Department will act “in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We will not be afraid.”
“We must stand our ground,” he told supporters.
Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Ni**er. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Ni**er?

It’s an attention-getting way to suggest that Obama and Holder play “good cop/bad cop” on racial issues, and Benjamin goes on to show examples over their careers that support the idea.  Benjamin is a Senior Fellow at the liberal think tank Demos, has written extensively about the Zimmerman case, and has been critical of Obama’s reaction. 
The “Inner Ni**er” charge got a volatile reaction from most liberals who absolutely loved the meaningless, identity-politics-pander that President Obama passed off as a meaningful speech, and they took to Twitter to let Benjamin know. (H/T Tommy Christopher)


@elonjames Seriously @RichBenjaminUSA. What the fuck dude? Of all the framing around this you would use “Inner Nigger” to make this argument?
@elonjames Whether you thought that Obama’s speech is lacking or not, deliberate link bait like this is cheap and problematic at best.
@AngryBlackLady When I said publish more voices of color, this wasn’t what I had in mind, @Salon.
@AngryBlackLady I can’t. i can’t. RT @tommyxtopher: @AngryBlackLady @Salon @elonjames cue Rush Limbaugh “satire.” Maybe a parody Stevie Wonder album cover?
@elonjames Wow. And @Salon-do you guys not have editors? What editor in their right mind sees “Inner Nigger” and thinks “Publish this ASAP.”
@elonjames Fuck your career. This isnt about how many hits you can get. This is so much bigger than that and muthafuckas out here trying to be popular.
@elonjames Dear White People & Organizations: having negroes make dumbass arguments does not shield you from critique. CC: @Salon
@elonjames At this point @Salon should rename itself “White Liberal Bullshit Weekly.”
@AngryBlackLady And @Salon published that nonsense by @RichBenjaminUSA with Trayvon’s name spelled incorrectly in the photo caption — so that’s delightful.
@goldietaylor I don’t even know what to say. Why would a progressive site publish a piece re: POTUS’ “inner n-word”? 

That last tweet from MSNBC’s Goldie Taylor is instructive in that she acknowledges that “progressive sites” tend not to publish anything that would be seen as critical of President Obama, especially an article critical of the President within the realm of race.

President Barack Obama rarely makes himself available to the mainstream media. They adore him anyway. At rare press conferences, such as the one scheduled for noon Friday at the White House, they lob softball questions or accept his evasive, meandering answers, rarely pressing him for clarity, much less truth. But there are many questions that the president ought to answer, yet which he is unlikely to face at all.
10. In 2008 you promised not to “do an end-run around Congress” with signing statements. Yet you have used signing statements and you have taken executive actions to circumvent Congress on immigration and other issues. Recently, you decided the employer mandate will not be enforced on October 1. Yet that date is stipulated by law. Doesn’t the Obamacare delay violate your powers under the Constitution?


9. Last week we learned that dozens of CIA personnel were in Benghazi at the time of the attack, and that there may be ongoing efforts to suppress information about what actually happened. In October 2012, you said that you issued three directives when you learned of the attack, yet these have never been seen. What did you actually do during the Benghazi attack, and why weren’t you more actively involved?
8. Last month, IRS officials testified to Congress that IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins, whom you appointed, was directly involved in reviewing applications for non-profit status by Tea Party groups. He also met with you in April 2012, prior to issuing new “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) criteria for evaluating such applications. What was your personal knowledge of the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups?
7. Recently your administration launched a new round of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders. Israel had repeatedly said that it would negotiate without preconditions, but Palestinian leaders would not. Your administration, through Secretary of State John Kerry, pressed Israel to release 104 terrorists from Israeli jails. Was there a single new concession you demanded from Palestinians?

6. You have publicly dressed down the U.S. military on the issue of sexual assault. In the 2012 campaign, you were very involved in specific controversies, even calling Sandra Fluke, for example. Yet you have refused to say anything about the conduct of a fellow Democrat, Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego, who refuses to resign. Aren’t you setting a bad example on sexual assault, as commander-in-chief, in the Filner case?
5. Edward Snowden has continued to reveal new information about the National Security Agency’s abilities to gather information about Americans’ private communications. Leaving aside the question of whether the government should have that power, or whether you have broken past promises on civil liberties, the fact that these leaks happened at all is striking. Why is Gen. Keith Alexander still the head of the NSA?
4. Recently you announced that you were canceling a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, over the Snowden issue and gay rights. Yet last month, even after Putin indicated he might offer Snowden asylum, you were still offering drastic cuts in America’s nuclear arsenal. It looks like the “reset” with Russia is a failure, after so many concessions. Isn’t it time to stop offering new cuts to U.S. nuclear weapons?
3. You are backing the Senate immigration bill, which passed because Democrats agreed to include border security measures. Regardless of whether those measures are sufficient, they depend on a commitment to enforce the law as written. Yet you have refused to enforce existing immigration laws, even imposing a so-called “Dream Act” by fiat. Why should Americans trust you to enforce a new immigration law?
2. You campaigned on the promise to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet you have helped the Taliban open a new office in Qatar, complicating relations with President Hamid Karzai, and recently suggested that there could be a “zero option” in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, as the U.S. withdraws, Al Qaeda is on the offensive across the region, and might return. Are we not repeating the mistakes of the past in Afghanistan?
1. You are about to head into a new round of budget negotiations. Some Republicans leaders have suggested that they are willing to offer concessions on the budget sequester if you commit to entitlement reform. You have spoken in theory about making some cuts but have never presented a plan, on paper, and have rejected all suggestions, even the Simpson-Bowles commission. Where is your plan to reform entitlements?
Bonus question: Last month, you spoke at length about how the African-American community views the death of Trayvon Martin case. You also asked people to respect the decision of the jury. Yet your Department of Justice is still aggressively investigating George Zimmerman, who is living in hiding, though all previous investigations showed no racial bias. Aren’t you violating Zimmerman’s civil rights?
UPDATE – Additional bonus question (from the comments): When you signed the Affordable Care Act, it included the Grassley amendment, subjecting members of Congress and their staff to the same rules as everyone else. Yet this week you signed off on special subsidies for members of Congress and their staff. Given your focus on inequality, how do you justify giving Congress Obamacare subsidies?
UPDATE 2 – Another bonus question (via Twitter): There is no longer any doubt that Nidal Hasan was motivated by radical Islamist beliefs. In May, you actually acknowledged for the first time that the Ft. Hood attack was an act of “Islamic jihad.” Yet your administration still considers is “workplace violence,” which denies victims certain benefits. Isn’t it time to declare the Ft. Hood shootings a terrorist act?

Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s longtime confidante and wife of disgraced former Congressman and soon-to-be New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, did not disclose that she consulted for outside groups while still employed by the State Department.
According to reports in the New York Times and Politico, Hillary Clinton “created an arrangement” for Abedin to “work for private clients as a consultant while serving as a top adviser in the department” during her final months at the State Department last year.


The arrangement was reportedly made in June of 2012, when Abedin “quietly left her position” as deputy chief of and became a “special government employee.”
Abedin continued to be publicly identified as Clinton’s “deputy chief of staff,” and she allegedly “did not disclose the arrangement–or how much income she earned–on her financial report” that “requires officials to make public any significant sources of income.”
According to the Times, Abedin “worked for Teneo, a strategic consulting firm, which was founded by Doug Band, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton.” The firm has “advised corporate clients like Coca-Cola and MF Global,” which collapsed while being run by disgraced former New Jersey Governor and top Obama bundler Jon Corzine. 

Abedin also “served as a consultant to the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation and worked in a personal capacity” for Hillary Clinton “as she prepared to transition out of her job as secretary of state.”
Officials in the State Department are reportedly sensitive about the arrangement, which ended in March when Abedin became director of Clinton’s transition office. 
Even liberal watchdog groups like CREW said the arrangement was “unusual.”
“If she was being held out as a deputy chief of staff, it would be highly unusual for her to be a part-time employee or a consultant,” Melanie Sloan, CREW’s director, told the Times. 
These revelations come to light as Abedin’s husband–Weiner–has hired Danny Kedem, a former staffer for Hillary Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential bid, as his campaign manager and is reportedly expected to formally announce next week that he will run for mayor of New York.

On Friday, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh praised Pat Caddell, the frustrated Democrat who has often spoken out against the political establishment, for his thunderous speech at CPAC on Thursday condemning the Republican consultant class.
Caddell accused GOP consultants of caring more about money than winning elections or principles and engaging in acts that could border on racketeering. 
Limbaugh said Caddell “launched both barrels at CPAC” and let the Republican consultant class “have it” while blowing “the lid off of CPAC” with what Limbaugh described was a message that “the Republican consultant class is taking the party down the tubes, that they’re making filthy amounts of money–$150 million a campaign–whether the candidate wins or loses.”



“In my party we play to win. We play for life and death,” Caddell said at a panel in a room that was only one-third full when it started and was standing room only once word spread throughout CPAC that Caddell was blistering the Republican elite. “You people play for a different kind of agenda…Your party has no problem playing the Washington Generals to the Harlem Globetrotters.”
Caddell said this mentality infected Romney, whose campaign consultants thold him to “back off” toward the end of the 2012 election and failed to realize that “you must also get your base” while courting independents. 

He then blasted the “CLEC–the consultant, lobbyist, and establishment complex,” which he said was a “self serving interconnected network of individuals and organizations interested in preserving their own power far more than they’re interested in winning elections.”
“I blame the donors who allow themselves to be played for marks,” Caddell continued. “I blame the people in the grassroots for allowing themselves to be played for suckers….It’s time to stop being marks. It’s time to stop being suckers. It’s time for you people to get real.”
Limbaugh read these quotes on his radio show and wholeheartedly endorsed them, for Limbaugh told his listeners that for years he has warned of consultants who claim they have the secret formula for winning over so-called “independents” at the expense of conservatives, and the “candidates fall for it year after year after year” and lose. 
“They’re all moderates. None of them are really conservative,” Limbaugh said of the GOP consultant class. “They say they are, and they think they’ve got the recipe to win.”
Limbaugh said the consultant class thinks “people in the middle, these great moderate independents, aren’t conservative. And furthermore, they think that conservatism scares these people” and they “make no effort to educate or inform or correct that impression.”

The conservative radio show host said he has always been confused by consultants who think Republicans will turn off independents by getting aggressive because “Democrats are the meanest, most extreme, insufferable” people and, “there’s nothing nice about them.”
“Somehow that doesn’t scare the independents,” Limbaugh said. 

Case in point: Romney’s 2012 loss to Obama. 
“He won the independents, just like these brainiacs said,” Limbaugh said. “But four million conservatives sat home and didn’t vote.”
Limbaugh noted that Caddell was right to know that consultants get advertising commissions whether the candidate wins and the GOP leaders threaten candidates they will not receive institutional support if the candidate does not hire their cronies from a list of “approved” consultants and strategists. 

He said this was the “foundation for Caddell’s speech at CPAC” and consultants who led the charge of, “The era of Reagan is over,” are not big fans of him or conservatives. He emphasized that he has always been confused about why Republicans have the two Reagan campaigns as blueprints for how to win majorities by running on core beliefs and principles and fail to use them. 
Limbaugh said Caddell’s speech about the CLEC was “really important” because it explains why Republicans continue to lose national elections because the consultant class just wants to be liked by the liberal Washington mainstream media and ecosytem. 
“You’re happy to be walked all over. You’re just happy to be in the game. You’re happy to be acknowledged,” Limbaugh said of the permanent political class. “I really believe the pursuit to make everybody like you is the greatest prison you could put yourself in.”
Limbaugh said Republicans who want to get liked “cease being” who they are and then “you end up not even knowing who you are.” 
Limbaugh blamed Romney’s consultants for telling Romney to “back off” on critical issues like Benghazi and not attack Obama in the final days of the campaign because they did not want to be disliked by their liberal peers in the mainstream media and Washington’s permanent political class.
“You try to be all things to all people, and that can’t be done,” Limbaugh said, noting that the mainstream media wants Republicans to be content with being “perennial losers” who know their place. “This effort to make themselves liked never gets anywhere. They never gain respect.”

On Monday, the Associated Press reported that operatives of Mexican drug cartels have infiltrated virtually every large and mid-sized city in the United States in order to “tighten their grip on the world’s most lucrative narcotics market and maximize profits.” 
Based on reviews of court records and interviews with law enforcement officials, the Associated Press claims that Mexican drug cartel “groups have begun deploying agents from their inner circles to the U.S.” 
“Cartel operatives are suspected of running drug-distribution networks in at least nine non-border states, often in middle-class suburbs in the Midwest, South and Northeast,” the report claimed.


Jack Riley, the law enforcement official in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Chicago office described the infiltration as “probably the most serious threat the United States has faced from organized crime.” Riley added, “People think, ‘The border’s 1,700 miles away. This isn’t our problem.’ Well, it is. These days, we operate as if Chicago is on the border.”

Riley believes that the increased presence of Mexican drug cartel operatives has lead to an increase in violent crime in Chicago. “They are the puppeteers. Maybe the shooter didn’t know and maybe the victim didn’t know that. But if you follow it down the line, the cartels are ultimately responsible.”
In February, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane said that Mexican drug cartels “are taking over our neighborhoods.” In Louisville, Metropolitan Police Department Lieutenant Richard Pearson noted, “This is the first time we’ve been seeing it — cartels who have their operatives actually sent here.” 
Monday’s Associated Press report comes on the heels of a story reported by Breitbart News on Sunday that examined possible connections between the Saturday murders of Kaufman Texas County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia and an alleged alliance between the Aryan Brotherhood and Mexican drug cartels.

The Obama White House is scrambling to blame Friday’s abysmal March jobs numbers on the sequester’s trimming of the rate of growth in federal budgets that have yet to fully commence. 
After the Labor Department announced that a mass exodus of 663,000 workers left the U.S. workforce last month and that job creation fell 112,000 jobs short of projections, Obama’s top economic adviser Alan B. Krueger, took to the White House blog to blame the sequester:

It is important to bear in mind that the March household and payroll surveys are the first monthly surveys to look at employment since the beginning of sequestration.  While the recovery was gaining traction before sequestration took effect, these arbitrary and unnecessary cuts to government services will be a headwind in the months to come, and will cut key investments in the Nation’s future competitiveness.  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the sequester will reduce employment by 750,000 full-time equivalent jobs by the end of the year. 
Now is not the time for Washington to impose more self-inflicted wounds on the economy.  The administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to put more Americans back to work like rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing.

Krueger did not mention January’s 2% payroll tax increase, which will wipe out an entire year’s worth of wage gains by American workers. Roughly 70% of national expenditures emanate from consumers.


Kathy Bostjancic, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis for The Conference Board business research group, says the major flaw in Obama’s argument is that the sequester has not kicked in yet. 
“What is even more troubling about the most recent slowdown is that it takes place even before the sequester cuts materially hit the economy,” Bostjancic stated in a press release. “This reinforces our view that the estimated 3.5 percent real GDP growth in Q1 is not likely to be sustained. Instead, we see the overall economy, led by the consumer, downshifting significantly in the second quarter, struggling to get close to 1 percent real growth.” 
The need to curb Washington’s spending will have an effect on jobs, says Bostjancich, but they will likely be centered around “further contraction in government sector jobs.”

Indeed, the unemployment rate for government workers is less than half (3.6%) the national unemployment rate. Since July, the government has added 618,000 government workers to its payrolls, employing 20,633,000 individuals.
While Friday’s reporting shows a 7.6% unemployment rate, the real rate–including the millions who have given up hope and quit looking for work, are in part-time positions and needing full-time work, etc.–is closer to 15%, says billionaire former Obama supporter Mort Zuckerman. Worse, says Zuckerman, “Multiple job-holders are up by 340,000 to 7.26 million. In essence then, all of the ‘new’ positions are going to people who already are working, mostly part-time.”
To be sure, the need to slam the brakes on Washington’s reckless spending will likely shed jobs, and possibly the 100,000 to 300,000 economists project. But the 90,000,000 Americans who no longer work as of last month have myriad other factors to blame than a cut the equivalent of 0.5% of the national debt that has yet to go into effect.

On Friday, Pentagon officials informed a House committee that the President’s formal budget proposal wouldn’t be delivered to Congress until April 8th, more than two months past the statutory deadline. Under federal law, the President is required to submit his budget blueprint to Congress no later than the first Monday in February. President Obama has met that deadline only once. 
When asked at a press briefing Friday, White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest wouldn’t confirm the budget’s release. “I don’t have a budget date to announce to you,” he said. It is telling that the White House didn’t inform Congress of the delay, but left the task to budget staff at the Pentagon. 
A major part of a President’s job is to manage the Executive Branch and its numerous federal agencies. The President’s budget proposal is the Administration’s estimation of the resources it will need to meet its mission and priorities for the coming year. Historically, the President submits his budget before Congress gets to work on a final spending plan. 


This year, however, House and Senate Budget authors will unveil their spending plans weeks ahead of President Obama. Like many other legislative deliberations, Obama will be on the sidelines. 

Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sen. Jeff Sessions blasted the delay. “He will be submitting it after the House and Senate have produced a budget proposal and adjourned for Easter. So while the President speaks of his deep concern for American workers and families, he fails to even submit to Congress his financial plan to help those workers and families.”
Since Obama took office, the government has mostly been on auto-pilot. Senate Democrats have refused for the past four years to even bring a budget plan to the floor for a vote. This inaction has caused the government to run on a series of “continuing resolutions”, which simply extend all current spending, with modest increases, for a set period of time. 
As a result, there have been no real talks about prioritizing spending nor reducing or eliminating ineffective programs. It has allowed Obama and the Democrats to give lip-service to the need to cut spending, without having to provide any specific recommendations. It’s budgetary shadow-boxing. 
Obama is simply uninterested in the day-to-day workload required to successfully manage the federal government. He can’t even be bothered when federal law requires that he “show his work” to the nation.

As the federal government enters day three of a partial shutdown, talk in Congress is turning increasingly to a “grand bargain” that would include entitlement and tax reform as a way to resolve the current fiscal impasse. Rep. Steve Stivers, a close Boehner ally, even floated the idea that “revenue”, i.e. higher taxes, could be part of this “bargain.” 
There is no clear path to reopening government right now. Obama and Senate Democrats continue to refuse to negotiate or compromise on legislation to provide new government funding. In just two weeks, however, the federal government is set to hit its debt ceiling, exhausting its borrowing authority. After this, the government will have to pay its bills out of continuing tax collections, necessitating dramatic cuts in spending or a default on the nation’s existing debt payments. 
As the government shutdown and debt ceiling issues intertwine, many in the GOP believe that only a “grand bargain” on spending and revenue is a big enough vehicle to restore government funding and lift the debt ceiling. During the last debt ceiling negotiations, in 2011, the GOP was close to agreeing to a similar “grand bargain.” The deal fell apart in the 11th hour, however, because President Obama increased his demands for new revenue. 


This experience should caution the GOP against unilaterally proposing another “grand bargain” at this time. Obama and the Senate Democrats seem incapable of negotiating in good faith. The rhetoric they currently employ against Republicans does not suggest they are ready to cede ground on fiscal issues in any meaningful way. It is hard to imagine Harry Reid shifting from calling Republicans “anarchists” to treating them as honest brokers in a substantive negotiation over the nation’s fiscal policy. 

Theoretically, a “grand bargain” could be a good idea, given the urgent need to reform the nation’s entitlement programs and tax code. In reality, however, with Republicans only controlling the House, any “grand bargain” is likely to be light on spending reform and heavy on tax hikes.
If Republicans take control of the Senate in 2014, which is increasingly likely, conservatives and moderate Republicans would be in a better position to push a “grand bargain” that would contain meaningful reforms that could boost the economy. 
Policy considerations, however, may yield to internal GOP politics. Paul Ryan, who was granted a special waiver to continuing chairing the Budget Committee, is eager to strike a significant budget deal while he has the gavel. Rep. David Camp, too, is entering his final term chairing the Ways and Means Committee and is anxious to enact some kind of tax reform while he heads the committee. Their desire for a personal legacy will make them strong advocates for a “grand bargain,” despite the GOP’s relatively weak hand. 
The GOP faces a series of tough choices over the next two weeks. So, too, do Obama and the Senate Democrats. Much of the current situation is due to the inability of the Senate to produce a regular budget over the past five years. The failed stimulus program, bailouts, expanded welfare payments and new entitlements like ObamaCare has caused government spending to skyrocket, pushing the national debt to unsustainable levels. Even a mainstream media black-out can’t forever keep those facts from the American public. 
The onus isn’t on Republicans to solve the nation’s fiscal crisis. President Obama and Senate Democrats have brought us to this point. It should be up to them to steer us out of it.

8027	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/06/Obama-Boehner-tired-spending	News	1	Economy	None	Negative	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"
In an interview with Stephen Moore of the Wall Street Journal, newly re-elected House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) opened up about President Obama’s utter unwillingness to cut a single dollar from federal spending. In a stunning admission, Obama reportedly told Boehner, “We don’t have a spending problem.”
Boehner added that President Obama continues to maintain that America’s federal deficit is caused not by governmental overspending but by “a health-care problem.” Said Boehner, “They blame all of the fiscal woes on our health-care system.” Boehner told Obama, “Clearly we have a health-care problem, which is about to get worse with Obamacare. But, Mr. President, we have a very serious spending problem.” Obama eventually replied, “I’m getting tired of hearing you say that.”


Obama may be tired of hearing Boehner talk about a spending problem, particularly when Obama has been re-elected on the basis of ignoring government spending. Nonetheless, America does have a spending problem, which Obama is steadfastly ignoring. “He’s so ideological himself,” Boehner explained, “and he’s unwilling to take on the left of his own party.” That’s why Obama refused to raise the retirement age for Medicare after agreeing to it. “He admitted in meetings that he couldn’t sell things to his own members,” said Boehner. “But he didn’t even want to try … We could never get him to step up.”

Boehner says that there will be no new tax increases over the debt ceiling. “The tax issue is resolved,” he said. And he said that more closed-door negotiations with Obama would be “futile.” It’s a bit too late to recognize that, but better late than never.
Obama need not negotiate on spending. He can just continue to bully Republicans by suggesting that they are the party of the rich – and his media lackeys can pretend that it’s fiscally irresponsible to ask the government to live within its means.

Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) had a dire prediction for America about sequestration, claiming that 170 million jobs would be lost as a result of the across-the-board cuts. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only about 140 million jobs in the whole country.
During a press conference on February 28, Waters told reporters of a visit by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke who told members of congress that sequestration is not the optimal way to cut the federal budget.
Talking of Bernanke’s comments, Waters claimed that “if sequestration takes place, that’s going to be a great setback. We don’t need to be having something like sequestration that’s going to cause these jobs losses, over 170 million jobs that could be lost.”


However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Table A-9, Selected Employment Indicators, in January of 2013 there were 141,614 million jobs in the current American economy.
Using Waters’ math, the US would lose about 30 million more jobs than it had to start with.

Yesterday we did have Mr. Bernanke in our committee and he came to tell us what he’s doing with quantitative easing and that is trying to stimulate the economy with the bond purchases that he’s been doing because he’s trying to keep the interest rates low and create jobs–and he said that if sequestration takes place, that’s going to be a great setback. We don’t need to be having something like sequestration that’s going to cause these jobs losses, over 170 million jobs that could be lost–and so he made it very clear he’s not opposed to cuts but cuts must be done over a long period of time and in a very planned way rather than this blunt cutting that will be done by sequestration.
As you know in this committee we have all of HUD and HUD is responsible for so many programs that determine the quality of life for women and families. CBDG, a form of grant programs will be cut by $153 million dollars. These are grants to cities that help with women and children and low-income programs.
We also will cut the Home Program by $52 million if sequestration takes place, Native American Housing grants by $34 million, House and Choice grants $113 million, Public Housing–mostly single women in Public Housing–another $304 million, and homelessness, everybody claims to be concerned about homelessness and the growing number of women and children who are out their homeless but look they will take a $99 million dollar hit and on and on and on.
And so, we are here today, one more time, talking about women and children and families and how we can protect our women, children, and families and have a decent quality of life–sequestration will set us back. All of the gains that we have made will be lost with sequestration.

House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) has doubled down on his move to cut pensions for military veterans in a USA Today op-ed published Sunday.
In the op-ed, Ryan opens up by highlighting the CBO estimate that the deal he cut with Senate Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) would result in at least $20 billion in deficit reduction. “The Bipartisan Budget Act that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and I drafted will soon become law,” Ryan wrote. “We think it’s a small step toward fiscal discipline in Washington. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will reduce the deficit over the next ten years by over $20 billion. And unlike current law, it will provide much-needed relief to our already strained defense budget.”
As Breitbart News has reported, Ryan’s and Murray’s budget deal does not reduce the deficit. In fact, the deal raises the deficit by at least $15.5 billion because of a series of gimmicks that Ryan and Murray employed in the accounting of the deal — namely, double counting of savings like the tactic which was employed in Obamacare, and the failure to include an estimate of the interest on the borrowed money for the first couple of years of increased spending. These are only a few among a series of other misleading statements Ryan has made about the deal. 


The rest of Ryan’s op-ed is devoted to defending his decision to cut $6 billion worth of military pensions. “One part of the bill has become particularly controversial: the reduction in cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for working-age military retirees,” Ryan wrote. “The federal government has no greater obligation than to keep the American people safe and we must take care of the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line. For that reason, Congress is understandably hesitant to make changes to military compensation. But even hesitance has a cost.” Citing the rising cost per service member since 2001, he then claimed that the need for reform is “undeniable.”
Ryan cited and praised President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel for his stance on the issue as well. Ryan wrote, “Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a combat vet himself, has said ‘that we can no longer put off military compensation reform. DOD’s leadership, Chairman Dempsey, the service chiefs, the service secretaries, and myself, we all know that we need to slow cost growth in military compensation. Otherwise, we’ll have to make disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization.'”
Ryan then detailed what he says the changes to military veterans’ pensions would specifically do to veterans:


Here’s what the new law will do. We make no changes for those currently at or above age 62. This reform affects only younger military retirees. Right now, any person who has served 20 years can retire–regardless of age. That means a serviceman who enlists at 18 becomes eligible for retirement at 38. The late 30s and early 40s are prime working years, and most of these younger retirees go on to second careers.

Ryan characterized the change as a “small adjustment” in the next paragraph, even though he admitted it could affect veterans by as much as $100,000 or more over their lifetimes, depending on when they retire.
“All this reform does is make a small adjustment for those younger retirees,” Ryan wrote. “If they retire before age 62, the annual increase in their retired pay will be 1% less than the inflation rate. In other words, their benefits will grow every year–just at a slower rate. And when the retiree hits 62, DOD will recalculate the retired pay so that it will be where it would have been if he or she had received the full inflation adjustment every year since he or she retired.” Ryan then calculated that, for a hypothetical serviceman who enlisted at 18 and retired at 38, his benefits would change under the deal from about $1.8 million to $1.7 million. 
“This is a far more modest reform than other bipartisan proposals, some of which would have fully eliminated the adjustments for inflation for working-age retirees,” Ryan wrote.
Despite Ryan’s claims these cuts are a “small adjustment” for veterans, that approximately $100,000, in some parts of the country, could be a significant percentage of the entire size of a mortgage for a house. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, in October the average size of a home loan in America was $289,650. Ryan’s “small adjustment” cuts to veterans would be more than a third, then, of the average mortgage — and in many cases, more than half of these veterans’ lifetime expenses for homeownership.
The Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) estimates that the cuts could mean as much as $124,000 in lost retirement income for veterans, which would be even more significant losses of opportunity in the future for veterans.

Ryan argued that the approximately $6 billion in savings that cutting the pensions for America’s military veterans would garner for the federal treasury would “go right back to the military.”
“In 2012, Congress established the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to examine the entire military-compensation system from top to bottom,” Ryan wrote. “The commission’s recommendations are due in May, and the leaders of the armed-services committees in Congress have agreed to consider their recommendations and look for other ways to reform the system. That’s why this reform does not take effect until the end of 2015 — it gives Congress ample time to consider alternatives.”
Ryan said that for America to be able to afford the best equipment on the battlefield for active duty military, these pension cuts are necessary.
“For me, there’s simply no choice between responsible reforms of military compensation and making what our military leadership has called ‘disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization,'” Ryan wrote. “Every time we kick the can down the road, we put our troops’ combat readiness at risk. This agreement put forward one reform option, and I invite others to do the same. Our troops have been willing to sacrifice everything for this country. We owe it to them to give them the best equipment on the battlefield and a secure retirement when they come home.”
In his op-ed, Ryan did not address the proposal in the House of Representatives gaining significant attention already from Reps. Martha Roby (R-AL) and Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA). Roby’s and Fitzpatrick’s plan would restore pensions for all military veterans and offset the savings those cuts create with savings from closing a loophole allowing illegal aliens access to the Refundable Child Tax Credit. Closing that loophole would save $7 billion — more than enough to ensure that the Pentagon gets the money it needs to buy top-notch military equipment.
Since Ryan and Murray’s budget deal increases spending and increases the federal deficit, many conservatives and even mainstream Republicans wonder why veterans’ pensions should be cut when there is wasteful spending like leaving that tax credit loophole open, or many of the new details that Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) detailed in his “Wastebook,” among other examples of wasteful spending.
Last week, Ryan avoided discussing the proposal when asked by Breitbart News about it. Instead, his spokesman Kevin Seifert said Ryan supports closing that illegal alien tax credit loophole but also supports cutting military pensions. Seifert would not answer when pressed on whether Ryan would back the Roby-Fitzpatrick plan, which is a House version of a Senate amendment Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, attempted to attach to the deal but could not due to the procedural blocking of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
Now that he is backing up his decision to cut veterans’ pensions, Ryan has taken a stance that is directly averse to the the Roby-Fitzpatrick plan — something that could put Ryan at odds with a majority of the House GOP conference. Including Roby and Fitzpatrick, a total of 46 House Republicans have signed on to their bill as cosponsors. Powerful committee chairmen like House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and House Rules Committee chairman Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) have also cosponsored the Roby-Fitzpatrick deal. This could foreshadow a battle between House GOP power players for the future direction of the conference.

With President Obama set to precipitate a constitutional crisis over the upcoming debt ceiling, Republicans in Congress must now stand up to the bullying commander in chief. 
Yesterday, after the fiscal cliff had been passed through Congress, President Obama claimed victory. “Just recently,” he told supporters, “Republicans in Congress said they’d never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. We’ve now raised those rates, permanently, making our tax code more progressive than it’s been in decades.”


But more important than Obama’s triumphalism was his insistence that he will not – repeat, will not – negotiate over the debt ceiling. At all. “While I will negotiate over many things,” Obama said, “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed.” Of course, Obama has racked up those bills, and it is he who refuses to pay the freight with any cuts whatsoever. But now he’s declaring the unilateral authority to avoid discussing the debt ceiling. “What the president was saying was, ‘I’m not going to play chicken with the debt limit,'” said Jen Psaki, Obama’s spokeswoman.

Under the Constitution of the United States, the House of Representatives has the power of the purse strings. It is Congress that decides whether or not to incur more debt, not the president. And yet Obama has essentially stated that he will not stand for any negotiation surrounding that Congressional power.
That’s tyrannical. But unlike in the past, the Democrats in Congress are willing to go along with such systemic perversion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has shown himself quite willing to give Obama unlimited power to raise the debt ceiling. 
So the question now is whether Republicans will stand strong against this unconstitutional aggression from President Obama. In 2011, Republicans in Congress caved, and ended up with the pathetic fiscal cliff proposal that set up massive tax increases and an across-the-board cut. Then they made that cave complete in order to avoid those default tax increases.
Now, however, they have a second chance to stand tall. But they will have to stand together, and they will have to hold Obama’s feet to the fire. The issue of the debt ceiling is about more than spending. It is about whether we have a Constitutional system worth preserving, or whether the President should be allowed to run roughshod over it. Speaker of the House John Boehner has been re-elected — and in achieving re-election, he has given himself a second bite at an apple he missed in 2011, during that disastrous debt ceiling debate. The time for compromise is finished. Our thug president ended it. Republicans must realize that, and act accordingly.

On Saturday, an estimated 1.3 million long-term unemployed Americans will lose their unemployment insurance benefits. For the first time since 2008, Congress failed to extend the benefits went it passed a budget just before Christmas. The Obama Administration has warned that more than 4 million unemployed could lose benefits next year unless Congress passes another extension. 
In the past, states provided unemployed workers with up to 26 weeks of benefits. At the start of the recession, the federal government provided extra weeks of assistance. During the depths of the recession, federal and state governments provided 99 weeks of cash payments. For those keeping score at home, that is almost 2 years of financial assistance. The average benefit is around $1,100 a month. 
The expiration of benefits for the long-term unemployed has already sparked a round of finger-pointing in Washington. On Friday, the left-wing Huffington Post put much of the blame on Democrats. “The record indicates that Democrats were late to show up, distracted in part by other concerns,” HuffPo reported. “A month and a half before the deadline, few members of Congress or administration officials were even talking about unemployment insurance.”


Extending the benefits for another year would cost the government $25 billion. The left argues that this assistance helps the economy, by giving the unemployed cash to purchase consumer goods. The Congressional Budget Office has even estimated that extending benefits for the unemployed creates around 200,000 jobs. 
This argument is absurd. It is the fiscal policy version of the “broken windows” economic fallacy. If all my windows were broken, I would have to spend a lot of money replacing them. This would theoretically boost the economy by providing work for glaziers and other workers. This does not factor, however, what else I could have done with my money. It is likely that it could have been spent or invested far more productively than simply replacing what I already had. 
If the government wants to extend unemployment benefits for another year, it will have to borrow $25 billion. The cost of this will actually increase over time, as the government pays interest on this debt. These are resources that can’t be used for anything else, whether its infrastructure improvements or tax reform. 

A bigger problem than the duration of unemployment benefits, is the number of the long-term unemployed. More than 4 million Americans looking for work have been unemployed for more than 27 weeks, beyond the time-frame of traditional unemployment insurance. The recession officially ended more than 4 years ago. Such a large number of long-term unemployed suggests deeper problems with the economy than can be fixed by simply adding additional benefits. 
Absurdly, at the same time the left is pushing for an extension of unemployment benefits, it is also pushing to hike the minimum wage. If someone has been unemployed for 99 weeks, mandating higher wages is unlikely to be of much help. Minimum wage hikes, at least at the margin, have a negative impact on job creation. 
Extending unemployment benefits may itself be counter-productive for job creation. A landmark study from Sweden found that more generous unemployment benefits increased the rates of unemployment. The relationship was very robust. Every 1% point increase in benefits increased unemployment by 5%.  
In 2007, Sweden reformed its unemployment insurance system. The government provides 60 weeks of benefits, but on a sliding scale. The longer someone is unemployed, the less they receive in assistance. This system provides a powerful incentive to find work. 
It is perhaps telling that, in 2013, we are in such a state that American lawmakers should look to Sweden for economic reforms.

House Republican leaders reportedly did not bring any immigration bills to the floor before the August recess because they were fearful of the backlash they would get from voters in their districts during the break.
According to a report in the National Journal, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA), and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) think the “tactical play” will “boost” the reform’s changes. 

Breitbart News reporter Matthew Boyle reported ten days ago that House Republicans were planning to pass various piecemeal bills and hope to conference with the Senate to get a more comprehensive bill enacted. Conservatives expressed to Boyle their concerns that conferencing with senators–and potentially the White House–would transform whatever is passed in the House into something resembling the Senate’s bill, which Numbers USA Executive Director Roy Beck said, on Breitbart News Sunday, was an “end of America” bill.


Last Friday, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) essentially made the strategy public at a town hall event in his district, confirming Boyle’s reporting. 
National Journal noted that House Republican leaders wanted to keep immigration “on the back-burner” to lessen the type of “backlash” that coalesced against Obamacare in August 2009.  
As Politico reported, five “a la carte” immigration bills have already passed two key committees in the House while the Senate was debating its immigration bill. 
Bills passed in either the Homeland Security or Judiciary Committees include a border security bill that has weaker provisions than the Senate’s, a plan to award 500,000 visas to agricultural workers, which “can be adjusted according to market needs,” a bill to lift the current cap on high-skilled visas, a bill to give states more power to enforce federal immigration laws, and an E-Verify trigger that will make newly-legalized immigrants “undocumented” again if E-Verify is not in place by five years.

In a desperate attempt to get California’s budgetary nightmares under control, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown pushed for a tax hike plan last November to increase the state’s overall tax rate on millionaires to the highest in the nation at 13.3%.  But now, experts say Brown’s actions may be sparking a tax migration for the high income earners whom the state relies on to pay its bills.
“You’d be a fool not to leave California,” says Ed Botowsky of Chapwood Investments who manages the finances of several professional athletes and high income Californians.  Botowsky says some of his clients have already made the decision to flee the state to avoid the tax crunch.
Seven states including Florida, Texas, and Nevada do not have a state income tax.  That can mean big savings for millionaires willing to make the move.  Tiger Woods’s move from California to Florida will save him an estimated $7.5 million in taxes this year alone.  His golf rival, Phil Mickelson, who recently expressed concern over California’s tax squeeze, could save $8 million this year by following Tiger’s lead. 


An estimated 62.7% of California’s general revenue fund comes from personal income taxes.  With roughly 41% of the state’s entire revenue coming from the top 1% of California income earners, the state is especially vulnerable to even modest fluctuations in the migration of its millionaires.  

“The higher reliance on personal income tax is a double-edged sword,” said Fitch Ratings Senior Director Douglas Offerman.
Michael Genest, who formerly ran California’s state finance department, says he worries what will happen if the millionaire migration dries up the revenues Gov. Jerry Brown is banking on.
“What happens if revenues fall through the floor? He’s going to be right back where we were in 2008,” Genest said.
The recent 5% federal tax increase on high earners, coupled with California’s 13.3% state income tax, may prove more than millionaires are willing to take, especially since they have options and can move easily.
“They’re going to have an exodus of people,” said John Karaffa, president of ProSport CPA, a Virginia-based firm that represents nearly 300 professional athletes, primarily in basketball and football. “I think they’ll see some [leave California] for sure. They were already a very high tax state and it’s getting to a point where folks have to make a business decision as well as a lifestyle decision.”

According to the press release, this coming June the Washinghton Examiner will cease all local coverage to focus instead on “investigative reporting and commentary on issues affecting national legislation and policy.” 
Other than a weekly magazine focusing on “political thought leadership,” the outlet will also end publication (which is now daily) in June and move all its resources online. 


The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple is reporting that as many as 87 layoffs are expected. 

From the press release:
Clarity Media Group today announced that daily newspaperThe Washington Examiner will shift its business model in June, becoming a digital platform and weekly print magazine focused on political thought leadership

The new product, set to launch June 17, will offer news, analysis, investigative reporting and commentary on issues affecting national legislation and policy across a number of key areas. The website will continue to engage millions of visitors nationwide with web-only reporting and commentary throughout the day, complemented by WEX-branded digital and social media. The target readership for the print weekly will be 45,000 government, public affairs, advocacy, academia and political professionals in Washington, DC and state capitals.

Layoffs have also been announced:

Many of the business and editorial positions needed to publish a local daily newspaper are not required as we move to focus on national and political coverage,” said Mr. McKibben. “The employees being laid off should be proud of their achievements in creating The Washington Examiner, and Clarity is grateful for the role they have played in giving the Examiner the strong presence it has in Washington.” 
Among the employees staying to launch and run the new website and publication are editor Stephen G. Smith, executive editor Mark Tapscott, and managing editor of digital Jennifer Peebles. Several other executives on the business side will remain to lead the effort. In addition, 20 positions will be created for the new digital platform and weekly publication.

On ABC’s This Week, hosted by Martha Raddatz, Speaker of the House John Boehner appeared to downplay the problem of national debt while loudly proclaiming his wonderful relationship with President Obama. “The president and I, as I have made very clear, have a very good relationship. We’re open with each other. We’re honest with each other,” said Boehner. 

“Do you trust President Obama?” Raddatz asked. 

“Absolutely,” Boehner replied.

“Absolutely?” Raddatz emphasized.
“Absolutely,” Boehner repeated.

Framing Republicans as out-of-touch radicals, Raddatz then asked, “President Obama says these meetings are intended to find members of the common-sense caucus who he can make a deal with …. Are you not a member of the common-sense caucus?”
Boehner, falling for the trap, shot back, “I’m part of the common-sense caucus. We appreciate the outreach. We appreciate the engagement from the president. But it’s gonna take more than this if we’re serious about solving our problems.”
Then Boehner dropped the bombshell. Raddatz, after quoting President Obama saying we don’t have “an immediate crisis in terms of debt,” asked Boehner for his thoughts. And Boehner eagerly agreed: “We do not have an immediate debt crisis. But we all know that we have one looming …. It could be a year or two years, three years, four years. It’s not an immediate problem.” And then Boehner said he agreed with Obama on the immediacy of the problem.

With Republicans fighting tooth and nail to implement solutions necessary to reducing the national debt, Boehner’s language certainly undermines the public relations narrative set by conservatives. A House GOP aide angrily told Breitbart News today, “This undercuts the fight House conservatives have waged since 2010. Our efforts to prevent a debt crisis we will certainly face should never be minimized.”

 Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.
            ABC News White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl questioned Press Secretary Jay Carney on Obama’s sequester predictions:
KARL: Jay, even before we heard from Secretary LaHood, we’ve heard some dire warnings coming from the administration.  Just to tick through a few, we’ve heard about more wildfires, more workplace deaths, higher risk of terrorism, criminals set free.  Is there any exaggeration going on here?MR. CARNEY:  I think all of those things come from reduced numbers of people fighting fires, reduced numbers of people doing inspections of our food, reduced numbers of people engaging in air traffic control.  I mean, those are just the facts, Jon.KARL: No other way to squeeze 3 percent out of the federal budget?MR. CARNEY:  I think we had this colloquy yesterday.  The fact of the matter is that you are talking about a 13 percent cut in our defense budget and 9 percent cut in our nondefense discretionary budget this year.  And there is no way to do that, based on the way the law is written, without having hugely negative impacts on individuals and families.  Furloughs would have to happen.  Layoffs would have to happen.  That is a fact. And it’s not just us saying this.  You don’t believe us, maybe you believe the CBO.  Maybe you believe Macroeconomics Advisers or Moody’s.  They have projected fully a half a percentage point reduction in GDP growth.  And you know, because you cover this stuff, what that means economically.  They have projected three-quarters of a million people will lose their jobs if the sequester takes effect and stays in effect.Those are real-world consequences.  These are real people.  It’s not political leverage.  It’s a fact.  And we’re out there making clear that this is an important issue to deal with because of the real-world implications.  The reason why the President continues to put forward and we made clear again on paper what we have been making clear all along, the President’s very reasonable offer remains on the table because he wants to avoid this.Let’s just, again, go back to my basic point.  It is not an easy sell to Democrats to go along as part of a big deal with superlative CPI.  It is not an easy argument necessarily to get Democrats to go along with the reforms that the President has put in place in his proposal on entitlement reforms or with the spending cuts.  It was not easy to sign into law $1.1 trillion in spending cuts.  But he has done it, and Democrats have done it.  And what we haven’t seen from Republicans is anything equivalent.  And we’re just looking for a negotiating partner here.  We’re just looking for somebody to meet us halfway.

8298	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/23/Allen-West-Policies-like-amnesty-driving-up-black-unemployment-lead-to-things-like-Knock-Out-Game	Opinion	0	Economy	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Col. Allen West, former GOP U.S. Congressman from Florida, said at a Thursday morning panel focused on the devastating economic impacts of amnesty that economic policies that displace black youths from jobs–like President Barack Obama’s immigration policies–have led to fads like the “knockout game.”
The panel, hosted by the nonpartisan pro-jobs group Americans4Work and featuring West and other leaders on immigration policy, focused intensely on how the economy has not gotten better around the country for many groups of Americans, including the black community. They noted how the immigration policies proposed by the president and some in Congress would not help the situation.
West and fellow panelist Professor Jan Ting of Temple University were discussing what they called the “new normal” in America–how Americans are not succeeding independent of the government in record numbers.


“What we don’t want to see happening in the United States of America is this second and third generation of welfare,” West said. “That becomes the new normal. When you look and see your mother and your father or your grandmother or your aunt or uncle, whoever is raising you, that they were born in Section Eight housing, their kids were in Section Eight housing. And therefore, you think there is no place else for me to go but Section Eight housing.”
West said such levels of dependency on the government “affects your level of self-esteem.”
“That affects your ability to, to be a part of an American dream,” he said. “And, I think, the big problem that you see if this, a, situation continues to exacerbate itself, then the safety net is no longer a safety net. The safety net becomes a hammock. And therefore, you have to have an increase of government spending because you’re going to expand and grow this welfare nanny-state.”

Wets noted that the “exorbitant amount of spending” from the federal government on means-tested welfare programs, and what he describes as a diversion of the food stamps program from what it was originally intended to accomplish, leads America “in the wrong direction.”
“And, again, it comes to the fundamental question, are we going to promote an opportunity society or are we going to promote a dependency society?” West asked. “What is the problem if we head down this road? You’re going to have more Detroits. And think about what Detroit used to be. Think about what Detroit used to look like. And guess what? You have this–and this is something that is absolutely driving me crazy, this knockout game.”
West noted that many of those teens involved in the knockout game would have, in his day, had jobs in their towns and would not be engaged in this behavior. But since the economic and education systems created by the left–including immigration policy which allows foreign workers into the country to compete with them for jobs–they have nothing to do but engage in violence.
“Well, guess what? If you have all of these inner-city black teenagers that have nothing to do, their education system is failing them. Well, in the summertime, I knew I could go down to McDonald’s or Burger King, you know, Baskin Robbins, somewhere,” he recalled. “I would go and get my little part-time summer job. They don’t even have those options now. So, what are they doing? They’re going out and they’re beating on people. For what? For fun.” 
“This is what happens when the policies are creating more dependence,” West explained. “They’re creating more despair. It’s creating more despondency. And it’s only going to get worse if we don’t turn it around.”

West also addressed amnesty’s devastating impact on the black community’s employment opportunities. When West was asked why the Congressional Black Caucus has been silent on the matter, he responded that “it just goes back to who is your master.”
“I think that they [the Congressional Black Caucus] are more so interested in the interests of the Democratic Party and their agenda rather than the people that they were sent here to Washington, D.C. to serve,” West said. “I’ll go back to a statement that the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Emanuel Cleaver, made, and I asked him about this. But he said that if there was anyone other than President Obama sitting in the White House that we would be marching on the White House when you look at the numbers as far as unemployment in the black community.”

West added that Cleaver said: “We give deference to President Obama for that.”
“So, you know, there is something wrong here,” West said. “And you’re right. When you look at our inner cities, America cannot recover economically unless we do something about our inner cities. If that continues to be the, the weak part of our economy, it will continue to drag the rest of this country down. Because there will be more resources poured into the welfare and nanny state instead of the economic opportunity.”
West said lawmakers and leaders need to be “very careful” with regard to the “trust and confidence that the American people have right now in government.” 

“In 1986, let’s remember, we went down the path,” West said. “We had an amnesty program. But there were certain requirements that the federal government were supposed to undertake and they never did. And so, this problem has been exacerbated.”
The failures of Obamacare, West said, have also played into Americans’ mistrust of government, another reason why an amnesty program would not be a good thing.
“Right now, if anyone goes out before the American people and they say ‘comprehensive,’ everyone is running the other way because we have a comprehensive health care plan that we’re dealing with right now,” West said. “So, again, I think, that you need to look at this in multiple ways.” 
“I mean, it affects your national security. It affects your economy. It affects your education. It affects your health care. It affects your local criminality,” he stated. “We can get to the point where we have some type of guest worker program. There’s no doubt about that especially in the agricultural industry.”
But before any type of immigration legislation adds to the amount of workers in the country, West said there must be “an economy that is growing”; compared to 1986, he said the economy now is in much worse shape.
“We need to have manufacturing coming back to the United States of America,” West said. “And, Senator [Jeff] Sessions talked about the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] numbers being up. Because on average 0.9 percent GDP growth over each year over the past five or six years. This time in Ronald Reagan’s economy, we were 7.2 percent GDP growth, big difference.” 
“So, why are we talking about flooding more people into a workforce where the GDP that is barely, you know, making it, it cannot sustain itself really, a debt to GDP ration which is upside down where we are owing more than we’re, we’re producing, we cannot take more people coming to this workforce,” he explained.

Senate Democratic leaders wrote a letter to President Barack Obama to let him know they would support him if he raised the nation’s debt ceiling unilaterally, without congressional approval, by either invoking the 14th Amendment or using some other legal justification
In a letter signed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Senate Democratic Policy Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and other Democrats and dated Jan. 11, the Democratic Senate leaders wrote they believed Obama “must be willing to take any lawful steps” to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling.
They wrote: 



In the event that Republicans make good on their threat by failing to act, or by moving unilaterally to pass a debt limit extension only as part of unbalanced or unreasonable legislation, we believe you must be willing to take any lawful steps to ensure that America does not break its promises and trigger a global economic crisis–without Congressional approval, if necessary.



The leaders also warned House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to not allow conservative members of Congress to hold the nation’s economy and reputation “hostage” during the upcoming negotiations concerning raising the debt ceiling. 
Last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said if she had a choice, she would invoke the 14th Amendment “in a second” to raise the debt ceiling if she were president. 
Democrats want Obama to raise the debt ceiling unilaterally because they do not want to cut spending, which Republicans will demand in return for authorizing the debt ceiling to be raised.
During the last round of debt ceiling negotiations in the summer of 2011, Obama was asked if he would invoke the 14th Amendment to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling. 
Obama replied then that he had talked to his lawyers, and they were “not persuaded that that is a winning argument.”

Speaking to the conservative Ripon Society on Tuesday, Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) admitted that he screwed up the public relations aspect of the fiscal cliff negotiations:

Looking back, what I should have done the day after the election was to make it clear the House has passed a bill to extend all of the current tax rates, the House has passed a bill to replace the sequester with cuts in mandatory spending, and the Senate ought to do its work. We’re ready, able and willing to work with the Senate as soon as they produce a bill. It should have been what I said. You know, again, hindsight is 20-20.

Instead, Boehner opened the negotiations with a press conference announcing Republican concessions. In an attempt to appear temperate and moderate, Boehner discarded the principle that Republicans would not embrace higher taxes – a move that Obama quickly turned against Boehner, insisting that higher taxes would be the solution to any debt crisis.

Boehner now recognizes the problem with his strategy, and vows not to engage in any one-on-one negotiations with Obama in the future; instead, he says he will only allow bills to be passed in the House, then in the Senate, as provided for by the Constitution. The House threat to Boehner’s speakership, which was covered in depth by Breitbart News, apparently frightened Boehner enough to change course. “You have no idea the suspicions and the undercurrents that [negotiations with Obama] caused, frankly, a lot of my members,” said Boehner. “It really has, in fact, caused somewhat of a breach that I’ve been in the middle of trying to repair.” 
Boehner is engaged in rehabilitating his image, attempting to overcome perceptions that he has the tendency to cave to President Obama:

Some of our members don’t realize that while I may be a nice enough guy, and I get along with people, when I was voting I had the 8th most conservative voting record in the House. But a lot of our newer members – they don’t know that. And so, you know, they think I’m some squish, that I’m ready to sell them out in a heartbeat, when obviously, most of you in this room know that that ain’t quite who I am.
The best way to overcome that perception is to stand up to the bully president. Unless Boehner embraces that truth, he will continue to lose favor among members of his own caucus.

Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) had a dire prediction for America about sequestration, claiming that 170 million jobs would be lost as a result of the across-the-board cuts. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only about 140 million jobs in the whole country.
During a press conference on February 28, Waters told reporters of a visit by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke who told members of congress that sequestration is not the optimal way to cut the federal budget.
Talking of Bernanke’s comments, Waters claimed that “if sequestration takes place, that’s going to be a great setback. We don’t need to be having something like sequestration that’s going to cause these jobs losses, over 170 million jobs that could be lost.”


However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Table A-9, Selected Employment Indicators, in January of 2013 there were 141,614 million jobs in the current American economy.
Using Waters’ math, the US would lose about 30 million more jobs than it had to start with.

Yesterday we did have Mr. Bernanke in our committee and he came to tell us what he’s doing with quantitative easing and that is trying to stimulate the economy with the bond purchases that he’s been doing because he’s trying to keep the interest rates low and create jobs–and he said that if sequestration takes place, that’s going to be a great setback. We don’t need to be having something like sequestration that’s going to cause these jobs losses, over 170 million jobs that could be lost–and so he made it very clear he’s not opposed to cuts but cuts must be done over a long period of time and in a very planned way rather than this blunt cutting that will be done by sequestration.
As you know in this committee we have all of HUD and HUD is responsible for so many programs that determine the quality of life for women and families. CBDG, a form of grant programs will be cut by $153 million dollars. These are grants to cities that help with women and children and low-income programs.
We also will cut the Home Program by $52 million if sequestration takes place, Native American Housing grants by $34 million, House and Choice grants $113 million, Public Housing–mostly single women in Public Housing–another $304 million, and homelessness, everybody claims to be concerned about homelessness and the growing number of women and children who are out their homeless but look they will take a $99 million dollar hit and on and on and on.
And so, we are here today, one more time, talking about women and children and families and how we can protect our women, children, and families and have a decent quality of life–sequestration will set us back. All of the gains that we have made will be lost with sequestration.

Senate Budget Committee Republican staff on Thursday released a description of what they claim is a “major flaw” in the immigration reform plan being pushed by the bipartisan “Gang of Eight”–a loophole that will end up being a multi-trillion dollar entitlement spending increase, with the burden falling on American taxpayers. 
“According to what has been publicly reported about the Gang of Eight’s forthcoming immigration bill, there appears to be a major flaw that could allow millions of illegal immigrants to access federal welfare benefits and poverty programs,” the GOP Budget Committee staff wrote in a statement to media. 




“Specifically, there is nothing in the framework to apply federal public charge law to those in the country illegally before they are granted legal status. What this means is that the bill would create an end-run around federal law: individuals in the country illegally could receive legal status without having to demonstrate financial self-sufficiency.”
The statement adds that the Senators in the Gang of Eight “have suggested that cost will not be an issue because amnestied illegal immigrants will not be eligible for certain public aid and welfare programs during a temporary period of probationary legal status (although even this is in growing doubt given the outcome of the relevant vote during the recent consideration of the Senate budget).”

“But, crucially, once this status ends and they become eligible for green cards, those who illegally immigrated will have access to a wide array of public assistance programs,” they wrote. 
“Green card holders are currently eligible for Medicaid, TANF, Supplemental Security Income, child care assistance, food stamps, and a variety of other welfare benefits and public aid programs. The Budget Committee Republican staff estimates that costs could be upwards of $40 billion in 2022 alone, just for Medicaid and Obamacare. The long-term unfunded liability for Obamacare would grow another $2 trillion.”
The statement notes that existing federal law is being overlooked in the rush to pass comprehensive immigration reform: “The net costs would be enormous and only increase once citizenship is granted (and would extend to our nation’s retirement programs as well). Additionally, during their probationary status, there are still a number of ways previously illegal immigrants could draw means-tested public aid for their households–which is the reason why federal law deems all immigrants likely to be a public charge inadmissible to the country regardless of whether they are applying for temporary, permanent, or any other form of legal status.”
Read the whole statement here. 
Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s spokesman Alex Conant responded to that analysis by saying: “Since we don’t yet have a legislative proposal, it’s not possible to come up with anything resembling an accurate calculation about the potential fiscal impact of bipartisan immigration reform. Obviously we share concerns about the potential fiscal impact of changes to our immigration system, which is why we will ask for an in-depth CBO analysis to inform debate around the bipartisan proposal. Senator Rubio has been clear that he will only support legislation that prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving any Federal benefits, and in our negotiations, the Democrats have gone along with that demand – even agreeing to a partial repeal of Obamacare to bar undocumented immigrants benefits. In the long-term, there’s no question that modernizing our broken legal immigration will be very good for our nation’s economy.”

When the House votes on Tuesday evening (or potentially right after midnight early Wednesday morning), House Republicans will likely be divided into two camps: Team Boehner and Team Cantor.
Those who vote for the bill will be on Team Boehner and those who oppose it will be on Team Cantor. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is backing the bill, and conservative groups like FreedomWorks are opposing it.


House Speaker John Boehner is, according to some media accounts and several Republican members, prepared to vote in favor of the the Senate “fiscal cliff” deal that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Vice President Joe Biden cut late on New Year’s Eve, which passed by an 89-8 margin. Boehner aides haven’t answered requests for confirmation of these rumors and reports. The National Review‘s Robert Costa reports that Boehner won’t personally vote unless his vote is needed to pass the plan through the House.
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will be taking a different path. He’ll be voting against the bill, and according to some offices, he’s been the organizing power behind House GOP opposition to the deal.
That means the number one and number two House Republicans will be heading in completely different directions when the “fiscal cliff” vote happens. 

Some conservatives, like Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, who plan to vote against the bill expect it to pass anyway. And that may end up happening. But the internal House GOP fight is far from over with this vote.
Boehner suffered politically after his failure to pass his fiscal cliff “Plan B” before Christmas, and now that he’ll likely need Democratic votes to push this plan through he’s even weaker. 
That means Cantor, who’s wanted the speakership for a long time, could strike now and challenge Boehner in the election for House officeholders on Thursday–or he’ll likely have to wait at least another two years.
Cantor’s spokespersons Doug Heye and Rory Cooper both publicly tweeted denials. “Majority Leader Cantor stands with @SpeakerBoehner,” Heye wrote. “Speculation otherwise is silly, non-productive and untrue.”
“Folks out there w/ crazy theories about what’s going on in House,” Cooper wrote. “All ridiculous. Just figuring out best path forward. Stay calm, carry on.”
Cooper’s and Heye’s comments don’t negate the fact that Boehner and Cantor are deliberately taking drastically different stances heading into this vote. 
Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer even thinks Cantor may be going to make a move at Boehner. “It’s possible (Eric Cantor’s opposition to fiscal cliff bill) is the prelude to a challenge Thursday,” Krauthammer said on Fox News Channel’s Special Report on Tuesday evening. 
“It would be naked to do it at this late hour as a result of the split over this vote. Look, there are a lot of conservatives in the Republican caucus in the House who hate the bill and for good reason. This is a complete surrender on everything. The ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts is 40 to 1, rather than 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 or 1 to 3. So, I mean it’s a complete rout by the Democrats.”

On Thursday, President Obama took to the White House podium to triumphantly announce the end of the government shutdown. In doing so, he proclaimed that he wanted to push forward with other legislative priorities, including a budget, immigration reform, and the long-stalled pork-laden farm bill. 
“[I]n the coming days and weeks, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, a budget that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further,” Obama stated. Historically, “balanced” has been code for tax increases. 


Obama then pushed on to immigration reform: “Number two. We should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system.” Naturally, he blamed the Republican House for stalling his preferred immigration bill.

Finally, Obama called for the farm bill to be passed: “Number three. We should pass a farm bill, one that American farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the long-term certainty that they deserve.” And, disingenuously, he called for negotiations.
On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) echoed Obama, saying, “I look forward to the next venture, which is making sure we do immigration reform.” On Thursday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that Obama wanted immigration reform “more than anything else” during his second term. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-CA) said that he trusted that Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) would cave on immigration: “Once again, the speaker for the majority party is going to be placed in a position of deciding whether he’s going to put country before party and get something done. We just need a few courageous Republicans to stand up and say they’re ready.”
Republicans, however, pushed back. “It’s not going to happen this year,” said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID). “After the way the president acted over the last two or three weeks where he would refuse to talk to the speaker of the House…they’re not going to get immigration reform. That’s done.”

No one can argue with the fact that Paul Ryan’s compromise budget bill raises taxes and increases spending. Show me one Republican who got elected on that platform. Spare America the Orwellian word games. If the government is taking money out of your pocket to fund its growing Big Brother operations, it’s a tax. Whether money is taken from you via your phone bill, your airline ticket, or your income, it’s a tax. If politicians can’t be honest about this, it’s time to go home. 
The TEA Party’s very acronym stands for “Taxed Enough Already.” We sent these politicians to Congress in an historic landslide election in 2010 with a mandate to stop the runaway spending train bankrupting our nation, not to wave to it from the station or – heaven forbid – increase its speed. And yet, here we are still pretending that there are no real world consequences to running up near trillion dollar deficits year after year with no end in sight.


So, where does this leave us? We can sit back and accept the increased spending “Compromised Plan” with increases in taxes and spending, or we can charge ahead to at least preserve the very modest Sequester cuts American workers already fought for. If we go with the first option, we simply kick the can down the road yet again and wait for the inevitable real world consequences of bankruptcy (see Detroit for an example of what’s in store). Or we can go with the second option and probably get clobbered by the media (so what’s new?!).

The Political Establishment will no doubt tell us that a budget battle will distract us from the fight against Obamacare. But that excuse is just the latest variation in the Establishment’s old canard that they’re keeping their powder dry for the next big battle which never seems to materialize because they’re always too busy waving the white flag and following the path of least resistance until election day.
Enough is enough!
Here’s the deal, folks. The media will clobber us no matter what. We do not want more taxes. We want Congress to rein in spending and live within its means. (What’s so radical about that?!) Americans have gotten quite an education recently in wasteful government spending as we’ve all seen how the federal government can blow a billion dollars on a website that doesn’t work. 
Do these members of Congress really think they can justify every tax dollar they spend and still demand more from hard working Americans by increasing our taxes?
2014 is just around the corner. If any member of Congress thinks raising taxes and increasing wasteful spending is a winning strategy to run on, then by all means they should vote for the Ryan budget. We’ll be watching.

President Barack Obama will be making a major speech on the economy at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, a site with deep historical significance. 
Knox College was the location of the fifth of seven debates between Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, often known as the “Little Giant” for his small size but large influence in American politics, and Republican Abraham Lincoln.
At Knox, Lincoln and Douglas debated about the institution of slavery, whether it should be restricted in the territories, and its ongoing role in the Republic. Was slavery to remain a traditional, decaying institution left to choke and die under the original Constitution, or was it to be a permanent part of the American social fabric, possibly given new life in the Western territories?


The Lincoln-Douglas debates put Lincoln on the map politically, and even though he lost the 1858 Senate race to Douglas, he triumphed in the 1860 presidential election.
Obama also has a deep connection to Knox College, as it was the site of his 2005 speech on economics when he was a freshman senator. In that speech, he defended the power of government to boost the economy and increase economic opportunity.
Though many American statesmen, including Abraham Lincoln, have believed in government playing a role in building the American economy, Obama’s speeches have turned their philosophy on its head.

In his 2005 speech, Obama attacked the “ownership society” and made an argument for the collective good of government action. This philosophy is opposed to the individual liberty philosophy of the Founding Fathers and of Abraham Lincoln.
Obama said that Americans must have a “sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we’re all in it together and everybody’s got a shot at opportunity.
Obama was building up to the “you didn’t build that,” creed that became a key issue during the 2012 presidential campaign. This economic philosophy is fundamentally based on the principle that since individual success relies on the work of others, one owes the rest of society in the form of high taxes.
If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business–you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.
In essence, Obama has twisted the government “of the people, by the people, for the people” into a government that owns you. 

But this set of principles contradicts the idea of individual rights and the “self-made man” that Lincoln supported. 
Lincoln’s “beau ideal of a statesman” was Henry Clay of Kentucky, a Whig of the previous generation that helped craft the “American System” of economics. This system was in large part based on funding national infrastructure projects through tariffs, along with a national bank that would give the United States a sound system of money.
But Clay did not believe that individuals owed society anything, and he was famous for making the term “self-made man” popular. Clay, after defending corporations as a positive way for individuals to achieve success and get ahead in the world, said in a speech, “In Kentucky, almost every manufactory known to me, is in the hands of enterprising and self-made men, who have acquired whatever wealth they possess by patient and diligent labor.”
This philosophy of both economic development and an acknowledgement that the individual owns his own labor is based on a Lockean natural rights philosophy that permeated the American founding and has been at the cornerstone of nearly every major American political party. It would certainly be in line with Brietbart News’ own “Hamilton,” who very much represents the philosophy of Alexander Hamilton’s Federalists, Henry Clay’s Whigs, and Abraham Lincoln’s Republicans.
Given Obama’s previous speeches on economics, the philosophy that made America the greatest opportunity society in the world and ended the institution of slavery is unlikely to be heard at Knox College.

White House economic adviser Gene Sperling, who controversially told journalist Bob Woodward he would “regret” accusing the Obama administration of shifting the goalposts to include tax hikes in debate over the sequester, offered a misleading defense of the sequester on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley on Sunday.
Sperling told Crowley that the original intent of the sequester was “to force both sides to come back to the type of grand bargain that Bowles-Simpson have called for, that most budget experts call for…”. 


But President Barack Obama rejected the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission, even though he had established it to propose solutions to the country’s long-term budget crisis. 

As Woodward recalled in The Price of Politics, and as is easily confirmed by a variety of other sources, including former Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner, Obama rejected the Bowles-Simpson formula because he was not willing to accept reforms to the country’s entitlements, including Social Security. 
Obama and the Democrats wanted larger tax hikes and fewer cuts to spending and entitlements. Many Republicans, too, rejected the plan, largely because it left the massive new entitlement of Obamacare in place.
Moreover, as Woodward pointed out elsewhere in the book (and as Breitbart News highlighted long before Woodward’s claims about the sequester made him a White House target), it was Obama himself who scuttled a “grand bargain” by demanding additional revenues through tax hikes when a deal had been within reach.
Sperling’s revisionist history invites the question: if the sequester had been meant to encourage a grand bargain like Bowles-Simpson, why hasn’t Obama simply embraced Bowles-Simpson?
The obvious answer is that Obama had no intention of reaching a deal, and hoped to use the sequester as he used the “fiscal cliff”–to squeeze more concessions out of Republicans on tax rates, and to blame the opposition for whatever horrible economic outcomes the administration could conjure.

Conservative author and columnist Ann Coulter, a long and loyal supporter of New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie, told attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday that he was “off her list.” 
“Did you see his convention speech?” she asked the crowd. “It was really bad.  And I must say, though I loved Chris Christie, I’m now a single issue voter against amnesty, so Christie is off my list.”  She noted, however, that Senator Ted Cruz (R – TX) “is still on (her) list.” Coulter has hopes for Senator Marco Rubio (R – FL) but wondered, “Why on earth is Marco Rubio and these endless Republicans supporting [amnesty]?”
Governor Christie was not invited to the annual conference this year. The decision raised questions among conservatives again if Christie’s actions during the Romney-Ryan campaign, particularly towards the end damaged his credibility with the GOP’s conservative base. 


“This year, for better or for worse, we felt like he didn’t deserve to be on the all-star selection, and for decisions that he made,” CPAC Chairman Al Cardenas  told reporters. “And so hopefully next year he’s back on the right track and being a conservative.” Cardenas noted that Christie “is popular figure, but everyone needs to live by the parameters of the movement.”

Coulter said that she does not know who she is focused in on for 2016 but she described what kind of candidate should not be running. She previously supported former Republican Delaware Governor Pete du Pont, conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan, business mogul Steve Forbes, and former Congressman Duncan Hunter (R – CA). Coulter admitted she made mistakes with some of her past choices. 
“No, you can’t run a congressman. I have learned that. You cannot run a governor from a state that’s only as big as a congressional district. That’s the equivalent of running of congressman. We can’t run businessmen, pundits,” she said, adding, “People who have not run and won elections in at least a mid-size state. We’re looking at governors and senators. Once you throw in the governors and senators, let’s see how they debate, let’s see their positions then.”
Coulter was particularly critical of conservatives who put themselves before the movement. She pointed to the Senate races lost by Republicans in 2012. Coulter pointed to former Congressman Todd Akin’s unwillingness to drop out of the Senate race in Missouri and those who supported his decision. “Passion is great but in politics, scoring is all that counts,” she said.

The Obama Administration has decided to block access to public memorials on the National Mall as a result of the government shutdown. Like its decision to end White House tours when the sequester cuts took effect, there is no rational reason for this. The Park Police, nominally in charge of monitoring these spaces, isn’t even affected by the shutdown. Shutting off access to these sites is gratuitous and petulant. 
On Monday, the first day of the government shutdown, a number of WWII veterans showed up at a memorial to their service to find that access had been blocked. The memorial is in a public space and is open 24/7, with almost no oversight from Park Police personnel. (Who, by the way, are exempt from the government shutdown.) The White House was, according to reports, informed of the veterans’ visit and chose to block access.
Having lived in DC for 18 years, I can tell you, the WWII Memorial is simply an architectural structure in an open public space. There is no official “access” to it. There are no guards. It’s a building in a park. Yet, the Obama Administration tried to block veterans from viewing the public memorial, even after hearing about the planned visit. 


Fortunately, the “greatest generation” was having nothing of this and easily overcame the government barricades. (Do we yet again have to rely on this generation to show the promise of America?) 

On Wednesday, the veterans’ group is planning to visit the Lincoln Memorial, which the Obama Administration has also vowed to close to visitors. I have regularly visited this memorial at one or two in the morning. At those hours, it is a peaceful and reflective place. It is an open space. There is no access that needs to be blocked. It is only by a conscious decision, and a great deal of work, that access would be blocked. 
This is nothing more than a petulant response by the Obama Administration to the government shutdown. Over the next week, more than 500 WWII veterans are expected in DC to visit the memorial dedicated to their sacrifice. If the Park Police again try to erect barricades to this public space, it will be another sign that the Obama Administration has made an affirmative decision to separate itself from the American public. 
Obama chose this pass. He ought to be made to own it.

Conservatives on Twitter cried foul last January when the governor of New Jersey lashed out at Republicans for rightly scrapping the pork-laden Sandy Relief bill. Now Christie’s at it again – blaming the House GOP for not moving quickly enough to approve funds.
Joel Pollak and other conservatives on Twitter, today, remember the history, and were having none of Christie’s revisionism:



@govchristie Do you not understand legitimate objections to wasteful pork, opportunistically inserted into the bill? Or just not concerned?
— Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) April 30, 2013

@joelpollak All the pork was stripped out of bill prior to passage at the insistence of Republicans, myself included. Pls learn the facts.

@govchristie Respectfully, I believe the facts are otherwise. You insisted on passage of the original pork-laden bill shar.es/lpEXv

The entire reason you held a press conference was to berate Republicans for not passing the bill with the pork @govchristie

No, your criticism @govchristie was of House Republicans not passing the bill WITH all of the pork, stop rewriting history

You are “dead wrong” @govchristie, you held a press conference specifically about the House not passing the pork version of the bill

@govchristie You should just admit you are wrong on Sandy pork. You can’t boost yourself by bashing conservatives with false lefty memes.

And so it came to pass that the filibuster was dismembered, dishonored, and indefinitely detained. With the end of the filibuster came the end of any semblance of comity and compromise on Capitol Hill. 
The party that never seemed to care much for the rule of law broke the rules of the Senate to change the rules. Senate rules for two centuries allowed the filibuster. To change the rules required a two-thirds majority. 


When the Parliamentarian ruled that the Democrats were breaking the rules, the Democrats simply over-ruled the Parliamentarian. The rules, it seems, are not binding upon Democrats.
We shouldn’t be surprised that the party that believes in a living, breathing, ever-evolving Constitution might not believe that Senate rules are important.
We shouldn’t be surprised that the party that believes that morality is unfixed, unchained to any constants, that all ethics are situational, would break the rules.

Is anyone really surprised that a party with no apparent concern for the burden of debt they place on every American family, that such a party would break the rules to get their way?
We are told they are upset that the Senate takes too long. They want their way and they want it now. The ironfisted rule of rule breakers has begun. There will be no return. 
What passed for gridlock before will pale in comparison to the poison that seeps from the hands of those who are careless and reckless with the law.
Where the filibuster once created conversation, the ironfisted rule will stifle it.
For you see, contrary to popular belief, the filibuster actually fostered compromise, dialogue, and results. In exchange for release of nominations, in exchange for release of legislation, Republicans and Democrats would agree to votes.

The filibuster would encourage a reluctant president to cooperate with oversight from Congress.
Information about malfeasance or transparency could be pried from a President in exchange for relinquishing a hold or ending a filibuster. The filibuster was Congress’ tool to exert power or balance power with the president.
The loss of the filibuster weakens Congress and makes any executive, regardless of party, more powerful and less likely to be transparent.
In short, giving power to the party in the minority worked for two centuries to coax compromise.
In the era of filibusters and holds, someone like myself could put roadblocks in front of a Federal Reserve nominee. That hold could then be exchanged for a vote on a bill that had been held hostage for years, such as Audit the Fed.
Such compromise will no longer occur. The Senate will now be run with an iron fist, a fist clenched so tightly, a power wound so closely, that dissent will no longer be heard, debate will be stifled, and amendments to legislation will become non-existent.
The Senate has been described as the saucer that cools the tea that boils out of the cup that is the House of Representatives. The Senate was the saucer that cooled the tea, deliberated and gave review and time for calmer minds to prevail. The Senate was one of the items that our Founders established to separate our Republic from the whims of the majority, from the headlong dash of an unrestrained mob-ocracy.
The public will be burned more often as the Senate becomes less saucer and more boiling cauldron. The loss of the filibuster will lead to more.

The American Conservative Union (ACU), which runs the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), announced on Monday that Sarah Palin will speak at the 40th annual gathering of conservatives in March.
“We are pleased to again welcome Governor Sarah Palin to CPAC in March,” ACU Chairman Al Cardenas said in a statement. “Governor Palin electrified the crowd in 2012 and we are thrilled to welcome her back this year.”
CPAC 2013 will be held Thursday, March 14 through Saturday, March 16, 2013 at its new location in National Harbor, MD at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center. 


The non-Washington, D.C. location of this year’s conference is fitting for Palin, who blistered the permanent political class and crony capitalism during her 2012 address last year in the nation’s capital in her first appearance at the conference.
Last year, she was mobbed in the hallways before her speech. Palin stayed for nearly an hour after speaking, engaging conservatives and supporters who were there to listen to her. Reporters and observers at CPAC noted in 2012 they had not seen anyone who resonated with the conservative base more than Palin. 
At CPAC 2012, Palin said Washington, D.C. had become “something that our forefathers never envisioned, and they would have sworn their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor to change.”

Palin said the “old Washington of our Founders” was a place where people “came to serve your government, not prosper over it and on it and from it and off of it.” She mentioned the country’s wealthiest counties were all around the D.C. region, a theme director Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Schweizer’s Government Accountability Institute would later document a year later in “Boomtown.” 
She referenced her speech in Indianola, Iowa in 2011 when she spoke of “crony capitalism” that “isn’t the capitalism of free men and free markets, of risk and sacrifice, of innovation and hard work.” She said the new crony capitalism is one of “connections” and of “government bailout and handouts” and waste, “corporate welfare and corruption.” 
After her Indianola speech, “crony capitalism” and “permanent political class” were injected into the political vocabulary. 
“This is the capitalism of Barack Obama and the permanent political class,” Palin said at CPAC in 2012. 
She lambasted the Occupy protesters who were at the conference in 2012, saying they should be instead protesting at Obama’s White House, which has “spurred the expansion of government which diminishes freedom and opportunity for all to rise and to succeed.”

Palin derided politicians who come to Washington, D.C. “denouncing the place as the cesspool of corruption” only to, after a year or two, see it as a hot tub. 
“And they are hopping in and enjoying the jacuzzi,” Palin said, noting it was “time we drain the jacuzzi and throw the bums out with the bath water.”
After Palin turned down Fox News’ offer to renew her contract, she spoke exclusively to Breitbart News about her future. When asked what her response was to the mainstream media’s declarations that she and the Tea Party were “buried,” Palin said she was raised “to never retreat and to pick battles wisely, and all in due season.”
“When it comes to defending our republic, we haven’t begun to fight! But we delight in those who underestimate us,” Palin told Breitbart News last month.

California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Friday that a provision in House GOP leadership’s “no budget, no pay” plan is unconstitutional.
“That’s unconstitutional,” Issa said of House leadership’s plan to withhold the pay of members of Congress if they don’t pass a budget by April 15.
The plan offers to raise the debt ceiling for three months, and the Senate must pass a budget by the end of that time period-April 15. If they fail to pass the budget by April 15, members of Congress wouldn’t be paid.


Issa said that would interfere with the 27th amendment to the Constitution, which doesn’t allow pay for members of Congress to change until after an election. “No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened,” the 27th amendment reads.

Hours before, American Majority Action spokesman Ron Meyer also said the plan was unconstitutional for the same reason. Because of that, Meyer said “No Budget No Pay” couldn’t “take effect until next Congress.”
Meyer also said in an email that “numerous conservative members of the House have already come out and said they won’t vote for a plan which doesn’t cut spending.” At this time, it’s unclear if “No Budget No Pay” will cut any spending.
UPDATED (5:40pmET): In a statement to Breitbart News after this piece was published, Issa said he “strongly support[s] the House Republican leadership’s proposal to link the debt ceiling increase to passage of a budget by the Senate which has gone 1360 days without passing a blueprint for federal spending.  While the 27th Amendment prohibits Congress from varying its own pay within a given Congress, as I noted in my interview it can certainly withhold pay.  I have not read the legislative text of the ‘No Budget, No Pay’ proposal and how it approaches historically difficult questions about Congressional compensation.  I would note that there has even been legal action taken challenging the current system that gives Members of Congress an automatic pay-raise.  I have been an advocate for the strategy of linking a debt ceiling increase to passage of a budget as an effective way of forcing President Obama to focus on our nation’s long term fiscal situation.  I expect the final proposal brought before the House will have resolved any constitutional questions and that it will have my support.”

9139	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/25/Christmas-Obama-pay-raise	News	1	Economy	None	Positive	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Just in time for Christmas, President Obama signed an executive order on Monday giving a 1 percent pay raise for federal employees. The raise follows a four year hiatus from salary increases for federal workers, although most federal employees have apparently seen their pay increase via promotion or performance. The first increased paycheck will kick in on January 1.

President Obama’s reward to the federal workforce follows his longstanding belief that government work ought to be a first option for Americans. Nonetheless, Obama’s decision to raise federal pay only widens the income inequality gap between federal workers and private sector employees; as of 2011, the average private sector employee made $59,804 in salary, and $28,000 in benefits, while the average federal workers made $74,436 in salary and $40,000 in benefits.

Furthermore, the gap between Washington, D.C. culture and the rest of the country is growing ever larger. Between 2000 and 2012, according to Census Bureau statistics, Washington, D.C. household income jumped 23.3%; the rest of the country, by contrast, dropped 6.6%. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “The Washington, D.C. metro area — which includes the surrounding suburbs in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia — has it even better, with a median household income of $88,233 that ranks highest among the U.S.’s 25 most populous metro areas.”

But Washington, D.C. remains completely dichotomous, with the percentage of residents living 50% below the poverty line increasing 1% during that period.
President Obama’s Christmas present to his federal friends will amount to nothing more than another lump of coal in the rest of America’s stocking.

9140	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/24/Obama-at-Knox-College	News	1	Economy	None	SomewhatPositive	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

President Barack Obama will be making a major speech on the economy at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, a site with deep historical significance. 
Knox College was the location of the fifth of seven debates between Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, often known as the “Little Giant” for his small size but large influence in American politics, and Republican Abraham Lincoln.
At Knox, Lincoln and Douglas debated about the institution of slavery, whether it should be restricted in the territories, and its ongoing role in the Republic. Was slavery to remain a traditional, decaying institution left to choke and die under the original Constitution, or was it to be a permanent part of the American social fabric, possibly given new life in the Western territories?


The Lincoln-Douglas debates put Lincoln on the map politically, and even though he lost the 1858 Senate race to Douglas, he triumphed in the 1860 presidential election.
Obama also has a deep connection to Knox College, as it was the site of his 2005 speech on economics when he was a freshman senator. In that speech, he defended the power of government to boost the economy and increase economic opportunity.
Though many American statesmen, including Abraham Lincoln, have believed in government playing a role in building the American economy, Obama’s speeches have turned their philosophy on its head.

In his 2005 speech, Obama attacked the “ownership society” and made an argument for the collective good of government action. This philosophy is opposed to the individual liberty philosophy of the Founding Fathers and of Abraham Lincoln.
Obama said that Americans must have a “sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we’re all in it together and everybody’s got a shot at opportunity.
Obama was building up to the “you didn’t build that,” creed that became a key issue during the 2012 presidential campaign. This economic philosophy is fundamentally based on the principle that since individual success relies on the work of others, one owes the rest of society in the form of high taxes.
If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business–you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.
In essence, Obama has twisted the government “of the people, by the people, for the people” into a government that owns you. 

But this set of principles contradicts the idea of individual rights and the “self-made man” that Lincoln supported. 
Lincoln’s “beau ideal of a statesman” was Henry Clay of Kentucky, a Whig of the previous generation that helped craft the “American System” of economics. This system was in large part based on funding national infrastructure projects through tariffs, along with a national bank that would give the United States a sound system of money.
But Clay did not believe that individuals owed society anything, and he was famous for making the term “self-made man” popular. Clay, after defending corporations as a positive way for individuals to achieve success and get ahead in the world, said in a speech, “In Kentucky, almost every manufactory known to me, is in the hands of enterprising and self-made men, who have acquired whatever wealth they possess by patient and diligent labor.”
This philosophy of both economic development and an acknowledgement that the individual owns his own labor is based on a Lockean natural rights philosophy that permeated the American founding and has been at the cornerstone of nearly every major American political party. It would certainly be in line with Brietbart News’ own “Hamilton,” who very much represents the philosophy of Alexander Hamilton’s Federalists, Henry Clay’s Whigs, and Abraham Lincoln’s Republicans.
Given Obama’s previous speeches on economics, the philosophy that made America the greatest opportunity society in the world and ended the institution of slavery is unlikely to be heard at Knox College.

9163	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/30/msnbc-halperin-media-bias-shutdown	Opinion	1	Economy	None	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Intentionally or not, Monday on Morning Joe, Time’s Mark Halperin revealed to the world how the American media’s pro-Obama bias will in part be to blame for any coming government shutdown. When asked if President Obama had an incentive to negotiate with the GOP, Halperin explained that, “The White House does not have much incentive. They think the trends are going to go in their direction at the end of the week, or early next week at the latest; because again, the press is largely sympathetic to their arguments on this.”
—



—
In short: The government is going to shut down because Obama knows the media has his back and therefore feels no pressure to enter into negotiations that might avert a shutdown. In fact, Obama is apparently okay letting the government shut down because he knows the media won’t make him pay a political price for it. 

So what we have here is the media’s pro-Obama bias as a big factor in a potential shutdown. 
As we have seen all year, when it comes to settled laws on issues such as gun control, voter ID, and immigration, the media are big believers in the kind of “civil bipartisan compromise” that results in changing those laws — as long as all that “civil bipartisan compromise” comes from the GOP. 
But the media have completely abandoned their championing of “civil bipartisan compromise” with respect to this budget crisis, and as a result, Obama knows he has the media on his side and is therefore comfortable in his position not to negotiate. And Obama’s refusal to compromise is hurtling America towards a government shutdown. 
What we have here is a situation wherein media bias is helping to inflame a crisis. In other words, were the media acting responsibly, objectively,  and professionallly, this would actually decrease the chances of a shutdown. Obviously, though, the media wants its cake and to eat it too. The media are behaving in a way that increases the chances of a shutdown and then the media will blame the GOP for what the media helped cause.  
Now we also know why Obama felt so secure golfing during this weekend’s shutdown crisis, instead of rolling up his sleeves like a leader to make a deal. Why not? He knows the media won’t blame him for anything, including shutting down the government.

9187	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/01/California-Tax-Hike-Sparks-Millionaire-Migration	News	1	Economy	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

In a desperate attempt to get California’s budgetary nightmares under control, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown pushed for a tax hike plan last November to increase the state’s overall tax rate on millionaires to the highest in the nation at 13.3%.  But now, experts say Brown’s actions may be sparking a tax migration for the high income earners whom the state relies on to pay its bills.
“You’d be a fool not to leave California,” says Ed Botowsky of Chapwood Investments who manages the finances of several professional athletes and high income Californians.  Botowsky says some of his clients have already made the decision to flee the state to avoid the tax crunch.
Seven states including Florida, Texas, and Nevada do not have a state income tax.  That can mean big savings for millionaires willing to make the move.  Tiger Woods’s move from California to Florida will save him an estimated $7.5 million in taxes this year alone.  His golf rival, Phil Mickelson, who recently expressed concern over California’s tax squeeze, could save $8 million this year by following Tiger’s lead. 


An estimated 62.7% of California’s general revenue fund comes from personal income taxes.  With roughly 41% of the state’s entire revenue coming from the top 1% of California income earners, the state is especially vulnerable to even modest fluctuations in the migration of its millionaires.  

“The higher reliance on personal income tax is a double-edged sword,” said Fitch Ratings Senior Director Douglas Offerman.
Michael Genest, who formerly ran California’s state finance department, says he worries what will happen if the millionaire migration dries up the revenues Gov. Jerry Brown is banking on.
“What happens if revenues fall through the floor? He’s going to be right back where we were in 2008,” Genest said.
The recent 5% federal tax increase on high earners, coupled with California’s 13.3% state income tax, may prove more than millionaires are willing to take, especially since they have options and can move easily.
“They’re going to have an exodus of people,” said John Karaffa, president of ProSport CPA, a Virginia-based firm that represents nearly 300 professional athletes, primarily in basketball and football. “I think they’ll see some [leave California] for sure. They were already a very high tax state and it’s getting to a point where folks have to make a business decision as well as a lifestyle decision.”

Liberals have accused Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia of being the court’s resident bully, but when two liberal female Suprem Court Justices–Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan–this week tried to browbeat Scalia and lawyers arguing against the Voting Rights Act’s Section 5 pre-clearance requirement, the mainstream media hailed their efforts.  
In oral arguments in Shelby County v. Holder on Wednesday, Scalia made the point that members of Congress have no reason whatsoever to vote against the extension of the Voting Rights Act and that he was “fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless–unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution.”
“I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement,” Scalia said


Scalia’s point was that once a bill has the effect of ensuring that minority candidates get elected from “minority” districts, it is almost impossible, in the political system, to vote against extending the act. 
“Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes,” Scalia said. “I don’t think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act.”
Scalia said there were “certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now” and even the Virginia Senators “have no interest in voting against this” because they would lose votes “if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act.” 

“Even the name of it is wonderful: The Voting Rights Act,” Scalia said. “Who is going to vote against that in the future?”
Sotomayor was not having any of it. 
Sotomayor, as a liberal Washington Post columnist noted, “allowed the lawyer for the Alabama county seeking to overturn the law to get just four sentences into his argument before interrupting him. “
When Sotomayor would not relent, Justice Anthony Kennedy had to say, in remarks directed at her, “I would like to hear the answer to the question.”
When the lawyer started talking, Kagan then interrupted him. And in what was described as a “breach of decorum,” Kagan interrupted Scalia’s questioning to argue with Scalia directly on the bench.

Sotomayor would not let Justice Samuel Alito get a word in as well, and Chief Justice John Roberts had to says, “Justice Alito,” to signal that he had the floor. 
And when the lawyer for Alabama was about to make his concluding arguments, Sotomayor allowed him four words–“Thank you, Chief Justice”–before aggressively interrupting him. 
“Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5?,” Sotomayor asked. 
Before he could explain, she interrupted by saying she had “asked a different question.”
“Do you think Section 5 was voted for because it was a racial entitlement?” Sotomayor asked.
And so it went, and the mainstream media that always describe Scalia as “acerbic” for his aggressive questioning did not judge Sotomayor and Kagan by the same standards. Instead, mainstream media outlets like the Washington Post said Sotomayor’s and Kagan’s performances proved they were “ready for battle.”

President Obama is expected to ignore calls from the American people to cut spending in his State of the Union speech. It appears that he will urge the government to spend more, while using euphemisms such as “investments” to obfuscate the issue. The speech will likely focus on “investments” in infrastructure and education.

White House economic adviser Gene Sperling warned that closing the deficit “doesn’t mean you pull back on everything … I don’t think that laying the foundation for future growth (with research and highway spending) is anything to discount in any way. What you need to do is be smart.”


White House press secretary Jay Carney opined, “The core emphasis that he has always placed in these big speeches remains the same, and it will remain the same — the need to make the economy work for the middle class.” He added that the State of the Union address will speak of “proposals that are necessary to help the middle class grow and to help the economy grow.” 
Obama, as usual, is proceeding with his plans despite polls showing they are unpopular.

Last week a poll by Fox News revealed 73 percent of voters believed cutting spending was the best approach to fixing the U.S. economy, while only 15 percent who favored  increased spending. Two out of three people surveyed were against another “economic stimulus.”
A new Pew poll indicated that the budget deficit was now the third most important issue concerning Americans, surpassing terrorism and just behind the economy and jobs. According to the Commerce Department, the last quarter of 2012 featured the economy shrinking by .1 percent.

The difference between Obama and the GOP, which favors cutting spending without raising spending, can be summed up in two quotes: former Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter saying that cuts in spending alone would “strangle our economy,” and Noelle Clemente, with the American Action Forum, asserting that the claims by the White house of cuts they have made are “full of budget gimmicks …We’ve seen that stimulus spending doesn’t work. That’s not the solution. … We know that this is a long-term spending problem and it’s driven by long-term spending: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.”

Breitbart News has learned there is a provision included in the immigration bill that could be used to give free cars, motorcycles, scooters or other vehicles to young people around the country over a period of 15 months after the bill passes.  The new provision is a result of the latest addition to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which is essentially an entirely new version of the bill.
  
The Washington Examiner‘s Byron York uncovered the new Obama stimulus program that Gang of Eight members and other Senate Republicans inserted into the bill as a sweetheart deal for liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). The left leaning Senator was previously critical of the legislation. 


“The original Gang bill ended with a section designated Title IV, which was headlined REFORMS TO NON-IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAMS,” York wrote on Sunday. “The Hoeven-Corker version of the bill added a Title V, with the headline JOBS FOR YOUTH. The measure would provide $1.5 billion in the next two years to provide jobs for Americans between the ages of 16 and 24. It was originally pushed by Democratic Sen. Bernard Sanders, who wanted to come to the aid of young workers who were ‘hard hit by the Wall Street-caused recession.’ Now, Sanders says immigration reform will further damage youth job prospects.”

A provision under that new stimulus program title allows for the use of spending the taxpayer money on the program to provide transportation for youth to and from their jobs.
“(f) USE OF FUNDS.– (1) IN GENERAL.–The funds made available under this section shall be used– (A) to provide summer employment opportunities for low-income youth, with direct linkages to academic and occupational learning, and may be used to provide supportive services, such as transportation or child care, that is necessary to enable the participation of such youth in the opportunities;”
The total appropriation for this new stimulus program would be $1.5 billion that would be divvied up among states that applied for the money. According to the proposed statute as written, all the money would need to be spent in a year-and-three-months period. 
“The amounts appropriated under this title shall be available for obligation by the Secretary of Labor until December 31, 2014, and shall be available for expenditure by grantees (including subgrantees) until September 30, 2015,” the part of the provision detailing how long the money would be available for reads.
A GOP senate aide told Breitbart News that for the country to be able to spend $1.5 billion on such a program so fast, it would need to buy, lease or rent motor vehicles  for beneficiaries of the new government handout. The provision that outlines how the money can be legally used for providing “supportive services” like “transportation,” the aide said, could easily be interpreted to mean the money could be spent buying or leasing or renting vehicles for the beneficiaries.
“This appears to give states authority to buy, lease or rent motorcycles, cars and scooters or anything kids want to buy to get to and from a job,” the GOP aide said.

Word on the Hill is that a Senate deal to end the partial government shutdown and lift the debt ceiling will be reached on Tuesday. Although specific details are murky and subject to change, the broad outlines of the deal indicate a complete victory for Sen. Harry Reid and the Democrat caucus. With the partial government shutdown entering its third week, it looks increasingly likely that the GOP will gain next to nothing from the stand-off. 
The deal negotiated between Reid and GOP Leader Mitch McConnell would reopen the government through January 15th. The GOP had sought to lock-in lower levels of spending due to next year’s sequester cuts, but that seems off the table now. The deal would also raise the debt ceiling until early February. It sets up another contentious fight over spending and debt in the critical 2014 election year. 
In exchange, the GOP secured the creation of a large bi-cameral, bi-partisan commission or committee to explore budget and spending reforms. It also secured a provision to force the Obama Administration to take steps to verify the income of people seeking ObamaCare subsidies. That requirement is in the existing law, but was waived recently by the Administration. 


Democrats also seem to have secured a priority for their union allies. The deal, reportedly, would delay for one year ObamaCare’s “reinsurance” tax on group plans. Repealing this tax was a key policy goal for labor. 

It is hard to see this deal as anything but a complete capitulation by the GOP. The national debt would increase, without corresponding spending cuts or other reforms. Federal spending would resume at a higher level than required by the Budget Control Act, passed in 2011. Given the GOP’s inability to secure any meaningful reforms in these negotiations, it is hard to imagine it would fair better with a commission. 
If a deal is reached Tuesday, it could still take several days to pass the Senate. Any one Senator can object to the deal, forcing the Senate to consider the deal through its Byzantine process. It isn’t likely to pass the Senate until well after Treasury’s October 17 deadline for new borrowing authority. 
If the House gets the deal several days past the debt deadline, the chamber will come under extraordinary pressure to approve the deal.

Two days after President Barack Obama signed a budget compromise that slashed pension benefits for military veterans, retired Marine Jessie Jane Duff blasted Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) for his “outrageous attitude” toward the sacrifices those in the armed forces have made. 
Appearing on Fox & Friends on Saturday, Jessie Jane Duff, who is at the E7 level, said Ryan, who brokered the deal with Sen. Patty Murray (D-WI), does not realize that many active duty military personnel go back to civilian life “broke” and “without a job” and have difficulty getting on equal footing with their “civilian counterparts.” She noted that many veterans have had to leave the armed forces early due to injuries or are suffering from things like PTSD. 
The deal Obama signed includes a provision that would “pare down annual cost of living increases in benefits for military retirees under age 62, saving the government an estimated $6.3 billion over a decade.” What that means is a sergeant first class at the E7 level like Duff who retires at age 42 would lose $72,000 in benefits over a lifetime, according to a Fox News analysis. 


She said that Ryan was “misleading” Americans into believing that veterans were getting a pay increase by using accounting tricks and lingo when in fact they are not. 

Duff, of Concerned Veterans for America, said Ryan was screwing over the types of  veterans who were deployed three times to Afghanistan and Iraq and said it was “outrageous” for Ryan to claim that the benefits were “extremely generous.” She emphasized that not enough people in Congress have served in the military, and they are out of touch with Americans who have served or have family members in the armed forces.
Multiple bills have been introduced in the House to undo the cuts.

In a blockbuster one-hour investigative special that aired on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Friday, Peter Schweizer, Steve Bannon, and Sean Hannity exposed how Washington, D.C. has extracted power and money from the United States into a centralized location to become the country’s greatest “boomtown,” despite not creating anything.
Schweizer, the president of the nonpartisan Government Accountability Institute, highlighted how the permanent political class that relies on lobbying and influence peddling makes more money by “growing the size of government,” which leaves no incentive on either side of the aisle to limit government.
As a result, he noted the three richest counties and seven of the top ten wealthiest counties in the nation are in the Washington, D.C. region. The District also consumes the most fine wine in the nation. He asserted the business in Washington is now “not politics” but “money.” 


Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, said the best and the brightest now come to Washington because they see Washington as a Tammany Hall that will allow them to get rich off of influence peddling. He noted that Washington D.C. runs the equivalent of a $4 trillion private equity fund every year and essentially doles out 25% of the country’s wealth to those who are connected. 
“Nobody has ever turned a camera on them,” Bannon said, indicating he intends to change that in the future. “This is a permanent political class that has now formed an aristocracy. That’s why nothing has changed in Washington.”
Bannon explained people arrive in Washington as country lawyers and then decide to “turn the business of government into a family business” by having their wives and kids work in lobbying.  

“And this is how they become a permanent political class,” he concluded. 
Hannity mentioned that Washington politicians “kick money back to family, friends, or people that hire them when they retire.”
And Schweizer concurred. He claimed the permanent political class is bipartisan and those who are a part of this permanent aristocracy either marry or are born into it. 
Schweizer noted former Mississippi Senator Trent Lott, a Republican, and former Louisiana Senator John Breaux, a Democrat, partnering up to lobby after they left Congress. He cited Republican Rep. Bill Young of Florida whose daughter-in-law does defense lobbying while he sits on one of the most powerful subcommittees dealing with defense issues. 
Schweizer also pointed out that Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) has two sons who have also lobbied for projects in which their father was involved. 

According to Schweizer, this type of bipartisan nepotism that would not be tolerated in corporations is why “political debates are like professional wrestling, it’s not always what it appears to be.”
“It’s a massive cultural problem in Washington, D.C.,” he lamented, adding that the problem is going to get worse. 
Bannon said if one follows the money, it is clear there is no incentive for the permanent political class to cut spending. And because there is not an incentive to cut spending, Bannon said, Americans are stuck with a party of “big government” and a junior partner that is the party of “little big government.” Unfortunately, Bannon said the country lacks a party that is truly focused on limited government.  
“There is no pressure on them to cut. Washington controls the money. They have an industrial logic to the business model,” he explained. “The permanent political class of both political parties are benefiting from it.”
Hannity promised more segments in the future with Bannon and Schweizer as they make Americans more aware of the rampant crony capitalism Washington’s permanent political class tries its best hide.

One of the more insignificant, yet pernicious, spending cuts in the Ryan-Murray budget is a reduction in military pensions. The changes would apply to current active-duty and retired military personnel under the age of 62. Many military families view these changes as a broken promise and, Breitbart News has learned, are convening a “Twitter Town Hall” Monday night in opposition to the budget deal. The grass roots event is targeting Senators up for reelection next year with the hashtag #KeepYourPromise.
“The President and Congress’s failure to watch the back of those who have served their country for twenty or more years in the military, particularly over the last twelve years of war, will ensure the next generation of potential recruits understands that their word means nothing,” Jeremy Hilton, an organizer of the event told Breitbart News. 
Hilton is a Navy veteran and in 2012 was named “Military Spouse of the Year” by Armed Forces insurance. His wife currently serves as an officer in the Air Force. 


“Military families understand that costs must be constrained,” Hilton continued. “[B]ut all of us have watched DoD flush money down the drain in Afghanistan, here in the states by buying Aeron chairs “because we have to spend it before the end of the year”, or multi-billion congressional boondoggles….we have seen waste that borders on the obscene.”

The Ryan-Murray deal pushes active-duty and veterans into a new pension plan that lowers their yearly cost-of-living adjustment. Instead of keep pace with inflation, the new yearly adjustment would be equal to inflation minus 1%. Once the veteran turns 62, the yearly adjustment would fully account for inflation going forward. 
The change is expected to save around $7 billion over the next decade. The money coming out of veterans’ pension checks wouldn’t go to deficit reduction or paying down debt, however. It would go to finance increased government spending. 
Rep. Paul Ryan defended the cut to military pensions over the weekend. “We give them a slightly smaller adjustment for inflation because they’re still in their working years and in most cases earning another paycheck,” Ryan said. 
Ryan’s defense is beside the point. It isn’t really a question of whether or not a veteran can “afford” the pension benefit cut. It’s a question of whether the government should honor a commitment it’s made to its military personnel, especially at a time when the demands on them and their families are so great. 
“So, at the end of twelve years of fighting,” Hilton told Breitbart News, “you are going to break faith with the men and women who have spent half of that time away from their families?”

Senate Democratic leaders wrote a letter to President Barack Obama to let him know they would support him if he raised the nation’s debt ceiling unilaterally, without congressional approval, by either invoking the 14th Amendment or using some other legal justification
In a letter signed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Senate Democratic Policy Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and other Democrats and dated Jan. 11, the Democratic Senate leaders wrote they believed Obama “must be willing to take any lawful steps” to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling.
They wrote: 



In the event that Republicans make good on their threat by failing to act, or by moving unilaterally to pass a debt limit extension only as part of unbalanced or unreasonable legislation, we believe you must be willing to take any lawful steps to ensure that America does not break its promises and trigger a global economic crisis–without Congressional approval, if necessary.



The leaders also warned House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to not allow conservative members of Congress to hold the nation’s economy and reputation “hostage” during the upcoming negotiations concerning raising the debt ceiling. 
Last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said if she had a choice, she would invoke the 14th Amendment “in a second” to raise the debt ceiling if she were president. 
Democrats want Obama to raise the debt ceiling unilaterally because they do not want to cut spending, which Republicans will demand in return for authorizing the debt ceiling to be raised.
During the last round of debt ceiling negotiations in the summer of 2011, Obama was asked if he would invoke the 14th Amendment to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling. 
Obama replied then that he had talked to his lawyers, and they were “not persuaded that that is a winning argument.”

During his Monday press conference, Barack Obama bizarrely claimed he needs to raise the debt ceiling because Congress won’t stop ordering him to spend money:

This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me: ‘You need to fund our Defense Department at such-and-such a level. You need to send Social Security checks. You need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans.’ They lay all this out for me, and–because they have the spending power–and so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills.
Separately, they also have to authorize a raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can’t do is tell me to spend X and then say, but we’re not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.

Of course, Obama isn’t mentioning that it is largely his side that wants to spend, while the GOP wants to cut spending. 



The issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation and so there’s a very simple solution to this. Congress authorizes us to pay our bills. Now if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don’t have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I’m happy to take it.
If they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done and you know, there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no, you know, easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending.

The president’s entire defense is predicated on the premise that spending absolutely must stay at its current levels, an issue he has been entirely unwilling to discuss with Republicans in Congress.
Notice that for the past two years, the House, run by the GOP, has passed budgets while the Democratic Senate hasn’t. Who’s the fiscally irresponsible party here?

America is suffering from an epic case of Armageddon fatigue. 
Budget showdown, government shutdown, debt ceiling debacle–the stakes are real but the establishment seems to feed off the chaos they create as a means to foment fear and outrage and translate it into campaign donations for themselves. 


Look closely and you’ll see that something seismic is going on under the surface of the manufactured chaos in D.C. 
Washington has morphed into an extortion racket, a place where members of the permanent political class threaten to inflict legislative and regulatory pain to extract campaign donations that they can then siphon into the pockets of themselves and their family members. 
In a new book featured this Sunday on 60 Minutes titled Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets, Peter Schweizer explains how Washington politicians use a set of mafia-style legislative tactics to extort people and industries into donating to them out of fear of political and legal reprisals. 

Schweizer interviewed former Chairman of Apache Corporation Ray Plank. Plank said campaign cash and lobbying contracts now function as “protection money” to keep lawmakers and regulators from going after you. 
“It’s what you expect from the mafia,” said Plank. “They basically come to you and say, ‘We are going to shove this bat up your ass and give you an enema. You better play ball.’ We saw a great deal of it. It’s an insidious blight.” 
There are left-wing progressives on Wall Street and in the high-tech world who bankrolled President Obama’s campaign because they love his radical agenda. But as Schweizer points out, many gave because they know they have to; if they don’t, Obama will come after them. 
That’s a lesson the Tea Party knows all too well. After the Tea Party’s historic 2010 midterm victory, Obama unleashed Attorney General Eric Holder to go after the oil and gas sector, which had given four times as much to Republicans as to Democrats. As Obama said in October 2010, “We are going to punish our enemies and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us.” 
Of course, not everyone gets subjected to these Godfather-style shakedowns. Case in point: Obama bundler and former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine of MF Global shame. After “losing” $1.6 billion of MF Global customer money, Corzine walked away without a scratch. In Extortion, Schweizer publishes a devastating quote from Lisa Timmerman, a 17-year MF Global employee who served as the firm’s assistant comptroller for five years, saying: “Corzine is a major Obama fundraiser [which] is keeping prosecutors from bringing criminal charges against him.” 

But what about the rest of us? What about the average American mom and dad just trying to stay afloat in the disastrous Obama economy? We don’t have the funds to throw “protection money” at the political extortionists in Washington who are eager to foist things like Obamacare on us. Only Obama’s union cronies and members of the permanent political class are given Obamacare waivers and spared the pain of the policies D.C. inflicts on the rest of us. Big business got an Obamacare exemption that Obama refuses to give ordinary individuals who can’t even sign up for Obamacare on the broken exchange websites, but they’ll still be fined for not doing so! 
And what about the GOP establishment? Why haven’t they been able to clean up the extortion racket in Washington? You have to ask yourself, has the party machine fought this corruption or does it participate in it? As a senior House Republican told Fox News on Thursday, it’s “highly unlikely” Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) will be challenged because few have the muscle to match his ability to “raise money.” 
In fact, the ability to raise money is apparently key to all the power in Washington. Here’s how bad it’s gotten: the Democratic and Republican Parties actually have a secret price list–officially known as “party dues”–that tells members of Congress how much money they must extract from donors in order to win a chairmanship or a top slot on a powerful Congressional committee. Schweizer somehow obtained the top-secret lists and included the never-before-published documents in Extortion. 
But fundraising isn’t the only thing D.C. employs to keep people in line. Over in the Senate, Democrats like Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) use thug tactics on Tea Party members and activists who stand in their way. In a devastating chapter on Harry Reid, Schweizer includes a quote from Reid’s former chief of staff Susan McCue, who in 2005 said Reid seizes on a person’s weaknesses to “disarm, to endear, to threaten, but most of all to instill fear.” 
The fact that these strong-arm tactics take place in Washington doesn’t surprise me at all. I’ve fought this type of corruption my entire political career. And those who disagreed with me politically used thug-like tactics to try to bankrupt my family with frivolous lawsuits in Alaska, and it hasn’t stopped to this day. 
It’s time for Washington to stop threatening citizens and scaring up dollars through an endless extortion scheme of manufactured crises. It’s time for leaders to lead. That means doing right by voters without requiring them to pay protection money in advance. 
You have to wonder whether Constitutional rule of law even exists when separate rules apply for powerful and well-connected men like Jon Corzine. And you have to wonder whether we really have government of the people, by the people, and for the people when the only way We the People can be heard is if we grease the palms of the ruling class. 
Enough is enough. If the permanent political class won’t drain the swamp, we will. We should follow the advice in the title of Schweizer’s last book and “Throw Them All Out.” 2014 is just around the corner.

Obama’s Debt Default Is on His Shoulders While We Shoulder His Impeachable Offenses
Apparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit. To suggest that raising the debt limit doesn’t incur more debt is laughably absurd. The very reason why you raise the debt limit is so that you can incur more debt. Otherwise what’s the point?


It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default. There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first. We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first. However, we don’t have enough money to continue to finance our ever-growing federal government (with our $17 trillion dollar national debt that has increased over 50% since Obama took office). That’s why President Obama wants to increase the debt limit. He doesn’t want to make the tough decisions to rein in government spending. So, he’s scaremongering the markets about default, just as he tries to scaremonger our senior citizens about their Social Security, which, by the way, is funded by the Social Security Trust Fund and is solvent through 2038.

It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense. A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill.

9540	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/03/03/Sperling-s-DIsingenuous-Defense-of-Sequester	Opinion	1	Economy	None	Negative	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"
White House economic adviser Gene Sperling, who controversially told journalist Bob Woodward he would “regret” accusing the Obama administration of shifting the goalposts to include tax hikes in debate over the sequester, offered a misleading defense of the sequester on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley on Sunday.
Sperling told Crowley that the original intent of the sequester was “to force both sides to come back to the type of grand bargain that Bowles-Simpson have called for, that most budget experts call for…”. 


But President Barack Obama rejected the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission, even though he had established it to propose solutions to the country’s long-term budget crisis. 

As Woodward recalled in The Price of Politics, and as is easily confirmed by a variety of other sources, including former Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner, Obama rejected the Bowles-Simpson formula because he was not willing to accept reforms to the country’s entitlements, including Social Security. 
Obama and the Democrats wanted larger tax hikes and fewer cuts to spending and entitlements. Many Republicans, too, rejected the plan, largely because it left the massive new entitlement of Obamacare in place.
Moreover, as Woodward pointed out elsewhere in the book (and as Breitbart News highlighted long before Woodward’s claims about the sequester made him a White House target), it was Obama himself who scuttled a “grand bargain” by demanding additional revenues through tax hikes when a deal had been within reach.
Sperling’s revisionist history invites the question: if the sequester had been meant to encourage a grand bargain like Bowles-Simpson, why hasn’t Obama simply embraced Bowles-Simpson?
The obvious answer is that Obama had no intention of reaching a deal, and hoped to use the sequester as he used the “fiscal cliff”–to squeeze more concessions out of Republicans on tax rates, and to blame the opposition for whatever horrible economic outcomes the administration could conjure.

The performance of the White House Press Corps during President Obama’s Tuesday afternoon briefing resulted in not a single question that seriously challenged the president or even made him uncomfortable. The hour-long affair was more like a conversation between the like-minded on issues such as the ongoing budget battles and going around Congress by raising the debt ceiling by executive fiat. Anyone who remembers the non-stop confrontation directed at President Bush just a few years ago, by this same group of reporters, would not recognize them today.  
Not a single reporter confronted Obama over the violent rhetoric he and his administration have been using to describe Republicans, or even the fact that as a Senator, Obama voted against raising the debt ceiling — a position he is now describing as dangerous, irresponsible and akin to hostage-taking. 


In fact, in this briefing, Obama used the words “hostage, insane, ransom, nuclear bomb, chaos, disaster.”
Mark Knoller of CBS News is the only reporter that asked the president about the individual compromise spending bills the GOP have passed to fund the parks, veterans, and National Institutes of Health, among other items. Obama swatted away the question with talking points without being challenged on the fact that this veto threat means children suffering from cancer will not get treatment from the NIH.
No reporter even asked about the ObamaCare launch debacle. 

Here are some of the questions that were asked:
— 

Julie Pace of AP
 Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Obviously if Congress does pass a clean CR and a clean debt ceiling bill, those may just be short-term measures. If that happens, does your offer to negotiate with them on issues like health care and spending and deficit reduction still stand in the intervening weeks if they pass measures that are just perhaps six weeks or two months long?

Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You laid out the economic consequences of default, but if we were to get to that point, would you prioritize and pay bondholders first to maintain the semblance of credit or — rather than Social Security recipients or military servicemen and women? And how would you go ahead and make that determination?

Q: Thank you, Mr. President. With Speaker Boehner so far unwilling to hold a vote on a clean CR, what assurances can you give to those affected by a shutdown who are concerned about an even longer impasse? And how worried are you personally that your preferred solution to this clean CR and sequestration levels may do harm to the nation’s economy and your second-term agenda?

Q: Thanks. You talked a bit about the hit to credibility around the world that this impasse has caused. I’m wondering what you and your administration are telling worried foreign creditors, China and Japan, who are calling and then asking about whether the United States is going to avoid defaulting on its debts?

Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the Supreme Court, and the term started today with a campaign finance case that sort of picks up where Citizens United left off. You called Citizens United devastating to the public interest, so I wonder if you could weigh in on this latest case.

At a White House press conference Friday afternoon, President Obama said he was “absolutely certain” the Senate amnesty bill would pass the House if it were brought to the floor for a vote. Obama said the Republican leadership should put the bill up for a vote. The problem is, the House doesn’t have the bill. The Senate still has not delivered its bill to the House for consideration. 
In the days after the Senate passed its bill, House Ways and Means Chairman David Camp pointed out that the bill is unconstitutional, in its construction. The Senate bill raises revenue by creating new taxes and fees. According to the Constitution, however, legislation that raises revenue can only be introduced first in the House. 
This creates a real dilemma for Senate backers of the bill. As my colleague Matt Boyle explained at the time:



When such a revenue-raising bill comes out of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, currently Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), can use a procedure called a “blue slip resolution” to automatically kill it on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. Stockman has been promising to attempt to kill the Senate’s bill that way and, as such, Reid has refused to send it to the House, thereby protecting the bill from being “blue slipped.” The term “blue slip,” Stockman’s office noted in a release, comes from the blue color of the paper on which a resolution is printed that returns a Senate bill back to the Senate in these situations.

This is why supporters of the Senate bill are so eager to conference with the House. They need even a simple piece of legislation on immigration to get around the constitutional problem. Conferees could strip out all the language of the House bill and substitute the Senate provisions, and the resulting bill would be constitutional. 
GOP Leadership isn’t blocking the House from voting on the Senate bill. The drafters of the original Senate bill are the ones blocking the House.

President Obama is expected to ignore calls from the American people to cut spending in his State of the Union speech. It appears that he will urge the government to spend more, while using euphemisms such as “investments” to obfuscate the issue. The speech will likely focus on “investments” in infrastructure and education.

White House economic adviser Gene Sperling warned that closing the deficit “doesn’t mean you pull back on everything … I don’t think that laying the foundation for future growth (with research and highway spending) is anything to discount in any way. What you need to do is be smart.”


White House press secretary Jay Carney opined, “The core emphasis that he has always placed in these big speeches remains the same, and it will remain the same — the need to make the economy work for the middle class.” He added that the State of the Union address will speak of “proposals that are necessary to help the middle class grow and to help the economy grow.” 
Obama, as usual, is proceeding with his plans despite polls showing they are unpopular.

Last week a poll by Fox News revealed 73 percent of voters believed cutting spending was the best approach to fixing the U.S. economy, while only 15 percent who favored  increased spending. Two out of three people surveyed were against another “economic stimulus.”
A new Pew poll indicated that the budget deficit was now the third most important issue concerning Americans, surpassing terrorism and just behind the economy and jobs. According to the Commerce Department, the last quarter of 2012 featured the economy shrinking by .1 percent.

The difference between Obama and the GOP, which favors cutting spending without raising spending, can be summed up in two quotes: former Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter saying that cuts in spending alone would “strangle our economy,” and Noelle Clemente, with the American Action Forum, asserting that the claims by the White house of cuts they have made are “full of budget gimmicks …We’ve seen that stimulus spending doesn’t work. That’s not the solution. … We know that this is a long-term spending problem and it’s driven by long-term spending: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.”

Ali Velshi is CNN’s Chief Business Correspondent and Barack Obama’s Chief Sequester Propagandist. This so-called correspondent is a living breathing pipe-organ for the White House and its latest push to blame sequester — and by extension, the GOP — for Obama’s failed economic policies. 
A little after 2pm ET today, Velshi appeared on CNN with Brooke Baldwin. She asked how the business community is reacting to sequester. His response was to use both hands to grab hold of Obama’s talking points from earlier today and spread that sequester gospel like one of the president’s apostles:
Generally speaking the word from the business community is pretty standard. We are at a time in our economy where it would be useful to be building and expanding. We got unemployment edging down, jobs being created, very low interest rates, and an energy boom. We could be really moving to the top of the global pile in terms of economic activity, and this sort of thing [sequester] is like the government sticking its foot out just as your gaining speed as you’re running. 


Where to begin? 
This isn’t a little partisan spin coming from Velshi, it is full-blown Orwellian propagandizing. You expect this kind of flackery from David Axelrod, not someone CNN poses as an objective correspondent. 
1. Unemployment is not edging down. It is edging up. At best it’s stuck, and the CBO says it is going to stay stuck for at least another year. 

2. Job creation is barely treading water with population growth. 
3. An energy boom? Has Velshi filled his gas or home heating tank lately?
4. How exactly is our economy “gaining speed” when our economy plummeted around three-points last quarter to a growth level of one-tenth of one-percent? 
5. “We could be really moving to the top of the global pile?” Did Velshi really say that? Good grief. Even Obama is more careful with the happy talk. 
Then there are the lies of omission: The fact that we learned just today that the drop in income last month was the biggest in 20 years; and the fact that sequester represents about 2% of the federal budget, which translates to about a measly 1% of our GDP. 

The picture Velshi is outrageously and dishonestly trying to paint is that our economy is humming (when the EXACT opposite is true) and that, if it falters (to a point where even the media can’t happy talk it), the fault falls on the government being too small, which Obama tried so desperately to stop. 
But Velshi wasn’t done sucking up to Obama. Oh, no, someone’s looking for a “good dog” by blaming sequester in part on the right-leaning Chamber of Commerce:
But I have to tell you, the business community to some degree has fed this. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce really contributed to the partisanship and the election of people who are on both sides of this in Washington. And this is the result. 
In Velshi’s defense… he has earned that “good dog.”
Come on CNN, can’t you do a little better than this? The economy just might become the biggest story in the country soon. If you want to earn back an audience, you’re going to need a business correspondent with some credibility, respect for context, and more respect for the viewer than his failed agenda.

In an eye-opening six-month investigation into America’s disability program, Planet Money reporter Chana Joffe-Walt uncovered a “disability industrial complex” fraught with fraud that churns out 14 million checks every month to citizens the government has deemed disabled.   
“Since the economy began its slow, slow recovery in late 2009, we’ve been averaging about 150,000 jobs created per month,” said Joffe-Walt in an Public Radio International (PRI) “This American Life” interview. “In that same period every month, almost 250,000 people have been applying for disability.”



Among Joffe-Walt’s findings are the following facts:


The federal government spends more money each year on cash payments for disabled former workers than it does on food stamps and welfare combined; America’s two largest disability programs, including health care for disabled workers, costs taxpayers $260 billion a year
In some parts of the country, such as Hale County, Alabama, one out of every four working-age adults collects a disability check
As of 2011, 33.8% of newly diagnosed disabled workers cited “back pain and other musculoskeletal problems” as their reason for being unable to work.  In 1961, the top reason for being disabled was “heart disease, stroke”
Disabled workers do not get counted in the unemployment figures. If they did, the numbers would be far higher 
Less than 1% of people who went on disability at the beginning of 2011 have returned to the workforce
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program–which covers kids and adults–has exploded.  SSI is now seven times larger than it was 30 years ago.

The report suggests that the much-touted Welfare to Work policies of the 1990s that appeared to successfully move welfare recipients off the public dole may have been a mirage. States have figured out that shifting people from welfare to disability frees up substantial funds, as states have to pay the costs of welfare, but the federal government picks up the tab for disability.
“That’s a kind of ugly secret of the American labor market,” said MIT economist David Autor.  “Part of the reason our unemployment rates have been low, until recently, is that a lot of people who would have trouble finding jobs are on a different program.” 
Joffe-Walt says disability has “become a de facto welfare program for people without a lot of education or job skills.” The reporter notes that the disability program “wasn’t supposed to serve this purpose; it’s not a retraining program designed to get people back onto their feet.”
According to Social Security chief actuary Steve Goss, disability insurance program reserves will run out of money in 2016.

In a New York Times interview published Saturday, President Obama came out foursquare against the Keystone XL pipeline, claiming that it would not create jobs. “Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator,” Obama said. “There is no evidence that that’s true.” He then blamed Canada for not “doing more” to prevent carbon emissions from oil sands. Obama continued, “I meant what I said; I’m going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release.” 

Obama also blasted reports that job creation would be significant: “”[M]y hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline – which might take a year or two – and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in a economy of 150 million working people.” He stated that gas prices would go up in parts of the United States thanks to Keystone XL: “So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they can’t ship some of that oil to world markets.”


On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told Fox News Sunday that Keystone’s failure to move forward was somehow Republicans’ fault: “There were some political games that were played, that took it off the trail and path to completion, where Republicans put it out there as something that was put on a timetable that it could not be resolved. It caused a delay. Playing political games with something like this was a mistake.”

House Republicans have sent the White House a revised proposal to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks, as well as reopen government through December 15th, which was their original spending proposal before the partial shutdown. The revised GOP plan reflects the demands Obama made in a meeting with House GOP Leaders on Thursday. It also reflects the unwillingness of the DC GOP to face a fiscal showdown with Democrats. 
Aside from reopening the government and agreeing to raise America’s debt over the current $16.7 trillion limit, the Republicans made several other concession to President Obama and the Democrats. One such example is that Obamacare would receive funding. The Republicans would get to take out a portion of the president’s signature legislation, but the law would substantially remain intact. The AP reports:

Under a proposal she and other GOP senators have been developing, a medical device tax that helps finance the health care law would be repealed, and millions of individuals eligible for subsidies to purchase health insurance under the program would be subject to stronger income verification.

In addition, some of the across-the-board “sequester” cuts would be reversed under the GOP plan. It has not been determined which specific cuts will be targeted at this time.


In exchange for meeting, at least momentarily, all of Obama’s demands, the House GOP is seeking a “framework” for future negotiations on addressing longer-term budget issues. These negotiations would be led for the Republicans by Rep. Paul Ryan, who is likely to seek a “grand bargain” resolving the nation’s structural budget problems. 

After such a swift capitulation on the current impasse, how likely is it that the GOP will be able to extract meaningful reforms during yet another round of budget talks? House Leadership has already shown that, when nearing an actual deadline, it will cave while extracting very few concessions. 
The GOP surrender comes at a time when it is in a stronger position than it was during the partial government shutdown in 1995/96. The public generally blames both parties and President Obama for the fiscal stalemate. Obama’s approval ratings, meanwhile, have cratered to 37%, the lowest of his Presidency. 
In addition, 61% of the public thinks significant spending cuts have to be part of any deal to lift the debt ceiling. By that, they mean actual cuts, not a “framework” to discuss cuts. 
The House GOP has signaled to the Democrats that it is desperate to end the stand-off. They will, of course, promise that they will have more “leverage” next time. They’ve said that so many times, they probably even believe it.

A federal program originally designed to provide rural residents with phone service in case of emergencies is now one of the fastest growing welfare programs. Costing just around $140 million a few years ago, federal spending on the subsidy has exploded to $2.2 billion. 
Created in 1984, under President Reagan, the program is funded by a tax on regular phone service. The program was intended to cover the high capital costs of running telephone lines to remote, rural areas. In 2008, however, the program was expanded, through bureaucratic rule-making, to include cell phones. Today, a number of companies offer “free” cell phones and cell phone service plans to low-income people on welfare or food stamps. 
The program seems riddled with waste, however. The FCC recently admitted that an audit found almost 300,000 individuals with more than one subsidized phone. The Agency also testified to Congress that the top 5 companies offering phones and service couldn’t verify the eligibility of 41% of the recipients of the free phones. 


The history of this program should caution those embracing a new phone subsidy contained in the “Gang of 8” immigration bill unveiled last week. The program, dubbed “MarcoPhones” by some commentators, would provide grants to people living within 100 miles of the border who “lack cellular service” to purchase satellite phones. 

The proposal originated in legislation introduced by Sens. McCain and Kyl in 2011, in response to the murder of a rancher who lived in an area with weak cellular coverage. That proposal had very general eligibility criteria, but restricted funding to just $3 million over 2 years. The “Gang of 8” proposal, however, keeps the broad eligibility criteria, but removes any funding restriction. 
The original federal program to provide telephone service to residents in rural areas was well-intentioned. Establishing a dedicated funding mechanism, however, enabled the program to continue long after its goal was achieved. The FCC is considering expanding the program even beyond cell phones to also subsidize broadband internet connections. 
Government programs, left on their own, will always expand. The “MarcoPhone” program in the immigration bill is a test case. Applying very broad eligibility criteria with no funding restriction is a recipe for potential fraud and waste. It is a very small part of a large bill, but it could have very real long-term fiscal consequences.

(Reuters) – Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker proposed a nearly $70 billion biennial budget on Wednesday that combines income tax cuts with increased spending on transportation infrastructure and private education.
Walker, a first-term Republican facing re-election next year, said he would offset the tax cuts and spending increases contained in his 2013-2015 budget by redirecting some funds away from public schools and healthcare, freezing aid to local governments and selling off state assets such as power plants.


Democrats said the proposal would weaken the economic security of the state’s most vulnerable residents.
Walker, who touched off massive protests two years ago when he curbed the collective bargaining rights of public workers, said his proposed income tax cut would save residents $343 million.
“More money in the hands of taxpayers will likely drive greater demand for goods and services, which will likely lead to greater production and eventually more hiring of employees,” he said.

The proposed budget, unveiled in an address to both houses of the Legislature in Madison, included expanded state aid to private schools through voucher programs and the tightening of income eligibility requirements for recipients of publicly funded health programs.
Walker said he also wanted “able-bodied, non-elderly” people receiving food stamps in Wisconsin to be enrolled in mandatory employment training.
“I’m all for providing a temporary hand up,” he told lawmakers. “But … it should not be a permanent handout.
Democrats, who tried unsuccessfully last year to recall Walker, were critical of the proposed budget.
State Senator Kathleen Vinehout, who was a candidate for governor in the Democratic primary ahead of last year’s recall election, said, “Roads and bridges are being paid for by borrowing and raiding money that would otherwise go to schools and universities.
“These are political choices, not the choices voters in Wisconsin would make.”
Walker’s proposed budget will now go to the state Legislature, which is controlled by Walker’s fellow Republicans.
Debate on the measure is expected to continue for months.

Earlier this week, GOP Rep. Mick Mulvaney offered the Senate Democrat budget proposal for a vote in the House. The budget plan was defeated, with 35 Democrats crossing the aisle to oppose it. Thursday night, Dem Sen. Patty Murray responded by offering Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget for a vote in the Senate. The measure failed, 40-59, with 5 GOP Senators joining in opposition. Interestingly, among these 5 were Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee.
Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee are providing the nucleus of an emerging conservative opposition in the Senate. While there are other conservatives in the GOP caucus, these three are establishing themselves as reliable voices to articulate the conservative opposition to an ever encroaching government. 
They are becoming skilled at identifying issues to make a stand on principle. I have no doubt that if their votes could have pushed the Ryan budget into passing, they would have voted for it, as it is likely the best option on the table. Frankly, however, the Ryan budget doesn’t go as far as conservatives would prefer. A vote against an amendment that was already going to be defeated was a good moment to stand on that principle. 


The Ryan budget doesn’t cut real spending, but instead lowers the growth rate of spending. That is good, but unless you pull out by the roots wasteful spending and programs, they can always be expanded by a future Congress. Cutting real spending requires choices and priorities. Merely slowing the rate of spending growth keeps much of government in place. 

The most important, and meaningful, proposal in Ryan’s budget is to transition Medicare into a premium support program. Seniors would be free to select the health insurance that best meets their needs and the federal Medicare program would underwrite some portion of the premiums. It curbs unsustainable entitlement spending, but, best, it gives Seniors greater choice over their health care. 
Late Thursday, MI Sen. Debbie Stabenow introduced an amendment that would prevent Medicare being turned into a “voucher” program, the Democrats’ label to describe the Ryan plan. The Stabenow amendment passed 96-3. 
Who were the three Senators to vote against Stabenow? Sens. Paul, Cruz and Lee. Hopefully, their principled, conservative opposition will catch on with their colleagues.

Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) told the financial markets what they wanted to hear, namely that the Federal Reserve is going to moderate massive purchases of Treasury debt and mortgage securities.
The news of the “tapering” of Fed bond purchases sent stock prices soaring, this on the notion that the US economy is improving. Would that it were so.  
Cardiff Garcia of FTAlphaville reports that the FOMC reduced slightly the rate of bond purchases:


Beginning in January, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than $45 billion per month.
The trouble is that Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen, and the rest of the FOMC remain in fantasy land when it comes to the causes of our shared economic malaise. While parts of the US economy are doing pretty well, the housing and financial sectors are in a terrible funk. Read the last installment of Washington & Wall Street, “Regulation Likely to Slow the Housing Recovery in 2013,” if you want the gnarly details.
There are a couple of basic problems with how American economists and investors look at the economy and issues such as consumer demand. For example, consider this statement by the FOMC last week:


Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint may be diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Really? The liberal/socialist view of demand-side economists championed by the likes of Paul Krugman holds that a failure by government to spend (and borrow) more is somehow restraining the US economy. In reality, however, we are in a period of extended economic hangover following from the housing boom of the 2000s, when many jobs were supported by speculative credit creation and equally dicey housing activity, both in the US and internationally. Just read the frightening article from The New York Times, “Irish Try to Eradicate Ghosts of a Housing Crash,” and the idea is clear. All of the bad debt behind the housing boom ultimately came about due to the irresponsible Fed money expansion policies under Alan Greenspan.
Decelerating consumer spending (and higher saving) in the private sector and shrinkage of credit private are causing poor job creation, but the good news is that real production and real job creation are slowly coming back. Yet the neo-Keynesian socialists led by Krugman et al. want to put the US economy back on a heroin drip of public spending and higher deficits to immediately stimulate consumption.  
Truth be told, the only way to really fix the US economy in a stable, long-term fashion is to focus on fiscal reform and deficit reduction. When they consider the statement above that inflation is running below the Fed’s targets, all economists should be given pause.  
Even though the US central bank has grown its balance sheet 300% since 2008, the pace of economic activity continues to fall even as financial bubbles proliferate around the world. Even with interest rates near zero and the Fed monetizing most of the Treasury’s debt issuance, the only accomplishment of the FOMC has been to create financial bubbles in everything from single-family homes to the ersatz currency known as Bitcoin. In a very real sense, the soaring value of Bitcoin vs. the dollar tells you that financial inflation is brisk even as deflation haunts the real economy. 
The cost of living for all Americans continues to rise, but the volume of spending and all transactions generally is still anemic, even falling. Consider this chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showing the velocity of money, which has been falling rapidly since 2007 and is now at the lowest level since the Great Depression.
“The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period,” notes the St. Louis Fed. “In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.  The frequency of currency exchange can be used to determine the velocity of a given component of the money supply, providing some insight into whether consumers and businesses are saving or spending their money.”
While the majority of the FOMC thinks or at least says they believe that the reduction in government spending is responsible for the lax economic environment, in fact it is a function of the end of 20 years of credit-fueled boom facilitated by the Fed. The speculative “Bitcoin Economy” is surging – at least for now – but the real economy continues to deflate. Americans are shunning the consumer economy, paying down debt, and pulling back on spending more than they earn. The members of the FOMC think this is bad for some reason. Only when the Fed and Congress focus on spurring real growth via tax and spending cuts will we see growth in real jobs and spending that is sustainable.

Congressman Gohmert (R-TX) introduced an amendment to the Continuing Resolution preventing Obama from using federal funds to transport himself to/from a golf course until White House resumes giving tours to the public. 
Today, the White House Vistor’s Office sent out an email to interested parties that announces the suspension of all White House Tours due to the sequester cuts. 



ATTN Interested Parties,
Due to staffing reductions resulting from sequestration, we regret to inform you that White House Tours will be canceled effective Saturday, March 9, 2013 until further notice.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to reschedule affected tours. 
We very much regret having to take this action, particularly during the popular Spring touring season.   For updates regarding this situation, please contact the White House Visitors Office 24 Hour Hotline at (202) XXX-XXXX.
Sincerely,
White House Visitors Office

Congressman Gohmert is a history enthusiast who frequently gives extended tours of the capitol in the evenings to his constituents.  Many tourists come to D.C. this time of year on vacation, specifically to visit the Cherry Blossoms, projected to bloom at the end of the month. These tourists will not be able to take a tour of the White House, and if they scheduled a tour, the tour is cancelled. 

The rules committee in the House is currently deciding whether or not they will allow amendments to be included in the CR.  If they decide to allow amendments, Gohmert will attach his amendment.
Gohmert’s amendment reads: None of the funds made available by a division of this Act may be used to transport the President to or from a golf course until public tours of the White House resume.
According to ObamaGolfCounter.com, the president has played 115 rounds of golf since taking office.  Townhall’s Heather Ginsberg estimates that 341 furloughed jobs could have been saved had the money not been spent of golf trips.

Speaking to the conservative Ripon Society on Tuesday, Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) admitted that he screwed up the public relations aspect of the fiscal cliff negotiations:

Looking back, what I should have done the day after the election was to make it clear the House has passed a bill to extend all of the current tax rates, the House has passed a bill to replace the sequester with cuts in mandatory spending, and the Senate ought to do its work. We’re ready, able and willing to work with the Senate as soon as they produce a bill. It should have been what I said. You know, again, hindsight is 20-20.

Instead, Boehner opened the negotiations with a press conference announcing Republican concessions. In an attempt to appear temperate and moderate, Boehner discarded the principle that Republicans would not embrace higher taxes – a move that Obama quickly turned against Boehner, insisting that higher taxes would be the solution to any debt crisis.

Boehner now recognizes the problem with his strategy, and vows not to engage in any one-on-one negotiations with Obama in the future; instead, he says he will only allow bills to be passed in the House, then in the Senate, as provided for by the Constitution. The House threat to Boehner’s speakership, which was covered in depth by Breitbart News, apparently frightened Boehner enough to change course. “You have no idea the suspicions and the undercurrents that [negotiations with Obama] caused, frankly, a lot of my members,” said Boehner. “It really has, in fact, caused somewhat of a breach that I’ve been in the middle of trying to repair.” 
Boehner is engaged in rehabilitating his image, attempting to overcome perceptions that he has the tendency to cave to President Obama:

Some of our members don’t realize that while I may be a nice enough guy, and I get along with people, when I was voting I had the 8th most conservative voting record in the House. But a lot of our newer members – they don’t know that. And so, you know, they think I’m some squish, that I’m ready to sell them out in a heartbeat, when obviously, most of you in this room know that that ain’t quite who I am.
The best way to overcome that perception is to stand up to the bully president. Unless Boehner embraces that truth, he will continue to lose favor among members of his own caucus.

Capitol Hill talk regarding the Senate deal apparently includes a provision that would take away the Congress’ power to increase the debt ceiling. According to Politico, it looks like the buzz appears to be true.:

The plan includes a proposal offered by McConnell in the 2011 debt ceiling crisis that allows Congress to disapprove of the debt ceiling increase, which means lawmakers will formally vote on whether to reject a debt ceiling increase until Feb. 7. Obama can veto that legislation if it passes. If Congress fails as expected to gather a two-thirds majority to override the veto, the debt ceiling would be raised.

National Journal reported last week:



Whether it’s four weeks from now or in one year, there’d be even less reason to put faith in a last-minute deal next time the U.S. is up against the debt limit.
There’s only one foolproof way to avoid a future crisis: Fundamentally change the way the debt ceiling works. 
This approach isn’t all that radical. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., proposed a reform in January that would change the debt-ceiling mechanism so that Congress would vote to disapprove of an increase, as opposed to approving one. Such a change would limit debt-ceiling negotiations to a veto-proof majority, while still leaving Congress with some power.
The most interesting part of this proposal? It was originally floated in 2011 by Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell. The potential for a bipartisan deal here that fixes the debt-limit problem is real. Sen. Boxer continues to advocate for the change. Right now though, Harry Reid’s office says the senator is not considering any disapproval mechanism. But that could change as this process moves on.
Such a plan would be obviously good for Democrats, as they can get the immediate gratification of not having to risk default in order to fully implement the Affordable Care Act. But it’d be good for Republicans too, who could not only avoid the stigma of blame for a default, but also presumably reap the ruling-party rewards in future Congresses and presidencies. It would also put an immediate political target on President Obama, and Democrats by association, for being the sole entity responsible for raising the debt limit by over a trillion dollars. That opportunity has got to sound pretty good to Republicans ahead of 2014.

Additionally, New York Magazine remarked, the provision would “defang the debt ceiling, returning it to its historical place as an opportunity for ineffectual posturing rather than extortion.” However it would only apply to the next debt ceiling vote.  The debt limit can only currently be increased if Congress affirmatively votes to raise it and the president signs it into law.  During Congress’ last debt limit debate in 2011, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R – KY) wanted to invert this process by making it automatic, unless Congress voted against it and the president did not veto it.  Theoretically, Congress could override a veto, but given the current makeup of both chambers that would be nearly impossible.

Earlier this year, Phil Mickelson suggested that he may have to move out of California because of the state’s confiscatory tax rate. He later was pressured to walk back some of his remarks, but after winning the Open Championship on Sunday–and earning $1.43 million–Mickelson may have to reassess his options. 
Mickelson backed off after complaining about the California state tax rate being raised to 13.3 percent for those earning over $1 million, which occurred when voters approved of Proposition 30 in November of 2012. ESPN reported regularly that Texas’s zero percent state income tax rate, for example, may have had a role in pushing Dwight Howard to ultimately sign with the Houston Rockets (see Breitbart Sports’ table of state taxes before California’s hike). Forbes Magazine is now reminding Mickelson that California will benefit greatly from Mickelson’s British Open win Sunday. Tiger Woods is another athlete who has publicly said he moved out of California, where he was born and raised, because of the state’s high tax rate. 
One report suggests Mickelson may pay over 60 percent of his $1.43 million out in taxes to the UK, IRS and California. As Breitbart Sports reported, athletes are taxed based on where they earn the money (away games go to the state in which a game was played, etc.), but whether California collects their 13.3 percent of the $1.43 million since Mickelson decided not to leave the state is small change compared to what California may get from him after the win in Scotland.


Forbes points out the that the bigger impact of Mickelson’s win will be in extending and potentially even expanding the $36 million a year he gets from endorsements from companies such as KPMG, Barclays, and Callaway. If the British Open win increases his sponsorship by just $2 million, California would receive $5 million in state taxes from him.
The $5 million tax payoff the state of California could receive from Mickelson almost matches the $5.8 million the state could continue to keep after Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson was able to stop the Kings from moving to Washington, where the players would have kept the $5.8 million a year even under their relatively low $44 million team salary.

The Obama White House is scrambling to blame Friday’s abysmal March jobs numbers on the sequester’s trimming of the rate of growth in federal budgets that have yet to fully commence. 
After the Labor Department announced that a mass exodus of 663,000 workers left the U.S. workforce last month and that job creation fell 112,000 jobs short of projections, Obama’s top economic adviser Alan B. Krueger, took to the White House blog to blame the sequester:

It is important to bear in mind that the March household and payroll surveys are the first monthly surveys to look at employment since the beginning of sequestration.  While the recovery was gaining traction before sequestration took effect, these arbitrary and unnecessary cuts to government services will be a headwind in the months to come, and will cut key investments in the Nation’s future competitiveness.  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the sequester will reduce employment by 750,000 full-time equivalent jobs by the end of the year. 
Now is not the time for Washington to impose more self-inflicted wounds on the economy.  The administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to put more Americans back to work like rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing.

Krueger did not mention January’s 2% payroll tax increase, which will wipe out an entire year’s worth of wage gains by American workers. Roughly 70% of national expenditures emanate from consumers.


Kathy Bostjancic, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis for The Conference Board business research group, says the major flaw in Obama’s argument is that the sequester has not kicked in yet. 
“What is even more troubling about the most recent slowdown is that it takes place even before the sequester cuts materially hit the economy,” Bostjancic stated in a press release. “This reinforces our view that the estimated 3.5 percent real GDP growth in Q1 is not likely to be sustained. Instead, we see the overall economy, led by the consumer, downshifting significantly in the second quarter, struggling to get close to 1 percent real growth.” 
The need to curb Washington’s spending will have an effect on jobs, says Bostjancich, but they will likely be centered around “further contraction in government sector jobs.”

Indeed, the unemployment rate for government workers is less than half (3.6%) the national unemployment rate. Since July, the government has added 618,000 government workers to its payrolls, employing 20,633,000 individuals.
While Friday’s reporting shows a 7.6% unemployment rate, the real rate–including the millions who have given up hope and quit looking for work, are in part-time positions and needing full-time work, etc.–is closer to 15%, says billionaire former Obama supporter Mort Zuckerman. Worse, says Zuckerman, “Multiple job-holders are up by 340,000 to 7.26 million. In essence then, all of the ‘new’ positions are going to people who already are working, mostly part-time.”
To be sure, the need to slam the brakes on Washington’s reckless spending will likely shed jobs, and possibly the 100,000 to 300,000 economists project. But the 90,000,000 Americans who no longer work as of last month have myriad other factors to blame than a cut the equivalent of 0.5% of the national debt that has yet to go into effect.

As the federal government enters day three of a partial shutdown, talk in Congress is turning increasingly to a “grand bargain” that would include entitlement and tax reform as a way to resolve the current fiscal impasse. Rep. Steve Stivers, a close Boehner ally, even floated the idea that “revenue”, i.e. higher taxes, could be part of this “bargain.” 
There is no clear path to reopening government right now. Obama and Senate Democrats continue to refuse to negotiate or compromise on legislation to provide new government funding. In just two weeks, however, the federal government is set to hit its debt ceiling, exhausting its borrowing authority. After this, the government will have to pay its bills out of continuing tax collections, necessitating dramatic cuts in spending or a default on the nation’s existing debt payments. 
As the government shutdown and debt ceiling issues intertwine, many in the GOP believe that only a “grand bargain” on spending and revenue is a big enough vehicle to restore government funding and lift the debt ceiling. During the last debt ceiling negotiations, in 2011, the GOP was close to agreeing to a similar “grand bargain.” The deal fell apart in the 11th hour, however, because President Obama increased his demands for new revenue. 


This experience should caution the GOP against unilaterally proposing another “grand bargain” at this time. Obama and the Senate Democrats seem incapable of negotiating in good faith. The rhetoric they currently employ against Republicans does not suggest they are ready to cede ground on fiscal issues in any meaningful way. It is hard to imagine Harry Reid shifting from calling Republicans “anarchists” to treating them as honest brokers in a substantive negotiation over the nation’s fiscal policy. 

Theoretically, a “grand bargain” could be a good idea, given the urgent need to reform the nation’s entitlement programs and tax code. In reality, however, with Republicans only controlling the House, any “grand bargain” is likely to be light on spending reform and heavy on tax hikes.
If Republicans take control of the Senate in 2014, which is increasingly likely, conservatives and moderate Republicans would be in a better position to push a “grand bargain” that would contain meaningful reforms that could boost the economy. 
Policy considerations, however, may yield to internal GOP politics. Paul Ryan, who was granted a special waiver to continuing chairing the Budget Committee, is eager to strike a significant budget deal while he has the gavel. Rep. David Camp, too, is entering his final term chairing the Ways and Means Committee and is anxious to enact some kind of tax reform while he heads the committee. Their desire for a personal legacy will make them strong advocates for a “grand bargain,” despite the GOP’s relatively weak hand. 
The GOP faces a series of tough choices over the next two weeks. So, too, do Obama and the Senate Democrats. Much of the current situation is due to the inability of the Senate to produce a regular budget over the past five years. The failed stimulus program, bailouts, expanded welfare payments and new entitlements like ObamaCare has caused government spending to skyrocket, pushing the national debt to unsustainable levels. Even a mainstream media black-out can’t forever keep those facts from the American public. 
The onus isn’t on Republicans to solve the nation’s fiscal crisis. President Obama and Senate Democrats have brought us to this point. It should be up to them to steer us out of it.

Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) told the financial markets what they wanted to hear, namely that the Federal Reserve is going to moderate massive purchases of Treasury debt and mortgage securities.
The news of the “tapering” of Fed bond purchases sent stock prices soaring, this on the notion that the US economy is improving. Would that it were so.  
Cardiff Garcia of FTAlphaville reports that the FOMC reduced slightly the rate of bond purchases:


Beginning in January, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than $45 billion per month.
The trouble is that Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen, and the rest of the FOMC remain in fantasy land when it comes to the causes of our shared economic malaise. While parts of the US economy are doing pretty well, the housing and financial sectors are in a terrible funk. Read the last installment of Washington & Wall Street, “Regulation Likely to Slow the Housing Recovery in 2013,” if you want the gnarly details.
There are a couple of basic problems with how American economists and investors look at the economy and issues such as consumer demand. For example, consider this statement by the FOMC last week:


Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint may be diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Really? The liberal/socialist view of demand-side economists championed by the likes of Paul Krugman holds that a failure by government to spend (and borrow) more is somehow restraining the US economy. In reality, however, we are in a period of extended economic hangover following from the housing boom of the 2000s, when many jobs were supported by speculative credit creation and equally dicey housing activity, both in the US and internationally. Just read the frightening article from The New York Times, “Irish Try to Eradicate Ghosts of a Housing Crash,” and the idea is clear. All of the bad debt behind the housing boom ultimately came about due to the irresponsible Fed money expansion policies under Alan Greenspan.
Decelerating consumer spending (and higher saving) in the private sector and shrinkage of credit private are causing poor job creation, but the good news is that real production and real job creation are slowly coming back. Yet the neo-Keynesian socialists led by Krugman et al. want to put the US economy back on a heroin drip of public spending and higher deficits to immediately stimulate consumption.  
Truth be told, the only way to really fix the US economy in a stable, long-term fashion is to focus on fiscal reform and deficit reduction. When they consider the statement above that inflation is running below the Fed’s targets, all economists should be given pause.  
Even though the US central bank has grown its balance sheet 300% since 2008, the pace of economic activity continues to fall even as financial bubbles proliferate around the world. Even with interest rates near zero and the Fed monetizing most of the Treasury’s debt issuance, the only accomplishment of the FOMC has been to create financial bubbles in everything from single-family homes to the ersatz currency known as Bitcoin. In a very real sense, the soaring value of Bitcoin vs. the dollar tells you that financial inflation is brisk even as deflation haunts the real economy. 
The cost of living for all Americans continues to rise, but the volume of spending and all transactions generally is still anemic, even falling. Consider this chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showing the velocity of money, which has been falling rapidly since 2007 and is now at the lowest level since the Great Depression.
“The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period,” notes the St. Louis Fed. “In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.  The frequency of currency exchange can be used to determine the velocity of a given component of the money supply, providing some insight into whether consumers and businesses are saving or spending their money.”
While the majority of the FOMC thinks or at least says they believe that the reduction in government spending is responsible for the lax economic environment, in fact it is a function of the end of 20 years of credit-fueled boom facilitated by the Fed. The speculative “Bitcoin Economy” is surging – at least for now – but the real economy continues to deflate. Americans are shunning the consumer economy, paying down debt, and pulling back on spending more than they earn. The members of the FOMC think this is bad for some reason. Only when the Fed and Congress focus on spurring real growth via tax and spending cuts will we see growth in real jobs and spending that is sustainable.

During his Monday press conference, Barack Obama bizarrely claimed he needs to raise the debt ceiling because Congress won’t stop ordering him to spend money:

This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me: ‘You need to fund our Defense Department at such-and-such a level. You need to send Social Security checks. You need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans.’ They lay all this out for me, and–because they have the spending power–and so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills.
Separately, they also have to authorize a raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can’t do is tell me to spend X and then say, but we’re not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.

Of course, Obama isn’t mentioning that it is largely his side that wants to spend, while the GOP wants to cut spending. 



The issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation and so there’s a very simple solution to this. Congress authorizes us to pay our bills. Now if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don’t have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I’m happy to take it.
If they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done and you know, there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no, you know, easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending.

The president’s entire defense is predicated on the premise that spending absolutely must stay at its current levels, an issue he has been entirely unwilling to discuss with Republicans in Congress.
Notice that for the past two years, the House, run by the GOP, has passed budgets while the Democratic Senate hasn’t. Who’s the fiscally irresponsible party here?

On Saturday, an estimated 1.3 million long-term unemployed Americans will lose their unemployment insurance benefits. For the first time since 2008, Congress failed to extend the benefits went it passed a budget just before Christmas. The Obama Administration has warned that more than 4 million unemployed could lose benefits next year unless Congress passes another extension. 
In the past, states provided unemployed workers with up to 26 weeks of benefits. At the start of the recession, the federal government provided extra weeks of assistance. During the depths of the recession, federal and state governments provided 99 weeks of cash payments. For those keeping score at home, that is almost 2 years of financial assistance. The average benefit is around $1,100 a month. 
The expiration of benefits for the long-term unemployed has already sparked a round of finger-pointing in Washington. On Friday, the left-wing Huffington Post put much of the blame on Democrats. “The record indicates that Democrats were late to show up, distracted in part by other concerns,” HuffPo reported. “A month and a half before the deadline, few members of Congress or administration officials were even talking about unemployment insurance.”


Extending the benefits for another year would cost the government $25 billion. The left argues that this assistance helps the economy, by giving the unemployed cash to purchase consumer goods. The Congressional Budget Office has even estimated that extending benefits for the unemployed creates around 200,000 jobs. 
This argument is absurd. It is the fiscal policy version of the “broken windows” economic fallacy. If all my windows were broken, I would have to spend a lot of money replacing them. This would theoretically boost the economy by providing work for glaziers and other workers. This does not factor, however, what else I could have done with my money. It is likely that it could have been spent or invested far more productively than simply replacing what I already had. 
If the government wants to extend unemployment benefits for another year, it will have to borrow $25 billion. The cost of this will actually increase over time, as the government pays interest on this debt. These are resources that can’t be used for anything else, whether its infrastructure improvements or tax reform. 

A bigger problem than the duration of unemployment benefits, is the number of the long-term unemployed. More than 4 million Americans looking for work have been unemployed for more than 27 weeks, beyond the time-frame of traditional unemployment insurance. The recession officially ended more than 4 years ago. Such a large number of long-term unemployed suggests deeper problems with the economy than can be fixed by simply adding additional benefits. 
Absurdly, at the same time the left is pushing for an extension of unemployment benefits, it is also pushing to hike the minimum wage. If someone has been unemployed for 99 weeks, mandating higher wages is unlikely to be of much help. Minimum wage hikes, at least at the margin, have a negative impact on job creation. 
Extending unemployment benefits may itself be counter-productive for job creation. A landmark study from Sweden found that more generous unemployment benefits increased the rates of unemployment. The relationship was very robust. Every 1% point increase in benefits increased unemployment by 5%.  
In 2007, Sweden reformed its unemployment insurance system. The government provides 60 weeks of benefits, but on a sliding scale. The longer someone is unemployed, the less they receive in assistance. This system provides a powerful incentive to find work. 
It is perhaps telling that, in 2013, we are in such a state that American lawmakers should look to Sweden for economic reforms.

In an interview with Stephen Moore of the Wall Street Journal, newly re-elected House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) opened up about President Obama’s utter unwillingness to cut a single dollar from federal spending. In a stunning admission, Obama reportedly told Boehner, “We don’t have a spending problem.”
Boehner added that President Obama continues to maintain that America’s federal deficit is caused not by governmental overspending but by “a health-care problem.” Said Boehner, “They blame all of the fiscal woes on our health-care system.” Boehner told Obama, “Clearly we have a health-care problem, which is about to get worse with Obamacare. But, Mr. President, we have a very serious spending problem.” Obama eventually replied, “I’m getting tired of hearing you say that.”


Obama may be tired of hearing Boehner talk about a spending problem, particularly when Obama has been re-elected on the basis of ignoring government spending. Nonetheless, America does have a spending problem, which Obama is steadfastly ignoring. “He’s so ideological himself,” Boehner explained, “and he’s unwilling to take on the left of his own party.” That’s why Obama refused to raise the retirement age for Medicare after agreeing to it. “He admitted in meetings that he couldn’t sell things to his own members,” said Boehner. “But he didn’t even want to try … We could never get him to step up.”

Boehner says that there will be no new tax increases over the debt ceiling. “The tax issue is resolved,” he said. And he said that more closed-door negotiations with Obama would be “futile.” It’s a bit too late to recognize that, but better late than never.
Obama need not negotiate on spending. He can just continue to bully Republicans by suggesting that they are the party of the rich – and his media lackeys can pretend that it’s fiscally irresponsible to ask the government to live within its means.

President Barack Obama is supposed to lead the country, but barely participated in the “fiscal cliff” negotiations except to berate Republicans in the media. As Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid is meant to move legislation through the upper chamber, but gave up and was sidelined by the Vice President. House Speaker John Boehner is meant to lead his caucus, but they rejected his proposals, and he barely held onto his job.
Welcome to post-“fiscal cliff” Washington, a leaderless chasm in which no one is bold enough to offer an agenda, nor confident enough to compromise. Even the Tea Party refuses to step up: it was ironic that Michele Bachmann cast the 218th vote that gave Boehner the bare majority he needed to retain the Speaker’s gavel. This is an age without a Reagan, without a Thatcher–without even a Ted Kennedy, on the other side.


President Obama marked the conclusion of the “fiscal cliff” deal by promising he would not negotiate with Congress on the debt ceiling. Likewise, Speaker Boehner promised he would no longer negotiate directly with the President. These are absurd promises that mock the spirit of the Constitution’s separation of powers, bold statements that are meant to convey strength but in reality betray the weaknesses of both party’s leaders. 

The branches must co-govern, even as they check each other’s power. Yet the separation of powers is something President Obama has never accepted, as he ignores Congress and writes regulations or makes appointments as he pleases. He resents the fact that Congress controls the debt ceiling, and there is now serious talk that he might simply ignore Congress by minting a $1 trillion coin and depositing it in the Treasury.
Meanwhile, in Congress, the Senate has treated the Republican-controlled House as if it were an illegitimate body, ignoring dozens of economic bills passed through the lower chamber even as it refuses to pass a budget. The “extremist” House compromised on the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff, much to the annoyance of the GOP base, because Republicans accepted the reality of divided government. Not so the Democrats.
The new Republican temptation, as expressed by Boehner’s promise not to deal one-on-one with the President, is to withdraw from a political process in which good faith is punished by mockery and demands for more concessions. That is understandable, but mistaken. President Obama is actually weaker than ever, because there is no political will to enact further tax hikes, and because fiscal circumstances demand spending cuts. 
These are precisely the conditions under which Republican leaders should want to engage President Obama directly. The President does not want to negotiate because he knows he will have to make concessions–just as, during the campaign, he took little interest in debating Gov. Mitt Romney because he did not want to have to defend his record. The House has the opportunity, finally, to hold the President accountable for his debts.
But instead of inviting direct talks, Speaker Boehner had to reject them to retain his position. And so Republicans have re-elected a leader on a promise not to lead. It is almost as bad as watching Democrats re-elect Nancy Pelosi as Minority Leader after guiding her party to two successive defeats. 
Because there are few consequences for bad leadership, there is little good leadership. And so we stagger into the next crisis.

“I can’t hear you, America! Good morning!” black conservative activist and media personality Wayne Dupree, known online as “News Ninja 2012,” said as he fired up the crowd at Freedom Plaza in downtown Washington, D.C. “I still can’t hear you! Good morning, America!”
Dupree walked through how he served in the U.S. military and how he “can say, proudly say, that I have great personal interest in what goes on in my country.”
“We fight for this country because we believe in its greatness,” Dupree said. “We believe in this Democracy. And we believe in freedom for all citizens. And we will continue to fight and defend and preserve those freedoms for our citizens.”


Dupree went on to argue that “the real reason why we’re here today, July 15, here on Freedom Plaza, is because we hear the battle cries, and Washington calling for us Americans to stand up and fight.”

Dupree then railed on the “Gang of Eight” Senate immigration bill. “This legislation is nothing but a wish list written by corporate lobbyists and checked off by career politicians in order to exploit cheap labor and fill campaign coffers for the next election,” he said. “This legislation robs us of the American dream and it undermines our Democratic process. We the People have been called upon to protect our freedom, and we do this with a smile on our faces and patriotism in our hearts.”
“This is not racist,” Dupree added later in the speech. “Let me say that again: This is not racist! This is an American thing. It’s not because we’re ‘hate-mongers who discriminate against those that want a better life.’ We cannot allow people who defy our laws, threaten our national security, and threaten our economy to redefine what America stands for. No way. Not without a fight.”
  Here’s video of Dupree’s whole speech.

            ABC News White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl questioned Press Secretary Jay Carney on Obama’s sequester predictions:
KARL: Jay, even before we heard from Secretary LaHood, we’ve heard some dire warnings coming from the administration.  Just to tick through a few, we’ve heard about more wildfires, more workplace deaths, higher risk of terrorism, criminals set free.  Is there any exaggeration going on here?MR. CARNEY:  I think all of those things come from reduced numbers of people fighting fires, reduced numbers of people doing inspections of our food, reduced numbers of people engaging in air traffic control.  I mean, those are just the facts, Jon.KARL: No other way to squeeze 3 percent out of the federal budget?MR. CARNEY:  I think we had this colloquy yesterday.  The fact of the matter is that you are talking about a 13 percent cut in our defense budget and 9 percent cut in our nondefense discretionary budget this year.  And there is no way to do that, based on the way the law is written, without having hugely negative impacts on individuals and families.  Furloughs would have to happen.  Layoffs would have to happen.  That is a fact. And it’s not just us saying this.  You don’t believe us, maybe you believe the CBO.  Maybe you believe Macroeconomics Advisers or Moody’s.  They have projected fully a half a percentage point reduction in GDP growth.  And you know, because you cover this stuff, what that means economically.  They have projected three-quarters of a million people will lose their jobs if the sequester takes effect and stays in effect.Those are real-world consequences.  These are real people.  It’s not political leverage.  It’s a fact.  And we’re out there making clear that this is an important issue to deal with because of the real-world implications.  The reason why the President continues to put forward and we made clear again on paper what we have been making clear all along, the President’s very reasonable offer remains on the table because he wants to avoid this.Let’s just, again, go back to my basic point.  It is not an easy sell to Democrats to go along as part of a big deal with superlative CPI.  It is not an easy argument necessarily to get Democrats to go along with the reforms that the President has put in place in his proposal on entitlement reforms or with the spending cuts.  It was not easy to sign into law $1.1 trillion in spending cuts.  But he has done it, and Democrats have done it.  And what we haven’t seen from Republicans is anything equivalent.  And we’re just looking for a negotiating partner here.  We’re just looking for somebody to meet us halfway.

On Wednesday, President Barack Obama said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asked for and accepted the resignation of the acting Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Steven T. Miller. However, Miller’s  term as acting IRS Commissioner was up in a couple of weeks, and it is presently unclear whether he was forced to resign or was simply granting notice that his term was up.
Obama will face reporters on Thursday to answer questions about the IRS scandal that placed nearly 500 conservative organizations in the IRS’s crosshairs during the 2010 and 2012 elections. 
Beyond the classic question, “What did the Administration know and when did it know it?”, a myriad of questions remain unanswered.  Here are just a few:


Who inside the IRS hatched the plan to target conservatives and what, if any, connections do they, their associates, or superiors have to the Obama White House, campaign team, or other political organizations?
Who at the IRS leaked confidential tax documents to the progressive-leaning journalism group ProPublica, an action which the IRS official manual says can result in up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000?
Who are the two “rogue” individuals disgraced former IRS Commissioner Stevens said went “off the reservation” and acted “overly aggressive” and what, if any, connections do they have politically? If, as the Inspector General report alleges, political motivations were not driving the targeting of conservatives, then what was?  Also, what “discipline” did the two rogue agents receive?
Did IRS agents coordinate with Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) or his staff to “go after them [conservative groups],” as he told the New York Times, following Levin’s letters to then-IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman and Director Lois Lerner? 
Did Sen. Max Baucus (D-MO) or his staff communicate or coordinate with IRS agents after Baucus wrote this September 28, 2010 letter instructing then-Commissioner Douglas Shulman to have his “agency survey major 401(c)(4), (c)(5) and (c)(6) organizations to determine whether they are acting as conduits for major donors advancing their own private interests”?
What communications took place between IRS agents and the following senators and their staffs following the delivery of this jointly written letter demanding the IRS crack down on “abuse of the tax code by political groups focused on federal election activities”: Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO ), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Sen. Al Franken (D-MN)?
What communications existed between Obama reelection campaign co-chair Joe Solomonese, whom the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) alleges received its confidential tax returns, and IRS agents?
What portion of Obama’s 79% increase in audits of charities were of conservative groups?
If political motivations were not driving the selective targeting of 500 conservative organizations, then why were a similar number of liberal groups not harassed?
What role did IRS Rulings and Agreements Division Director Holly Paz, who in 2008 donated $2,000 to Obama, play in ratcheting up IRS investigations, as she promised she would in June 2012?

Whether reporters will ask and Obama will answer the critical questions that must be resolved remains to be seen.

In legislation filed yesterday, the House GOP Leadership made an important twist in their plan to pass a short-term increase in the debt ceiling. Rather than increase the debt ceiling by a few hundred billion dollars, buying them time for further talks on the budget, they have opted to “suspend” the debt ceiling. Its a blatant abdication of their constitutional authority. It’s an ominous sign of the talks to come. 
Article 1 of the US Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to borrow money to fund the government. Up until World War I, Congress would approve every bond issuance. The borrowing demands of the war made this impractical, so Congress authorized a “debt ceiling,” where the government could freely borrow up to a statutory limit and then go back to Congress to approve additional borrowing. Think of it as giving your teenager a pre-paid debit card. 
With this measure, the government had more flexibility to manage its affairs while preserving the Constitutional principle that Congress controlled the purse strings. 


“Suspending” the debt ceiling until May upends this principle. Upon enactment, the government’s borrowing authority would be unlimited until May. Presumably, the government could borrow trillions in this window, providing either the markets or the Fed would meet the new supply of debt. 

Worse, however, is that the GOP move establishes a very slippery precedent. The left has been agitating to simply eliminate the idea of a debt ceiling entirely. For all its flaws, the ceiling at least guarantees we will have some debate about government spending. The left finds this annoying. Unfortunately, the GOP plan to “suspend” the ceiling provides at least partial support to this argument. If we can “suspend” it for three months, why not a year? Once you’ve surrendered the constitutional principle behind the ceiling where and how can you draw a line? 
Despite their past history of punting on difficult fiscal issues, I was willing to give the House GOP a skeptical benefit of the doubt on their plan for a short-term lift in the ceiling. The deficit debate has three components, ie. debt ceiling, sequestration, and budget expiration, which happen close to each other, but not simultaneously. It made some strategic sense to weave them together into a single debate. 
I assumed, however, that this would entail an increase in the debt ceiling of a few hundred billion dollars, to provide the time to negotiate a longer-term deal. I did not anticipate it would feature the House GOP surrendering its constitutional obligations. 
When the GOP took control of the House, they vowed that every piece of legislation would contain specific language citing the constitutional authority for the proposed law. It would be interesting to see their interpretation of the constitutional authority to suspend the document.

The mainstream media in the United States have ignored comments made by President Barack Obama during his a speech in Northern Ireland this week in which he described religious education as a source of conflict.
The president’s comments have sparked widespread controversy and criticism in the Irish media, as well as in Catholic media in the U.S., but the mainstream media have ignored Obama’s contentious remarks.


Obama, who attended an elite private high school, told an audience in Belfast on Monday [emphasis added]:


Because issues like segregated schools and housing, lack of jobs and opportunity — symbols of history that are a source of pride for some and pain for others — these are not tangential to peace; they’re essential to it.  If towns remain divided — if Catholics have their schools and buildings, and Protestants have theirs — if we can’t see ourselves in one another, if fear or resentment are allowed to harden, that encourages division.  It discourages cooperation.

Catholic media have interpreted the remarks as an attack on religious education itself, and Catholic education in particular. The mainstream media, which seized on every remark made by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney during his 2012 international trip as a near-disqualifying “gaffe,” have been entirely silent.
While gaffes are usually defined as extemporaneous, off-the-cuff errors or poorly judged statements, Obama’s remarks were planned in advance. The “gaffe” in Obama’s Belfast remarks lies in the fact that Obama did not consider the sensitivities of his audience–or that he inadvertently revealed his own anti-religious prejudice.
To travel to a city troubled by conflict, and to then insult the members of at least one of the two communities, is not only a gaffe, but a serious diplomatic error. 
Unless, of course, the speaker is President Barack Obama.

Democrat politicians, positioning themselves to share in the spoils, are heaping endorsements on Hillary Clinton to run for President in 2016. Topping the list of lawmakers exalting the former First Lady and former Secretary of State are Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). 
Clinton has not openly declared she is running in 2016. Yet, according to political strategist Tad Devine who helped Al Gore and John Kerry in their presidential bids, “She’s the prohibitive front-runner. She’s in a stronger position than anyone seeking the nomination other than an incumbent president in the last 40 years.” Clinton’s front runner status provides “a powerful inducement for figures to offer her early support,” he further commented.


House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, hoping to regain her leadership as Speaker of the House, also shares her support for the former First Lady. Pelosi recently stated, “If she were to run, I think that she would be the candidate, and I think she’d be one of the best prepared — and she would win.”

Besides Pelosi, Reid, and Schumer clamoring to jump on the Clinton band wagon, other less influential democratic legislators are trying to clutch onto the Clinton coattails. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), is willing to forget that she suggested in 2008 former President Bill Clinton may not be a good role model and that she wouldn’t let her daughter near him. Respecting the power of the Clintons, she now boasts, “I was one of the first to do the Ready for Hillary rollout. I’ve been publicly way out there for a while.”
Needless to say, there is good reason to be lending your support to Ms. Clinton. She and husband Bill prove to be exhaustive fundraisers and help draw potential voters to the polls, including female and minority voters. All of this means positive election outcomes and greater chances for Dems to win in their individual races. Moreover, an early coronation for Hillary will avoid unnecessary in-house battles that are often damaging in presidential primaries.

Politico’s Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei stretched their writing wings and penned an editorial Thursday night on the looming collapse of the Republican party. Allen and VandeHai, whose day jobs are to undercut the GOP and its candidates, feign concern that the party isn’t doing enough to appeal to voters who don’t support the party. A more interesting story for the democrats-with-by-lines is the precipitous drop in support for Obama on every major issue. 
According to Gallup, just 35% of Americans support Obama’s handling of the economy. In early June, before Obama embarked on an extensive tour of speeches about the economy, 42% approved of his efforts. In other words, the more he talked about the economy, the less Americans approved of how he was handling it. 
It isn’t just the economy, though. Americans don’t support how Obama is handling virtually every issue. Only 26% support Obama’s handling of the federal deficit. Taxes? 36% approve. Foreign Affairs? 40%. Immigration? 39%. Health Care? 39%. Only on fighting terrorism (50%) and race relations (51%) does Obama win the backing of a majority, just, of Americans. 


Obama basically has the backing of the Democrat base and no one else. With Republicans holding the House, 30 Governorships and more state legislative districts and statewide offices than almost any time in history, and likely to make gains in the Senate next year, it seems it is the Democrats who are on Allen and VandeHai’s “eve of destruction.”  
To stitch together their partisan theory, Allen and VandeHei point to perceived problems the GOP has with African-Americans, Hispanics and gays. None of these demographic groups ever formed any meaningful part of a winning coalition for the GOP. No political party should actively try to alienate a block of voters, but the GOP’s path to future victory isn’t paved with pandering appeals to these groups either. 
Politico’s editorial is largely built around the presumed need for the GOP to pass some kind of amnesty legislation to appeal to Hispanic voters. While it is certainly true that the nation needs to reform its broken immigration system, reform comes in many varieties. A recent poll found that 60% of Hispanics want the border secured before amnesty is granted, a position in line with a majority of the GOP caucus in the House. Allen and VandeHai make the mistake of accepting the conventional wisdom in DC that “immigration reform” means accepting the Senate “Gang of 8” bill. In the alternative universe that is reality, the issue is far more complex.   

Even if the House GOP were to reverse course and embrace amnesty, it isn’t at clear they would benefit at the ballot box. George H. W. Bush was part of an Administration that actually granted amnesty to illegal immigrants, and he received the lowest percentage of support from Hispanics than almost any time previously. If Mitt Romney had magically received 70% of the Hispanic vote last year, he still would have lost to President Obama. There just aren’t enough voters in any of the demographics Politico focuses on to make that much of a difference for the GOP.
Mitt Romney largely lost the election last year because millions of conservatives and working-class whites failed to show up at the polls. In the last two cycles, the party nominated the moderate, centrist candidates the media barks the GOP needs and large swathes of the party’s base stayed home. The GOP would be better served “auditing” its outreach and messaging to these groups than fine-tune its messaging to groups preternaturally wired to vote against the party. 
In modern political history, the GOP has won when it has embraced its conservative principles and articulated a message of freedom and enterprise. Freedom is the most inclusive message in politics. As the late Andrew Breitbart used to say, “If we can’t sell Freedom, we suck.” 
Allen and VandeHei would rather the GOP adopt the Democrat playbook and make explicit appeals based on identity politics. An healthy dash of racial politics with a pinch of feminist rhetoric. It is a recipe for disaster for the GOP. Which is, of course, why Politico is pushing it.   
If Republicans choose to take advice from hacks like Allen and VandeHai, then they deserve the failures they will surely reap.

10446	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/20/State-Rep-Joe-Carr-Will-Challenge-Lamar-Alexander-in-TN-GOP-Senate-Primary	News	0	Elections	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
State Representative Joe Carr announced on Ralph Bristol’s Nashville talk radio program on Tuesday that he is a candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. Carr will compete against incumbent Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) in the party’s August 2014 primary. Bristol had promised his listeners on Monday that someone would make a “major announcement” that will “alter the Tennessee political landscape,” and at 7:10 in the morning Joe Carr delivered on that promise.
“I am announcing as a candidate for the United State Senate,” Carr told Bristol.


Carr left no doubt with whom he will stand in the Senate. “Conservatives deserve a clear voice in this election, and conservative champions like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul need a strong ally from Tennessee in the US Senate.” Carr told Bristol.
In a statement released by the campaign as he announced on Bristol’s program, Carr said, “I will advance the conservative movement in Washington. I will fight for the Constitution and the first principles that made our country great: personal responsibility, individual liberty, and limited government. I will stand firm in defense of the 2nd amendment and insure that life of the unborn have a strong and vocal advocate.”
Carr blasted incumbent Republican Senator Lamar Alexander’s voting record. “Lamar Alexander has failed to advance the conservative movement and change Washington,” he charged, then hit the 73 year old Alexander on three main issues. “He voted for amnesty for 11 million illegals, supported funding Obamacare and rubber stamped Obama’s appointments to cabinet level positions and the Supreme Court. Voting with President Obama 62% of the time is unacceptable.”


A Triton Poll released on Sunday in an exclusive Breitbart story showed that Senator Alexander trails a generic “credible conservative” challenger by 5 points, 49% to 44%. Carr’s announcement on Tuesday puts an established name and face to that challenger for the first time. Bristol asked Carr if the results of that poll influenced his decision to challenge Alexander. “It confirmed what we knew. Lamar is popular, but there is a disconnect between the way he votes and what Tennesseans want.”
“If Lamar Alexander is voting with Barack Hussein Obama 62% of the time, he’s voting against Tennesseans 62% of the time,” Carr told Bristol.
As a state representative, where he is the co-founder of the Tenth Amendment Caucus, Carr has gained a reputation as a conservative firebrand. He is expected to join announced candidate Brenda Lenard and potential candidate Kevin Kookogey at an August 31 BEAT LAMAR Forum in Nashville.
Well respected conservative businessman Lee Beaman, who owns several large automobile dealerships in Middle Tennessee, will be Carr’s state campaign chairman. In a statement released by the campaign as Carr announced, Beaman said that “from the beginning, several of us . . . urged Rep. Carr to run for the US Senate. He led the fight to curb illegal immigration, abolish the death tax and protect the 2nd amendment, and we know he’ll lead from the front and change Washington.”

Before announcing for the Senate, Carr withdrew from the Fourth Congressional District race. With Carr’s departure from that race, incumbent Republican Congressman Scott Desjarlais, first elected in 2010 but beset by personal issues and weak fundraising, now faces only one major challenger, State Senator Jim Tracy. Carr currently represents a Rutherford County district in the Tennessee General Assembly.
Carr noted that his move to the Senate race is in response to widespread support for his own challenge to Senator Alexander. “Since I first announced my congressional exploratory committee eight months ago I have received literally hundreds and hundreds of requests from Tennesseans asking me to run for the US Senate instead of the US House. Tennesseans are hungry for strong, principled, conservative leadership, so I am answering the call.”
Carr sounded like a man prepared for a long and tough political battle. “I have no illusions. This is David versus Goliath. But I have extraordinary faith in my fellow Tennesseans. They will see through the spin and the rhetoric and recognize they have a clear choice to elect a conservative fighter. I will work tirelessly, and I will give my all for Tennessee.”
Carr enters the Senate race able to use the $275,000 he has in his Congressional campaign committee. With Beaman and other conservative Tennessee donors backing him, Carr is positioned to raise enough money to mount a serious challenge to the well financed Alexander.
Carr’s in-studio announcement on Bristol’s program was the first time in Tennessee political history that a major politician announced their candidacy for the United States Senate on a talk radio program. 
Rep. Carr, a 1981 graduate of Middle Tennessee State University, is a business consultant who helps companies become more energy efficient. Additionally, he and his wife Ginny own and operate Cedar Snag Farms in Lascassas.?He was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 2008 and currently serves as Chairman of the Local Government subcommittee. He is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, a member of the National Federation of Independent Business, Tennessee Right to Life, Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce and the MTSU Blue Raider Athletic Association. He is also an accomplished private pilot and member of the Aircraft Owners & Pilot Association.

Gallup reports that President Obama’s approval rating slipped again in the 2nd Quarter, falling to 47.9%. The dip was the second quarterly drop in a row. At the end of last year, on the heels of his reelection, Obama’s approval rating stood at 51.9%. His approval rating is near the bottom of second-term Presidents at this point in their tenure. 
Both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton had significantly higher approval ratings at this point in their Presidencies. Reagan enjoyed a 58.7% approval rating, while Clinton’s approval was slightly lower, 56.3%. Gallup notes that Obama’s poll numbers more closely resemble George W. Bush and Harry Truman. Truman’s approval rating was 48.7%. Bush’s was slightly lower than Obama’s at 47.3%.
Over the next three months, the 19th Quarter in office, every modern President has seen a decline in their approval ratings, with the exceptions of Reagan and Clinton. Both Presidents were presiding over a strong and growing economy. Obama will be presiding, at best, over a weak and stagnant economy. 


Obama faces particular challenges over the next three months, however. This Fall, Washington will be consumed with another fight over raising the nation’s debt ceiling and passing a budget. The last time Obama and Congress fought over the debt ceiling, his approval ratings fell to the lowest of his time in office, 41%. 

Also, in October a major piece of his ObamaCare law is scheduled to go into effect, the federal and state health insurance exchanges. As with any major government undertaking, there are likely going to be problems with the implementation. Massive problems, however, which are not unlikely, could further erode Obama’s approval. 
Obama’s challenge is that he is in a weak position to absorb those threats to his approval. Just a drop of a few points would put his approval in the low 40s. That is a weak position heading into an important election year, when the Democrats are at serious risk of losing control of the Senate. 
Senate Democrats would likely continue to chart their own course, moving themselves away from Obama and the White House. The success or failure of Obama’s second term may be decided this Fall.

On a conference call with reporters Friday afternoon, Republican Ken Cuccinelli said his campaign was closing aggressively and was “positioned to shock the political world” in Tuesday’s Virginia election. Cuccinelli, who trails Democrat Terry McAuliffe in polling, said his campaign was beating their turnout and grass roots goals.
Cuccinelli stressed repeatedly that President Obama’s decision to campaign on Sunday with McAuliffe was a “great opportunity” for the Republican’s campaign. “[The Democrats] are having a rally to celebrate ObamaCare,” Cuccinelli said. He noted that he was the “first person in the country” to fight ObamaCare, referencing the fact that he was the first to file a lawsuit challenging the health care law, and welcomed the introduction of the issue into the Governor’s race. 
He dismissed the possibility that Obama’s appearance would energize Democrats to turn out for McAuliffe. He noted that McAuliffe has released very few specifics about his proposals, making it difficult to increase interest in the campaign. “Voters want to be for something,” Cuccinelli said. 


McAuliffe has maintained a steady lead in recent polling. The Democrat has been helped by a significant fundraising advantage. In recent weeks, McAuliffe has enjoyed a 3 or 4-1 advantage on the airwaves. In the closing days of the campaign, union and Democrat interest groups have poured additional resources into McAuliffe’s campaign, but additional ad spending at this stage in the campaign delivers diminishing returns. 

“We may be out raised,” Cuccinelli said. “But, we won’t be outworked.” 
Tuesday’s election is expected to have a very low turnout, certainly much lower than the turnout in 2012. The electorate in odd-years tends to be older and more conservative than in presidential years, giving the Cuccinelli campaign hope of a strong finish. 
McAuliffe certainly hopes that Obama’s campaign appearance creates enthusiasm among Democrat voters. It is just as likely, however, to galvanize the Republican and conservative base. If Cuccinelli prevails on Tuesday, it will be because conservatives returned to Republicans and opposition to ObamaCare. It’s a message that GOP leaders in DC should heed.

Organizing for Action is a non-profit advocacy organization borne out of the Obama campaign infrastructure. Headed by veteran staff of Obama’s reelection, the organization’s mission is to use the resources that reelected Obama to promote his policy agenda. As a 501 c(4), it can accept unlimited donations. According to its 1st Quarter financials, however, it is struggling to attract the same big donors that fueled Obama’s reelection.
OFA raised $4.8 million in the first three months of 2013. This is a fraction of what the Obama campaign would raise each quarter, even though OFA can accept unlimited donations. OFA certainly tried to maximize this fundraising advantage. For a $500,000 contribution, donors would receive a seat on a “national advisory board” and attend quarterly meetings at the White House. The top donation to the group, however, was half this amount, $250,000 from activist Peter Munger. 
Last month OFA held a founders’ summit in DC, which featured President Obama. The event was open to donors giving at least $50,000 to the group. In the 1st Quarter, however, only 16 donors gave this amount. In all, just over 1,400 donors gave more than $250. 


The underwhelming haul can’t just be attributed to a post-election lull, either. In January alone, the RNC raised almost $7 million and the DNC raised over $4 million. In addition, President Obama has aggressively pushed several high-profile agenda items. Supporting these is OFA’s reason for existing and should have fueled significant contributions. 

OFA’s larger challenge is that a campaign structure to support on individual candidate doesn’t necessarily translate to particular policies. Voters support a candidate for a variety of reasons, often irrespective of policies. Even when a voter completely agrees on an issue, it doesn’t always mean they will take action on that issue. 
Deciding to take action in the climax of a national election is much different than taking action outside of the political frenzy, when daily life has returned. 
Another challenge for OFA is that, inevitably, base activists will turn their attention to other campaigns. Second term Presidents inevitably shrink from the domestic policy debate, as party activists focus on midterm elections and the next nominee for the White House. 
OFA’s struggles attracting big donors suggests this process has already started.

In a speech Saturday evening to the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition at the group’s 13th annual fall banquet in Des Moines, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) argued that now is the time for the Tea Party movement to take its next steps, take control of American government, and frame America’s future with a focus on conservative and liberty-minded principles.
Lee compared the movement’s next stages to those of the American revolution, noting how the earliest stages of revolution began in Boston with the Boston Tea Party, where a band of protesters dumped British tea in the Boston Harbor as a sign of disapproval of the high taxes the British had levied on them. That eventually turned into the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia after Americans fought and won their independence from the British.
“In order to chart our course forward, join me on a journey back,” Lee said in the speech, according to an advance copy provided to Breitbart News. “Back to a time when the people of this continent were just as frustrated with their oppressive government as all of us here tonight are with the Federal government today.”


Lee noted that in 1773, “a group of Americans had had it with the King George establishment which was too big, too expensive and too intrusive in their lives.”
“What would become known as the Boston Tea Party became a clarion cry against the kind of government the colonists did not want,” Lee said. “It turned out to be a pretty important party and a very big deal. But had they stopped at just protesting against the kind of government they didn’t want the Boston Tea Party would not have been even a footnote in history. It would have been just one more vain protest against an oppressive federal establishment.”
Lee explained how the Founding Fathers of America “pressed forward from Boston” and continued their protest and “began a journey toward the kind of government they did want” instead of just protesting a government they disliked.

“It took them 14 long years to get from Boston to Philadelphia, where in 1787 they created, in the Constitution, the kind of government they did want,” Lee said. “Boston to Philadelphia. That is a good model for us to follow today.”
Lee argued that the Tea Party movement and conservatives must always fight against “bad government,” but that the movement must also find a way forward to fight for the right kind of government. “While we must always challenge and fight against bad government we must also be found promoting and pursing the policy path toward the kind of federal government we do want and the people deserve,” Lee said. “Unfortunately with this administration we have, of necessity, had a lot of Boston battles – from fiscal cliffs and attacks on our 2nd amendment rights to sequester and of course, Obamacare.” 
“So let me be clear – we will never back down from a Boston moment – and we will never stop rallying the American people to fight those battles,” he explained. “But it is just as important to keep our eyes in the direction of Philadelphia and the principles and policies which will lead us ultimately to the kind of government we do want.”
According to Des Moines Register, Lee was in Iowa to rally conservatives for the next phases of the battle ahead. He is not running for president–“absolutely not” he answered when asked by the Iowa paper if he would consider a White House bid. Instead, what Lee is doing is becoming the intellectual leader of the conservatives in the U.S. Senate. 
Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Marco Rubio (R-FL), the conservatives with whom Lee usually keeps company, are each potential presidential candidates in 2016. Lee is not, and that puts him in a unique position to focus on accomplishing building the conservative movement and a future message for the Republican Party.

In the past few weeks, Lee has developed a new agenda for the GOP focused on populism. Matt Continetti noted in the Weekly Standard that Lee argued that in a recent speech delivered to the Heritage Foundation, “Candidates need policy ideas that address the concerns of ordinary voters–and they have to campaign, and win, on those ideas.”
Lee’s goal, as he said in the Iowa speech on Saturday, is to help the GOP and the conservative movement develop a platform from which to win the hearts and minds of voters, and more importantly, get the country back on the track to prosperity. 
“To deserve victory, conservatives have to do more than pick a fight,” Lee said. “We have to win a debate. And to do that, we need more than just guts. We need an agenda.”
“It is a long march from Boston to Philadelphia,” he added. “And make no mistake – there are more Boston battles ahead and ‘we the people’ must always be ready to stand up and speak out against the kind of government we do not want. Bad government and bad policy must always be hit, and stopped, head on. Likewise, we must always have the vision of Philadelphia before us – a vision and an agenda for the type of government and they kind of country we do want.”
This has been Lee’s plan since he was elected in 2010, and he is executing it step by step. In 2010, in his election night victory speech, Lee also made the argument that the Tea Party movement needs to travel from Boston to Philadelphia.

Reading the Left’s fevered desires over at Slate isn’t anything new. 
Not even articles breathlessly titled and subtitled:


Go for the Throat! Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party.
Not even articles that read:
The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat. …

Obama’s only remaining option is to pulverize. Whether he succeeds in passing legislation or not, given his ambitions, his goal should be to delegitimize his opponents. Through a series of clarifying fights over controversial issues, he can force Republicans to either side with their coalition’s most extreme elements or cause a rift in the party that will leave it, at least temporarily, in disarray.
Slate is what it is and some bloodthirsty Slate writer orgasmic over the prospect of Obama permanently pulverizing and destroying the GOP is as noteworthy as green on grass.
Oh, except after someone like Brit Hume connects the dots. 
The author of this outrageous left-wing fever dream is John Dickerson, whom Slate describes as “Slate’s chief political correspondent”. What Slate leaves out of its little bio, though, is that Dickerson is also the political director at CBS News. 
Dickerson is merely being Dickerson, and  there’s no doubt he speaks for legions upon legions of those in the media today. 

What is worthy of note, though, is that a CBS News’ political director is now comfortable openly calling for the destruction of the Republican Party. He obviously fears no admonitions from his colleagues or his employer. And why should he? Earlier this week, Bob Schieffer, a CBS News “living legend,” was perfectly comfortable publicly comparing the NRA to Nazis. 
You lump all of this with CNN chief Jeff Zucker applauding Piers Morgan’s shameless feasting off the dead children of Sandy Hook for ratings and attention, and what you have is a media that’s finally … coming out. 
And yet, even as they do, even as they openly celebrate their left-wing biases out of one side of their mouth, out the other, they will claim they remain objective and unbiased. 
The Big Lie has officially arrived. 
And somewhere Dan Rather’s thinking, “Oh, so now it’s okay!?”

In a sign of how active Sarah Palin intends to be in influencing the 2014 elections, SarahPAC, Sarah Palin’s Political Action Committee, released a video on Wednesday meant to ignite independents, conservatives, and Tea Partiers for the 2014 midterm elections. These voters propelled Republican candidates in the historic 2010 midterm elections that saw Republicans take back the House of Representatives on the backs of Tea Party voters. 
Titled “Loaded for Bear,” the video shows footage and headlines from mainstream media outlets like Politico referring to Palin as a “kingmaker” and conservative outlets like Fox News acknowledging how successfully Palin has used her star-power to help elect conservative candidates to office. 


The video also features Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) praising Palin for her fearlessness and being instrumental in electing senators such as Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Pat Toomey, Jeff Flake, Deb Fischer, Cruz and governors like Nikki Haley of South Carolina. 
In 2012, former South Carolina Senator and current president of the Heritage Foundation Jim DeMint said Palin’s endorsement “has more influence in primaries than any other endorsement right now.”
“Sarah Palin picks winners,” Cruz says in the video.

 
And by all measures, that dynamic will not change in the next two years for Palin is often a one-woman clearinghouse for conservative and Tea Party candidates. 
The video, which the group PassCodeCreative made, features Palin at Tea Party rallies in places like Nevada and at the Iowa State Fair in 2011, where she impressed Iowans, liberals and the mainstream media by answering nearly every question asked of her and engaging comfortably with nearly everyone who approached her for nearly six hours. 
In the video, footage of Palin’s 2013 CPAC speech is shown where Palin says, “Don’t let the the big consultants, the big money men and the big bad media scare you off” from running for office.
She urges Republicans to focus more on “rebuilding the middle class” than rebranding the party and says “it is time to furlough the consultants.”

Palin also speaks about her signature issue of dismantling the permanent political class and fighting crony capitalism. She urges Republicans look for candidates from Main Street communities, PTA meetings, small businesses and Tea Party rallies. 
“SarahPAC supporters – the 2014 elections are just twenty months away. We appreciate your support, together we have elected many great commonsense conservatives over the past four years,” SarahPAC Treasurer Tim Crawford says in a statement posted with the video. “Together, we will keep fighting to support these bold candidates.”
Reporters in the video note only “Sarah Palin will hold Congress to account,” that Palin “plays by her own rules,” and Palin “doesn’t care about old dogs” in the GOP. These are the qualities that make Tea Partiers, conservatives, and independents trust Palin. 
The video notes that there are 35 Senate and 36 Governors races in 2014 and ends with a clip of Ted Cruz saying at CPAC, “I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if it were not for Gov. Sarah Palin.”
The words “We Haven’t Yet Begun to Fight” splash across the screen as SarahPAC’s signature bear roars at the end of the video.

Up until just a few days ago, the American media were our country’s top cheerleaders for what they describe as “functional government.” The highest value in government, according to our media, was “getting things done.” And the way to get things done, we were told repeatedly, was through civility, compromise, and bipartisanship. But over the past couple of days, as the prospect of a government shutdown looms closer, the media have completely abandoned those principles.
In the name of civility, I’m old enough to remember (because it was just last week) when the media made politicians pay a heavy political price for harsh rhetoric and name-calling. Again and again, we have seen the media turn away from the issue at hand and make the “rhetoric” used to push the issue the issue. 
For example, when running for president last year, Newt Gingrich wanted to talk about the explosion of food stamp recipients under President Obama. But the media just wanted to talk about whether he was racist for using the words “food stamps.” 


Think about how many times some local Republican politician, or some conservative private citizen, at a town hall meeting, has made national headlines because of what the media described as “extremist political rhetoric.” Good heavens, how many times has some straggler’s Tea Party sign made NBC’s Chuck Todd tut-tut with disgust. 
Think about how many times the media have used how a conservative made a political point as a way to gang up on and relentlessly pummel him or her — all while ignoring the issue. 
Remember that whole fashion season of the media collectively wringing its hands over “eliminationist rhetoric?” Remember how the following fashion season was devoted to the scourge of “bullying.”

But that was then; this is now — and now the media have officially ended their opposition to over-the-top political rhetoric. We don’t know this because the media sent out a memo or made an official announcement; we know this because President Obama and Democrats have been accusing Republicans of being arsonists, anarchists, terrorists, extremists — and this is all Chuck Todd has to say about it…
—

“Hobby horse” “shenanigans” “extremists” and “burn the house down”.  How POTUS described Congress today. GOP getting a taste of bully pulpit
— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) September 27, 2013
—
And the rest of the media have been just as shoulder-shrugging and silent in the face of all this harsh, partisan, eliminationist rhetoric. 

But that is not the only change in media policy that happened this past week. The media are also no longer concerned with making Washington work or the value of bipartisanship and working across the aisle. President Obama, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi have made it absolutely clear that they will not negotiate in budget battles that could result in a government shutdown, and the media are absolutely okay with this.  
In the past, when Republicans dug in their heels or didn’t seem willing to compromise enough to satisfy Obama, the media were outraged over DC dysfunction and the lack of bipartisan compromise.
So it is finally over — the era of the media placing the highest value on bipartisan compromise and civility has finally ended. The media are now for harsh rhetoric, gridlock, and extremism. Or…
…maybe the media are just a bunch of hypocritical, lying, left-wing hacks who despise the GOP and are willing to sell their honor in order to help Obama to a political win?
Either way.

UPDATE [11/5/2013]: With 99% of all precincts reporting, Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe has won the Virginia governor’s race with 47.9% of the vote. Republican Ken Cuccinelli has garnered 45.5%. The Wenzel Strategies poll has proven an accurate measure of the final days of the campaign, with Cuccinelli losing by a much smaller margin than other polling firms predicted. RealClearPolitics’s average of various polls predicted a McAuliffe win by +6.7. The Washington Post’s final poll predicted a +12 McAuliffe win.
A new poll, provided exclusively to Breitbart News, finds the Virginia Governor’s race a virtual dead-heat, with Democrat Terry McAuliffe leading Republican Ken Cuccinelli 41%-40%. Libertarian Robert Sarvis garners 10% and 9% of likely voters who remain undecided. With less than two weeks to go, the race is a toss-up that will likely be decided by turnout, a critical factor in an off-year election.
The poll comes from Wenzel Strategies, which accurately predicted closing momentum for Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Deb Fischer, among others. The slight edge McAuliffe holds is due mostly to stronger support within his partisan base. 81% of Democrats support McAuliffe, against just 68% of Republicans who support Cuccinelli. 


Cuccinelli’s support seems be building, however, as public attention moves away from the recent government shutdown to the failing implementation of ObamaCare. Cuccinelli was a leading national figure suing to overturn the health care law. 

The closeness of the race is apparent in the millions spent by left-wing groups to support McAuliffe in the closing days. In addition, Hillary and Bill Clinton, close allies of McAuliffe, have made themselves permanent fixtures in the Commonwealth, campaigning on his behalf. 
“There’s a reason the Clintons have been called in to spend a week campaigning for McAuliffe and that Bloomberg is pouring in millions with 2 weeks to go,” Brian Baker, President of Ending Spending Action Fund, which commissioned the poll, told Breitbart News. “Their internals must be showing what our poll indicates — that his unfavorables are high and they must try to suppress Cuccinelli turnout to prevail.  All indications are that the numbers are closing, especially post shutdown. The focus will be where the undecideds go and what will Sarvis draw? With the race this close, the poll indicates a vote for Sarvis is a vote for McAuliffe.”
History also is on Cuccinelli’s side. Since the 1980s, the winner of the Virginia Governor’s race has always been from the opposite party of that occupying the White House.

Next week, the Senate will vote on Obama’s nominee to Chair the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, David Medine. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, followed up the confirmation hearing with a list of questions for the nominee. (The complete questionnaire is posted below.)
In his answers to Grassley’s question about profiling for terrorism among foreign nationals, Medine wrote, “In general, profiling of foreign nationals based solely on their point of departure to the United States is inappropriate.” 
The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on February 28 of this year, approving the nomination of Medine. A vote will be held in the Senate next week. The other four nominees to the board have already been confirmed. They were asked to respond to the same questionnaire. 


The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) was created in 2004 after the 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of a board to safeguard civil liberties and oversee the new authorities granted to the security agencies. The PCLOB was slow to develop, holding its first meeting in 2006. The original chair of the board, Lanny Davis, resigned citing disagreements with the White House. In 2007, legislation updated the board’s statute and established the board as an independent agency within the executive branch. Subsequent nominees were stalled for months, until 2010 when Obama nominated two members and then three additional members in 2011. 

Medine’s opinion that constitutional protections against racial profiling should be extended to foreign nationals should raise serious red flags. “There may be intelligence regarding a plot being developed or partially implemented in a particular foreign country that could, under some circumstances, justify heightened scrutiny of visitors from that country linked to other information about the plot” answered Medine. 
It is important to point out, that eight out of ten fugitives on the FBI’s most wanted terrorists list are foreign-born.  
Medine did not answer questions about his views on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the PATRIOT Act. He is currently an attorney fellow at the SEC and prior that, he worked at the law firm Wilmer Hale.

Though Robert Sarvis is the announced Libertarian candidate who is reportedly pulling 10 percent of the vote in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, Republican Ken Cuccinelli likely has more to offer libertarians in the state than Sarvis. Libertarian Ron Paul and his son Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) think so, and both have endorsed Cuccinelli. 
Political analyst Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner, who often espouses the libertarian viewpoint, wrote Friday that Cuccinelli “would arguably be the most libertarian governor in the United States if he wins on Nov. 7,” a point that contrasts sharply with the fact that libertarians are attacking him. 
As Carney observes, Cuccinelli, as Virginia’s attorney general, was the first to challenge the constitutionality of ObamaCare’s mandates, taxes, subsidies, and infringements upon liberty.  


As governor, Cuccinelli’s plan is to cut the state income tax rate by 15 percent for individuals and 33 percent for corporations, creating an environment that is ripe for the free market. 
But libertarians should take note that Cuccinelli’s style is more “pro-economic growth” and less “pro-business,” as evidenced by the fact that his state’s business lobby has had its feathers ruffled by his stand against corporate welfare. Cuccinelli opposed the tax hikes that were sought by Northern Virginia developers to pay for roads and public services, and he pledged to cut the tax credits for special interest groups. 
In addition, Cuccinelli fought, while a state senator, to protect second amendment rights and, consequently, has an “A” rating from the NRA. He also opposed smoking bans when serving as a state senator. 

As Carney states, “Cuccinelli also often chooses government restraint over ‘law and order.'” 
Not afraid to oppose his own party, Cuccinelli, was the only Republican to vote against an expansion of the death penalty in 2009, even during a competitive primary for attorney general. 
Cuccinelli’s strong character was visible in his unwavering effort to exonerate Thomas Haynesworth, a black man who was wrongly convicted of rape and jailed for 27 years. Cuccinelli argued successfully to obtain a rare “writ of actual innocence,” which was possible because as a state senator, he had advocated for a law that would make such exoneration easier. 

Carney questions why, with Cuccinelli having libertarian bona fides, Ed Crane, former president of the Cato Institute, and other libertarians are supporting Sarvis and spending $300,000 on his campaign? 
He suspects, he says, that identity politics plays a role: 

I asked Sarvis why a libertarian should oppose Cuccinelli, and the first words out of his mouth were “social issues.” Crane’s only critique of Cuccinelli when announcing the $300,000 buy for Sarvis: “Ken Cuccinelli is a socially intolerant, hard-right conservative with little respect for civil liberties.” 
Cuccinelli is undoubtedly conservative. He’s an observant Catholic with seven children and a home-schooling wife. He’s a hero to the pro-life cause and an opponent of gay marriage. 
Libertarians, as a rule, support gay marriage, and most libertarians are pro-choice. But pro-life views fit within the libertarian framework: If you believe an in utero baby is a person, and if you believe the government has a legitimate role in protecting the innocent from violence, it’s logical to restrict abortion. 
And Cuccinelli, while unwavering in his moral opposition to abortion, is a moderate among Virginia Republicans when it comes to government restrictions on abortion: He worked behind the scenes trying to remove a GOP-created requirement that women undergo an ultrasound before getting an abortion. 

Carney gets to the crux of the matter, however, when he asserts, that “social liberals’ attack on Cuccinelli conflates his personal conservatism with his policy views.” 
The fact is that, while Cuccinelli might not personally agree with a law, he knows his job is to uphold the laws in his state. So, when he prosecuted a 47 year-old sexual predator who had sex with a minor, he defended his state’s “Crimes Against Nature” law but did not attempt to “ban sodomy” or homosexuality, as his critics say. He also has never attempted to “ban contraception,” as Planned Parenthood and its minions have charged. 
As Carney contends, Ken Cuccinelli may personally live a conservative lifestyle, but his record as both a state senator and attorney general is one that demonstrates that liberty is worth fighting for. Shouldn’t libertarians respect his choice to live as he does, while he also works to keep Virginians free?

Chief Global Affairs Correspondent for ABC News Martha Raddatz joined fellow 2012 presidential debate moderators Jim Lehrer and Bob Schieffer at Washington D.C.’s National Press Club. The trio discussed their experiences as debate moderators during the last presidential campaign to panel moderator Marvin Kalb.
When asked by Kalb if she felt rattled by Twitter criticism of her performance, she said:  



Twitter, as much as you might want to fight it, Marvin, it’s out there. There are voices out there that have influence. There are. I think for we as journalists, it’s a great journalistic tool. It is. You can find all sorts of stories. 
I had some strange press the day before that for about fifteen minutes rattled me. It did not affect me as a moderator. It affected me as a mom. My son’s on Twitter all the time. It’s the only way we can communicate. If he’s in the bedroom, it’s like, ‘Are you coming to dinner?’ And I tweet it. But I was worried, because there was such nasty stuff. And then my son was like, ‘Mom, do people..?’ I said, ‘You know there are some crazy people who write really mean things and don’t worry about them.’ She added that she she told him, ‘These people have three followers. Quit answering them. They all live in basements with 75 cats.’

Raddatz was asked later by Breitbart News during the Q & A, “You seemed to have gotten a lot of criticism during the vice presidential debate, allowing Joe Biden to just run all over you–the constant laughing, the interrupting of Paul Ryan, particularly when he was talking about an armed Iran or green energy. How can you say you had any control over that debate whatsoever?” 

She responded:

Listen, I want to answer you fairly. I really do. You’re up there and you’re as fair as you can possibly be. I think that when we came out of that debate, Joe Biden had 45 seconds more than Congressman Ryan. I think Congressman Ryan felt it was fair. And that’s what I can say. I think Congressman Ryan afterwards could not have been nicer. Both of them were. And both of them thought it was fair. 

However, Michael Steel, Paul Ryan’s Vice Presidential spokesman, told the Daily Caller after the debate that Raddatz did not moderate debate fairly at all. :

“I thought she obviously asserted herself more than [Jim] Lehrer did,” Steel said, referencing the moderator of the first presidential debate last week, according to Politico. “[B]ut there was still a great deal of crosstalk, there was still a great deal of difficulty making points in a reasonable and progressive fashion.”

Marvin Kalb began making a tweeting sound after Breitbart News asked her the question, referencing Raddatz’s previous remarks about criticisms she received on Twitter. However, Raddatz, did not just receive criticism for her debate moderator performance from people with 75 cats who live in basements and have three Twitter followers. 
A number of right-of-center journalists were critical of her as well. The Washington Examiner‘s David Freddoso wrote, “Ryan is outnumbered here. It’s two against one.” National Review’s Katrina Trinko remarked, “Raddatz is totally being walked all over by Biden. She’s letting him get by with murder in time of talking.” Phil Klein, who works for the Washington Examiner, said, “Every time Biden starts interrupting Ryan, Martha Raddatz cuts Ryan off.” Fox News Contributor and Radio’s Laura Ingraham asked, “Why does Raddatz want to ‘move on’ when Ryan is getting traction?”  
Finally, Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer said of Raddatz, “I pay good money to see a fight, not the referee.”

On Mar. 8, reporter Carl Cameron on Special Report on Fox News Channel was surveying potential GOP 2016 presidential candidates. Then he raised Ted Cruz–one of the most brilliant constitutional lawyers ever to serve in the Senate–the new 41-year old Hispanic senator from Texas.  
Cameron added, “But Cruz was born in Canada and is constitutionally ineligible” to run for president. While many people assume that, it’s probably not true.
Cameron was referring to the Constitution’s Article II requirement that only a “natural born citizen” can run for the White House.


No one is certain what that means. Citizenship was primarily defined by each state when the Constitution was adopted. Federal citizenship wasn’t clearly established until the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868. The Constitution is not clear whether it means you must be born on U.S. soil, or instead whether you must be born a U.S. citizen.

Cruz was born in Canada, but his mother was a lifelong American, born in Delaware. (His father was a political refugee from Cuba.) So under federal law, Cruz was born an American citizen by virtue of his mother. His family moved back to Texas, where Cruz grew up, and lived his entire life except the years he spent in New Jersey attending Princeton, Massachusetts attending Harvard Law School, and Washington, D.C., clerking for Chief Justice William Rehnquist at the Supreme Court and later serving in the Bush administration. So this former Texas solicitor general was born an American citizen and has spent almost all his life in America–usually serving his state or nation. 
It would be better to report, “Some constitutional experts say he would be ineligible,” or more accurate still, “A small minority of constitutional experts say he would be ineligible.” But no one can make the unqualified claim that the Constitution declares Ted Cruz is unable to run for president. 
There’s never been a court case to decide this issue, and there are only a few law review articles written by professors. The only professor I know of who thinks Cruz in ineligible to run for president also said John McCain was ineligible to run for president because he was born on a U.S. Navy base in Panama. I don’t recall any media outlet reporting John McCain was ineligible to be president.
The most likely meaning of the national-born clause is that you must have been an American citizen at birth, so that you would not have greater loyalty to some foreign nation. Cruz was born an American citizen, and has spent most of his life serving this nation with unabashed patriotism.
If Cruz runs for the White House, then one of his opponents in the primary would have standing to sue in federal court to argue Cruz is ineligible. But the smart money would be on a court agreeing that Cruz is as eligible as anyone else who was born an American citizen.

Even though Karl Rove’s American Crossroads brand has been damaged after the group declared war against conservative candidates, the group will reportedly try to influence the 2014 midterm elections by bullying campaigns and creating groups that, on the surface, do not seem to be affiliated with them.
According to the New York Times, Crossroads “appears to be testing” its “new approach” in Kentucky. The Conservative Victory Project, the group formed to take on conservative candidates, has stayed out of Kentucky’s Senate primary between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Tea Party challenger Matt Bevin. Instead, a group called “Kentuckians for Strong Leadership” is curiously backing McConnell while getting most of its cash from Crossroads donors. It is “legally separate from Crossroads;” but Stephen Law, the president of Crossroads, sits on its board, and the two groups share a treasurer. 
Crossroads may set up “similar groups in races in which its brand may be less appealing to voters or donors.” The Times notes that this is an approach Crossroads may have to take because Rove’s organization has been so tarnished among the conservative base that candidates fear donors will not contribute to any group associated with him.


In other races, Crossroads has been threatening Senate candidates, saying the group and its affiliates will not support them if they accept support from other super PACs. According to the Times, Law warned a Republican West Virginia Senate candidate (Rep. Shelly Moore Capito) that if her campaign formed its own super PAC, Crossroads would not offer it support. 

Other Republicans said they were “unwilling to let Mr. Rove and his colleagues decide which Senate candidates get the most support.” “You don’t want someone playing God above you saying, ‘You don’t need any more money in your race. You can win by a few less points,'” a Republican told the Times. 
Crossroads and its affiliated groups spent nearly $450 million during the 2012 election cycle with no wins to show for it. Law said the group had good financial controls in place so that its money is not wasted.

Palin also speaks about her signature issue of dismantling the permanent political class and fighting crony capitalism. She urges Republicans look for candidates from Main Street communities, PTA meetings, small businesses and Tea Party rallies. 
“SarahPAC supporters – the 2014 elections are just twenty months away. We appreciate your support, together we have elected many great commonsense conservatives over the past four years,” SarahPAC Treasurer Tim Crawford says in a statement posted with the video. “Together, we will keep fighting to support these bold candidates.”
Reporters in the video note only “Sarah Palin will hold Congress to account,” that Palin “plays by her own rules,” and Palin “doesn’t care about old dogs” in the GOP. These are the qualities that make Tea Partiers, conservatives, and independents trust Palin. 
The video notes that there are 35 Senate and 36 Governors races in 2014 and ends with a clip of Ted Cruz saying at CPAC, “I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if it were not for Gov. Sarah Palin.”
The words “We Haven’t Yet Begun to Fight” splash across the screen as SarahPAC’s signature bear roars at the end of the video.

10596	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/29/Harvard-Prof-Tea-Party-Not-Going-Anywhere-More-Likely-to-Win	Opinion	1	Elections	None	Negative	Positive	breitbart.com	"

A government and sociology professor at Harvard writes that the Tea Party is more likely than not to “win in the end” in an age when Americans are becoming more removed from Washington and distrusting the federal government and their elected officials. 
“Tea Party forces will still win in the end,” Theda Skocpol writes, unless moderate Republicans can defeat them. Skocpol concedes that the Tea Party “will triumph just by hanging on long enough” as Americans are getting fed up by “our blatantly manipulated democracy and our permanently hobbled government.”
The article, “Why The Tea Party Isn’t Going Anywhere,” was first published in the journal Democracy, and later reprinted in The Atlantic. 


Despite the fact that Democrats, the mainstream media, and the Republican establishment again were predicting the “demise of the Tea Party” immediately after the government shutdown ended, Skocpol doesn’t believe so.
“But we have heard all this before,” she writes. “The Tea Party’s hold on the GOP persists beyond each burial ceremony.”
Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson published a book in 2011 that “showed how bottom-up and top-down forces intersect to give the Tea Party both leverage over the Republican Party and the clout to push national politics sharply to the right.”

“At the grassroots, volunteer activists formed hundreds of local Tea Parties, meeting regularly to plot public protests against the Obama Administration and place steady pressure on GOP organizations and candidates at all levels,” they found. “At least half of all GOP voters sympathize with this Tea Party upsurge.”
Though Skokpol and Williamson have their typical biases and describe the Tea Party movement as a “radical” one that may not like minorities–without any evidence of that assertion–they acknowledge that “even though there is no one center of Tea Party authority–indeed, in some ways because there is no one organized center–the entire gaggle of grassroots” and outside groups that support the movement “wields money and primary votes to exert powerful pressure on Republican officeholders and candidates.”
Skocpol observes that the “Tea Party clout has grown in Washington and state capitals” because “Americans are also losing ever more faith in the federal government.” In addition, “most legislators and candidates are Nervous Nellies,” and they have seen the Tea Party defeat establishment Republicans like Charlie Crist in Florida in 2010 and David Dewhurst in Texas in 2012 in addition to knocking off incumbent Republican Sens. Bob Bennett (R-UT) and Richard Lugar (R-IN). 
“That grabs legislators’ attention and results in either enthusiastic support for, or acquiescence to, obstructive tactics,” Skocpol writes. 
She writes how powerfully someone like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) resonates with the Tea Party. She noted that he was able to direct House Republicans to pressure House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) to demand that President Barack Obama and Democrats fund the government except for Obamacare. 

Skocpol notes that it will not be easy to defeat the Tea Party. 
“For one, at least three successive national election defeats will be necessary to even begin to break the determination and leverage of Tea Party adherents,” Skocpol writes. She concedes that Tea Partiers will not “stand down easily or very soon.”
Skocpol notes “moderate Republicans” do not have as much power in Washington or in state capitals and points to Cruz as being “very well positioned to garner unified Tea Party support in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries.” The Chamber of Commerce will reportedly spend $50 million to wage war against the Tea Party, along with Karl Rove’s American Crossroads; Skocpol believes unless those groups defeat the Tea Party, it may well win many permanent victories.
“During the last election cycle, no far-right candidate ever consolidated sustained grassroots Tea Party support, as those voters hopped from Rick Perry to Herman Cain to Newt Gingrich to Rick Santorum,” Skocpol writes. “But this time, Cruz may very well enjoy unified and enthusiastic grassroots Tea Party support from the beginning of the primary election season.”
Skocpol also sends a warning to Democrats who think that the Tea Party will fade because of a few bad polls. 
“Once the October 2013 shutdown ended in supposed total victory for President Obama and his party, many Democrats adopted a cocky swagger and started talking about ousting the House GOP in 2014,” Skocpol writes. However, she warns that “a clear-eyed look shows that Tea Party remains powerful and has achieved victories that continue to stymie” Democrats and their statist agenda.

The former chief strategist for left-wing billionaire George Soros has joined Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg in an effort to push amnesty for America’s illegal immigrants, Bloomberg reports.
Stanley Druckenmiller, who Bloomberg reports served as Soros’s “chief strategist” for “more than 10 years” as a client money manager, has joined Zuckerberg’s efforts at FWD.us to push for comprehensive immigration reform. 
Druckenmiller served as the lead portfolio manager for Soros’ Quantum Fund from 1988 until 2000. According to Bloomberg, he “produced average annual returns of 30 percent at his hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management LLC” from 1986 through 2010.


In addition to hiring Druckenmiller, Zuckerberg funds former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour’s “Americans for a Conservative Direction.” According to the New York Times, that group has been one of the many special interests at the forefront of trying to push conservatives in the House of Representatives to support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The Times wrote recently that Barbour’s Zuckerberg-funded group “has been running ads in Iowa lately that implore those watching to ‘stand with Marco Rubio to end de facto amnesty.'”

The Mexican government once paid Barbour to lobby on behalf of amnesty for illegal immigrants inside the United States.
Other special interest groups are lobbying for the House to pass an amnesty program, as well. 
The American Action Network, a group led by former Minnesota Republican Sen. Norm Coleman, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on television and radio ads pushing the Senate’s immigration bill in the House. Coleman founded the American Action Network with Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign National Finance Committee co-chair Fred Malek. In addition to his various roles in politics, Malek is the founder and chairman of Thayer Lodging Group.
Karl Rove is similarly spending money pushing amnesty. “Certainly the way in which the bill is perceived and Rubio’s own political fortunes are closely entwined,” Steven Law, the president of Rove’s American Crossroads, said a few weeks ago. “Our first priority is to promote and advance immigration reform, and to talk about the ways this advances conservative goals. If we do that we will not only be helping to move legislation, but it will also protect those who stuck their necks out like Rubio.”
Before those special interests started their lobbying and advertising campaigns for amnesty in the House, most of House GOP leadership seemed to brush off the Senate’s bill. After weeks of pressure from these special interests, however, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will hold a hearing on his version of the “DREAM Act” on Tuesday, an amnesty provision for young illegal immigrants. 
Beyond Druckenmiller’s role, several Soros-backed groups are involved in the effort to pass amnesty. As Breitbart News has reported, the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) and the National Immigration Forum (NIF) are funded by the progressive billionaire.

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin announced that she will travel to Washington, D.C. on Sunday to support and honor the veterans who will be arriving for the “Million Vet March” on the memorials.
Speaking at a rally for New Jersey Republican Senate candidate Steve Lonegan along with Mark Levin on Saturday, Palin denounced the Obama administration for dishonoring veterans by barricading the World War II Memorial during the federal government shutdown. She said it was “heart-wrenching,” “atrocious,” and “not right.”  


“We’re going to zip on in to D.C.,” Palin said of herself and her husband Todd. “We’re going to shake hands with those vets who are being dishonored.”

Palin then accused the Obama administration of “using our military as pawns” during the government shutdown with such actions. 
She also mentioned that the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), whose seat Lonegan and Democrat Cory Booker are running for, was the last World War II veteran to serve in Congress and noted that his memory was also being dishonored by the Obama administration’s actions. 
Palin said the memorials serve to remind Americans of “the cost to provide for this exceptional nation” and the price Americans have had to pay to fight “against tyranny” and “for liberty.” 
Palin noted that the memorials, though they received some federal assistance, were also built with private donations. 
“And our government thinks they can shut down our memorials that honor our vets?” Palin said. “For shame.”
Palin has previously urged Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience at the “Barrycades.” At the “Million Vet March”, veterans will demand that the Obama administration re-open the memorials and urge Congress to pass legislation to forbid the memorials from being closed in future government shutdowns.

10640	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/12/rubio-ryan-values-voters-straw-poll	News	1	Elections	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the GOP’s most recent vice presidential candidate, finished with a combined total of less than 10 percent of the vote in the Family Research Council (FRC) Values Voter Summit straw poll.
Rubio finished in fifth place with 5 percent of the vote, while Ryan finished in sixth place with 4 percent of the vote. The three biggest issues for the 762 straw poll voters were religious liberty, life, and Obamacare.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) finished overwhelmingly in first place, taking in 42 percent of the straw poll’s vote. Dr. Ben Carson, an ardent opponent of Obamacare, and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, a social conservative, finished tied for second place with 13 percent of the vote each.


Rubio has taken a beating among the GOP’s rank-and-file voters for his stance on immigration reform and continues to be unable to return to the top tier of conservative leaders. Ryan, who also supports comprehensive immigration reform, has recently become the face of the GOP establishment’s willingness to surrender to President Barack Obama on Obamacare and the ongoing fiscal fights over both the budget and the debt ceiling.
A high-ranking conservative Capitol Hill staffer told Breitbart News that Ryan’s fiscal stances seem to be out-of-step with the values of conservatives. “I don’t think he did himself any good by his latest proposal, mostly proved himself to be out of touch with the current trend,” the staffer said in an email. “We are hoping the majority of the majority will enjoy being on the right side.”
When FRC Action president Tony Perkins was asked by Breitbart News what he thought of Ryan’s performance in the straw poll, Perkins said, “He wasn’t here personally. Clearly, I think it helps if you’re here and able to speak. Now, he did speak via video, but I just think the competition is steep. We had really, really great speeches by some really great leaders. It’s hard to compete with that by video message so that’s what I would attribute it to.”

Ryan had previously stated he would join the summit but ended up sending in a video speech in order to attend negotiations with the White House instead.
Perkins also said he thinks the ongoing fiscal negotiations that Ryan is leading on behalf of House Republicans “factors in quite significantly.”
“As I was just talking with Ted Cruz to call him to give him the results of the polling, and I do that every year, I will call the individual and give them a heads-up on who wins the straw poll, and so I called and talked to Ted,” Perkins said. “He was very encouraged by the response he received here and very surprised and excited to hear the results that he won the straw poll. It simply served to encourage him and bolster him in the stand that he is taking, that he is representing and defending the families of this country that will be negatively impacted by Obamacare and keeping his word to voters that he would come here to repeal Obamacare.”
“So I think it says that those base voters are not only not punching those who are doing what they said they were going to do, but rewarding them for doing so,” Perkins said.
Perkins added he does not think immigration “divides the social conservative voters as much as some would like it to.”

“There certainly are differences in opinion of how we address it and how we approach it, but I do not think that in my numerous conversations regarding this issue that it divides social conservatives as much as some think,” Perkins said. “I think this [straw poll] is more a reflection of who has been out front on one of the most pressing issues; as I mentioned, Obamacare finished at the top three of our issues. Religious liberty was at the very top, which Obamacare is a direct assault on.” 
“Who’s been leading the charge on that? And that answer would be Ted Cruz,” he stated.
Cruz also helped lead the charge, along with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), in the U.S. Senate against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill and remains opposed to any pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in America.
Perkins added that this straw poll shows the GOP establishment must begin representing populist ideas of what the conservative base wants. “That [the establishment] is the same mindset that brought us the results in 2008 and 2012,” Perkins said. “These issues that the vast majority of the Republican voting base care about were ignored.” 
“The numbers, and I’ve seen the analysis of the 2012 election specifically, the post-election analysis, and the Republicans said this is where they’re going and they wanted to reach the middle and they did, but they stepped over the base,” he explained. “What you’re seeing here consistently is the president is mobilizing and exciting his base on many of these issues and in many of these elections the Republicans have not. They’ve not been able to do that.”

The National Immigration Forum (NIF), the force behind the so-called “Evangelical Immigration Table” (EIT), is actually a front group for players on the institutional left including billionaire George Soros and the Ford Foundation, according to reporting by Breitbart News and other outlets.
According to the Huffington Post, EIT is running a $250,000 advertising campaign in favor of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Even so, EIT admitted to Breitbart News it does not legally exist as an incorporated political entity or non-profit organization but said NIF is the group that “facilitates” its activities. 


NIF is a power player in immigration politics, and includes among its leadership some of the most powerful Washington figures on the issue.
In 2009, OSI donated $257,152 to NIF aimed at “implementing immigration reform campaign through communications, policy, and field organizing.”
Also in 2009, OSI donated another $1.5 million to “allow” NIF to “manage and lead Four Pillars Campaign for comprehensive immigration reform, and sustain core policy work supporting and leading policy efforts.”

A year later, in 2010, Soros’s OSI gave NIF another $1.5 million over two separate grants both intended for “general operating support.”
NIF has also received $1 million total from the leftist Ford Foundation, spread over two separate half-million-dollar grants in 2009 and 2011. Those grants were both intended for advocacy in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.
Jim Wallis, the president and CEO of Sojourners, a leading force in the Evangelical Immigration Table group, has admitted to accepting funding from Soros as well. 
World magazine writer Marvin Olasky laid out in a 2010 article how Wallis and his organization, Sojourners, had received $325,000 from Soros groups over three grants from 2004, 2006 and 2007. According to OSI’s 2007 990 form filed with the IRS, available publicly through the Foundation Center, the 2007 money–a total of $100,000–was for Wallis’s Sojourners “to support the Christians for Comprehensive Immigration Reform Campaign.”
Wallis originally denied being funded by Soros when he was first confronted with the accusation, and accused Olasky of lying. “It’s not hyperbole or overstatement to say that Glenn Beck lies for a living. I’m sad to see Marvin Olasky doing the same thing,” Wallis said in 2010 interview with Patheos. “No, we don’t receive money from Soros. Given the financial crisis of nonprofits, maybe Marvin should call Soros and ask him to send us money.”

“So, no, we don’t receive money from George Soros,” Wallis added. “Our books are totally open, always have been. Our money comes from Christians who support us and who read Sojourners. That’s where it comes from. In fact, we’ve had funding blocked, this year and last, by liberal foundations who didn’t like our stance on abortion. Other liberal groups were happy to point out to them that our stance wasn’t kosher on abortion, so our funding was blocked.”
After Olasky and the National Review‘s Jay Richards confronted this claim by Wallis, Wallis admitted he made an incorrect statement to Patheos and that he was accepting Soros money. “I should have declined to comment until I was able to review the blog post in question and consulted with our staff on the details of our funding over the past several years,” Wallis said in a statement. 
“Instead, I answered in the spirit of the accusation and did not recall the details of our funding over the decade in question. The spirit of the accusation was that Sojourners is beholden to funders on the political left, which is false. The allegation concerned three grants received over 10 years from the Open Society Institute that made up the tiniest fraction of Sojourners’ funding during that decade–so small that I hadn’t remembered them.”
While that original Soros funding may have been almost a decade old when it was uncovered, Wallis has subsequently accepted more money from the leftist billionaire. In a 2011 story, Olasky noted that Wallis had confirmed to him he accepted another $150,000 from Soros for a grant that would take hold in 2012.
Interestingly enough, even though evangelicals are receiving funding from Soros and his groups, his official website notes that he “identifies himself as an atheist.”
Soros is also well known for his pro-amnesty, open borders positions on immigration.

10675	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/24/Club-for-Growth-Interview	News	1	Elections	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, told Breitbart News this weekend that establishment Republicans who have no qualms about growing the size of government and benefit from it find the fiscally conservative group to be a nuisance because the Club aggressively identifies conservatives and backs them in Republican primaries. 
And when candidates the Club for Growth supports come to Washington, they often do not just “go along to get along,” especially when it comes to matters regarding taxes and spending. 


Case in point: Ted Cruz. 
In 2012, establishment Republicans like Karl Rove and American Crossroads preferred Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst over Ted Cruz in the Texas Republican Senate primary, with their donors backing Dewhurst against Cruz. It was the Club for Growth that helped Cruz counter the Rove-approved establishment money that was going to Dewhurst’s campaign in addition to Dewhurst’s considerable wealth, which he used to self-fund his failed Senate run. The Club for Growth spent $5.5 million in independent expenditure ads to support Cruz in his fight against Dewhurst. The group accounted for 83% of all pro-Cruz outside spending.
While Sarah Palin’s endorsement of Cruz ultimately got the attention of and galvanized Tea Partiers and conservatives to ensure Cruz got into the runoff against Dewhurst, the Club for Growth’s money ensured Cruz could stay on the air against Dewhurst in Texas’s huge and expensive media markets.

Rove, in stark contrast, said on Fox News’ “Hannity” after Cruz won the primary that Texas had “three good candidates” in that race, meaning Rove, unlike the Club for Growth, would have been perfectly content with the more moderate candidates like Dewhurst who would not fight in Washington, D.C. 
Last year, the group emphasized that it committed “to do everything within our power to ensure Cruz won the primary” and “went all in and it did so because it is absolutely critical to the future of our nation that we have a true fiscal conservative representing the state of Texas in the United States Senate.” 
And that’s exactly what Cruz has done since arriving in Washington, D.C., voting against John Kerry to be the next Secretary of State and fiercely questioning President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel to the point where liberals have resorted to calling him a “McCarthyite.”
Chocola noted the Republican establishment often views the types of candidates the Club for Growth supports as “threats to the big-government status quo” that Republicans often help enable. 
Chocola added that in part because of the group’s efforts, those in Congress are talking about “spending less money, not simply slowing the rate of growth of spending.”

The full interview with Chocola is below.
Breitbart News: Given the success of Club for Growth in supporting free market principles, policies and candidates, what do you make of the attacks–often behind closed doors–by establishment figures like Karl Rove and Haley Barbour regarding your involvement in Republican primaries?
Chris Chocola: We’re not surprised at all. The Republican establishment has always viewed the types of candidates supported by our PAC as threats to the big-government status quo that the GOP often helps enable. We’ll continue to support candidates like Ted Cruz, Pat Toomey and Marco Rubio. They’ll continue to support candidates like David Dewhurst, Arlen Specter, and Charlie Crist. It’s that simple.
Breitbart News: What are Club for Growth’s key objectives for 2013?
Chris Chocola: We want to continue to grow the pro-growth caucus by supporting strong, fiscally conservative candidates through our PAC. We are hoping that the candidates the PAC has helped elect are helping to drive the agenda within the Republican Party. We’ll be watching closely to see if Republicans stand strong on sequestration and the continuing resolution. We’ll be urging them to cut spending and put us on a path to a balanced budget within 10 years. The whole purpose of the Club for Growth is to encourage policies that lead to a high-growth economy, and we’re very concerned that our growing debt burden and uncertainty about our economic future is holding us back. All we’ve ever wanted from Congress is responsible behavior, and we think that message is beginning to percolate throughout capitol hill. For the first time in a long time, members of Congress are talking about spending less money, not simply slowing the rate of growth of spending. That’s a sea-change, and we’re looking to build on that momentum.
Breitbart News: When you look at specific policy proposals–such as those dealing with the debt ceiling, the deficit, the fiscal cliff, and federal spending in general–do you think the Club is winning the war of war of ideas among the Republicans on Capitol Hill.
Chris Chocola: We take pride in our ability to advocate for free markets and limited government, but it’s really the new members we’ve helped elect through our PAC that are driving policy. It’s because of members of Congress like Jeff Flake and Pat Toomey that earmarks are banned. It’s because of members like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Mike Lee that the culture of the Senate is beginning to change. We supported those members and others because of what they believe, and they will stand and fight for their principles. Our goal is to get a majority of the majority. We’re not there yet, but the changes that have happened within the Republican Party on policy over the past decade because of the Club for Growth  and its members is undeniably positive.

When the House votes on Tuesday evening (or potentially right after midnight early Wednesday morning), House Republicans will likely be divided into two camps: Team Boehner and Team Cantor.
Those who vote for the bill will be on Team Boehner and those who oppose it will be on Team Cantor. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is backing the bill, and conservative groups like FreedomWorks are opposing it.


House Speaker John Boehner is, according to some media accounts and several Republican members, prepared to vote in favor of the the Senate “fiscal cliff” deal that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Vice President Joe Biden cut late on New Year’s Eve, which passed by an 89-8 margin. Boehner aides haven’t answered requests for confirmation of these rumors and reports. The National Review‘s Robert Costa reports that Boehner won’t personally vote unless his vote is needed to pass the plan through the House.
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will be taking a different path. He’ll be voting against the bill, and according to some offices, he’s been the organizing power behind House GOP opposition to the deal.
That means the number one and number two House Republicans will be heading in completely different directions when the “fiscal cliff” vote happens. 

Some conservatives, like Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, who plan to vote against the bill expect it to pass anyway. And that may end up happening. But the internal House GOP fight is far from over with this vote.
Boehner suffered politically after his failure to pass his fiscal cliff “Plan B” before Christmas, and now that he’ll likely need Democratic votes to push this plan through he’s even weaker. 
That means Cantor, who’s wanted the speakership for a long time, could strike now and challenge Boehner in the election for House officeholders on Thursday–or he’ll likely have to wait at least another two years.
Cantor’s spokespersons Doug Heye and Rory Cooper both publicly tweeted denials. “Majority Leader Cantor stands with @SpeakerBoehner,” Heye wrote. “Speculation otherwise is silly, non-productive and untrue.”
“Folks out there w/ crazy theories about what’s going on in House,” Cooper wrote. “All ridiculous. Just figuring out best path forward. Stay calm, carry on.”
Cooper’s and Heye’s comments don’t negate the fact that Boehner and Cantor are deliberately taking drastically different stances heading into this vote. 
Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer even thinks Cantor may be going to make a move at Boehner. “It’s possible (Eric Cantor’s opposition to fiscal cliff bill) is the prelude to a challenge Thursday,” Krauthammer said on Fox News Channel’s Special Report on Tuesday evening. 
“It would be naked to do it at this late hour as a result of the split over this vote. Look, there are a lot of conservatives in the Republican caucus in the House who hate the bill and for good reason. This is a complete surrender on everything. The ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts is 40 to 1, rather than 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 or 1 to 3. So, I mean it’s a complete rout by the Democrats.”

Pro-amnesty organizations are campaigning heavily for Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and a close ally of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Virginia’s gubernatorial election on Tuesday.
“Latino groups are intensifying get-out-the-vote efforts in the Virginia governor’s race against a national backdrop of a congressional struggle over immigration reform,” NBC News Latino reports. “The groups said Thursday immigration reform is a critical issue on which candidates will be measured by Latino voters in the race.
As the groups work to have a strong showing of Latino turnout in Tuesday’s race, pressure has intensified on House Republicans to move immigration reform legislation in the waning days of this congressional year. That has helped keep the issue in the forefront as the Virginia candidates head to Election Day and groups try to turn out Latino voters in the state, home to the 16th largest population of Hispanic-eligible voters.”


NBC Latino quotes the National Council of La Raza Action Fund’s executive director Matthew McClellan who said his group and others are organizing 75,000 phone calls on behalf of McAuliffe and conducting door-to-door get-out-the-vote efforts, running ads in Spanish-language media and sending direct mail to more than 27,000 homes. “The Latino community is tired of talk and demanding action,” McClellan said. “Saying the right thing is not enough and we will be looking for action after is over.”

Labor Council for Latin American Advancement executive director Hector Sanchez called on Hispanics who want comprehensive immigration reform to show up at the polls for McAuliffe. “It’s very important for everyone to turn out to the polls, to analyze where those candidates are and make sure those candidates are representing Latinos on issues that are critical for the community,” Sanchez said.
They are specifically pushing DREAM Act proposals, ones that would grant amnesty to young illegal immigrants who crossed the border or entered or stayed in the country illegally before they became adults. Ken Cuccinelli, the GOP candidate running against McAuliffe, opposes amnesty and DREAM Act proposals.
No matter the result, these leftwing groups and others are likely to try to extrapolate the election results in Virginia to fit their national agenda, as both House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) and House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) are from the Commonwealth. Cantor and Goodlatte are key players in the immigration debate, and both thus far remain publicly open to attempts from House GOP leadership to go to a conference committee to negotiate with the Senate and its “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Cantor and Goodlatte remain open to such efforts despite the fact that the Senate bill’s key GOP sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), has publicly come out against such efforts

On Monday, RNC Chair Reince Priebus sent stinging letters to NBC and CNN concerning their recently announced decisions to produce films celebrating the life of Hillary Clinton. The RNC sees the odd programing move as an in-kind contribution to Clinton’s presumed campaign for President in 2016. As a result, the party will formally bar Republicans from partnering with the networks on any primary or Presidential debates in 2016. 
Priebus wrote to CNN:

I find CNN’s actions disturbing and disappointing. Your credibility as a supposedly unbiased news network will most certainly be jeopardized by the decision to show political favoritism and produce an extended commercial for Secretary Clinton’s nascent campaign.

And to NBC:



I find this disturbing and disappointing. NBC cannot purport to be a neutral party in American politics, and the credibility of NBC News, already damaged by the partisanship of MSNBC, will be further undermined by the actions of NBC Universal executives who have taken it upon themselves to produce an extended commercial for Secretary Clinton’s nascent campaign.

The decision by NBC and CNN to produce a mini-series or film about the life of Hillary Clinton is indeed odd. They do not regularly produce films about major figures in American politics. Perhaps I missed it, but I don’t recall a network bio of former Secretary of State Condolezza Rice. I also haven’t seen films about NY Senator Kristin Gillibrand or First Ladies Laura Bush and Michelle Obama.

The RNC Summer meeting is August 14th. Unless the networks scuttle their plans to produce their Hillary Clinton films, Priebus will seek a binding vote by the full RNC to bar the party from partnering with, or sanctioning, any primary or Presidential debate with the two networks.
The 2016 campaign for President has begun.

In the wake of last week’s much-discussed New York Times investigative report detailing cronyism and mismanagement inside the Clinton Foundation, former president Bill Clinton issued an open letter in an attempt to stem the public relations backlash. Clinton’s letter challenged a couple of the Times’ assertions that his nonprofit had run deficits.
Curiously, Clinton’s letter left unchallenged the Times’ more troubling reporting–based on over two dozen interviews with Clinton Foundation insiders–that the nonprofit is rife with cronyism and conflicts of interest that leverage access and power to benefit for-profit ventures like Teneo, a consultancy co-founded by Bill Clinton’s “surrogate son” and former Clinton Foundation aide Douglas Band. Teneo, whose earliest clients included the now-defunct MF Global headed up by Obama bundler Jon Corzine, has also hired Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin, wife of mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner.
That placed Media Matters in the awkward position of defending Hillary and Bill Clinton from the liberalNew York Times. Media Matters blogger Emily Arrowood filed a blog post chastising the New York Timesfor its “misleading Times story, which apparently failed to perform due diligence in reporting on the accounting requirements for foundations.”
Oddly, Arrowood went on to scold conservative media outlets for having the temerity to cite the New York Times reportage.
“Predictably, conservative media did not wait to learn these facts surrounding the Clinton Foundation, preferring to cite the initial Times story to decry imaginary scandals and lob both new and old attacks at Hillary Clinton,” wrote Arrowood. She blasted Fox News host Eric Bolling, The Blaze, The London Telegraph (sic), former New York Times Magazine editor-in-chief Ed Klein, and The Atlantic as being part of a “right-wing noise machine” that was “scrambling to find a new Hillary scandal.”
Like Bill Clinton’s letter, however, Arrowood’s blog post sidestepped the Times’ more serious charges of cronyism and conflicts of interest and ducked altogether the Breitbart News report last week featured on Drudge Report that chronicled additional Clinton Foundation conflicts of interest not included in theTimes’ original report. As Breitbart News reported, by 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised at least $46 million from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Brunei, Oman, and other foreign governments with whom Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would later negotiate. In her role as a New York Senator, Hillary Clinton also reportedly helped New York developer Robert Congel win millions of dollars in federal assistance after Congel donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
Then there is the case of Teneo. According to the Times, the Clintons, Band, Teneo, and the Foundation were entangled in a web of crony alliances and conflicts of interest:

Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country’s top hedge funds.
By 2011, the firm had added a third partner, Declan Kelly, a former State Department envoy for Mrs. Clinton. And Mr. Clinton had signed up as a paid adviser to the firm.
Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients. The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors, while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encouraged others to become new foundation donors. Its marketing materials highlighted Mr. Band’s relationship with Mr. Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative, where Mr. Band sat on the board of directors through 2011 and remains an adviser. Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.

The crony connections between Teneo, Douglas Band, and the Clintons had grown so alarming, reports theTimes, that Chelsea Clinton “became increasingly concerned with the negative impact Mr. Band’s outside business might have on her father’s work and that she cited concerns raised during the internal review about potential conflicts of interest involving Teneo.”
The Media Matters piece made no mention of Teneo, Douglas Band, Robert Congel, or Chelsea Clinton’s concerns over crony capitalist conflicts of interest.
Instead, following Bill Clinton’s lead, Media Matters dodged the New York Times‘ most serious revelations and quibbled over “context”–a risky tactic that may encourage the Times to dig deeper.
Indeed, just one day after Bill Clinton and Media Matters’s retort, liberal New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd followed up the Times’ Clinton Foundation cronyism report with this: “If Americans are worried about money in politics, there is no larger concern than the Clintons…Clintonworld is a galaxy where personal enrichment and political advancement blend seamlessly, and where a cast of jarringly familiar characters pad their pockets every which way to Sunday.”
Dowd added, “The most egregious nest of conflicts was a firm founded by Doug Band called Teneo, a scammy blend of corporate consulting, public relations and merchant banking. Band, a surrogate son to Bill, put Huma, a surrogate daughter to Hillary, on the payroll.  Even Big Daddy Bill was a paid adviser.”
No word yet from Media Matters on Maureen Dowd’s newly minted allegiance with the “right-wing noise machine.”

A new poll of Republican voters in Tennessee shows Sen. Lamar Alexander trailing a generic “conservative” challenger by 5 points. The poll, obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, shows a “credible conservative candidate” leading Alexander 49.5-44.9%. While a serious opponent hasn’t yet emerged to challenge Alexander, the poll shows how vulnerable he is in next year’s August primary.
The poll, from Triton Polling, interviewed over 680 Republican voters in the Volunteer State last week. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.7%. 
Around 64% of Republican voters, at least somewhat, approve of the job Alexander is doing, an unsurprising result for a Republican incumbent. Only 27% view Alexander as “conservative,” however. 65% of Republican voters view him as “moderate” or “liberal.” These are the views of Republican voters, 51% of whom identify themselves as “very conservative.” In total, over 85% of Republican voters consider themselves at least somewhat conservative. 


Any incumbent polling in the 40s is in a weak position. Alexander’s position is particularly vulnerable, however, because the base voters view his ideological orientation as distinct from their own. Just over 30% of Republican voters say they will “definitely” vote to renominate Alexander next year. 

After the head-to-head match-up question, which, again Alexander lost, the poll then has several “push” questions, testing possible messages against Alexander. Ranging from “voting with Obama 62% of the time” to “supporting amnesty” for 11 million illegals, each finds around 70% of Republican voters “less likely” to support Alexander. 
Of course, Alexander can’t lose the primary if he doesn’t have a challenger. BEAT LAMAR, a grass roots effort opposed to Alexander’s reelection is holding a candidate forum on August 31st, to begin the vetting process of selecting a conservative opponent for the primary. 
“Everybody has agreed that we need to get behind a single candidate and put our efforts behind someone who can challenge Lamar, debate his public record and basically just push back against the Republican establishment that is trying to bully and intimidate anyone who wants to run against him,” Nashville Tea Party President Ben Cunningham told The Tennessean.  
This latest poll may tempt more seasoned candidates into the race. Ralph Bristol, a popular talk radio host in Tennessee, told Breitbart News, “If a strong, articulate, conservative who has been vetted and tested in lower office were to mount a challenge, and attracted Tea Party support, I’m convinced Lamar is at least as vulnerable as Lindsey Graham or Mitch McConnell, probably more so.”

When the subject of Hollywood and President Barack Obama comes up, most people think of the celebrities who cut videos supporting the leader’s two runs for the White House.
Others might name check movie producer Harvey Weinstein, one of Obama’s most vocal backers.


They all pale in comparison to studio mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks fame, who Mother Jones dubs the Kingmaker of the Democrat party. That hardly describes Katzenberg’s impact on two presidential elections, particularly the 2012 contest.


Katzenberg gave $3.15 million to Democratic super-PACs during the 2012 cycle–almost 30 times more than his total reported giving in 2008. (There’s no telling how much he might have given to other groups that don’t disclose their donors.) He steered millions more to Priorities–his friend and business partner, Steven Spielberg, gave $1 million, for instance. He hosted numerous fundraisers for Obama and raised more for the president than anyone else in California. All told, Katzenberg gave or raised more than $30 million to reelect Obama, helping Hollywood make up for Wall Street’s plummeting financial support of the president.

Of course, all that money means Katzenberg can get a few favors done when the need arises. And when his movie studio wanted to branch out into China, all those donations came in handy.

Obama officials say they respect Katzenberg not only for his fundraising, but also because he has no specific “ask”–no ambassadorship to Switzerland, no regulatory tweak, no nights in the Lincoln Bedroom. Even so, being Hollywood’s liaison to Washington has its perks: Obama takes Katzenberg’s calls, and he and his political adviser, Andy Spahn, visited the White House almost 50 times between them during Obama’s first term. (Not all of Spahn’s visits had to do with Katzenberg.) It has also left him well positioned to advocate for his industry’s and his company’s interests in China’s booming film market.

Hollywood stars like Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis deplore the impact of unfettered cash on the political process. They even made a movie about it–The Campaign.
Will they consider a sequel targeting King Katzenberg? Don’t count on it. Money is only evil when it props up the wrong (read: right) politicians.

Rasmussen Reports released a poll on Tuesday that shows Democrat Terry McAuliffe leads Republican Ken Cuccinelli by 17 points, 50% to 33%, in the race to become Virginia’s next governor. Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis is in third place with 8%. The poll of 1,000 likely Virginia voters was conducted on October 20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.
Though McAuliffe’s lead in Tuesday’s poll was significantly higher than in previous polls, it was just the latest information that confirmed the bad news Virginia Republicans have known for several months. It is clear that the Cuccinelli campaign is headed towards a disastrous outcome in November unless dramatic changes are undertaken. But, with only two weeks remaining until election day, it may be a case of too little, too late.
Conservatives and Tea Party activists have been sounding the warning bells with the consultants running the Cuccinelli campaign for months.  Given the extraordinary vulnerabilities of the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, mired as he is in dual investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Homeland Security of GreenTech Automotive, many Virginians are wondering how a candidate so beloved by the conservative base has run such a weak campaign.


McAuliffe’s campaign has succeeded in framing the election around social issues by outspending Cuccinelli at least two to one in television advertising. The pace of that outspending appears to have accelerated recently. Several Virginia residents told Breitbart News on Tuesday that Cuccinelli has been hammered mercilessly over the past several weeks with an onslaught of highly negative attack ads, while his own mild responses have been seen but not remembered.
McAuliffe has also benefited from significant spending on his behalf by outside liberal interest groups, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent endorsement.
Tea Party activists in Virginia are not surprised that the Cuccinelli campaign has performed so poorly. The problem, they believe, began when Cuccinelli hired a campaign team staffed heavily by Washington insider Republican consultants. 

That error by itself could have been overcome, but the Cuccinelli team then proceeded to give Tea Party activists and groups around the Commonwealth the cold shoulder. Eager to help Cuccinelli win by providing the power and energy of a vigorous ground game, Tea Party activists were given no opportunity to be involved in the campaign.
This fundamental strategic error drew all of the energy out of the Cuccinelli campaign, and was compounded on August 15 by Cuccinelli’s own ill-advised criticism of the grassroots for their lack of interest in volunteering for his campaign. Activists throughout the Commonwealth saw Cuccinelli’s comments as a public slap in the face, and many have subsequently washed their hands of both the candidate and the campaign team.
Rather than working with the grassroots on the development of a ground game and get-out-the-vote infrastructure, the Cuccinelli campaign has relied on television ads and press releases. Some of these press releases have been considered sophomoric by Tea Party activists. 

An “RRR” spoof poll released by the Cuccinelli campaign in late August is the most visible example of the campaign’s communications missteps. In an effort to counter the polls released by the PPP company, a well known left leaning polling firm, all of which show McAuliffe with a strong lead and Cuccinelli with high negatives, the Cuccinelli campaign has issued a series of press releases about phony polls conducted by the fake “RRR” (Republican Republican Republican) polling firm that purportedly show Cuccinelli with a significant lead.
Tea Party activists in Virginia are reluctant to publicly criticize the Cuccinelli campaign because of their loyalty and affection for Cuccinelli personally. However, they have been eager to offer suggestions to Attorney General Cuccinelli on how he can turn his campaign around. Unfortunately, few, if any of them have been able to even obtain a hearing from the Cuccinelli campaign team to communicate these views.
Larry Nordvig, Executive Director of the Richmond Tea Party, told Breitbart News last month that “conservatives are highly concerned about Obamacare, immigration, and moral decline, and are looking for reassurance and leadership in those areas. Attorney General Cuccinelli has not taken a hard stand on those issues. The net effect is that he’s not exciting his base, which dampens campaign volunteer activism. “

But for Nordvig when he spoke with Breitbart in September, “re-engaging his base” was “even more critical for Attorney General Cuccinelli.”

“Cuccinelli is not going to win the money race,” Nordvig said.  “That means he will stand, or fall, based on grassroots support. He has got to start reassuring conservatives that he will fight for their deepest-held beliefs. Oh, and it wouldn’t hurt to court the Tea Party a little more,” Nordvig added. “We’re the major component of the grassroots support he needs to win.”
Unfortunately for Cuccinelli, it is virtually impossible to mount an effective ground game on just two weeks notice. Such an effort requires months to develop an infrastructure of volunteers and systems. 
“I hate to say this,” one Virginia source told Breitbart News on Tuesday, “but unless grassroots lightning strikes in the next two weeks, get used to saying ‘Governor McAuliffe’ . . . and ‘President Clinton.’ “

Sen. John McCain spent the weekend negotiating with Majority Leader Harry Reid on a deal to avert Reid’s threatened use of the “nuclear option” to change Senate rules to eliminate filibusters on Presidential nominations. Through his efforts, McCain was able to secure a complete GOP capitulation on 7 pending nominations. Reid secured all the benefits of exercising the “nuclear option” without the political cost of actually using it.  
Under the McCain deal, the GOP will provide enough votes to secure the 60 votes needed for cloture and proceed to final consideration of the 7 nominees. In exchange, Reid agreed to replace two current union attorney nominees with two alternative union attorney nominees. McCain’s swift surrender ensures that the “nuclear option” is a permanent fixture of the nomination process.
GOP objections to many of the pending nominations were not minor. The first nomination to be approved under the McCain deal was Richard Cordray to be the first Director of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was enacted under the Dodd-Frank legislation and holds sweeping powers over all aspects of the financial and credit sector. 


When Cordray was first nominated two years ago, McCain and all but 2 GOP Senators signed a letter vowing to block any nomination unless reforms were made to the agency. A major concern was that Congress was specifically prohibited from exercising any oversight over the Agency’s budget. The promise to block that nomination wasn’t prompted by concerns about a specific nominee, but a fundamental political principle. McCain’s deal is further confirmation that principle are cheap in Washington. 

Theoretically, McCain’s surrender preserves the right of Republicans to filibuster future nominations. Practically speaking, however, that right has been permanently ceded. If the GOP is willing to fold when it has serious objections to pending nominations, it will easily surrender again in the future the next time Reid threatens the “nuclear option.” If the GOP isn’t willing to draw a line over flawed nominees like Cordray or Thomas Perez, it never will be. 
Reid believed that he could eliminate the filibuster for nominations with a simply majority vote. Democrat Sen. Carl Levin on Tuesday said he believed the change required 67 votes and stated he would vote against Reid’s rule change. It would have been better for the GOP to force Reid to vote on the change. Senators would have had to go on record whether they supported Reid or Levin’s interpretation of the rules. With a number of vulnerable Democrats up for reelection next year, a vote could have carried political consequences. 
McCain, however, helped the Democrats avoid a risky political vote. He also ensured that he is on Harry Reid’s speed-dial the next time the GOP raises objections to an Obama nomination.

Beyond the media fawning over the spectacle of President Barack Obama and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sitting down for an interview together on 60 Minutes–old rivals, reunited!–there is a message that the president wants to send. Not just the fact that Vice President Joe Biden will not be his first pick for 2016, but also the signal that Republicans ought to forget about a revival in four years: liberalism is here to stay.
Republicans seem to have concluded that their overall revival depends on finding the right candidate to win. If so, they may be in for a long wait. Clinton is so popular right now–with Republicans as well as Democrats–that she is easily the favorite to win in 2016. Freshman Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) welcomed her during last week’s Benghazi hearings by telling her he had wished her to win the 2008 Democratic primary; even Paul Ryan suggested on Meet the Press that a President Clinton might have solved the debt crisis by now.


Clinton’s popularity is partly due to the fact that she is so different to Obama. She is not as hostile to opposition, and gives more direct-sounding answers to tough questions, even when she is being just as evasive. She once gave the impression of being more centrist, as well, famously voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War–a vote that her rival punished her for on the campaign trail in 2008, claiming he would have voted differently.

In truth, there is not much daylight between the Alinskyite pair. Clinton not only carried out the Obama administration’s awful foreign policy–she did so with enthusiasm. She lectured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 45 minutes over construction in Jewish parts of Jerusalem, for example, and launched an abortive “reset” in relations with Russia (a gesture that failed even in its theatrics; the button read “overcharge”).
Obama and Clinton are also closely bound together in the Benghazi failure, a scandal whose details are still being kept from the public, even though it is broadly clear that the White House chose not to intervene to save U.S. personnel, and at the same time engineered a cover-up in which both Obama and Clinton agreed to a fraudulent alibi that blamed the deadly attack on an anti-Islam video on YouTube that few had seen.
Yet the two have avoided accountability, since the media failed to pursue the Benghazi scandal before the election (or actively suppressed it), and now that the election is long gone, most have adopted the “what difference does it make?” attitude displayed by Clinton on Capitol Hill last week. She ought to be haunted by those words, and those four dead Americans, for the rest of her career; chances are, however, that she will not.
Obama’s joint interview was likely planned as a gesture of support and unity as the Benghazi scandal returned–however briefly–to the headlines. Yet it also serves a political purpose for the president, as he moves forward with an aggressive and confrontational agenda designed to divide and marginalize opposition and lay the foundation for radical changes, not just for the next four years but the in years beyond.
President Obama wants Republicans to know that the left’s moment is not fleeting; that the changes he makes today will be ratified by the electorate, through Clinton, in 2016 and possibly 2020; in short, that there is no hope for a resurgence and they may as well yield. Whether he succeeds may depend less on how Republicans rebuild themselves, and more on whether Biden–and other Democrats–disrupt the Obama-Clinton alliance.

On Mar. 8, reporter Carl Cameron on Special Report on Fox News Channel was surveying potential GOP 2016 presidential candidates. Then he raised Ted Cruz–one of the most brilliant constitutional lawyers ever to serve in the Senate–the new 41-year old Hispanic senator from Texas.  
Cameron added, “But Cruz was born in Canada and is constitutionally ineligible” to run for president. While many people assume that, it’s probably not true.
Cameron was referring to the Constitution’s Article II requirement that only a “natural born citizen” can run for the White House.


No one is certain what that means. Citizenship was primarily defined by each state when the Constitution was adopted. Federal citizenship wasn’t clearly established until the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868. The Constitution is not clear whether it means you must be born on U.S. soil, or instead whether you must be born a U.S. citizen.

Cruz was born in Canada, but his mother was a lifelong American, born in Delaware. (His father was a political refugee from Cuba.) So under federal law, Cruz was born an American citizen by virtue of his mother. His family moved back to Texas, where Cruz grew up, and lived his entire life except the years he spent in New Jersey attending Princeton, Massachusetts attending Harvard Law School, and Washington, D.C., clerking for Chief Justice William Rehnquist at the Supreme Court and later serving in the Bush administration. So this former Texas solicitor general was born an American citizen and has spent almost all his life in America–usually serving his state or nation. 
It would be better to report, “Some constitutional experts say he would be ineligible,” or more accurate still, “A small minority of constitutional experts say he would be ineligible.” But no one can make the unqualified claim that the Constitution declares Ted Cruz is unable to run for president. 
There’s never been a court case to decide this issue, and there are only a few law review articles written by professors. The only professor I know of who thinks Cruz in ineligible to run for president also said John McCain was ineligible to run for president because he was born on a U.S. Navy base in Panama. I don’t recall any media outlet reporting John McCain was ineligible to be president.
The most likely meaning of the national-born clause is that you must have been an American citizen at birth, so that you would not have greater loyalty to some foreign nation. Cruz was born an American citizen, and has spent most of his life serving this nation with unabashed patriotism.
If Cruz runs for the White House, then one of his opponents in the primary would have standing to sue in federal court to argue Cruz is ineligible. But the smart money would be on a court agreeing that Cruz is as eligible as anyone else who was born an American citizen.

America is suffering from an epic case of Armageddon fatigue. 
Budget showdown, government shutdown, debt ceiling debacle–the stakes are real but the establishment seems to feed off the chaos they create as a means to foment fear and outrage and translate it into campaign donations for themselves. 


Look closely and you’ll see that something seismic is going on under the surface of the manufactured chaos in D.C. 
Washington has morphed into an extortion racket, a place where members of the permanent political class threaten to inflict legislative and regulatory pain to extract campaign donations that they can then siphon into the pockets of themselves and their family members. 
In a new book featured this Sunday on 60 Minutes titled Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets, Peter Schweizer explains how Washington politicians use a set of mafia-style legislative tactics to extort people and industries into donating to them out of fear of political and legal reprisals. 

Schweizer interviewed former Chairman of Apache Corporation Ray Plank. Plank said campaign cash and lobbying contracts now function as “protection money” to keep lawmakers and regulators from going after you. 
“It’s what you expect from the mafia,” said Plank. “They basically come to you and say, ‘We are going to shove this bat up your ass and give you an enema. You better play ball.’ We saw a great deal of it. It’s an insidious blight.” 
There are left-wing progressives on Wall Street and in the high-tech world who bankrolled President Obama’s campaign because they love his radical agenda. But as Schweizer points out, many gave because they know they have to; if they don’t, Obama will come after them. 
That’s a lesson the Tea Party knows all too well. After the Tea Party’s historic 2010 midterm victory, Obama unleashed Attorney General Eric Holder to go after the oil and gas sector, which had given four times as much to Republicans as to Democrats. As Obama said in October 2010, “We are going to punish our enemies and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us.” 
Of course, not everyone gets subjected to these Godfather-style shakedowns. Case in point: Obama bundler and former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine of MF Global shame. After “losing” $1.6 billion of MF Global customer money, Corzine walked away without a scratch. In Extortion, Schweizer publishes a devastating quote from Lisa Timmerman, a 17-year MF Global employee who served as the firm’s assistant comptroller for five years, saying: “Corzine is a major Obama fundraiser [which] is keeping prosecutors from bringing criminal charges against him.” 

But what about the rest of us? What about the average American mom and dad just trying to stay afloat in the disastrous Obama economy? We don’t have the funds to throw “protection money” at the political extortionists in Washington who are eager to foist things like Obamacare on us. Only Obama’s union cronies and members of the permanent political class are given Obamacare waivers and spared the pain of the policies D.C. inflicts on the rest of us. Big business got an Obamacare exemption that Obama refuses to give ordinary individuals who can’t even sign up for Obamacare on the broken exchange websites, but they’ll still be fined for not doing so! 
And what about the GOP establishment? Why haven’t they been able to clean up the extortion racket in Washington? You have to ask yourself, has the party machine fought this corruption or does it participate in it? As a senior House Republican told Fox News on Thursday, it’s “highly unlikely” Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) will be challenged because few have the muscle to match his ability to “raise money.” 
In fact, the ability to raise money is apparently key to all the power in Washington. Here’s how bad it’s gotten: the Democratic and Republican Parties actually have a secret price list–officially known as “party dues”–that tells members of Congress how much money they must extract from donors in order to win a chairmanship or a top slot on a powerful Congressional committee. Schweizer somehow obtained the top-secret lists and included the never-before-published documents in Extortion. 
But fundraising isn’t the only thing D.C. employs to keep people in line. Over in the Senate, Democrats like Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) use thug tactics on Tea Party members and activists who stand in their way. In a devastating chapter on Harry Reid, Schweizer includes a quote from Reid’s former chief of staff Susan McCue, who in 2005 said Reid seizes on a person’s weaknesses to “disarm, to endear, to threaten, but most of all to instill fear.” 
The fact that these strong-arm tactics take place in Washington doesn’t surprise me at all. I’ve fought this type of corruption my entire political career. And those who disagreed with me politically used thug-like tactics to try to bankrupt my family with frivolous lawsuits in Alaska, and it hasn’t stopped to this day. 
It’s time for Washington to stop threatening citizens and scaring up dollars through an endless extortion scheme of manufactured crises. It’s time for leaders to lead. That means doing right by voters without requiring them to pay protection money in advance. 
You have to wonder whether Constitutional rule of law even exists when separate rules apply for powerful and well-connected men like Jon Corzine. And you have to wonder whether we really have government of the people, by the people, and for the people when the only way We the People can be heard is if we grease the palms of the ruling class. 
Enough is enough. If the permanent political class won’t drain the swamp, we will. We should follow the advice in the title of Schweizer’s last book and “Throw Them All Out.” 2014 is just around the corner.

In Virginia, the Fairfax Democratic Party is gloating over the effective removal of voter integrity advocate Hans von Spakovsky from the electoral board of the largest county in the state.  
As the end of von Spakovsky’s current term on the board approached its end, Fairfax Republicans submitted his name and two others as nominees for two of the board’s three seats (since Republican Bob McDonnell currently serves as governor, his party gets the majority of seats). In an unprecedented move, Fairfax County Circuit Judges rejected von Spakovsky for the position, even though Republicans designated him as their preferred nominee.
Because of his fight against voter fraud, local Democrats and national left-wing journalists targeted von Spakovsky, a Heritage Foundation fellow and Breitbart contributor, for removal from the board. These critics asserted that von Spakovsky and other conservatives hoped to disenfranchise voters by supporting election integrity measures like Voter ID in 2012.


Cesar del Aguila, chairman of the Fairfax Democratic Party, and his attorney John Farrell demanded these judges remove von Spakovsky. These judges are themselves appointed by a partisan legislative body and capitulated to the demands of the Democrats. Reporter Robert McCartney amplified the Democrats’ complaints on the pages of the Washington Post.
Aguila and Farrell claimed von Spakovsky acted in a “partisan” way on the board. However, of von Spakovsky’s 224 votes, he made 221 in unison with the board’s Democrat commissioner. Only three votes were split 2-1. 
The refusal to appoint the top designee of the Republican Party was entirely unprecedented in Virginia and promises to bring legislative scrutiny on the actions of Chief Judge Dennis Smith. It may also incite Republicans to scuttle the designees of the Democrat party in the future.

Von Spakovsky is one of the nation’s leading voices against voter fraud, and his removal has serious ramifications for clean elections in the swing state of Virginia.
The Fairfax Democrats reveal a larger national identity crisis within the Democratic party; rational centrist elements have been pushed aside by loud fringe elements led by activists such as Aguila and Farrell. Nearly the entire Democratic legislative delegation from Fairfax and all of the Democrat county supervisors consider Aguila and Farrell to be rough and unhinged but are powerless to tame them.
Von Spakovsky invited the wrath of the radical left when he stopped the distribution of literature published by the ideologically charged League of Women Voters in government election offices. In fact, he stopped literature distribution by all third-party groups. The response by the Democrat party reveals the integration of purportedly non-partisan election advocacy groups like the League with party priorities.
Farrell also resented that von Spakovsky was adamant that Fairfax County comply with the Help America Vote Act of 2002, a federal election law. That law requires that the names of provisional voters be kept confidential, but the Democrat party wanted to harvest that data.
Jay McConville, Chairman of the Fairfax County Republican Party, responded to Friday’s events: 

It is disappointing that the judges would bow to political pressure and allow partisan gamesmanship to win the day. More than that, it is shocking that the Fairfax County Democratic Party would challenge the capabilities of Mr. Von Spakovsky, who has served this community so well and with great dedication during his previous term. Clearly the FCDC is more interested in partisan fights than in the proper functioning of the electoral system or the integrity of the vote.

Unfortunately, the righteous indignation of the Republican Party was too little and too late. The GOP must quickly learn that election administration issues are a blood sport to the left. Anyone who stands in their way is personally targeted and polarized. Until Republicans start fighting back just as hard, the left will keep bloodying those courageous Americans preserving the integrity of our electoral process. Until the GOP engages the fight at the outset and fiercely attacks the attackers, the administration of American elections will be dominated by the narrative of the left.

People close to Rush Limbaugh’s camp are furious at  Americans For Tax Reform’s (ATR) President Grover Norquist for saying the highly rated conservative talk radio host should not be considered as a moderator for the 2016 Republican presidential primary debates.
Norquist told The Hill that he opposed allowing conservative talk radio hosts Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin to moderate the 2016 Republican presidential primary debates, saying it would not be “useful.” 



Having conservative talk radio hosts Mark Levin or Rush Limbaugh host debates would be “not useful,” Norquist told The Hill. Talk radio hosts, he said, are primarily entertainers who would draw attention away from the candidates themselves.
He also said the radio hosts, despite their popularity, did not necessarily represent the Republican mainstream. He pointed toward immigration reform as an example, saying that while Levin opposes comprehensive immigration reform fiercely, polls show most Republicans are amenable to it.

Someone close to the Limbaugh camp spoke to Breitbart News said,  “It’s ironic that when everyone was jumping on the bash Grover bandwagon, Rush  never said a word. He has too much class.” The source also noted that in the past Norquist has used Rush’s quotes on the ATR website to fundraise and promote his cause of the moment.

“Some friend, huh.”
During the vote at the last Republican National Committee meeting when members decided to oust CNN and NBC as potential networks to moderate primary debates over the airing of a Hillary Clinton movie, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus  commented it would be a “very good idea” to have both Limbaugh and Levin as RNC debate moderators.  “I actually think that’s a very good idea,” He said, adding, “I mean, there’s a lot of good people out there that can actually understand the base of the Republican Party, the primary voters.”
 A GOP state party official agreed with Priebus telling Breitbart News, “[Limbaugh and Levin] should be moderators. Chris Matthews did the primary debate in 2008.” 
Immediately after Priebus’s comments, Limbaugh said on his radio show, “I don’t see how I can, I’m too famous.” However, Limbaugh noted the debate would certainly get high ratings.

In Virginia, the Fairfax Democratic Party is gloating over the effective removal of voter integrity advocate Hans von Spakovsky from the electoral board of the largest county in the state.  
As the end of von Spakovsky’s current term on the board approached its end, Fairfax Republicans submitted his name and two others as nominees for two of the board’s three seats (since Republican Bob McDonnell currently serves as governor, his party gets the majority of seats). In an unprecedented move, Fairfax County Circuit Judges rejected von Spakovsky for the position, even though Republicans designated him as their preferred nominee.
Because of his fight against voter fraud, local Democrats and national left-wing journalists targeted von Spakovsky, a Heritage Foundation fellow and Breitbart contributor, for removal from the board. These critics asserted that von Spakovsky and other conservatives hoped to disenfranchise voters by supporting election integrity measures like Voter ID in 2012.


Cesar del Aguila, chairman of the Fairfax Democratic Party, and his attorney John Farrell demanded these judges remove von Spakovsky. These judges are themselves appointed by a partisan legislative body and capitulated to the demands of the Democrats. Reporter Robert McCartney amplified the Democrats’ complaints on the pages of the Washington Post.
Aguila and Farrell claimed von Spakovsky acted in a “partisan” way on the board. However, of von Spakovsky’s 224 votes, he made 221 in unison with the board’s Democrat commissioner. Only three votes were split 2-1. 
The refusal to appoint the top designee of the Republican Party was entirely unprecedented in Virginia and promises to bring legislative scrutiny on the actions of Chief Judge Dennis Smith. It may also incite Republicans to scuttle the designees of the Democrat party in the future.

Von Spakovsky is one of the nation’s leading voices against voter fraud, and his removal has serious ramifications for clean elections in the swing state of Virginia.
The Fairfax Democrats reveal a larger national identity crisis within the Democratic party; rational centrist elements have been pushed aside by loud fringe elements led by activists such as Aguila and Farrell. Nearly the entire Democratic legislative delegation from Fairfax and all of the Democrat county supervisors consider Aguila and Farrell to be rough and unhinged but are powerless to tame them.
Von Spakovsky invited the wrath of the radical left when he stopped the distribution of literature published by the ideologically charged League of Women Voters in government election offices. In fact, he stopped literature distribution by all third-party groups. The response by the Democrat party reveals the integration of purportedly non-partisan election advocacy groups like the League with party priorities.

The early voting in one of the two recall elections in Colorado is not looking very favorable for the incumbent. Senate
President John Morse is in danger of getting thrown out for
his support for strict gun control laws passed in the 2013 session.
Early voting began Thursday, continued through Friday and Saturday and will resume Monday. The election is on Tuesday.
The recall initiative was launched by gun rights activists against the Colorado Springs Democrat John Morse and Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo because of their votes for the gun laws that include limiting the size of ammunition magazines and requiring universal background checks.


The Denver Post reports that Republicans are dominating in the early voting in Morse’s district and Democrats will have a lot of votes to make up if they want to keep Morse in office.

The vote totals so far from the El Paso County clerk and recorder show that although Republicans only comprise 26 percent of Morse’s Senate District 11, they account for 41 percent of the early voting. 

Here are the figures:
VOTER REGISTRATION: 69,481
Unaffiliated: 26,725 or 37.81%
Democrats: 23,344 or 33.59%
Republicans: 18,174 or 26.15%
Libertarians: 716 or 1.03%
Green Party: 278 or 0.40%
American Constitution: 244 or 0.35%
TURNOUT SO FAR: 9,485
Republicans: 3,923 or 41.36%
Democrats: 3,081 or 32.48%
Unaffiliated: 2,351 or 24.7%
Other: 130 or 1.37%

Meanwhile, Democrats are dominating in the recall voting for the other Democratic senator, Angela Giron of Pueblo as it currently stands.

As the actual recall election goes into its seventh day Sunday, it’s Democrats – many of whom are likely Giron supporters – who continue to hold a sizable lead in voting.
Friday morning, Pueblo County election officials said 5,887 Democrats had voted during the week compared with 3,314 Republicans and 2,054 independents.
That gives Democrats nearly a 2-to-1 margin over Republicans.

It is difficult to explain to Americans, particularly young Americans, what was wrong with the Clinton era, and why we ought not want to re-live it. The 1990s are sealed into our national memory as a time of great prosperity and expectation–killed off, in Democrats’ rewriting of history, by the 2000 recount and all that followed. 
The truth is that by 2000, Democrats could not run away from Clinton quickly enough. It’s worth revisiting why.


By 2000, President Bill Clinton had survived the scandal that led to his impeachment, but the dot-com bubble had burst and the country had plunged into recession. 
(It never really recovered. A college friend and I recently observed that the career trajectories of our friends were deeply affected by whether they graduated in 1998, at the height of the boom, or 1999, just before the crash, and with little time to gain real work experience.)
The political right, frustrated by the perceived failure of the 1994 revolution, decided to adopt its own version of Clinton’s “third way” politics by embracing George W. Bush and his “compassionate conservatism.” But on the left, those who resented Clinton’s market-oriented, free-trade policies finally gained the upper hand, shutting down the Seattle World Trade Organization talks in 1999, inaugurating the anti-globalization movement.

Things were unraveling overseas, as well. The Oslo Peace Process, which Clinton had pushed, and which promised a “new Middle East,” collapsed, and a new wave of terror began. 
Just days later, the U.S.S. Cole was attacked by Al Qaeda, the follow-up to the embassy bombings of two years before, and a sign that Clinton’s cruise-missile, light-footprint response to those attacks had encouraged rather than placated the enemy.
The party was over. And Americans were tired of it. 
Culturally, for instance, it was a time of stagnation. The Clinton era was a time of classic-rock revival and derivative hip-hop, each mining the past for inspiration as major stars died out. Grunge and alternative rose and fell in an arc of self-loathing. Across the arts, nostalgia for more meaningful times–what Harvard critic Philip Fisher mocked as “nightmare envy”–was a dominant theme.
Beneath the surface of Clinton-era complacency also lay the roots of future crises. The president reauthorized the Community Reinvestment Act in 1999, for example, pushing big banks into subprime lending and setting the stage for the 2007-8 housing crisis. 

At the same time, Clinton cronies like Jack Lew and Rahm Emanuel seized the opportunity of deregulation for self-enrichment at the country’s decrepit “too big to fail” banks.
It was Bill Clinton’s lies about his personal life that led to his impeachment; it was his manipulation and broken promises that led to public disenchantment. And that came at the worst possible time. 

A newly-globalized world, under attack by the far-left, the Islamists, and thinly-disguised nationalists, needed an effective leader to guide it through turbulent times, to affirm the value of freedom despite the great risks involved.
But Clinton had undermined himself, and his collapse left no political successors. His “New Democrats,” who once sought to move the party beyond old labor alliances and leftist dogmas, withered and faded.
Worse, Clinton abandoned his own achievements. Later, when President Obama gutted welfare reform’s work requirements, Clinton refused to criticize him, collaborating in the death of his own legacy–all for the sake of 2016.

Democrats forget all of that now, and the “Clinton fatigue” of 1999-2000. But what they still remembered about the Clintons in 2008 was their dishonesty. 
To moderates, that was a virtue: when Hillary mouthed the new left-wing rhetoric of her party, they knew she was saying what she thought would win primary voters. 
But to others, it was a fatal flaw. They preferred Barack Obama’s apparent left-wing authenticity (though Bill Clinton warned it was a “fairy tale”).
Hillary Clinton has all of the fakery, and none of the charm, of her husband. From her comical pandering to the black community, to her cover-ups at the State Department, she has done little of substance to redeem her duplicity.
After Obama’s many failures, Americans may be content to embrace someone they never trusted anyway. But those lies do make a “difference,” and opponents ought to remind Americans of that, constantly.

The Republican National Committee has hired the son of Fox News commentator Juan Williams to coordinate the party’s efforts to reach out to young and black voters.
Raffi Williams, the 24 year-old son of the liberal Fox commentator, will be the RNC’s deputy press secretary and will be tasked with helping the GOP make inroads in these communities. 
He told BuzzFeed that even though it is not realistic to expect Republicans to “get a ridiculous amount of African Americans in the next election,” the party can “can start to make inroads, and the more inclusive we are as a party the better optics we get to other demographics as well — not just African Americans — and that helps us in the long run.”


Williams was a Communications Director for the Republican Study Committee and worked for Rep. Dan Benishek’s (R-MI) reelection campaign. 

After losing every minority group badly during the last election cycle in a country that is getting more diverse, the RNC conducted an “autopsy” report that identified the problems the GOP has had with minority voters. Williams said RNC Chair Reince Priebus is enthusiastic about his efforts and it seems like he will be given the resources to succeed. 
“So it’s about making those new connections and getting the support I need. People are really enthused about it,” Williams said. “And that’s a nice thing for me. I didn’t know what I was walking into exactly but from the Chairman on down everyone is so on board with this.”
Republicans may be able to win over black voters after Obama leaves office because many blacks tend to be conservative on issues like immigration and gay marriage. 
For instance, George W. Bush won 16% of the black vote in Ohio in 2004, largely because many culturally conservative black voters went to the polls to vote against gay marriage. In 2008, Obama won 97% of the black vote in Ohio. And in 2012, Obama received 96% of the black vote in Ohio, but blacks made up an astounding 15% of Ohio’s electorate on election day, which made the difference for Obama in the state.

Facing an active campaign by grass-roots activists to defeat him in next year’s primary, Sen. Lamar Alexander penned a letter to the state’s largest newspaper defending his pragmatic, “problem solving” approach to governing. The letter in The Tennessean defends his record as a conservative who knows how to “get results.”
“Well, I learned to count in Maryville City Schools,” Alexander writes. “So I know that if you only have 45 votes and you need 60 senators to get something important done like balancing the budget and fixing the debt, then you have to work with other people — that is, IF you really care about solving the problem, IF you really want to get a result, instead of just making a speech.”
It is a superficially compelling argument. It is an argument conservatives have heard for decades. Yes, the perfect can’t be the enemy of the good. Yes, we have to compromise to meet many of our goals. And, yes, a half-loaf is better than nothing. 


But it begs the question. Where has Alexander’s “compromise” and “problem-solving” approach taken us? Alexander has often abetted the Democrats in the Senate, supporting their legislative agenda and providing support for Obama nominees. When has he been able to persuade Democrats to support a conservative issue? Alexander’s record suggests compromise is a one-way street, i.e. Republicans support Democrats. When do Democrats in the Senate ever repay the favor Alexander extends them?

The record of the “problem-solving” approach is fairly grim. It has given us $16 trillion in debt, ObamaCare, bailouts of Wall Street and the auto industry, trillion dollar deficits, sweeping new regulations, and government encroachment on ever more aspects of our lives. 
Against this, Alexander proudly trumps his successful campaign to preserve the rights of people to fish at dams. That’s all well and good, but it isn’t exactly an even trade. 
I have no doubt that Alexander is a fine man and a decent-enough Senator. Unfortunately, both he and the state’s junior Senator, Bob Corker, represent something of a wasted opportunity. Tennessee is a deeply conservative state. It is still one of only a handful of states that doesn’t have an income tax. Alexander and Corker, however, have voting records that better reflect the voters in Maine or Illinois. 
There is perhaps a place for Alexander’s approach to governing. Tennessee isn’t that place.

Monday afternoon, CNN released a statement in response to the Republican National Committee’s (RNC) ultimatum. In a letter to both NBC and CNN, RNC Chair Reince Priebus said that the Party will not allow either network to host primary debates if they go ahead with planned projects surrounding Hillary Clinton. In its statement, CNN said they will not cancel the planned documentary and that it would be a “disservice to voters” for the RNC not to partner with them for the debates:
CNN Films, a division of CNN Worldwide, commissioned a documentary about Hillary Clinton earlier this year. It is expected to premiere in 2014 with a theatrical run prior to airing on CNN. This documentary will be a non-fiction look at the life of a former First Lady and Secretary of State. Instead of making premature decisions about a project that is in the very early stages of development and months from completion, we would encourage the members of the Republican National Committee to reserve judgment until they know more. Should they decide not to participate in debates on CNN, we would find it curious, as limiting their debate participation seems to be the ultimate disservice to voters.
As far as CNN’s claim about a “disservice to voters,” one wonders which voters CNN is talking about. Certainly not Republican voters. For years now, and for very good reason, Republican voters have seen CNN as just another branch of the Democrat Party. 


During the 2012 election, many Republicans were  infuriated and questioned the judgment of an RNC that willingly allowed our candidates to have their futures put in the hands of a network that was and is so obviously enamored with Obama and the left. It was a suicide run, when these debates should be used by the RNC to help our candidates shine.

CNN was even worse during the actual presidential debates when CNN’s Candy Crowley violated the debate rules, tried to save Barack Obama from a Mitt Romney attack, and got her facts horribly wrong. This is one of the biggest gaffes in all of presidential debate history, but this one was committed by the moderator. 
Earlier today, NBC News responded with the claim it had nothing to do with the network’s planned miniseries about Clinton, that will star Academy Award-nominee Diane Lane. 
It is unlikely that Priebus and the RNC expected either network to back down. So the news here is all good.

Pew Research released a poll today that should give the White House cause for concern as the days tick by before Senator Chuck Hagel’s senate confirmation vote to become Defense Secretary. The more the public gets to know Hagel, the less they like him. Over the course of a month, as public awareness increased, Hagel’s favorables increased a mere four points, from 18 to 22, while his unfavorables jumped from 17 to 28 points. 
The pressure isn’t letting up, either. Today, Senator Lindsey Grahem sent a letter to Hagel asking for clarification on another round of controversial comments supposedly attached to the nominee:
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) sent a letter to Chuck Hagel today, asking whether he had made the reported comments (or anything like them) that “Israel has violated every UN resolution since 1967, that Israel has violated its agreements with the quartet, that it was risking becoming an apartheid state if it didn’t allow the Palestinians to form a state, … that the settlements were getting close to the point where a contiguous Palestinian state would be impossible …  that Netanyahu was a radical … [and] that Hamas has to be brought in to any peace negotiation.” Moreover, Graham by no means has given up on seeking the financial information Hagel so far has refused to provide.


There’s another development today in the great state of Nebraska. The University of Nebraska-Omaha is refusing to release Senator Hagel’s archives to the media. According to the Weekly Standard, Hagel stands by the university’s decision to keep sealed thousands of his papers, audio, video and transcripts of speeches: 
Chuck Hagel’s record in the Senate is well documented in the public domain,” says Hagel spokesman Marie Harf in an emailed statement.
“Given his extraordinary disclosures to date, which surpass the threshold applied to nominees, there is no need to make this archived material public.”

The archives are not open to the public, university officials say, because not everything there has been processed.
However, the university has also said that with Hagel’s permission, they would grant the Weekly Standard’s Daniel Halper access to the archive.
Thus far, Hagel is refusing that permission.

Chief Global Affairs Correspondent for ABC News Martha Raddatz joined fellow 2012 presidential debate moderators Jim Lehrer and Bob Schieffer at Washington D.C.’s National Press Club. The trio discussed their experiences as debate moderators during the last presidential campaign to panel moderator Marvin Kalb.
When asked by Kalb if she felt rattled by Twitter criticism of her performance, she said:  



Twitter, as much as you might want to fight it, Marvin, it’s out there. There are voices out there that have influence. There are. I think for we as journalists, it’s a great journalistic tool. It is. You can find all sorts of stories. 
I had some strange press the day before that for about fifteen minutes rattled me. It did not affect me as a moderator. It affected me as a mom. My son’s on Twitter all the time. It’s the only way we can communicate. If he’s in the bedroom, it’s like, ‘Are you coming to dinner?’ And I tweet it. But I was worried, because there was such nasty stuff. And then my son was like, ‘Mom, do people..?’ I said, ‘You know there are some crazy people who write really mean things and don’t worry about them.’ She added that she she told him, ‘These people have three followers. Quit answering them. They all live in basements with 75 cats.’

Raddatz was asked later by Breitbart News during the Q & A, “You seemed to have gotten a lot of criticism during the vice presidential debate, allowing Joe Biden to just run all over you–the constant laughing, the interrupting of Paul Ryan, particularly when he was talking about an armed Iran or green energy. How can you say you had any control over that debate whatsoever?” 

She responded:

Listen, I want to answer you fairly. I really do. You’re up there and you’re as fair as you can possibly be. I think that when we came out of that debate, Joe Biden had 45 seconds more than Congressman Ryan. I think Congressman Ryan felt it was fair. And that’s what I can say. I think Congressman Ryan afterwards could not have been nicer. Both of them were. And both of them thought it was fair. 

However, Michael Steel, Paul Ryan’s Vice Presidential spokesman, told the Daily Caller after the debate that Raddatz did not moderate debate fairly at all. :

“I thought she obviously asserted herself more than [Jim] Lehrer did,” Steel said, referencing the moderator of the first presidential debate last week, according to Politico. “[B]ut there was still a great deal of crosstalk, there was still a great deal of difficulty making points in a reasonable and progressive fashion.”

Marvin Kalb began making a tweeting sound after Breitbart News asked her the question, referencing Raddatz’s previous remarks about criticisms she received on Twitter. However, Raddatz, did not just receive criticism for her debate moderator performance from people with 75 cats who live in basements and have three Twitter followers. 
A number of right-of-center journalists were critical of her as well. The Washington Examiner‘s David Freddoso wrote, “Ryan is outnumbered here. It’s two against one.” National Review’s Katrina Trinko remarked, “Raddatz is totally being walked all over by Biden. She’s letting him get by with murder in time of talking.” Phil Klein, who works for the Washington Examiner, said, “Every time Biden starts interrupting Ryan, Martha Raddatz cuts Ryan off.” Fox News Contributor and Radio’s Laura Ingraham asked, “Why does Raddatz want to ‘move on’ when Ryan is getting traction?”  
Finally, Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer said of Raddatz, “I pay good money to see a fight, not the referee.”

Claims that Virginia Democrats are purposefully misrepresenting the positions held by Republican candidate for governor Ken Cuccinelli have made one of the ugliest political campaigns even worse.
A Virginia Republican delegate, Scott Lingamfelter, said that he received a robocall on Sunday night claiming that Cuccinelli supports ObamaCare and taxpayer funding of abortions. According to the Washington Free Beacon, the calls are believed to be an attempt to depress conservative voter turnout and to use pressure to boost voter turnout among Democrats in the final days of the race. 
Rather than a supporter of those positions, Cuccinelli was the first attorney general in the United States to challenge ObamaCare in federal court and is adamantly pro-life. 


A description of the robocall from Lingamfelter’s Facebook page claimed: 


About 25 minutes ago (7:24 PM 3 November) the Democratic Party of Virginia dropped a robo-call (that they said they paid for in the recording) at MY house to try to tell ME that Ken Cuccinelli supports Obamacare and public financing of abortion!!!
Virginia, pa-leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezzz understand that the party that wants Terry McAuliffe to be your governor will flat lie about anything! If you want proof that they will say ANYTHING to gain power over you and your life, you need go no further than the “robo-lies” they are sending around Virginia this Sunday evening. They are shameless in their tactics. (I guess they are trying to suppress GOP voters.)

The Beacon states that neither Lingamfelter nor the Democratic Party of Virginia responded to questions about the robocall campaign.  
In an update on its report of the story, LifeNews indicated that Cuccinelli himself has commented on the robocalls via an email sent out to his supporters: 

We have the most energized group of grassroots supporters I’ve ever seen in all of my years in office. Our momentum and excitement is contagious – Terry McAuliffe and the Democrats see that – and they’re nervous. So nervous in fact, that they’ve turned to desperate, outright lies to try to sway my hardworking and dedicated supporters. 
Early today, I was informed that the Democrats are calling the homes of my Republican supporters and telling them that I support Obamacare! 
That’s right, Friend. Terry McAuliffe and his Democrat allies are trying to convince voters that I support Obamacare in order to trick them into voting against me!
Of course we all know the truth – that I was the first Attorney General in the country to sue the federal government over Obamacare. I’ve been busy fighting back against Obamacare for years, and what has Terry McAuliffe done? He said it didn’t go far enough. 
Terry even stood by President Obama’s side yesterday and celebrated Obamacare after news broke that the President lied to Americans, and millions lost their health insurance.

Since the 2010 midterm elections, conservatives have looked to Speaker Boehner and House Republicans to provide a vanguard against Obama’s radical agenda. It has been a disheartening experience. In fairness to House Republicans, there is little one legislative chamber can do to affect the direction of the federal government. The tools they do have, however, they have often declined to use. Paul’s filibuster of the Brennan nomination on Wednesday, however, showed the emergence of a new opposition to Obama. Based in the Senate, it is providing the American public a stark contrast to Obama’s ever-expanding government. 
Paul’s filibuster was not based on a traditional partisan issue. Its goal was simply to clarify that the President did not have the authority to assassinate American citizens, on domestic soil, who are suspected of cooperating with terrorists. Such clarity ought not require a 13 hour filibuster. The event, however, exposed the public to a reasoned articulation of conservative, constitutional principles. It was a brilliant counter-point to Obama’s doctrine of expanding government power in every direction. 
On Friday, Sen. Marco Rubio joined Sen. Ted Cruz in announcing his opposition to any continuing resolution funding the government that didn’t also defund ObamaCare. House Republicans have long since given up this fight, passing a continuing resolution this week that continues to fund ObamaCare’s expansion. Sixteen House Republicans bucked their leadership and opposed the move, but enough Democrats joined Republicans to pass the measure. 


With this week’s moves, the center of political gravity has shifted to an emerging band of leaders in the Senate. Sens. Paul, Rubio, and Cruz are providing the nucleus of a new and robust conservative opposition to the Obama Administration. They will likely lose most of their battles. Unlike House Republicans, however, they understand that their primary responsibility is to articulate to the American public an alternative vision for the country. It requires one to pick an occasional battle and present one’s case to the public. 

House Republicans are obsessive about “governing,” even though they lack the levers of power to do so. They would rather put off an ideological fight on principle in order to pass legislation. This may make sense tactically, but strategically it’s a losing bet. Worse, it denies the American public a clear choice. A party ought to articulate why it should be entrusted with legislative power. 
Sens. Paul, Rubio and Cruz understand this. They are providing the tip of the spear ahead of the 2014 midterms. Based on initial responses to Paul’s filibuster this week, they will have an army behind them.

At the beginning of 2013, Obama and his Democrat party were in firm control of the nation’s political terrain. Obama had won a convincing reelection by again boosting turnout of his young and minority voter base. Contrary to expectations, the Democrats gained two seats in the Senate, extending their control of the chamber, and made modest gains in the House. The Republicans, after squandered an almost unprecedented opportunity, were have something of an existential crisis. What a difference a year makes. 
Not only did 2013 see a resurgence of the Republican party, it provided a number of political surprises throughout the year. The following were the biggest surprises of the year. 
5. The Collapse of Marco Rubio


At the beginning of the year, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) seemed the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in 2016. A poll of Iowa Republicans in January showed him with a commanding lead with a crowded field, running ahead of his closest competitor, Rep. Paul Ryan, by over eight points. In December, however, Rubio polled 8th in Iowa, garnering support from just 6% of Republicans in the state. In national polls, he polls around 6th place. It is a breathtaking political collapse. 
Rubio’s political fortunes were reversed by a fundamental misreading of the electorate on immigration reform. There is a robust case to be made for reforming our nation’s immigration system. The approach adopted by the Senate and promoted by Rubio, however, is arguably worse than the current system. It provides immediate legalization for 11 million illegal immigrants and effectively does almost nothing to secure the border. Even the modest security provisions in the bill would likely be ignored by the Obama Administration, which has ignored existing Congressional directives related to the border. 
Like amnesty legislation in 1986, it provides legalization with a promise of security that will likely never materialize. Also like the deal in 1986, it will likely provide an incentive for even greater illegal immigration in the future. The GOP establishment and its business allies may still approve immigration reform in 2014, but Rubio’s political standing is unlikely to return.  

4. The ObamaCare Rollout Disaster
I always expected ObamaCare to ultimately be a failure. I did not anticipate, however, the smoldering wreckage that was its rollout. The government simply had to build a website with no more complexity than Amazon or any other e-commerce site. It also had hundreds of millions of dollars and three years to build it. Even the government didn’t seem incompetent enough to screw that up. 
Oh, but it did. 
Even more surprising was the very slow response of the Obama Administration to the obvious disaster. Subsequent reports have detailed several warnings to government officials that the website wasn’t ready to launch, wasn’t secure, and wasn’t even accessible. Did no one take these remotely seriously? Did they think unicorns and pixie dust would mask these failures?
In October, in the aftermath of the government shutdown, Democrats led the generic congressional ballot by eight points. In the wake of the ObamaCare rollout disaster, Republicans have gained an unprecedented 13 points and now lead Democrats by 5. 

3. The GOP’s War on Its Base 
Inexplicably, the Republican party establishment reacted to its defeats in 2012 by declaring war on its base, conservative voters. Party officials and strategists blamed their defeat on the “tea party” and conservatives, who presumably turned off more “moderate” voters. The problem with this narrative is that the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, won Independents by five points. Republicans lost because the Democrats did a better job turning out their base voters. For the past two elections, the GOP has given its nomination to the most “moderate” candidate running. It is clearly not a recipe for success. 

In the past few years, there have been some candidates with strong tea party backing who in the end were flawed. There have been far more “establishment” candidates who also lost. Todd Aiken won the GOP primary in Missouri because the tea party was divided between two other candidates. Richard Lugar had the edge over eventual nominee Richard Mourdock, until it was revealed that Lugar didn’t have an actual residence in his state. At least make a pretense of representing a state. At least six “establishment” and “electable” Senate candidates, enough to secure a majority, went down to defeat in 2012.
The party and its business allies, however, have vowed to challenge conservatives in primaries next year. The GOP establishment will no doubt be able to raise millions to wage this pyrrhic war, but it is hard to see how it will have the “boots on the ground” to win elections. It may very well spark its own destruction as a national political force. 
2. Obama’s Irrelevance 

Congress ended its year passing the first budget agreement in five years. Most surprising, though, is that it accomplished this because Obama wasn’t part of the negotiations. The Democrats’ lead negotiator, Sen. Patty Murray, intentionally kept the White House out of the talks. 
It was a dramatic turn around for a President who won a solid reelection just a year ago. At the start of 2013, Obama’s approval rating was nearly 60%. By a combination of political miscalculation and detachment, Obama has squandered all the political capital he won through his reelection. 
He has made high-profile pushes for gun control, immigration reform, climate change and a higher minimum wage. Progress on these issues is arguably harder now than it was before Obama made them priorities. 
In foreign policy, an area where second term presidents generally focus, Obama has led a withdrawal of the US from the world stage. America was a passive observer to the dramatic events in Egypt. Our absence allowed Russia to reassert its influence in the region for the first time in decades. China is expanding its influence throughout the world. Obama drew a line in the sand on Syria and then quickly retreated. His outreach to Iran has angered almost all of our allies. They don’t trust us and our enemies don’t fear us. 
1. Obama’s Political Resilience   
With his approval ratings at the lowest of his Presidency, it may seem counterintuitive to talk about Obama’s political resilience. Consider, however, what he has withstood this year. 
We have learned that the government is engaged in comprehensive surveillance of Americans. The NSA tracks our web activity and even keeps records on every phone call we make. Worse, the Administration has lied about its activities repeatedly. The government even targeted reporters it suspected of working with government whistleblowers. 
We also learned that the government was using the IRS to target its political opponents. This targeting went beyond supervision of tax-exempt groups and included audits of major Republican donors. When a cancer patient went public with the news that he was losing his health insurance as a result of ObamaCare, he quickly learned he was being audited by the IRS. 
PoliticFact names Obama’s oft repeated promise that people can keep their health insurance the “lie of the year.” Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance as a result of his signature legislative achievement. The cancellation of these policies and problems with the law’s implementation raise the real possibility that fewer Americans will have insurance when ObamaCare takes full effect on January 1st. 
I could literally run through a half-dozen more issues, any one of which would cripple most presidencies. That’s even before considering the anemic economic “recovery.” Obama does currently have the lowest approval rating of any 2-term President, at this point, since Richard Nixon. Still, between 40-42% of the public approves of the job he is doing. How is this even possible? 
The most surprising thing about 2013 is that Obama has absorbed more negative shocks than almost all modern-day presidents combined and yet is still supported by only a little less than half the public. Even his currently low approval ratings defy gravity. 
Something’s got to give next year.

11032	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/05/19/53000-dead-voters-in-florida-millions-nationwide	News	1	Elections	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

The Florida Secretary of State has discovered 53,000 dead voters registered to vote. The Secretary of State has also flagged thousands of potential non-citizens who are also registered to vote. This discovery is indicative of a wider national problem with dead and ineligible voters on the rolls heading into the Presidential election.
In the 2012 legislative session, Florida finally passed a law requiring the use of the Social Security Death Index (SSDI) to determine if dead people are registered to vote in Florida. Secretary of State Kurt Browning and then-State Election Director Don Palmer proposed this idea in the previous legislative session, but the bill did not pass.
Florida discovered the dead voters by matching voter rolls against the SSDI.


The SSDI is the list of Americans who have died and applied for death benefits. Because an application must be submitted by the next of kin and carries criminal penalties for false statements, it is considered the most accurate list of dead voters available.
Yet most states don’t use the SSDI. Instead, they use a hodge-podge of other information, usually compiled from the state bureaus of vital statistics. But state bureau reporting is slow and incomplete.
Three counties in Florida have reported more citizens registered to vote than people alive eligible to vote – St. Johns, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa – according to the most recent Election Assistance Commission report.

Having dead people infesting the rolls is the first step to voter impersonation.
Federal law requires states to have a reasonable voter list maintenance program and gives the Eric Holder Justice Department the power to sue states that don’t. Not surprisingly, Holder’s DOJ has not brought a single case under the law to require states to clean up corrupted voter rolls. Indeed, when I served at the DOJ Voting Section, an announcement was made in November 2009 that this provision of the law would not be enforced. The political leadership was philosophically opposed to the law, and they said so.
Make no mistake, the problem of corrupted voter rolls is not confined to Florida. It extends to New Mexico, Iowa, Indiana, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and other states. Judicial Watch has notified various states they are in violation of the law and will be filing lawsuits to force the sort of clean-up that Florida has now started.
Many resist cleaning up the voter rolls as directed by the Secretary of State. Brenda Snipes, the Supervisor of Elections in Broward County (Fort Lauderdale) is one.
“I’m feeling really uncomfortable about this,” Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes told officials with the state’s Division of Elections.

With the election just months away, the time for removing ineligible voters is now. Unfortunately, millions are on the rolls across the nation, and election officials from the DOJ to local offices are reluctant to act.

11043	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/03/Inside-Conservative-Rebellion-Boehner	News	0	Elections	None	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"
House Speaker John Boehner barely held onto his job atop Congress’ lower chamber on Thursday. Just how close a call Boehner had is now becoming clear.
Nine House conservatives voted for somebody other than Boehner, two abstained from voting and one voted “present.” That total of 12 Republicans who didn’t support Boehner was a stone’s throw from the required 17 to force a second ballot election – at which point several more Republican members were slated to back a competitor to Boehner’s, who would unite the party behind him or her.


Politico has reported the original list of members possibly considering defection from Boehner was longer and included Reps. Steve King of Iowa, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Scott Garrett of New Jersey and Steve Fincher and Scott DesJarlais, both of Tennessee.
Politico uncovered this list because Kansas Republican Rep. Tim Huelskamp “sat on the House floor during the speaker vote brandishing an iPad” with a message “displayed on the screen ticking off members of the House Republican Conference he hoped would oppose the sitting speaker.”
The title of the email message was reportedly: “You would be fired if this goes out.”

Breitbart News has confirmed that the following members were considering voting against Boehner retaining his speakership as well: Reps. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Sam Graves of Missouri, Steve Southerland of Florida, Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, David Schweikert of Arizona, Arkansas freshman Tom Cotton and Brett Guthrie of Kentucky.
Reps. Guthrie and Cotton denied to Breitbart News that they were on the list.
“Speaker Boehner was voted out of the Republican Conference unanimously and I never considered not voting for him on the House floor. I do not know where these lists originated and my proposed involvement is completely false,” Guthrie said.
Doug Coutts, Chief of Staff for Rep. Cotton, asserted, “Contrary to Breitbart’s reporting, Mr. Cotton did not consider voting for anyone other than Speaker Boehner, an intention he stated plainly the morning of the vote on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal. 
“Further, no one approached Mr. Cotton to ask his support for anyone other than Speaker Boehner, nor did Mr. Cotton engage such conversations.”

Breitbart News also learned that outgoing House GOP conference chairman Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling was considering opposing Boehner. Boehner recently named Hensarling to be the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee in the next Congress.
All in all, there were more than 20 House Republicans who were considering unseat Boehner. Many of these members bailed on the movement at the last minute on the House floor.
There did appear to be at one point a chance Boehner wouldn’t regain his position during the happenings on the House floor. The Clerk of the House had reached the end of her list of names to call when Boehner reached 216 votes – he needed 217 to win re-election. As the National Review’s Washington, D.C., editor Robert Costa noted on Twitter, there were 17 Republican members either not voting, voting present or voting for someone other than Boehner. “So: In short, we were over 17 for a minute, looking at 2nd ballot, when the conservatives come to floor, save Boehner from 2nd ballot,” Costa wrote.
Then, as Costa notes, Bachmann, Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn and New Jersey’s Scott Garrett came back to the floor – after ignoring their names being called the first time during the alphabetical roll call – and voted for Boehner. 
“Boehner is fine, people/ He will be reelected. Blackburn, Bachmann, and Garrett saved him,” Costa said of those conservatives saving Boehner. “What a story. What a story.”
This article has been updated to include responses from Rep. Guthrie and a representative of Rep. Cotton.

Actress Ashley Judd, who’s mulling a 2014 bid for the U.S. Senate against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, largely miffed an opportunity to prove herself on the national political stage Friday.
Judd gave a speech on public health, followed by an audience question and answer session, at George Washington University’s School of Public Health and Health Services in the Foggy Bottom area of Washington, D.C. The event was Judd’s first real political trial balloon ahead of a rumored 2014 Democratic U.S. Senate bid in Kentucky – and she flopped.
During her speech, Judd described her initial decision to enter the Hollywood acting world over the activism world.


“I went to the other jungle: Hollywood,” Judd said to the audience of about 150 students. “There, I had instantaneous success much to my own – what would the word be? – I wouldn’t even say surprise because I didn’t even know it was success until I looked back on it last year. It just all happened so very fast.”
“I remember when I was going [to Hollywood], I was talking to a family friend, and I was still frightened,” Judd continued. “Amazingly, I was raised with someone who has the greatest voice of her generation in our own home yet I didn’t have a lot of stage education. I didn’t know what it meant to be an actor.  So, I was scared. I was nervous. I was talking to this family friend and said, ‘you know, I’m still going to do a lot of service, I’m still going to help advocate that women need access to medically accurate sex education and have access to a full basket of family planning choices that are right for them.’ I went on to list the other things I was going to do and he said, ‘do you want to be an actor or do you want to save the world?'”
“In 2002, I was really sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Judd added. “I didn’t know what was wrong. I knew that I was just – something wasn’t quite right. At that time, it turns out, and I didn’t even know this, I was one of the highest paid women in the history of Hollywood.”

After admitting she is a card carrying member of the “One Percent,” the Americans Democrats routinely demonize, Judd went on to flub comment after comment throughout the rest of the event. 
When she was describing how she “got sick and tired of my own pity for myself,” Judd struggled to pronounce the word “periphery” correctly. 
Judd then name-dropped Bono.
“That very same day I got a call from Bono,” Judd said of the day an AIDS group asked her to help push their message. “No talk is ever complete without talking about Bono.”
“He’s amazing,” Judd said of Bono. “He’s the real deal.”

The actress went to explain how she determined “why women and girls end up in brothels,” telling the student audience that “baseline” it was “gender inequality.”
When Judd opened the floor up for questions, her struggles intensified. When asked by the dean of the college if she had advice for the community, Judd let the place know how wonderfully she thought of herself. “You know have no idea how much advice I have,” she said.

“I can’t wait to hear from the College Republicans,” Judd joked at another point, before any students asked her a question.
The first student questioner, a young woman who made sure to point out she was a Democrat, asked Judd to define “feminism.” Judd tackled it the best she could, after noting how “it’s really very simple.”
“We could spend the rest of the day talking about this,” Judd said. “We were all made in the image and likeness of our Creator. We’re all sacred, and we’re here to love each other and be equal. It’s very simple.”

As a second young woman wrapped up her question of Judd, the actress stopped paying attention. “Huh, I’m sorry, I was giving my mother eye kisses,” Judd said. Judd’s mother, Naomi Judd, was in the audience.
The dean was forced to re-ask the young woman’s question so Judd could answer it.
When asked about what role “faith” plays in her initiatives, Judd said “I’m just a surrogate for the people doing the grassroots work.”
“What I had to do was find a faith that would work for me under all causes and conditions,” Judd said. “In forcibly displaced persons camps, in child abuse children, in emergency rooms, in a brothel, in a labor slave camp, in an orphanage. You know how hard it is to walk out of an orphanage? My hands tingle. You feel the weight of the babies coming up behind.”
“Or to sit in a slum and see two sisters who are orphaned ask me to bring them home to America, because America is the place where dreams come true? Later I found out they rehearsed it because they so wanted to come home to America with me. That’s a depth for me, a spiritual depth.”
Another student asked her about garbage initiatives around the world. The student said she worked in India for a little while recently, and “the amount of garbage … I just could not get over it.”
“My question is how to we get anyone to care about their health when the first thing they probably need to care about is the dump of trash in front of their house or their slum, and that they don’t have running water?” the student asked Judd. “To me, that seems like the base…. I’m just wondering from what you’ve seen in your travels what your thoughts are on that.”
Judd used a homespun saying in her tortured response.
“My thought is that you found your pig,” Judd responded. “You should stick with your pig. What I mean by ‘pig’ is we all have to find the thing that makes us mad and the thing that gives us the fire in the belly and the passion and the stamina to stick with it. The ‘pig thing’ comes another good Eastern Kentuckian, my godmother. It was heavy-handed in my face.”
In trying to further explain the “pig” reference, Judd said “it became a slogan for this is ‘my thing.'” 
“It sounds like garbage has become your thing,” Judd told the student questioner. “Go with it. And I agree with you about the garbage.'”

Thousands of Tea Party activists will gather Monday at rallies across the nation to mark Tax Day, April 15–and to re-ignite a movement that had been written off as dormant by the media and the political classes.
After propelling the Republican Party to the majority in the House of Representatives in 2010–and likely for the next decade thereafter–the Tea Party seemed to retreat. It failed in its political aim of defeating President Barack Obama in 2012, largely because of its earlier failure to find an alternative nominee to Gov. Mitt Romney. It was tarnished unfairly as racist, extremist, and–especially after the Tuscon shooting of Jan. 2011–violent, and was blamed even by some Republicans for the debt ceiling impasse in mid-2011.
Yet the Tea Party also succeeded in stopping the rapid growth of federal spending and taxation. The Tea Party ensured that there would be no bailouts for profligate states and no large-scale tax increases. Though it had to swallow the tax increases of the “fiscal cliff” deal in the early hours of 2013, it essentially preserved 98% of the Bush-era tax cuts. And by shifting the national debate in favor of deficit reduction, the Tea Party laid the foundation for the budget sequester–a set of across-the-board spending cuts that the American public has largely tolerated, even in the face of President Obama’s attempts to create panic and outrage.


The Tea Party ought to be fading into the background. The issues that the Obama administration has placed on the national agenda–immigration, gun control, and gay marriage–are thought to be ones where the Tea Party is weakest, far from the fiscal agenda that gave it early momentum and prominence. And yet the Tea Party has new momentum as an opposition force. Without articulating clear policy positions on any of these divisive issues, the Tea Party has rallied opposition nonetheless, holding the line in Congress and the states. 

The key has been the Tea Party’s continued stress on the Constitution–not just the Second Amendment, but also the fundamental principle of the rule of law, and the federalist structure that Washington has done so much in recent decades to erode. These general principles are enough of a foundation for a political stand–and broad enough to admit wide differences of opinion on the substantive underlying issues themselves. 
Recent months have proved challenging for conservatives, especially as politicians once backed by the Tea Party have begun reshaping themselves as moderates–Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) on immigration, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) on gun control, and several governors on Obamacare funding for state Medicaid expansion. Yet the Tea Party appears set for a revival–partly because of the failures of Republican national leadership, partly because of the emergence of new leaders, but largely because the country needs the opposition that it provides. 
In a system there the two parties find themselves unable to undo the worst aspects of policies in which they have often colluded, and the mainstream media no longer bother to hold Washington in check, only the Tea Party seems to have the potential to provide the spark for the country’s urgent renaissance.

Monday afternoon, CNN released a statement in response to the Republican National Committee’s (RNC) ultimatum. In a letter to both NBC and CNN, RNC Chair Reince Priebus said that the Party will not allow either network to host primary debates if they go ahead with planned projects surrounding Hillary Clinton. In its statement, CNN said they will not cancel the planned documentary and that it would be a “disservice to voters” for the RNC not to partner with them for the debates:
CNN Films, a division of CNN Worldwide, commissioned a documentary about Hillary Clinton earlier this year. It is expected to premiere in 2014 with a theatrical run prior to airing on CNN. This documentary will be a non-fiction look at the life of a former First Lady and Secretary of State. Instead of making premature decisions about a project that is in the very early stages of development and months from completion, we would encourage the members of the Republican National Committee to reserve judgment until they know more. Should they decide not to participate in debates on CNN, we would find it curious, as limiting their debate participation seems to be the ultimate disservice to voters.
As far as CNN’s claim about a “disservice to voters,” one wonders which voters CNN is talking about. Certainly not Republican voters. For years now, and for very good reason, Republican voters have seen CNN as just another branch of the Democrat Party. 


During the 2012 election, many Republicans were  infuriated and questioned the judgment of an RNC that willingly allowed our candidates to have their futures put in the hands of a network that was and is so obviously enamored with Obama and the left. It was a suicide run, when these debates should be used by the RNC to help our candidates shine.

CNN was even worse during the actual presidential debates when CNN’s Candy Crowley violated the debate rules, tried to save Barack Obama from a Mitt Romney attack, and got her facts horribly wrong. This is one of the biggest gaffes in all of presidential debate history, but this one was committed by the moderator. 
Earlier today, NBC News responded with the claim it had nothing to do with the network’s planned miniseries about Clinton, that will star Academy Award-nominee Diane Lane. 
It is unlikely that Priebus and the RNC expected either network to back down. So the news here is all good.

11097	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/08/matthews-mocks-christies-weight-wife	Opinion	1	Elections	None	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"
The Huffington Post reports that NBC’s Chris Matthews, longtime host of MSNBC’s “Hardball,” took the opportunity at an event Thursday to publicly insult New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Responding to a question with a joke, Matthews said he felt bad for Christie’s wife. The obvious insinuation is that the overweight governor crushes her during sex:   
Two days after Election Day, Chris Christie has crushed his opponent. Is he gonna be the Republican …” began McGrath.


“The one I feel for is his wife,” Matthews cut in.
After a brief pause, some chuckled as McGrath asked, “Why’s that?”
“Did you just say, ‘crush?'” Matthews said. “I mean, use your imagination.”

The crowd erupted.
This is not the first time Matthews has publicly mocked Christie’s weight:
Matthews said during a “Q & A Cafe” event two years ago with Carol Joynt, “He must be 300-plus, and that’s something he’s just gotta deal with, because you’re not going to say, ‘I’m going to cut the budget,’ well, how about starting with supper?”
In their efforts to undermine a likely GOP presidential candidate, the mainstream media have taken issue with Christie’s weight in various ways, ranging from cheap shots to scare tactics. Earlier this week, Time Magazine declared Christie the “elephant in the room” on its cover. Earlier this year, CNN’s Jim Acosta warned Americans that Christie could die in the Oval Office. 
It is also no coincidence that Politico piled on today with a “serious” piece examining Christie’s weight. 
The media love Christie when he is hugging Barack Obama and trashing conservatives. But the media also know that he is about to threaten Hillary Clinton’s ascension to the White House. By laying the groundwork with the weight issue now, the media hope to turn Christie into a national fat joke as a way to undermine his candidacy.

The actress went to explain how she determined “why women and girls end up in brothels,” telling the student audience that “baseline” it was “gender inequality.”
When Judd opened the floor up for questions, her struggles intensified. When asked by the dean of the college if she had advice for the community, Judd let the place know how wonderfully she thought of herself. “You know have no idea how much advice I have,” she said.

“I can’t wait to hear from the College Republicans,” Judd joked at another point, before any students asked her a question.
The first student questioner, a young woman who made sure to point out she was a Democrat, asked Judd to define “feminism.” Judd tackled it the best she could, after noting how “it’s really very simple.”
“We could spend the rest of the day talking about this,” Judd said. “We were all made in the image and likeness of our Creator. We’re all sacred, and we’re here to love each other and be equal. It’s very simple.”

As a second young woman wrapped up her question of Judd, the actress stopped paying attention. “Huh, I’m sorry, I was giving my mother eye kisses,” Judd said. Judd’s mother, Naomi Judd, was in the audience.
The dean was forced to re-ask the young woman’s question so Judd could answer it.
When asked about what role “faith” plays in her initiatives, Judd said “I’m just a surrogate for the people doing the grassroots work.”
“What I had to do was find a faith that would work for me under all causes and conditions,” Judd said. “In forcibly displaced persons camps, in child abuse children, in emergency rooms, in a brothel, in a labor slave camp, in an orphanage. You know how hard it is to walk out of an orphanage? My hands tingle. You feel the weight of the babies coming up behind.”
“Or to sit in a slum and see two sisters who are orphaned ask me to bring them home to America, because America is the place where dreams come true? Later I found out they rehearsed it because they so wanted to come home to America with me. That’s a depth for me, a spiritual depth.”
Another student asked her about garbage initiatives around the world. The student said she worked in India for a little while recently, and “the amount of garbage … I just could not get over it.”
“My question is how to we get anyone to care about their health when the first thing they probably need to care about is the dump of trash in front of their house or their slum, and that they don’t have running water?” the student asked Judd. “To me, that seems like the base…. I’m just wondering from what you’ve seen in your travels what your thoughts are on that.”
Judd used a homespun saying in her tortured response.
“My thought is that you found your pig,” Judd responded. “You should stick with your pig. What I mean by ‘pig’ is we all have to find the thing that makes us mad and the thing that gives us the fire in the belly and the passion and the stamina to stick with it. The ‘pig thing’ comes another good Eastern Kentuckian, my godmother. It was heavy-handed in my face.”
In trying to further explain the “pig” reference, Judd said “it became a slogan for this is ‘my thing.'” 
“It sounds like garbage has become your thing,” Judd told the student questioner. “Go with it. And I agree with you about the garbage.'”

Democrat politicians, positioning themselves to share in the spoils, are heaping endorsements on Hillary Clinton to run for President in 2016. Topping the list of lawmakers exalting the former First Lady and former Secretary of State are Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). 
Clinton has not openly declared she is running in 2016. Yet, according to political strategist Tad Devine who helped Al Gore and John Kerry in their presidential bids, “She’s the prohibitive front-runner. She’s in a stronger position than anyone seeking the nomination other than an incumbent president in the last 40 years.” Clinton’s front runner status provides “a powerful inducement for figures to offer her early support,” he further commented.


House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, hoping to regain her leadership as Speaker of the House, also shares her support for the former First Lady. Pelosi recently stated, “If she were to run, I think that she would be the candidate, and I think she’d be one of the best prepared — and she would win.”

Besides Pelosi, Reid, and Schumer clamoring to jump on the Clinton band wagon, other less influential democratic legislators are trying to clutch onto the Clinton coattails. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), is willing to forget that she suggested in 2008 former President Bill Clinton may not be a good role model and that she wouldn’t let her daughter near him. Respecting the power of the Clintons, she now boasts, “I was one of the first to do the Ready for Hillary rollout. I’ve been publicly way out there for a while.”
Needless to say, there is good reason to be lending your support to Ms. Clinton. She and husband Bill prove to be exhaustive fundraisers and help draw potential voters to the polls, including female and minority voters. All of this means positive election outcomes and greater chances for Dems to win in their individual races. Moreover, an early coronation for Hillary will avoid unnecessary in-house battles that are often damaging in presidential primaries.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on a conference call organized by Karl Rove’s Crossroads organization for large donors and their advisers on Oct. 30 that the Tea Party movement, in his view, is a “nothing but a bunch of bullies” that he plans to “punch … in the nose.”
On the call, according to a donor who was on it, McConnell personally named Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) as Tea Party conservatives he views as problematic for him. “The bulk of it was an attack on the Tea Party in general, Cruz in particular,” the source, a prominent donor, said in a phone interview with Breitbart News.
But the most memorable line came at the end of the call.


“McConnell said the Tea Party was ‘nothing but a bunch of bullies,'” the source said. “And he said ‘you know how you deal with schoolyard bullies? You punch them in the nose and that’s what we’re going to do.'”

Rove, as well as American Crossroads President and CEO Steven J. Law who also serves as the president of sister group Crossroads GPS, were also on the call. Rove “talked in a slightly gentler way, or let’s say, a more diplomatic way,” the source said. “But the message was pretty well the same: That if we’re going to save this thing, we have to back real Republicans.”
Pointing to how Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid just invoked the “nuclear option,” breaking 225-year old Senate rules to slip through President Obama’s liberal nominees, an aide to a Tea Party lawmaker said that McConnell’s focus on trying to go after the Tea Party has jeopardized Senate Republicans’ chances at actually beating Democrats. “Under Sen. McConnell’s watch, Republicans today just got rolled over by Democrats who pushed the button on the nuclear option, destroying years of well-established Senate order,” the aide said in an email to Breitbart News. “Perhaps if he focused less on destroying the Tea Party and more on defeating Democrats, he’d have more to show for his leadership.”
Rove spokesman Jonathan Collegio denies that anything was said about Cruz, Lee, or the Tea Party in general but admits the call did take place and that “some discussion” about the government shutdown and the Senate Conservatives Fund took place.
“Your source is ascribing things to the call that simply were never said,” Collegio said in an email. “There was no ‘anti-tea party donor call.’ There was a call, and there was some discussion about the government shutdown and the Senate Conservatives Fund (note this was one day after SCF launched a dishonest ad about McConnell), but nothing about the Tea Party or Sens. Cruz or Lee.”
Collegio declined to provide a transcript or recording of the call to Breitbart News. McConnell’s office has not commented on the matter.

Rasmussen Reports released a poll on Tuesday that shows Democrat Terry McAuliffe leads Republican Ken Cuccinelli by 17 points, 50% to 33%, in the race to become Virginia’s next governor. Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis is in third place with 8%. The poll of 1,000 likely Virginia voters was conducted on October 20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.
Though McAuliffe’s lead in Tuesday’s poll was significantly higher than in previous polls, it was just the latest information that confirmed the bad news Virginia Republicans have known for several months. It is clear that the Cuccinelli campaign is headed towards a disastrous outcome in November unless dramatic changes are undertaken. But, with only two weeks remaining until election day, it may be a case of too little, too late.
Conservatives and Tea Party activists have been sounding the warning bells with the consultants running the Cuccinelli campaign for months.  Given the extraordinary vulnerabilities of the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, mired as he is in dual investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Homeland Security of GreenTech Automotive, many Virginians are wondering how a candidate so beloved by the conservative base has run such a weak campaign.


McAuliffe’s campaign has succeeded in framing the election around social issues by outspending Cuccinelli at least two to one in television advertising. The pace of that outspending appears to have accelerated recently. Several Virginia residents told Breitbart News on Tuesday that Cuccinelli has been hammered mercilessly over the past several weeks with an onslaught of highly negative attack ads, while his own mild responses have been seen but not remembered.
McAuliffe has also benefited from significant spending on his behalf by outside liberal interest groups, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent endorsement.
Tea Party activists in Virginia are not surprised that the Cuccinelli campaign has performed so poorly. The problem, they believe, began when Cuccinelli hired a campaign team staffed heavily by Washington insider Republican consultants. 

That error by itself could have been overcome, but the Cuccinelli team then proceeded to give Tea Party activists and groups around the Commonwealth the cold shoulder. Eager to help Cuccinelli win by providing the power and energy of a vigorous ground game, Tea Party activists were given no opportunity to be involved in the campaign.
This fundamental strategic error drew all of the energy out of the Cuccinelli campaign, and was compounded on August 15 by Cuccinelli’s own ill-advised criticism of the grassroots for their lack of interest in volunteering for his campaign. Activists throughout the Commonwealth saw Cuccinelli’s comments as a public slap in the face, and many have subsequently washed their hands of both the candidate and the campaign team.
Rather than working with the grassroots on the development of a ground game and get-out-the-vote infrastructure, the Cuccinelli campaign has relied on television ads and press releases. Some of these press releases have been considered sophomoric by Tea Party activists. 

An “RRR” spoof poll released by the Cuccinelli campaign in late August is the most visible example of the campaign’s communications missteps. In an effort to counter the polls released by the PPP company, a well known left leaning polling firm, all of which show McAuliffe with a strong lead and Cuccinelli with high negatives, the Cuccinelli campaign has issued a series of press releases about phony polls conducted by the fake “RRR” (Republican Republican Republican) polling firm that purportedly show Cuccinelli with a significant lead.
Tea Party activists in Virginia are reluctant to publicly criticize the Cuccinelli campaign because of their loyalty and affection for Cuccinelli personally. However, they have been eager to offer suggestions to Attorney General Cuccinelli on how he can turn his campaign around. Unfortunately, few, if any of them have been able to even obtain a hearing from the Cuccinelli campaign team to communicate these views.
Larry Nordvig, Executive Director of the Richmond Tea Party, told Breitbart News last month that “conservatives are highly concerned about Obamacare, immigration, and moral decline, and are looking for reassurance and leadership in those areas. Attorney General Cuccinelli has not taken a hard stand on those issues. The net effect is that he’s not exciting his base, which dampens campaign volunteer activism. “

But for Nordvig when he spoke with Breitbart in September, “re-engaging his base” was “even more critical for Attorney General Cuccinelli.”

“Cuccinelli is not going to win the money race,” Nordvig said.  “That means he will stand, or fall, based on grassroots support. He has got to start reassuring conservatives that he will fight for their deepest-held beliefs. Oh, and it wouldn’t hurt to court the Tea Party a little more,” Nordvig added. “We’re the major component of the grassroots support he needs to win.”
Unfortunately for Cuccinelli, it is virtually impossible to mount an effective ground game on just two weeks notice. Such an effort requires months to develop an infrastructure of volunteers and systems. 
“I hate to say this,” one Virginia source told Breitbart News on Tuesday, “but unless grassroots lightning strikes in the next two weeks, get used to saying ‘Governor McAuliffe’ . . . and ‘President Clinton.’ “

An overlooked factor in the Democrats winning control of the House of Representatives in 2006 was the recruitment of middle-of-the-road, culturally conservative candidates. At the time then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel, who headed the effort, infuriated many on the left by aggressively recruiting dozens of “blue dog democrats” to challenge GOP incumbents. The effort worked, but the Democrats soon forgot the lesson. 
After Obama’s election, Democrat leaders believed they had a mandate for progressive policies. In the first two years of his term, Congress tacked far to the left, tackling cap-and-trade and ObamaCare. Corporate bailouts and billions in stimulus repelled independents. In 2010, House Democrats suffered the biggest electoral loss in history. Blue Dog Democrats, who had made up almost 25% of the Democrat caucus, were decimated. 
Obama’s reelection has apparently again convinced national Democrats they have a mandate for their progressive ideas. Obama has all but ruled out serious spending cuts and is aggressively pushing for even more tax increases. Democrats across the country are pursuing gun control legislation with a zeal that hasn’t been seen in decades. 


They are also vowing action on climate change, amnesty and a hike in the minimum wage. They are moving much further down the left-policy road than the rest of the country. 

When Democrats lost the House in 2010, they also lost hundreds of seats in state Legislatures, giving Republicans a strong hand in redistricting. As a result, to win back the House, Democrats need to win more than a dozen seats that were won by Mitt Romney last year. 
Obama’s hard tack to the left may be good for his base voters. The political fortunes’ of House Democrats are not built on his base voters, though. They need to appeal to independent, moderate voters who live in areas that lean GOP. They are building the wrong agenda for that task.

In a lecture to conservatives at the Las Vegas Country Club, Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, admitted that the selection of CNN’s Candy Crowley to moderate the second presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney in October 2012 had been a “mistake.”
Crowley stirred controversy by intervening in the town hall-style debate to support Obama’s contention that he had referred to the Sep. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi as a terrorist attack the day after it had occurred. In fact, as Crowley herself later admitted, Obama had not done so, referring only to “acts of terror” in general. In a CBS interview taped the same day, Obama declined to refer to the attack as a terrorist act, and subsequently supported a false story about a protest over an anti-Islamic video that never took place.


After Crowley backed up the president, some members of the audience burst into applause, in violation of the rules. The effect was not lost on the audience, which scored the debate as an Obama win–nor was it lost on Romney, who was sufficiently chastened that he refused to bring up the Benghazi issue again in the third presidential debate, even though that debate was specifically focused on foreign policy and national security.

Though it was likely not the only factor, or even the major factor, in Romney’s defeat, Crowley’s error slowed the new momentum that Romney had enjoyed since defeating Obama soundly in the first presidential debate. Her intervention also reinforced the media lack of interest in pursuing the Benghazi issue with the president.
Fahrenkopf, a stalwart Republican, co-chairs the Commission on Presidential Debates with Mike McCurry, who served as press secretary in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Politico’s Dylan Byers reports that the executive director of the Commission, Janet Brown, has refused to comment on Fahrenkopf’s remarks.

On a conference call with reporters Friday afternoon, Republican Ken Cuccinelli said his campaign was closing aggressively and was “positioned to shock the political world” in Tuesday’s Virginia election. Cuccinelli, who trails Democrat Terry McAuliffe in polling, said his campaign was beating their turnout and grass roots goals.
Cuccinelli stressed repeatedly that President Obama’s decision to campaign on Sunday with McAuliffe was a “great opportunity” for the Republican’s campaign. “[The Democrats] are having a rally to celebrate ObamaCare,” Cuccinelli said. He noted that he was the “first person in the country” to fight ObamaCare, referencing the fact that he was the first to file a lawsuit challenging the health care law, and welcomed the introduction of the issue into the Governor’s race. 
He dismissed the possibility that Obama’s appearance would energize Democrats to turn out for McAuliffe. He noted that McAuliffe has released very few specifics about his proposals, making it difficult to increase interest in the campaign. “Voters want to be for something,” Cuccinelli said. 


McAuliffe has maintained a steady lead in recent polling. The Democrat has been helped by a significant fundraising advantage. In recent weeks, McAuliffe has enjoyed a 3 or 4-1 advantage on the airwaves. In the closing days of the campaign, union and Democrat interest groups have poured additional resources into McAuliffe’s campaign, but additional ad spending at this stage in the campaign delivers diminishing returns. 

“We may be out raised,” Cuccinelli said. “But, we won’t be outworked.” 
Tuesday’s election is expected to have a very low turnout, certainly much lower than the turnout in 2012. The electorate in odd-years tends to be older and more conservative than in presidential years, giving the Cuccinelli campaign hope of a strong finish. 
McAuliffe certainly hopes that Obama’s campaign appearance creates enthusiasm among Democrat voters. It is just as likely, however, to galvanize the Republican and conservative base. If Cuccinelli prevails on Tuesday, it will be because conservatives returned to Republicans and opposition to ObamaCare. It’s a message that GOP leaders in DC should heed.

After the Senate Conservative Fund (SCF) endorsed Matt Bevin, the Tea Party challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), McConnell has reportedly gone on a rampage against SCF allies and the conservative candidates it has endorsed. 
Most recently, McConnell reportedly directed his anger at Nebraska conservative Senate candidate Ben Sasse, whom the SCF has endorsed in the open primary.
According to National Review, on November 12, “Sasse walked into Mitch McConnell’s office to clear the air” and let him know he never intended to oppose McConnell’s leadership, but McConnell was having none of it. The outlet notes that McConnell’s incident with Sasse in his war with SCF is “notable” because “it involves an attractive, promising candidate in an open primary as collateral damage in the intramural fight.”


Josh Holmes, McConnell’s top adviser, “privately told friends afterward it was the most uncomfortable meeting he’d been in”; Sasse reportedly turned to Holmes when he walked out of meeting and said, “That didn’t go well!”
McConnell reportedly “lit into” and grilled Sasse about “exactly when Sasse had first interacted with Matt Hoskins, the hard-charging executive director of SCF” who is “working to elect McConnell’s primary challenger.” The SCF was started by former South Carolina Senator and current Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, who feuded with McConnell because he backed candidates–like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul–that went up against McConnell’s handpicked candidates in Republican primaries.
McConnell reportedly asked Sasse about the YouTube video (embedded below) that was highlighted on the Drudge Report in September in which Sasse said it was time for “every Republican in Washington, starting with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, to show some actual leadership.”

In that video, Sasse also ripped Washington’s permanent political class, saying that elected officials are not kings and the American people are not “peasants.” He said there is not “one set of rules for the Washington elite and another for the masses” and called on McConnell to show leadership and give up his Obamacare subsidies. The outlet also reported that “the bad blood between Sasse and McConnell escalated” when Sasse met with National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) political director Ward Baker. 
McConnell, along with the Republican establishment like the NRSC, is mounting an organized effort against conservatives and Tea Partiers. For instance, McConnell, as Breitbart News reported, said he would like to punch the SCF “in the nose” on a conference call with donors of Karl Rove’s political group on October 30. McConnell has taken steps to put his words into action; National Review reported that “pressure from McConnell allies convinced SCF’s bookkeeper, Lisa Lisker, to part ways with the group,” even though “Lisker has previously worked for Republican candidates locked in tense primary elections without incident.” McConnell has been accused of “bullying” the bookkeeper. 
Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, in response to McConnell’s hostile words, told Breitbart News, “Why would Senator Mitch McConnell want to ‘punch in the nose’ the millions of patriotic moms, grandmoms and veterans who stand up for America through the Tea Party and groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund?”
“The people supporting SCF are the same people going to Tea Party meetings and rallies across the country. We elect our representatives to represent us, not to threaten us with physical violence during secret meetings with Karl Rove’s friends,” she told Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle. She added that “everything” the Tea Party said “about Obamacare turned out to be true.”
She continued, “If they’ve got so much fight in them, then where were they when we needed them to stand up and fight against Obamacare?” Martin also emphasized that the “Tea Party Patriots shares Senate Conservatives Fund’s goal of holding establishment Republicans accountable, and specifically, we shared the goal of defunding Obamacare.”
McConnell has not endorsed Sasse’s primary opponent in the race, but Sasse is being considered “collateral damage” in a fight he never wanted in McConnell’s and the Republican establishment’s broader war on conservative Tea Partiers and specifically against SCF.

Since the 2010 midterm elections, conservatives have looked to Speaker Boehner and House Republicans to provide a vanguard against Obama’s radical agenda. It has been a disheartening experience. In fairness to House Republicans, there is little one legislative chamber can do to affect the direction of the federal government. The tools they do have, however, they have often declined to use. Paul’s filibuster of the Brennan nomination on Wednesday, however, showed the emergence of a new opposition to Obama. Based in the Senate, it is providing the American public a stark contrast to Obama’s ever-expanding government. 
Paul’s filibuster was not based on a traditional partisan issue. Its goal was simply to clarify that the President did not have the authority to assassinate American citizens, on domestic soil, who are suspected of cooperating with terrorists. Such clarity ought not require a 13 hour filibuster. The event, however, exposed the public to a reasoned articulation of conservative, constitutional principles. It was a brilliant counter-point to Obama’s doctrine of expanding government power in every direction. 
On Friday, Sen. Marco Rubio joined Sen. Ted Cruz in announcing his opposition to any continuing resolution funding the government that didn’t also defund ObamaCare. House Republicans have long since given up this fight, passing a continuing resolution this week that continues to fund ObamaCare’s expansion. Sixteen House Republicans bucked their leadership and opposed the move, but enough Democrats joined Republicans to pass the measure. 


With this week’s moves, the center of political gravity has shifted to an emerging band of leaders in the Senate. Sens. Paul, Rubio, and Cruz are providing the nucleus of a new and robust conservative opposition to the Obama Administration. They will likely lose most of their battles. Unlike House Republicans, however, they understand that their primary responsibility is to articulate to the American public an alternative vision for the country. It requires one to pick an occasional battle and present one’s case to the public. 

House Republicans are obsessive about “governing,” even though they lack the levers of power to do so. They would rather put off an ideological fight on principle in order to pass legislation. This may make sense tactically, but strategically it’s a losing bet. Worse, it denies the American public a clear choice. A party ought to articulate why it should be entrusted with legislative power. 
Sens. Paul, Rubio and Cruz understand this. They are providing the tip of the spear ahead of the 2014 midterms. Based on initial responses to Paul’s filibuster this week, they will have an army behind them.

President Barack Obama’s former national field director Jeremy Bird has launched an organization with a plan to turn Texas blue for the first time in decades, Politico reports.
Bird’s new organization, “Battleground Texas,” will target Hispanic voters in the state to try to swing the Lone Star state in the direction of Democrats. Texas has for a long time been a Republican Party stronghold, and its 38 electoral college votes are crucial to any GOP presidential candidate’s run for office. If Texas becomes a battleground or Democratic Party state, Republican presidential candidates may be in dire danger. They’d have to spend time and money campaigning in the state, taking their focus off states that are already hotly contested.
Bird appears to understand this, and that’s why he’s targeting the state. “With its diversity and size, Texas should always be a battleground state where local elections are vigorously contested and anyone who wants to be our commander in chief has to compete and show they reflect Texas values. Yet for far too long, the state’s political leaders, both in Austin and in Washington, D.C., have failed to stand for Texans,” Bird told Politico. “Over the next several years, Battleground Texas will focus on expanding the electorate by registering more voters — and as importantly, by mobilizing Texans who are already registered voters but who have not been engaged in the democratic process.”


Politico quoted several anonymous Democratic consultants who said Bird plans to bring in top campaign talent and make a serious effort at competing in the state.

Republicans, on the other hand, are still regaining their footing after the beat down they endured in the last election cycle – and didn’t have a specific plan when Breitbart News asked for one.
Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told Breitbart News though that the GOP is “in the midst of the party’s winter meeting down here in Charlotte” where GOP leaders are crafting “the vision and role of the party going forward” including “specifically the ways that we can grow it and win more elections.”

President Barack Obama’s “most persistent distraction” when he launched his re-election campaign in April 2011 was not the economy, the Tea Party movement, the GOP presidential primary field, the unpopularity of Obamacare, or even the soon-to-be-launched mission to take out Osama bin laden. 
No, the most pressing issue for the president was the fact that real estate mogul Donald Trump had been challenging him over his birth certificate, according to the new book Double Down: Game Change 2012.
“[T]he most persistent distraction Obama was facing personified by Donald Trump, the real estate billionaire and reality show ringmaster who was flirting with making a presidential run under the banner of birtherism–the crackpot conspiracy theory claiming that Obama was born in Kenya and thus was constitutionally ineligible to preside as commander in chief,” authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann note in the opening chapter of the book.


While Obama–who was born in Hawaii–thought of the theory as “lunacy” and “simply mental,” in 2008 his campaign posted his short-form birth certificate online. But as 2011 rolled around, the theory, the authors note, “wouldn’t go away.”
“A recent New York Times poll had found that 45 percent of Republicans and 25 percent of voters overall believed he was foreign born,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote. “And with Trump serving as a human bullhorn, the faux controversy had escaped the confines of Fox News and conservative talk radio, reverberating in the mainstream media.”
George Stephanopoulos asked Obama about Trump’s crusade for his birth certificate twice in an interview the morning of April 14, 2011. “We’re not really worrying about conspiracy theories,” Obama said in response.

But that is not what this new book found; Halperin and Heilemann claim Obama literally spent that night in his Chicago home digging through old records to try to find some kind of proof he was born in Hawaii amid the belongings of his late mother, Ann Dunham.
After Obama made the fundraising rounds throughout Chicago, “he avoided mentioning Trump,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote, “yet the issue remained much on his mind.”
“What confounded him about the problem, beyond its absurdity, was that there was no ready solution,” they wrote. “Although Trump was braying for his original long-form birth certificate, officials in Obama’s home state were legally prohibited from releasing it on their own, and the president had no earthly idea where his family’s copy was.”
What Obama did try to do was “joke about the topic,” as he did during his final fundraiser that night at Chicago’s Navy Pier. “I grew up here in Chicago,” he said. “I wasn’t born here–I just want to be clear. I was born in Hawaii.”  
Halperin and Heilemann note that Obama spent the night in the Chicago home that he, Michelle, Sasha, and Malia left behind for the White House in early 2009. When Obama walked through the door after 10 PM, he “stayed up even later” the authors noted, “intrigued by some old boxes that had belonged to his late mother, Ann Dunham.”

While Obama’s mother died seven years earlier, Obama still had not dug through and “sorted” all of her things. “Now, alone in his old house for just the third night since he’d become president, he started rummaging through the boxes, digging, digging, until suddenly he found it: a small, four-paneled paper booklet the world had never seen before,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote. “On the front was an ink drawing of Kapi’olani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital, in Honolulu. On the back was a picture of a Hawaiian queen. On one inside were his name, his mother’s name, and his date of birth; on the other were his infant footprints.”
Obama was so pleased that he found it, he bragged about the discovery to his friend Marty Nesbitt who visited him the next day. Nesbitt, one of Obama’s best friends who bonded with the president over sports over the years, came over for breakfast the next morning. “After chatting for a while at the kitchen table, Obama went upstairs and came back down, wearing a cat-who-ate-a-whole-flock-of-canaries grin, waving the booklet in the air, and then placing it in front of Nesbitt,” the authors wrote. 
“Now that’s some funny shit,” Nesbitt said before he “burst out laughing.”
Obama was so proud he found the booklet that on the way to a scheduled interview with the Associated Press, he “pulled aside” adviser David Plouffe and press secretary Jay Carney “and eagerly showed them his discovery.”
Both Plouffe and Carney were unsure if that was, in fact, Obama’s long form birth certificate, but were hopeful that it could help them in fighting the birther conspiracy theories. As for Obama, Halperin and Heilemann noted, he “didn’t know what to think, but he flew back to Washington hoping that maybe, just maybe, he now had a stake to drive through the heart of birtherism, killing it once and for all–and slaying Trump in the bargain.”
Obama hoped this was his saving grace, as Trump’s charges had gotten so far under his skin it started consuming him. “Striding into a meeting with his senior advisers in the Oval Office the next Monday morning, he reached into his suit pocket and whipped out the booklet, infinitely pleased with himself,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote.

Republican Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad told Karl Rove to keep his new super PAC, which some conservatives believe was created to wage war on them, out of Iowa’s Republican primaries. 
“I basically told Karl Rove that what he was doing is counter-productive and he needs to stay out of it,” Branstad told the Associated Press last Friday. “If some outside group that has no connection to Iowa attacks somebody from Iowa, that is not smart.” 


After Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat, announced he would be retiring from the Senate in January, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) indicated he may be interested in pursuing the Senate seat, which has been held by a Democrat for 30 years, in 2014. 
Rove’s group promptly decided to smear King a week later, indicating he would be a Republican against whom the group would try to obliterate with negative ads in a potential Iowa GOP Senate primary. 
After Rove leaked the details of his super PAC to the New York Times, American Crossroads President Steven Law blistered King in the same publication, telling the Times the group was “concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem” and that “all of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.” These comments enraged King because they falsely implied King endorsed Akin’s views and comments about “legitimate rape,” which cost Akin Missouri’s Senate race in 2012.

“Nobody can bully me out of running,” King declared nearly a week ago, after learning of the comments. 
And Branstad agrees, noting it would be a “mistake” if Rove’s super PAC went into Iowa and started running negative attacks to tear down King in favor of another candidate backed by the establishment Republican group. 
Branstad’s comments are significant not only because he is the governor of the state that kicks off the presidential nomination process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses, but also because Branstad is a politician who has traditionally had good ties to the Republican establishment. Many outside groups, like Rove’s super PAC, are intending to use the 2014 elections as a test run for 2016. 
Branstad was not alone in criticizing Rove’s intentions. Even a longtime Rove friend and former Iowa Republican Party chairman, Richard Schwarm, told the Associated Press he felt Rove’s super PAC was a mistake.
“I think that was a total backfire on Rove’s part,” the member of the Iowa Republican political establishment said.

A Republican in California won a state Senate seat on Wednesday in a District in which Democrats have a 22-point advantage and that is 60% Hispanic.
Andy Vidak, the Republican farmer, won the special election runoff for the 16th District Senate seat when his opponent, Democrat Leticia Perez, a Kern County Supervisor, conceded on Wednesday, a day after voters cast their ballots. Vidak had 54% of the vote to Perez’s 46%.
Perez had initially conceded two months ago when the special election was held. But a recount put Vidak under the 50% threshold that was needed to avoid a runoff, and Perez took back her concession nearly a week after the initial election. The seat became vacant when the Democrat, who won the seat in 2010 by 21 points, resigned to work for Chevron. Democrats thought, especially with a Hispanic female candidate, the seat would be a shoo-in for them. The veto-proof supermajority Democrats have in the state Senate is now imperiled with Vidak’s victory.


As Breitbart News had previously reported, though, “Vidak, a working class candidate, resonated with working class Hispanics in the district who also saw how coastal California elites were not putting their bread-and-butter interests first.”

Vidak ran broadly on “the bifurcation of California: the coastal liberal elites versus the Valley folks.” On a more local level, Vidak’s theme of “fish versus farmer” resonated with Democrats in a District where the unemployment rate is 15% and as high as 30% in some communities in the District. Vidak reminded voters that liberal environmentalists, in order to protect fish, only allowed farmers to receive 20% of their water allocation, crippling the region’s economy. He also stressed that Perez supported the the state’s high-speed rail project that would have razed business, farms, and homes in the District. Because she supported the agenda of coastal elites and Democrat interest groups, Perez was able to raise twice as much money as Vidak, but 16th District voters ultimately rejected her liberal policies. 
It is often said that California is a harbinger of things to come for the country. For Republicans looking at California, there has not been much of hope of late, but Vidak’s victory could be a sign that areas that have traditionally voted for Democrats may give the right kind of Republican a chance as they see unemployment rates increase and opportunities for upward mobility decrease in their communities.

Sen. Rand Paul’s filibuster against the confirmation of CIA Director and “drone czar” John Brennan offers a “teachable moment” to the media and the left about the Tea Party. As they seethe in outrage and confusion that it took a Republican to question the constitutionality of drone attacks, it is important to remind our friends on the other side that it wasn’t just any Republican, but a–gasp!–Tea Party Republican who spoke “truth to power.”
Not only that, but the Senators who were first to offer their assistance were also Tea Party Republicans–the so-called McCarthyist Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco “Water Break” Rubio of Florida. All three of these Senators won their primary elections against candidates favored by the Republican establishment. All three have been attacked by the left and smeared as racist and extremist for belonging to the Tea Party. Yet without them, no one from either party would have questioned a policy that the left once saw as a dangerous abuse of executive power.


Only one Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, supported Paul. (Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois came to the floor very late in the game to offer a few challenging questions and formally end debate when Paul finally yielded.) Ryan Grim and Mollie Reilly of the Huffington Post observed: “…progressives who might have assumed to have been supportive were absent, leaving members of the GOP as the sole defenders of civil liberties. The White House was equally silent.” Some Democrats, notably Maxine Waters, even slammed Paul as “destructive.”

What many on the left and in the media have willfully failed to understand is that the Tea Party exists to defend the Constitution from unconstitutional encroachments on power and dangerous expansions in the size and cost of government. It did not merely arise in opposition to President Barack Obama; it had its roots in conservative outrage at the bailouts of the last months of George W. Bush’s presidency. At its core, the Tea Party is about American values, not Republican politics. It exists not to obstruct the Democrats but to restore the Constitution.
Rand Paul’s filibuster provided a useful contrast between the Tea Party and the GOP establishment. While Paul stood on the Senate floor, unable to leave the chamber to eat, a dozen other Republicans chose to dine with President Obama in a gesture of bipartisanship. (The contrast is not exact; a few Tea Party favorites attended the dinner, too, and joined Paul later in the Senate chamber.) It had already been hours since Wyden joined Paul’s protest, illustrating that true bipartisanship is forged on the basis of shared principles, not just political necessity.
Democrats and journalists like to describe the Tea Party as “hostage-takers,” holding Republican leaders and moderates in their thrall while they try to dismantle the government. But in reality it is the Washington elite that have taken the country hostage, forcing through expansions of government power and spending vast sums of money that the nation will struggle for generations to repay. The Tea Party represents the last chance to escape the zero-sum politics and economic stagnation that has plagued much of Europe for the last several years.
As Paul continued, liberals who once railed angrily against Bush were forced to confront the fecklessness of their own party. Hollywood’s John Cusack asked: “Where are the so-called progressive Democratic senators?” Meanwhile, the supposedly racist Tea Party Senator from Kentucky was leading the charge. It was not a political ploy for votes, or even an attempt to block one of President Obama’s nominees, which Paul acknowledged he would fail to do. It was just a stand on principle–which is what the Tea Party has been about all along.

An overlooked factor in the Democrats winning control of the House of Representatives in 2006 was the recruitment of middle-of-the-road, culturally conservative candidates. At the time then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel, who headed the effort, infuriated many on the left by aggressively recruiting dozens of “blue dog democrats” to challenge GOP incumbents. The effort worked, but the Democrats soon forgot the lesson. 
After Obama’s election, Democrat leaders believed they had a mandate for progressive policies. In the first two years of his term, Congress tacked far to the left, tackling cap-and-trade and ObamaCare. Corporate bailouts and billions in stimulus repelled independents. In 2010, House Democrats suffered the biggest electoral loss in history. Blue Dog Democrats, who had made up almost 25% of the Democrat caucus, were decimated. 
Obama’s reelection has apparently again convinced national Democrats they have a mandate for their progressive ideas. Obama has all but ruled out serious spending cuts and is aggressively pushing for even more tax increases. Democrats across the country are pursuing gun control legislation with a zeal that hasn’t been seen in decades. 


They are also vowing action on climate change, amnesty and a hike in the minimum wage. They are moving much further down the left-policy road than the rest of the country. 

When Democrats lost the House in 2010, they also lost hundreds of seats in state Legislatures, giving Republicans a strong hand in redistricting. As a result, to win back the House, Democrats need to win more than a dozen seats that were won by Mitt Romney last year. 
Obama’s hard tack to the left may be good for his base voters. The political fortunes’ of House Democrats are not built on his base voters, though. They need to appeal to independent, moderate voters who live in areas that lean GOP. They are building the wrong agenda for that task.

After Republican Senator Ran Paul told Secretary of State Hillary Clinton he would have removed her from that office were he president, ABC’s Terry Moran fired off this tweet:
—

Curious: What is Rand Paul’s foreign policy background? Did he serve in the military? Did he study, live, do business or charity overseas?
— Terry Moran (@TerryMoran) January 23, 2013

Translation: How dare he question the next president of the United States!
This is classic mainstream media tactical deflection. In order to take the spotlight off Hillary not reading the cables (which is why Paul criticized her) from our Libyan consulate requesting more security, Moran wants to make Paul the issue. 

You see, Paul’s question and statement of fact doesn’t matter, because Paul’s resume is more important. 
This is how the media turns an inconvenient narrative away from its own (a Democrat) and then trains its fire on whomever dares to politically damage one of its own. Libya has been a non-stop exercise in this kind of media behavior. Four Americans die under Obama’s watch, Romney dares say something, and the media makes him the story for 10 days; not the terrorist attack, the lack of security, or the subsequent administration cover up. 
Remember all the hand-wringing we saw from the elite media when someone with no foreign policy experience ran for president in 2008?
Yeah, me neither. 
Man alive, what an era the Democrats live in! No accountability, the watchdogs always have your back; and like magic, lies are turned into truth.

A government and sociology professor at Harvard writes that the Tea Party is more likely than not to “win in the end” in an age when Americans are becoming more removed from Washington and distrusting the federal government and their elected officials. 
“Tea Party forces will still win in the end,” Theda Skocpol writes, unless moderate Republicans can defeat them. Skocpol concedes that the Tea Party “will triumph just by hanging on long enough” as Americans are getting fed up by “our blatantly manipulated democracy and our permanently hobbled government.”
The article, “Why The Tea Party Isn’t Going Anywhere,” was first published in the journal Democracy, and later reprinted in The Atlantic. 


Despite the fact that Democrats, the mainstream media, and the Republican establishment again were predicting the “demise of the Tea Party” immediately after the government shutdown ended, Skocpol doesn’t believe so.
“But we have heard all this before,” she writes. “The Tea Party’s hold on the GOP persists beyond each burial ceremony.”
Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson published a book in 2011 that “showed how bottom-up and top-down forces intersect to give the Tea Party both leverage over the Republican Party and the clout to push national politics sharply to the right.”

“At the grassroots, volunteer activists formed hundreds of local Tea Parties, meeting regularly to plot public protests against the Obama Administration and place steady pressure on GOP organizations and candidates at all levels,” they found. “At least half of all GOP voters sympathize with this Tea Party upsurge.”
Though Skokpol and Williamson have their typical biases and describe the Tea Party movement as a “radical” one that may not like minorities–without any evidence of that assertion–they acknowledge that “even though there is no one center of Tea Party authority–indeed, in some ways because there is no one organized center–the entire gaggle of grassroots” and outside groups that support the movement “wields money and primary votes to exert powerful pressure on Republican officeholders and candidates.”
Skocpol observes that the “Tea Party clout has grown in Washington and state capitals” because “Americans are also losing ever more faith in the federal government.” In addition, “most legislators and candidates are Nervous Nellies,” and they have seen the Tea Party defeat establishment Republicans like Charlie Crist in Florida in 2010 and David Dewhurst in Texas in 2012 in addition to knocking off incumbent Republican Sens. Bob Bennett (R-UT) and Richard Lugar (R-IN). 
“That grabs legislators’ attention and results in either enthusiastic support for, or acquiescence to, obstructive tactics,” Skocpol writes. 
She writes how powerfully someone like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) resonates with the Tea Party. She noted that he was able to direct House Republicans to pressure House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) to demand that President Barack Obama and Democrats fund the government except for Obamacare. 

Skocpol notes that it will not be easy to defeat the Tea Party. 
“For one, at least three successive national election defeats will be necessary to even begin to break the determination and leverage of Tea Party adherents,” Skocpol writes. She concedes that Tea Partiers will not “stand down easily or very soon.”
Skocpol notes “moderate Republicans” do not have as much power in Washington or in state capitals and points to Cruz as being “very well positioned to garner unified Tea Party support in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries.” The Chamber of Commerce will reportedly spend $50 million to wage war against the Tea Party, along with Karl Rove’s American Crossroads; Skocpol believes unless those groups defeat the Tea Party, it may well win many permanent victories.
“During the last election cycle, no far-right candidate ever consolidated sustained grassroots Tea Party support, as those voters hopped from Rick Perry to Herman Cain to Newt Gingrich to Rick Santorum,” Skocpol writes. “But this time, Cruz may very well enjoy unified and enthusiastic grassroots Tea Party support from the beginning of the primary election season.”
Skocpol also sends a warning to Democrats who think that the Tea Party will fade because of a few bad polls. 
“Once the October 2013 shutdown ended in supposed total victory for President Obama and his party, many Democrats adopted a cocky swagger and started talking about ousting the House GOP in 2014,” Skocpol writes. However, she warns that “a clear-eyed look shows that Tea Party remains powerful and has achieved victories that continue to stymie” Democrats and their statist agenda.

It is worth noting that in most of the serious political crises during (or, more accurately, fomented by) the Obama administration, President Barack Obama has done nothing to reach agreements, and much to destroy them. Dealmaking comes down–alarmingly!–to Vice President Joe Biden’s intercessions.
Now there’s an additional reason to question President Obama’s leadership–and competence to hold office: he apparently thinks that he never tried to get media attention as a first-term U.S. Senator–not like that evil, self-interested Ted Cruz. He also, he says, never voted to shut down the government (never mind that vote against the debt ceiling, which even his spokespeople have admitted was a “political” gambit).


How utterly crazy is the president’s claim? He may have kept a low legislative profile in the Senate, where he barely showed up for work, but he was constantly the center of media attention–and made himself so. He led the left’s opposition to the Bush administration, for instance–and the centrist Clinton faction. He wrote The Audacity of Hope–a bestseller, and one that involved much media promotion, of course.

Then there was the whole running for president in his first term thing. Even before the campaign, Obama was making the media rounds, even appearing on a commercial during Monday Night Football in 2006 to tease the media’s appetite for his political ambitions. It doesn’t get much more self-promoting than this:


In fact, all Barack Obama was as a first-term U.S. Senator was a media sensation–the biggest ever. And it’s pretty much all he’s been since, judged by his lack of interest in doing his actual job. To insist otherwise, you’ve really got to be cracked. I never thought I’d say this, but maybe he should step down for Uncle Joe.
In response to Obama’s shutdown war on the American people intensifies:

Last November, President Obama won a narrow reelection and the Democrats in the Senate added two seats to their caucus. A few high-profile Republicans lost their races. The outcome has prompted the usual round of hand-wringing from the media, pundits and national GOP Leaders about the future of the party. A deeper look at the election results, however, paints a more complicated picture. Democrats may want to conduct their own hand-wringing about the future of their party. 
Although it lost the Presidency, the Republicans picked up a large number of victories in November. They gained a Governorship and solidified their gains from 2010 in the House and in the states. The GOP now has 30 Governors, a record in modern political history. They control all levers of state government in 25 states. One would have to go back to the 1920s to find the GOP so ascendant in the states. The Democrats have complete control in just 12 states, an historic low. (The rest of the states have split control.) 
GOP strength in the states isn’t confined just to the South or the Plains. They control the Governor and Legislature in industrial heartland states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana, as well. While Governor’s races in these states will always be competitive, redistricting should ensure that the GOP will dominate the legislatures in these states for the next decade. 


This isn’t just a numbers game. The polarization in the states gives each party an opportunity to enact large parts of their respective agendas. Republicans in several states are embracing this chance. Several states are looking at comprehensive overhauls of their tax codes. Republicans are looking at reforms throughout state government, from the budget, education and business regulation. 

Democrats, meanwhile, made strong gains in the states where they hold control. The party won a supermajority in the California and Illinois legislatures, for example. Progressives in these states will feel emboldened to pursue their agenda of higher taxes on the wealthy and business, and increased social spending. In many places, they will pursue stricter gun control and new environmental regulations. 
The public is about to benefit from a real-time experiment in whose policies are better suited to encourage economic growth. The likely Democrat lurch to the left in several states could tarnish the party’s brand in large parts of the country. Successful Republican governance in the states, by contrast, could repair some of the damage done to the GOP’s brand in national politics. 
The national GOP does face challenges. National party leaders are engaged in an existential crisis over the right amount of “conservative” or “moderate” positions. They seem largely disengaged from the party’s base supporters and activists. 
That said, Democrats are on a path to disengage them from large segments of the public. Combining this with the national Dem push to raise taxes and enact gun control, among other issues, will make it difficult for Democrats to remain competitive in large parts of the country. This will create an enormous opportunity for the national GOP to fix its brand. 
It shouldn’t look to machinations on Capitol Hill for salvation. It should look to the states.

11461	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/24/Club-for-Growth-Interview	News	0	Elections	None	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"
Chris Chocola, the president of the Club for Growth, told Breitbart News this weekend that establishment Republicans who have no qualms about growing the size of government and benefit from it find the fiscally conservative group to be a nuisance because the Club aggressively identifies conservatives and backs them in Republican primaries. 
And when candidates the Club for Growth supports come to Washington, they often do not just “go along to get along,” especially when it comes to matters regarding taxes and spending. 


Case in point: Ted Cruz. 
In 2012, establishment Republicans like Karl Rove and American Crossroads preferred Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst over Ted Cruz in the Texas Republican Senate primary, with their donors backing Dewhurst against Cruz. It was the Club for Growth that helped Cruz counter the Rove-approved establishment money that was going to Dewhurst’s campaign in addition to Dewhurst’s considerable wealth, which he used to self-fund his failed Senate run. The Club for Growth spent $5.5 million in independent expenditure ads to support Cruz in his fight against Dewhurst. The group accounted for 83% of all pro-Cruz outside spending.
While Sarah Palin’s endorsement of Cruz ultimately got the attention of and galvanized Tea Partiers and conservatives to ensure Cruz got into the runoff against Dewhurst, the Club for Growth’s money ensured Cruz could stay on the air against Dewhurst in Texas’s huge and expensive media markets.

Rove, in stark contrast, said on Fox News’ “Hannity” after Cruz won the primary that Texas had “three good candidates” in that race, meaning Rove, unlike the Club for Growth, would have been perfectly content with the more moderate candidates like Dewhurst who would not fight in Washington, D.C. 
Last year, the group emphasized that it committed “to do everything within our power to ensure Cruz won the primary” and “went all in and it did so because it is absolutely critical to the future of our nation that we have a true fiscal conservative representing the state of Texas in the United States Senate.” 
And that’s exactly what Cruz has done since arriving in Washington, D.C., voting against John Kerry to be the next Secretary of State and fiercely questioning President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel to the point where liberals have resorted to calling him a “McCarthyite.”
Chocola noted the Republican establishment often views the types of candidates the Club for Growth supports as “threats to the big-government status quo” that Republicans often help enable. 
Chocola added that in part because of the group’s efforts, those in Congress are talking about “spending less money, not simply slowing the rate of growth of spending.”

The full interview with Chocola is below.
Breitbart News: Given the success of Club for Growth in supporting free market principles, policies and candidates, what do you make of the attacks–often behind closed doors–by establishment figures like Karl Rove and Haley Barbour regarding your involvement in Republican primaries?
Chris Chocola: We’re not surprised at all. The Republican establishment has always viewed the types of candidates supported by our PAC as threats to the big-government status quo that the GOP often helps enable. We’ll continue to support candidates like Ted Cruz, Pat Toomey and Marco Rubio. They’ll continue to support candidates like David Dewhurst, Arlen Specter, and Charlie Crist. It’s that simple.
Breitbart News: What are Club for Growth’s key objectives for 2013?
Chris Chocola: We want to continue to grow the pro-growth caucus by supporting strong, fiscally conservative candidates through our PAC. We are hoping that the candidates the PAC has helped elect are helping to drive the agenda within the Republican Party. We’ll be watching closely to see if Republicans stand strong on sequestration and the continuing resolution. We’ll be urging them to cut spending and put us on a path to a balanced budget within 10 years. The whole purpose of the Club for Growth is to encourage policies that lead to a high-growth economy, and we’re very concerned that our growing debt burden and uncertainty about our economic future is holding us back. All we’ve ever wanted from Congress is responsible behavior, and we think that message is beginning to percolate throughout capitol hill. For the first time in a long time, members of Congress are talking about spending less money, not simply slowing the rate of growth of spending. That’s a sea-change, and we’re looking to build on that momentum.
Breitbart News: When you look at specific policy proposals–such as those dealing with the debt ceiling, the deficit, the fiscal cliff, and federal spending in general–do you think the Club is winning the war of war of ideas among the Republicans on Capitol Hill.
Chris Chocola: We take pride in our ability to advocate for free markets and limited government, but it’s really the new members we’ve helped elect through our PAC that are driving policy. It’s because of members of Congress like Jeff Flake and Pat Toomey that earmarks are banned. It’s because of members like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Mike Lee that the culture of the Senate is beginning to change. We supported those members and others because of what they believe, and they will stand and fight for their principles. Our goal is to get a majority of the majority. We’re not there yet, but the changes that have happened within the Republican Party on policy over the past decade because of the Club for Growth  and its members is undeniably positive.

A new poll from NBC New York and Marist College says that disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY), who lied to the American public about tweeting pictures of his junk to random women around the country, is now running a hard second in a potential mayoral matchup. Christine Quinn, the current Speaker of the House in New York, runs first with 26 percent of the vote; Weiner follows with 15 percent. While Nate Silver of the New York Times suggests that this number is actually limp for Weiner, given his 100 percent name recognition, it still gives him a leg up on the rest of the crowd.

It’s no coincidence that Weiner is now preparing to get on his hands and knees before the public in New York. As USA Today reports, Weiner says “I think I’ll be spending a lot of time, here on out, saying I’m sorry.” 

Weiner and his wife Huma are plastered on the new cover of the New York Times Magazine. He still refuses to answer questions about his tweet scandal. But it’s clear he understands he’s got to get the monkey of the story off his back, or he’ll take a spanking at the ballot box. He says, “I have been excruciatingly honest, in letter by letter, detail by detail, with my wife. An embarrassing amount is in the public domain … But out of respect for the idea that I’ve laid it all out for her and out of some respect for the privacy of the people who were at the other end of these correspondences, who had their lives turned upside down, I am not going to go into the details of every bit of it.”

Respect for his own possible mayoral run is more like it. He’s relying on his new book, Keys to the City, to carry him to victory. According to Weiner, the penis apparently mightier than the rhetorical sword.

State Representative Joe Carr announced on Ralph Bristol’s Nashville talk radio program on Tuesday that he is a candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. Carr will compete against incumbent Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) in the party’s August 2014 primary. Bristol had promised his listeners on Monday that someone would make a “major announcement” that will “alter the Tennessee political landscape,” and at 7:10 in the morning Joe Carr delivered on that promise.
“I am announcing as a candidate for the United State Senate,” Carr told Bristol.


Carr left no doubt with whom he will stand in the Senate. “Conservatives deserve a clear voice in this election, and conservative champions like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul need a strong ally from Tennessee in the US Senate.” Carr told Bristol.
In a statement released by the campaign as he announced on Bristol’s program, Carr said, “I will advance the conservative movement in Washington. I will fight for the Constitution and the first principles that made our country great: personal responsibility, individual liberty, and limited government. I will stand firm in defense of the 2nd amendment and insure that life of the unborn have a strong and vocal advocate.”
Carr blasted incumbent Republican Senator Lamar Alexander’s voting record. “Lamar Alexander has failed to advance the conservative movement and change Washington,” he charged, then hit the 73 year old Alexander on three main issues. “He voted for amnesty for 11 million illegals, supported funding Obamacare and rubber stamped Obama’s appointments to cabinet level positions and the Supreme Court. Voting with President Obama 62% of the time is unacceptable.”


A Triton Poll released on Sunday in an exclusive Breitbart story showed that Senator Alexander trails a generic “credible conservative” challenger by 5 points, 49% to 44%. Carr’s announcement on Tuesday puts an established name and face to that challenger for the first time. Bristol asked Carr if the results of that poll influenced his decision to challenge Alexander. “It confirmed what we knew. Lamar is popular, but there is a disconnect between the way he votes and what Tennesseans want.”
“If Lamar Alexander is voting with Barack Hussein Obama 62% of the time, he’s voting against Tennesseans 62% of the time,” Carr told Bristol.
As a state representative, where he is the co-founder of the Tenth Amendment Caucus, Carr has gained a reputation as a conservative firebrand. He is expected to join announced candidate Brenda Lenard and potential candidate Kevin Kookogey at an August 31 BEAT LAMAR Forum in Nashville.
Well respected conservative businessman Lee Beaman, who owns several large automobile dealerships in Middle Tennessee, will be Carr’s state campaign chairman. In a statement released by the campaign as Carr announced, Beaman said that “from the beginning, several of us . . . urged Rep. Carr to run for the US Senate. He led the fight to curb illegal immigration, abolish the death tax and protect the 2nd amendment, and we know he’ll lead from the front and change Washington.”

Before announcing for the Senate, Carr withdrew from the Fourth Congressional District race. With Carr’s departure from that race, incumbent Republican Congressman Scott Desjarlais, first elected in 2010 but beset by personal issues and weak fundraising, now faces only one major challenger, State Senator Jim Tracy. Carr currently represents a Rutherford County district in the Tennessee General Assembly.
Carr noted that his move to the Senate race is in response to widespread support for his own challenge to Senator Alexander. “Since I first announced my congressional exploratory committee eight months ago I have received literally hundreds and hundreds of requests from Tennesseans asking me to run for the US Senate instead of the US House. Tennesseans are hungry for strong, principled, conservative leadership, so I am answering the call.”
Carr sounded like a man prepared for a long and tough political battle. “I have no illusions. This is David versus Goliath. But I have extraordinary faith in my fellow Tennesseans. They will see through the spin and the rhetoric and recognize they have a clear choice to elect a conservative fighter. I will work tirelessly, and I will give my all for Tennessee.”
Carr enters the Senate race able to use the $275,000 he has in his Congressional campaign committee. With Beaman and other conservative Tennessee donors backing him, Carr is positioned to raise enough money to mount a serious challenge to the well financed Alexander.
Carr’s in-studio announcement on Bristol’s program was the first time in Tennessee political history that a major politician announced their candidacy for the United States Senate on a talk radio program. 
Rep. Carr, a 1981 graduate of Middle Tennessee State University, is a business consultant who helps companies become more energy efficient. Additionally, he and his wife Ginny own and operate Cedar Snag Farms in Lascassas.?He was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 2008 and currently serves as Chairman of the Local Government subcommittee. He is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, a member of the National Federation of Independent Business, Tennessee Right to Life, Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce and the MTSU Blue Raider Athletic Association. He is also an accomplished private pilot and member of the Aircraft Owners & Pilot Association.

Arizona is once again embroiled in a fight against the federal government at the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court heard arguments on Mar. 18 in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona.
In earlier years people had to go to their county seat of government–typically the county courthouse–to register to vote in a system that made it very difficult to commit voter registration fraud. A federal commission is authorized by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA, or “Motor Voter”), which was pushed and signed by Bill Clinton, to develop a federal form for mail-in registration. 


Arizona passed a law requiring people registering to vote by mail to include proof of citizenship. It was designed as a modest attempt to prevent illegal voting by foreigners that could undermine the legitimacy of the election returns in the democratic process. 
The record in this case includes over 200 people who had submitted fraudulent voter registrations, who later swore under oath to a commission investigating this matter that they were not even U.S. citizens. They say workers from groups like the now-defunct ACORN–who were getting paid for each registration form they turned in–talked them into signing it, and that these individuals did not know it was a crime for them to do so. 
NVRA requires states to “accept and use” the federal form. Arizona argues it accepts and uses the form, and that adding the requirement for someone to attach proof of citizenship is allowed. The plaintiffs and the Obama administration argue that if you add anything to the federal requirements, you are not accepting and using the federal form. This case will turn in part on which side the justices take on that issue. 

Usually when federal law conflicts with state law, it is resolved under the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution, whereby federal law trumps state law under certain circumstances. Instead of the Supremacy Clause, this case will be decided under the Elections Clause in Article I of the Constitution. That provision says that states are primarily in charge of voting and elections, but “Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations …” 
There is a large body of Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Supremacy Clause. This case may turn on whether the Elections Clause works by the same rules, or instead if there is a different framework that determines when federal election law trumps state election law.
It is unclear which way this case will go, with some justices sending signals one way or the other. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, “Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled. And it was to be [signing the form where you declare you are a citizen, under] penalty of perjury.” She added she understands NVRA as saying, “each state must accept and use the federal form, period. That’s the end of it.” 
Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to fault Arizona for not making certain claims earlier in the litigation. But Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne explained that this lawsuit began under his predecessor Terry Goddard, who is a Democrat, and that Horne did not know why Goddard did not think to use a different strategy. 
Scalia also seemed sympathetic to Arizona’s argument. For example, he remarked that the federal form requires nothing to show the individual is a citizen except, “check off, ‘I am a citizen,’ right? So it’s under oath. Big deal. If you’re willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose you’re willing to violate the perjury laws.”
Going into yesterday’s argument it was possible that two justices, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, were swing votes in this case. We should find out by late June which side prevailed.

11516	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/25/Republican-Establishment-Signals-Primary-War-Against-Utah-Tea-Party-Senator-Mike-Lee	News	0	Elections	None	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"

On Tuesday, 79-year old Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), now serving his seventh term in the Senate, signaled that he and other members of the Republican establishment are likely to encourage a primary challenge to first term Senator Mike Lee (R-UT).
Lee upset former Senator Robert Bennett (R-UT) in the 2010 Utah Republican primary convention in the Tea Party’s first major primary win over a Republican establishment politician.
Hatch told the Deseret News and KSL NewsRadio that “[i]t’s time now… for Lee and other tea party Republicans to be ‘rehabilitated’ for refusing to pass a budget bill needed to keep the government operating unless money for the act better known as Obamacare was removed.”


Hatch pointedly refused to endorse Lee for re-election to the Senate in 2016. “I’m not going to get into endorsements at this point in any way,” he said.
Hatch also criticized Lee’s tactics in the Senate. “The tactics were not the right tactics. It takes experience sometimes to make sure you can use the right tactics,” he stated.
Former Utah Governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman has also joined the establishment crowd attacking Lee. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Huntsman “said Lee has bucked a trend of senators who work to grow this small state in a way that makes people proud.” According to Huntsman, in Utah “[y]ou don’t have ideological wack-jobs… For all of its labeling as a red state, underneath it all Utah is a pretty pragmatic Western state, a just-get-it-done ethos.”

Spencer Zwick, a Utah resident who was a key member of Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign’s leadership team, also criticized Lee. “Business leaders that I talk to, many of whom supported him, would never support his reelection and in fact will work against him, myself included,” Zwick told the Post. According to Zwick, Lee is just a “showhorse.”
Zions Bank President A. Scott Anderson, a major Republican donor in Utah, said, “I think people admire him for sticking to his guns and principles, but I think there are growing frustrations… If things are to happen, you can’t just stick to your principles. You have to make things work… You’ve got to be practical.”
The Post reported that a potential Republican establishment challenger to Lee has already surfaced in “Thomas Wright, who stepped down this spring as chairman of the Utah Republican Party.” According to the Post, “Wright said he is considering running against Lee in 2016 because he has grown ‘exasperated’ with the junior senator’s governing style.”
Touching on an often used Republican establishment theme, Wright said, “I want to work with people to get things done. I want to go be a leader and build bridges, not burn them down.”
If early signs from Utah are any indication, the entire Republican establishment is looking to burn down every bridge to the Tea Party movement around the country in the 2014 primaries.

Journalists and professional political tacticians in Washington’s permanent political class ecosystem apparently do not believe the mainstream media would be better served if they had more reporters who were familiar with conservative politics and voters. 
After the 2012 presidential election, CNN reporter Peter Hamby interviewed over 70 “journalists and political tacticians” that make up a “who’s who” of the Washington permanent political class for ideas on new election beats and how presidential elections may better be covered. He published his findings in a paper for Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, titled, “Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus? Searching for a better way to cover a campaign.” 
The paper, by primarily examining Mitt Romney’s failed 2012 presidential campaign and the media coverage of it, extensively examines and lays out the new terrain on which modern political battles are contested. It looks at how the the “digital firehouse of information,” especially Twitter, “is being channeled by a new generation of campaign journalists, and how political decision makers are adjusting their tactics, because there is no turning back.”


On Monday, Politico’s Playbook picked out some of the reporters and tacticians quoted in Hamby’s paper and listed them in its morning e-mail, which has been likened to a camp newsletter: 
David Axelrod, Stuart Stevens, Matt Rhoades, Eric Fehrnstrom, Adam Nagourney, John Harris, Dick Stevenson, Marcus Brauchli, Dan Balz, Jeff Zeleny, Jonathan Martin, Mo Elleithee, Phil Rucker, Garrett Haake, Tommy Vietor, Ben LaBolt, Lis Smith, Stephanie Cutter, Chuck Todd, Karen Hughes, Joe Klein, David Carr, Jon Ward, Tim Miller, Scott Conroy, Maggie Haberman, Reid Epstein, Nancy Gibbs, Sasha Issenberg, John Dickerson, Jim Acosta, John Berman, Rachel Streitfeld, Mike Murphy, Kevin Madden, Rick Gorka, Peter Alexander, Sarah Boxer, Will Ritter, Maeve Reston, Michael Feldman, Tim Pearson, Rob Lockwood, Ashley Parker, Kasie Hunt, Ryan Williams, Paul West, Michael Calderone, Zeke Miller, Ben Smith, Dave Weigel, Matt Viser, Chris Rowland, Liz Sidoti, Sam Youngman, Shushannah Walshe, Jeff Smith, Carl Cameron, Jake Suski, Robert Costa, Jackie Kucinich, Sara Murray, Jim Heath
As Hamby reported in his groundbreaking examination of Twitter’s importance in campaigns, Romney and Obama campaign officials during the 2012 race were in amazement that younger mainstream media reporters who were fluent in the medium were hardly so in politics. Obama and Romney officials told Hamby they were incredulous that reporters on the campaign could not recognize Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson. 
Many of those Hamby interviewed for his research (listed above) would surely be familiar with Reed and Robertson, for they too are institutional figures. But they may be less familiar with shows conservatives watch like Duck Dynasty; churches they attend; politicians that influence them like Sarah Palin; the guns they like to shoot and need for self-protection; the books (Liberty and Tyranny, The Liberty Amendments) and websites they like to read; and the talk radio hosts (Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin) to whom they listen.

Hamby’s reporting about Reed and Robertson also underscores a broader problem with the mainstream media and those allowed into their ranks. Though the mainstream media often bemoan the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in America’s institutions–even though studies have shown they are guilty of the same–not much is said about the lack the ideological diversity in mainstream media organizations. Such diversity is needed to more critically report on politics and challenge and correct insular assumptions and stereotypes about conservatives. 
While those reporters in question may not have known who Reed and Robertson were, it is safe to assume that there is a greater chance they would have known Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards and Jesse Jackson.
In February of 2013, Gallup found that conservatives make up a plurality of the country. Other surveys by Gallup and Pew in recent years have found the Republican party has gotten more conservative and Republicans want it to be even more so, something the mainstream press should consider as they attempt to fairly cover the 2016 GOP presidential primary. In the 2016 primary, Republicans may be pulled to the right as Democrats were pulled to the left during a 2008 primary in which the liberal base was as antagonistically opposed to President George W. Bush and his war in Iraq as conservatives are to Obama and his policies. 
Some of the suggestions for better campaign coverage that were offered to Hamby are worth noting for serious consideration:


“voter contact”–studying how campaigns actually reach out to voters and the emerging science behind it.
“media tactics”– “As campaigns increasingly seek ways to make end-runs around the Washington media filter, reporters should track their activities in niche media platforms, on radio, on the web or in social networks,” Hamby writes. “Where, how and why? Is a campaign pushing their message in a popular video game, on Pandora radio, on the Big Ten Network? In the pages of Us Weekly or the Spanish-speaking press? What local TV stations are top targets for campaign advertising?”
“Downballot races”: Hamby suggests finding “a few contests in swing-y House or Senate districts on the state level– races that are barely covered anymore, even by local media, despite the colorful characters involved–and check in every few weeks.”
“Political science”: Hamby writes that reporters should pay attention to the academics that “are publishing smart, counterintuitive work or documenting trends that often go unnoticed in the press” instead of political scientists who seek to get quoted in every publication and mistake quantity for quality. 



Others solutions included: “The money trail and the political industry,” which would study where the massive amount of money that is raised is actually spent and some of the shadier ways political influence is purchased; a focus on better reporting and interpreting polling; and a focus on “Political movements, new and old.” Hamby also suggested sending reporters to cover states–instead of specific candidates–to play “zone defense” like CNN did in 2008 in states like South Carolina, or hiring local reporters or bloggers in key primary states who know the terrain well.
Perhaps Hamby, who gained respect for being one of the few mainstream reporters who has covered Sarah Palin fairly, had a blind spot to some suggestions that were not being offered or assumed his fellow denizens in Washington’s political ecosystem understand and give conservatives a fair shake. 
Consider what former Washington Post editor Marcus Brauchli told Hamby, though. Brauchli said that he did not think “the media did a terrific job of explaining Obama and his presidency”–and perhaps that was so because the same reporters that have difficulties understanding conservatives also are unable to critically report on Obama. 

Ultimately, the suggestions Hamby puts forth for better campaign coverage may not be worth that much in the long run without reporters, producers, and editors who have the knowledge and life experiences to cover an electorate that greatly influences one party’s primary and makes up a plurality of the nation. The closest anyone came to touching upon this in the study was Sasha Issenberg of Slate, who observed that the New York Times did not have a gun-culture beat reporter. 
At the very least, reporters should have a genuine curiosity that enables them to learn and challenge their assumptions about an electorate and parts of the country with which they may not be familiar–that is a trait the late David Broder, who is mentioned with reverence in Hamby’s report, had in spades.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the GOP’s most recent vice presidential candidate, finished with a combined total of less than 10 percent of the vote in the Family Research Council (FRC) Values Voter Summit straw poll.
Rubio finished in fifth place with 5 percent of the vote, while Ryan finished in sixth place with 4 percent of the vote. The three biggest issues for the 762 straw poll voters were religious liberty, life, and Obamacare.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) finished overwhelmingly in first place, taking in 42 percent of the straw poll’s vote. Dr. Ben Carson, an ardent opponent of Obamacare, and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, a social conservative, finished tied for second place with 13 percent of the vote each.


Rubio has taken a beating among the GOP’s rank-and-file voters for his stance on immigration reform and continues to be unable to return to the top tier of conservative leaders. Ryan, who also supports comprehensive immigration reform, has recently become the face of the GOP establishment’s willingness to surrender to President Barack Obama on Obamacare and the ongoing fiscal fights over both the budget and the debt ceiling.
A high-ranking conservative Capitol Hill staffer told Breitbart News that Ryan’s fiscal stances seem to be out-of-step with the values of conservatives. “I don’t think he did himself any good by his latest proposal, mostly proved himself to be out of touch with the current trend,” the staffer said in an email. “We are hoping the majority of the majority will enjoy being on the right side.”
When FRC Action president Tony Perkins was asked by Breitbart News what he thought of Ryan’s performance in the straw poll, Perkins said, “He wasn’t here personally. Clearly, I think it helps if you’re here and able to speak. Now, he did speak via video, but I just think the competition is steep. We had really, really great speeches by some really great leaders. It’s hard to compete with that by video message so that’s what I would attribute it to.”

Ryan had previously stated he would join the summit but ended up sending in a video speech in order to attend negotiations with the White House instead.
Perkins also said he thinks the ongoing fiscal negotiations that Ryan is leading on behalf of House Republicans “factors in quite significantly.”
“As I was just talking with Ted Cruz to call him to give him the results of the polling, and I do that every year, I will call the individual and give them a heads-up on who wins the straw poll, and so I called and talked to Ted,” Perkins said. “He was very encouraged by the response he received here and very surprised and excited to hear the results that he won the straw poll. It simply served to encourage him and bolster him in the stand that he is taking, that he is representing and defending the families of this country that will be negatively impacted by Obamacare and keeping his word to voters that he would come here to repeal Obamacare.”
“So I think it says that those base voters are not only not punching those who are doing what they said they were going to do, but rewarding them for doing so,” Perkins said.
Perkins added he does not think immigration “divides the social conservative voters as much as some would like it to.”

“There certainly are differences in opinion of how we address it and how we approach it, but I do not think that in my numerous conversations regarding this issue that it divides social conservatives as much as some think,” Perkins said. “I think this [straw poll] is more a reflection of who has been out front on one of the most pressing issues; as I mentioned, Obamacare finished at the top three of our issues. Religious liberty was at the very top, which Obamacare is a direct assault on.” 
“Who’s been leading the charge on that? And that answer would be Ted Cruz,” he stated.
Cruz also helped lead the charge, along with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), in the U.S. Senate against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill and remains opposed to any pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in America.
Perkins added that this straw poll shows the GOP establishment must begin representing populist ideas of what the conservative base wants. “That [the establishment] is the same mindset that brought us the results in 2008 and 2012,” Perkins said. “These issues that the vast majority of the Republican voting base care about were ignored.” 
“The numbers, and I’ve seen the analysis of the 2012 election specifically, the post-election analysis, and the Republicans said this is where they’re going and they wanted to reach the middle and they did, but they stepped over the base,” he explained. “What you’re seeing here consistently is the president is mobilizing and exciting his base on many of these issues and in many of these elections the Republicans have not. They’ve not been able to do that.”

It is worth noting that in most of the serious political crises during (or, more accurately, fomented by) the Obama administration, President Barack Obama has done nothing to reach agreements, and much to destroy them. Dealmaking comes down–alarmingly!–to Vice President Joe Biden’s intercessions.
Now there’s an additional reason to question President Obama’s leadership–and competence to hold office: he apparently thinks that he never tried to get media attention as a first-term U.S. Senator–not like that evil, self-interested Ted Cruz. He also, he says, never voted to shut down the government (never mind that vote against the debt ceiling, which even his spokespeople have admitted was a “political” gambit).


How utterly crazy is the president’s claim? He may have kept a low legislative profile in the Senate, where he barely showed up for work, but he was constantly the center of media attention–and made himself so. He led the left’s opposition to the Bush administration, for instance–and the centrist Clinton faction. He wrote The Audacity of Hope–a bestseller, and one that involved much media promotion, of course.

Then there was the whole running for president in his first term thing. Even before the campaign, Obama was making the media rounds, even appearing on a commercial during Monday Night Football in 2006 to tease the media’s appetite for his political ambitions. It doesn’t get much more self-promoting than this:


In fact, all Barack Obama was as a first-term U.S. Senator was a media sensation–the biggest ever. And it’s pretty much all he’s been since, judged by his lack of interest in doing his actual job. To insist otherwise, you’ve really got to be cracked. I never thought I’d say this, but maybe he should step down for Uncle Joe.
In response to Obama’s shutdown war on the American people intensifies:

Tuesday’s remarks by new Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Mike Shields seen as critical of conservative grassroots activists have not been well received by either the icons of the conservative movement or local grassroots leaders.
Despite efforts by RNC spokesperson Sean Spicer to walk those comments back, local conservative grassroots leaders–almost all of whom have been working hard for over four years with no compensation–remain unimpressed.
Ben Cunningham, founder of the Nashville Tea Party and one of the leaders of the decade earlier Tennessee Tax Revolt, told Breitbart News that “we are not about to be led by a bunch of timid Washington, D.C. Brahmins who are interested in making a buck off of people they see as naive. Either join us in the fight or get the hell out of the way.”


Cunningham added that “the problem for Washington, D.C.-based Republican consultants is they have become almost completely detached from the passion and purpose of the grassroots. To the grassroots Tea Party activist,” Cunningham continued,  “the future of the country is at stake and they immediately distrust ‘consultants’ who feel uneasy about manifesting their passion and fighting for the cause. Tea Party activists have been demonized and vilified and called every name in the book by liberals for four years and it has only made us stronger and more determined than ever.”

Zan Green, founder of the Rainy Day Patriots, a local tea party in Birmingham, Alabama organized in February 2009, echoed Cunningham’s sentiments. “The RNC is welcome to join ‘We The People’ in our self funded, personal-time-spent efforts to restore our republic. We could use some team players and there is always room for more boots on the ground.” 
Eric Olsen, co-founder of the 5,000 member Montana Shrugged Teaparty Patriots of Billings, Montana, told Breitbart News that “I take exception to all the reports coming from the Republican old guard.  They do not realize it, but they are losing their base with such remarks.”  
According to Olsen “the GOP should totally embrace the teaparty/grassroots followers as it is to their best interest.  But they lack the political will to do so.  Instead they demean the success of the movement.  They purposely went out of their way last election cycle to disenfranchise the tea party, libertarian and Ron Paul supporters.  We all know what happened then.  They lost crucial elections across the nation while successful teaparty backed candidates like Ted Cruz won handily.”
Olsen called the RNC Autopsy report “a joke,” and added that “it shows the willingness of the old guard GOP to throw their platform under the bus giving in to the pressure from the extreme left.”  
“Passion for America,” Olsen concluded,  “is the only force that will resurrect real hope and change for the United States.”

Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) announced Friday he would seek reelection to a seventh term in the U.S. Senate.
“I’m comfortable with my decision,” Cochran, who turns 76 years old this weekend, told Gannett on Friday. “I’m looking forward to it. People have been very generous and expressed appreciation. Some have even started sending contributions and helping in that way.”
Tea Party-backed State Sen. Chris McDaniel has already launched a bid for the GOP nomination for Cochran’s seat. In response to Cochran’s announcement, one that surprised most in GOP politics who expected him to retire, McDaniel said he is undeterred. “Sen. Cochran has had a long and distinguished career representing the people of Mississippi,” McDaniel said. “I look forward to a positive campaign based on the future of our state, our country, and the Republican Party. As a strong conservative, I will fight to bring those values to Washington.”


McDaniel has the support of an amalgam of state lawmakers in Mississippi, as several of his state senate colleagues have joined his campaign. He also has the support of conservative organizations throughout the state, plus national conservative support from groups like the Tea Party Express, Club for Growth, Madison Project, FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund, and others. 
In response to Cochran’s announcement he would be seeking reelection, Club for Growth president Chris Chocola said voters in Mississippi have a “real choice” between someone who is conservative and someone who is not.
“Throughout his over forty years in Washington, Senator Thad Cochran has done some good things for Mississippi, but he’s also done some bad things,” Chocola said. 


He voted to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, voted repeatedly to raise the debt limit by trillions of dollars, and even voted against a resolution that stated Congress has a “moral obligation” to cut spending. Senator Cochran has also voted to confirm liberal Supreme Court Justices and is a strong supporter of wasteful earmarks–something that is opposed by Republican leaders in both the Senate and the House. Mississippi voters will make the final judgment as to whether it is time for a change.

Cochran is backed by the establishment in Mississippi, most notably the political machine that former governor and one-time Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour built. 
As rumors he was mulling a bid for Cochran’s seat began swelling in Mississippi, Barbour’s machine sought to quash any Tea Party insurgency in the state. Before McDaniel announced, back in September, Barbour’s nephew GOP lobbyist Henry Barbour told Roll Call that the GOP establishment would destroy McDaniel if he ran.
“I think he will get his head handed to him, and that will be what he deserves,” Henry Barbour said then. “[But] it’s a free country.”
Even so, when asked in a recent interview with Breitbart News what it’s like to run against Barbour’s machine, McDaniel said it’s “nothing personal.”
“I’ve worked with Haley when he was governor,” McDaniel told Breitbart News. “He and I worked on many instances together during his time as governor. But we do represent different visions for the Republican Party.”
“My vision is one to restore the party to the greatness it once had, particularly with regards to its fiscal restraint and its adherence to constitutional principles. The party I believe in is the party I joined years ago when Reagan was president and I hope that party gets restored,” McDaniel said. “But what’s it like to run against Haley? You know, it’s politics. I appreciate his positions. I appreciate his opinions. We just disagree.”
“It’s not personal,” McDaniel added. “I’m just going to stand my ground to fight for what I believe and I’m confident he’ll stand his ground as well to fight for what he believes.”
Of all the establishment GOP incumbent U.S. Senators in danger to primary challenges, from Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina to Lamar Alexander in Tennessee to even potentially Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, Cochran, at this point, is the most likely to lose. Recently released polling data from Public Policy Polling showed McDaniel just six points back on Cochran after only a month since his announcement. That poll showed Cochran at 44 percent, compared to McDaniel at 38 percent.

Former George W. Bush chief political strategist Matt Dowd continued to try to diminish Sarah Palin and conservatives by once again making false claims about the former Alaska governor.
On Sunday’s “ABC’s This Week,” Dowd assailed CPAC for, in his mind, lessening its credibility by inviting conservatives like Palin and not liberal Republicans favored by the northeastern elite like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. 
“CPAC, to me, has totally diminished its credibility as an organization,” Dowd said. “And you invite Sarah Palin, who wasn’t competent enough to keep a Fox News contract? But she’s invited to the CPAC meeting?”


Dowd falsely claimed that Palin was not competent enough to be on Fox, whereas Palin turned down Fox’s offer to renew her contract. His remark was not only a dig at Palin but also a shot at Fox, implying the news network that has dominated the cable news ratings employs people with subpar levels of intelligence who do not meet  the lofty standards of the Aspen Institute or Harvard’s Institute of Politics. His comments also imply that he feels the conservatives who came out in droves to elect Bush twice–which is the only reason he has his media perch and anyone has even heard of him–are dumb as well.
Other writers purporting to represent the right, like Jennifer Rubin, the Washington Post‘s token conservative, also have chimed in, writing any gathering that includes Palin while not inviting GOProud and Christie “isn’t worth attending.”
Conservative writer Jeffrey Lord assailed these elitist Republicans who feel entitled to make CPAC “a big tent” instead of the “conservative tent” that it is supposed to be.  

Since Bush left office, his top advisers have begun to show their true–and not-so-conservative–colors. Mark McKinnon, the scarf-wearing, No Labels-founding former Bush media maven, has actively courted the approval of the media elite and made himself a featured attraction at elitist seminars. Karl Rove has slammed conservative candidates and now has created as super PAC that will arm itself to wage war against Tea Party candidates in GOP primaries.
As BizPacReview notes, in 2010, Palin, in response to talk radio host Laura Ingraham’s claim that the Bush family was trying to “kneecap” a potential Palin presidential campaign, referred to the Bush family as “blue bloods” who make up the Republican establishment. 
As the publication notes, many pundits attribute the lack of enthusiasm on the right over Mitt Romney’s candidacy to Romney’s and the Republican establishment’s snub of Palin and the Tea Party that won the GOP its House majority in 2010. The Republican establishment advisers were fearful of what their mainstream media bettors would think of them if they embraced the vice presidential candidate who has galvanized the Tea Party and the conservative base more than any other figure on the right over the last four years. 
Having not learned their lesson, establishment Republicans, BizPacReview notes, “continue to attack Palin for no apparent reason.”
But there is a deeper reason why establishment Republicans disdain Palin the reformer. 
When Palin made her first appearance at CPAC last year, she blistered Washington’s crony capitalism and permanent political class, which Stephen K. Bannon and the non-partisan Government Accountability Institute’s Peter Schweizer would later document in “Boomtown.”
At CPAC 2012, journalists and observers noted that no speaker galvanized the conservative base–with conservative words and ideas–like Palin. 
And that is why establishment Republicans like Dowd, who helped enable D.C.’s “Boomtown,” would rather anoint moderates like Christie and Romney as leaders on the right instead of conservatives like Palin, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)–both of whom Palin endorsed in their respective primaries–who are unafraid to challenge Republicans as well as Democrats.

The Republican National Committee has hired the son of Fox News commentator Juan Williams to coordinate the party’s efforts to reach out to young and black voters.
Raffi Williams, the 24 year-old son of the liberal Fox commentator, will be the RNC’s deputy press secretary and will be tasked with helping the GOP make inroads in these communities. 
He told BuzzFeed that even though it is not realistic to expect Republicans to “get a ridiculous amount of African Americans in the next election,” the party can “can start to make inroads, and the more inclusive we are as a party the better optics we get to other demographics as well — not just African Americans — and that helps us in the long run.”


Williams was a Communications Director for the Republican Study Committee and worked for Rep. Dan Benishek’s (R-MI) reelection campaign. 

After losing every minority group badly during the last election cycle in a country that is getting more diverse, the RNC conducted an “autopsy” report that identified the problems the GOP has had with minority voters. Williams said RNC Chair Reince Priebus is enthusiastic about his efforts and it seems like he will be given the resources to succeed. 
“So it’s about making those new connections and getting the support I need. People are really enthused about it,” Williams said. “And that’s a nice thing for me. I didn’t know what I was walking into exactly but from the Chairman on down everyone is so on board with this.”
Republicans may be able to win over black voters after Obama leaves office because many blacks tend to be conservative on issues like immigration and gay marriage. 
For instance, George W. Bush won 16% of the black vote in Ohio in 2004, largely because many culturally conservative black voters went to the polls to vote against gay marriage. In 2008, Obama won 97% of the black vote in Ohio. And in 2012, Obama received 96% of the black vote in Ohio, but blacks made up an astounding 15% of Ohio’s electorate on election day, which made the difference for Obama in the state.

On ABC’s This Week, hosted by Martha Raddatz, Speaker of the House John Boehner appeared to downplay the problem of national debt while loudly proclaiming his wonderful relationship with President Obama. “The president and I, as I have made very clear, have a very good relationship. We’re open with each other. We’re honest with each other,” said Boehner. 

“Do you trust President Obama?” Raddatz asked. 

“Absolutely,” Boehner replied.

“Absolutely?” Raddatz emphasized.
“Absolutely,” Boehner repeated.

Framing Republicans as out-of-touch radicals, Raddatz then asked, “President Obama says these meetings are intended to find members of the common-sense caucus who he can make a deal with …. Are you not a member of the common-sense caucus?”
Boehner, falling for the trap, shot back, “I’m part of the common-sense caucus. We appreciate the outreach. We appreciate the engagement from the president. But it’s gonna take more than this if we’re serious about solving our problems.”
Then Boehner dropped the bombshell. Raddatz, after quoting President Obama saying we don’t have “an immediate crisis in terms of debt,” asked Boehner for his thoughts. And Boehner eagerly agreed: “We do not have an immediate debt crisis. But we all know that we have one looming …. It could be a year or two years, three years, four years. It’s not an immediate problem.” And then Boehner said he agreed with Obama on the immediacy of the problem.

With Republicans fighting tooth and nail to implement solutions necessary to reducing the national debt, Boehner’s language certainly undermines the public relations narrative set by conservatives. A House GOP aide angrily told Breitbart News today, “This undercuts the fight House conservatives have waged since 2010. Our efforts to prevent a debt crisis we will certainly face should never be minimized.”

Journalists and professional political tacticians in Washington’s permanent political class ecosystem apparently do not believe the mainstream media would be better served if they had more reporters who were familiar with conservative politics and voters. 
After the 2012 presidential election, CNN reporter Peter Hamby interviewed over 70 “journalists and political tacticians” that make up a “who’s who” of the Washington permanent political class for ideas on new election beats and how presidential elections may better be covered. He published his findings in a paper for Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, titled, “Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus? Searching for a better way to cover a campaign.” 
The paper, by primarily examining Mitt Romney’s failed 2012 presidential campaign and the media coverage of it, extensively examines and lays out the new terrain on which modern political battles are contested. It looks at how the the “digital firehouse of information,” especially Twitter, “is being channeled by a new generation of campaign journalists, and how political decision makers are adjusting their tactics, because there is no turning back.”


On Monday, Politico’s Playbook picked out some of the reporters and tacticians quoted in Hamby’s paper and listed them in its morning e-mail, which has been likened to a camp newsletter: 
David Axelrod, Stuart Stevens, Matt Rhoades, Eric Fehrnstrom, Adam Nagourney, John Harris, Dick Stevenson, Marcus Brauchli, Dan Balz, Jeff Zeleny, Jonathan Martin, Mo Elleithee, Phil Rucker, Garrett Haake, Tommy Vietor, Ben LaBolt, Lis Smith, Stephanie Cutter, Chuck Todd, Karen Hughes, Joe Klein, David Carr, Jon Ward, Tim Miller, Scott Conroy, Maggie Haberman, Reid Epstein, Nancy Gibbs, Sasha Issenberg, John Dickerson, Jim Acosta, John Berman, Rachel Streitfeld, Mike Murphy, Kevin Madden, Rick Gorka, Peter Alexander, Sarah Boxer, Will Ritter, Maeve Reston, Michael Feldman, Tim Pearson, Rob Lockwood, Ashley Parker, Kasie Hunt, Ryan Williams, Paul West, Michael Calderone, Zeke Miller, Ben Smith, Dave Weigel, Matt Viser, Chris Rowland, Liz Sidoti, Sam Youngman, Shushannah Walshe, Jeff Smith, Carl Cameron, Jake Suski, Robert Costa, Jackie Kucinich, Sara Murray, Jim Heath
As Hamby reported in his groundbreaking examination of Twitter’s importance in campaigns, Romney and Obama campaign officials during the 2012 race were in amazement that younger mainstream media reporters who were fluent in the medium were hardly so in politics. Obama and Romney officials told Hamby they were incredulous that reporters on the campaign could not recognize Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson. 
Many of those Hamby interviewed for his research (listed above) would surely be familiar with Reed and Robertson, for they too are institutional figures. But they may be less familiar with shows conservatives watch like Duck Dynasty; churches they attend; politicians that influence them like Sarah Palin; the guns they like to shoot and need for self-protection; the books (Liberty and Tyranny, The Liberty Amendments) and websites they like to read; and the talk radio hosts (Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin) to whom they listen.

Hamby’s reporting about Reed and Robertson also underscores a broader problem with the mainstream media and those allowed into their ranks. Though the mainstream media often bemoan the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in America’s institutions–even though studies have shown they are guilty of the same–not much is said about the lack the ideological diversity in mainstream media organizations. Such diversity is needed to more critically report on politics and challenge and correct insular assumptions and stereotypes about conservatives. 
While those reporters in question may not have known who Reed and Robertson were, it is safe to assume that there is a greater chance they would have known Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards and Jesse Jackson.
In February of 2013, Gallup found that conservatives make up a plurality of the country. Other surveys by Gallup and Pew in recent years have found the Republican party has gotten more conservative and Republicans want it to be even more so, something the mainstream press should consider as they attempt to fairly cover the 2016 GOP presidential primary. In the 2016 primary, Republicans may be pulled to the right as Democrats were pulled to the left during a 2008 primary in which the liberal base was as antagonistically opposed to President George W. Bush and his war in Iraq as conservatives are to Obama and his policies. 
Some of the suggestions for better campaign coverage that were offered to Hamby are worth noting for serious consideration:


“voter contact”–studying how campaigns actually reach out to voters and the emerging science behind it.
“media tactics”– “As campaigns increasingly seek ways to make end-runs around the Washington media filter, reporters should track their activities in niche media platforms, on radio, on the web or in social networks,” Hamby writes. “Where, how and why? Is a campaign pushing their message in a popular video game, on Pandora radio, on the Big Ten Network? In the pages of Us Weekly or the Spanish-speaking press? What local TV stations are top targets for campaign advertising?”
“Downballot races”: Hamby suggests finding “a few contests in swing-y House or Senate districts on the state level– races that are barely covered anymore, even by local media, despite the colorful characters involved–and check in every few weeks.”
“Political science”: Hamby writes that reporters should pay attention to the academics that “are publishing smart, counterintuitive work or documenting trends that often go unnoticed in the press” instead of political scientists who seek to get quoted in every publication and mistake quantity for quality. 



Others solutions included: “The money trail and the political industry,” which would study where the massive amount of money that is raised is actually spent and some of the shadier ways political influence is purchased; a focus on better reporting and interpreting polling; and a focus on “Political movements, new and old.” Hamby also suggested sending reporters to cover states–instead of specific candidates–to play “zone defense” like CNN did in 2008 in states like South Carolina, or hiring local reporters or bloggers in key primary states who know the terrain well.
Perhaps Hamby, who gained respect for being one of the few mainstream reporters who has covered Sarah Palin fairly, had a blind spot to some suggestions that were not being offered or assumed his fellow denizens in Washington’s political ecosystem understand and give conservatives a fair shake. 
Consider what former Washington Post editor Marcus Brauchli told Hamby, though. Brauchli said that he did not think “the media did a terrific job of explaining Obama and his presidency”–and perhaps that was so because the same reporters that have difficulties understanding conservatives also are unable to critically report on Obama. 

Ultimately, the suggestions Hamby puts forth for better campaign coverage may not be worth that much in the long run without reporters, producers, and editors who have the knowledge and life experiences to cover an electorate that greatly influences one party’s primary and makes up a plurality of the nation. The closest anyone came to touching upon this in the study was Sasha Issenberg of Slate, who observed that the New York Times did not have a gun-culture beat reporter. 
At the very least, reporters should have a genuine curiosity that enables them to learn and challenge their assumptions about an electorate and parts of the country with which they may not be familiar–that is a trait the late David Broder, who is mentioned with reverence in Hamby’s report, had in spades.

People close to Rush Limbaugh’s camp are furious at  Americans For Tax Reform’s (ATR) President Grover Norquist for saying the highly rated conservative talk radio host should not be considered as a moderator for the 2016 Republican presidential primary debates.
Norquist told The Hill that he opposed allowing conservative talk radio hosts Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin to moderate the 2016 Republican presidential primary debates, saying it would not be “useful.” 



Having conservative talk radio hosts Mark Levin or Rush Limbaugh host debates would be “not useful,” Norquist told The Hill. Talk radio hosts, he said, are primarily entertainers who would draw attention away from the candidates themselves.
He also said the radio hosts, despite their popularity, did not necessarily represent the Republican mainstream. He pointed toward immigration reform as an example, saying that while Levin opposes comprehensive immigration reform fiercely, polls show most Republicans are amenable to it.

Someone close to the Limbaugh camp spoke to Breitbart News said,  “It’s ironic that when everyone was jumping on the bash Grover bandwagon, Rush  never said a word. He has too much class.” The source also noted that in the past Norquist has used Rush’s quotes on the ATR website to fundraise and promote his cause of the moment.

“Some friend, huh.”
During the vote at the last Republican National Committee meeting when members decided to oust CNN and NBC as potential networks to moderate primary debates over the airing of a Hillary Clinton movie, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus  commented it would be a “very good idea” to have both Limbaugh and Levin as RNC debate moderators.  “I actually think that’s a very good idea,” He said, adding, “I mean, there’s a lot of good people out there that can actually understand the base of the Republican Party, the primary voters.”
 A GOP state party official agreed with Priebus telling Breitbart News, “[Limbaugh and Levin] should be moderators. Chris Matthews did the primary debate in 2008.” 
Immediately after Priebus’s comments, Limbaugh said on his radio show, “I don’t see how I can, I’m too famous.” However, Limbaugh noted the debate would certainly get high ratings.

Claims that Virginia Democrats are purposefully misrepresenting the positions held by Republican candidate for governor Ken Cuccinelli have made one of the ugliest political campaigns even worse.
A Virginia Republican delegate, Scott Lingamfelter, said that he received a robocall on Sunday night claiming that Cuccinelli supports ObamaCare and taxpayer funding of abortions. According to the Washington Free Beacon, the calls are believed to be an attempt to depress conservative voter turnout and to use pressure to boost voter turnout among Democrats in the final days of the race. 
Rather than a supporter of those positions, Cuccinelli was the first attorney general in the United States to challenge ObamaCare in federal court and is adamantly pro-life. 


A description of the robocall from Lingamfelter’s Facebook page claimed: 


About 25 minutes ago (7:24 PM 3 November) the Democratic Party of Virginia dropped a robo-call (that they said they paid for in the recording) at MY house to try to tell ME that Ken Cuccinelli supports Obamacare and public financing of abortion!!!
Virginia, pa-leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezzz understand that the party that wants Terry McAuliffe to be your governor will flat lie about anything! If you want proof that they will say ANYTHING to gain power over you and your life, you need go no further than the “robo-lies” they are sending around Virginia this Sunday evening. They are shameless in their tactics. (I guess they are trying to suppress GOP voters.)

The Beacon states that neither Lingamfelter nor the Democratic Party of Virginia responded to questions about the robocall campaign.  
In an update on its report of the story, LifeNews indicated that Cuccinelli himself has commented on the robocalls via an email sent out to his supporters: 

We have the most energized group of grassroots supporters I’ve ever seen in all of my years in office. Our momentum and excitement is contagious – Terry McAuliffe and the Democrats see that – and they’re nervous. So nervous in fact, that they’ve turned to desperate, outright lies to try to sway my hardworking and dedicated supporters. 
Early today, I was informed that the Democrats are calling the homes of my Republican supporters and telling them that I support Obamacare! 
That’s right, Friend. Terry McAuliffe and his Democrat allies are trying to convince voters that I support Obamacare in order to trick them into voting against me!
Of course we all know the truth – that I was the first Attorney General in the country to sue the federal government over Obamacare. I’ve been busy fighting back against Obamacare for years, and what has Terry McAuliffe done? He said it didn’t go far enough. 
Terry even stood by President Obama’s side yesterday and celebrated Obamacare after news broke that the President lied to Americans, and millions lost their health insurance.

On Monday, RNC Chair Reince Priebus sent stinging letters to NBC and CNN concerning their recently announced decisions to produce films celebrating the life of Hillary Clinton. The RNC sees the odd programing move as an in-kind contribution to Clinton’s presumed campaign for President in 2016. As a result, the party will formally bar Republicans from partnering with the networks on any primary or Presidential debates in 2016. 
Priebus wrote to CNN:

I find CNN’s actions disturbing and disappointing. Your credibility as a supposedly unbiased news network will most certainly be jeopardized by the decision to show political favoritism and produce an extended commercial for Secretary Clinton’s nascent campaign.

And to NBC:



I find this disturbing and disappointing. NBC cannot purport to be a neutral party in American politics, and the credibility of NBC News, already damaged by the partisanship of MSNBC, will be further undermined by the actions of NBC Universal executives who have taken it upon themselves to produce an extended commercial for Secretary Clinton’s nascent campaign.

The decision by NBC and CNN to produce a mini-series or film about the life of Hillary Clinton is indeed odd. They do not regularly produce films about major figures in American politics. Perhaps I missed it, but I don’t recall a network bio of former Secretary of State Condolezza Rice. I also haven’t seen films about NY Senator Kristin Gillibrand or First Ladies Laura Bush and Michelle Obama.

The RNC Summer meeting is August 14th. Unless the networks scuttle their plans to produce their Hillary Clinton films, Priebus will seek a binding vote by the full RNC to bar the party from partnering with, or sanctioning, any primary or Presidential debate with the two networks.
The 2016 campaign for President has begun.

11737	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/27/Ken-Cuccinelli-Is-Virginia-s-Libertarian-Choice-Too	News	1	Elections	None	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Though Robert Sarvis is the announced Libertarian candidate who is reportedly pulling 10 percent of the vote in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, Republican Ken Cuccinelli likely has more to offer libertarians in the state than Sarvis. Libertarian Ron Paul and his son Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) think so, and both have endorsed Cuccinelli. 
Political analyst Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner, who often espouses the libertarian viewpoint, wrote Friday that Cuccinelli “would arguably be the most libertarian governor in the United States if he wins on Nov. 7,” a point that contrasts sharply with the fact that libertarians are attacking him. 
As Carney observes, Cuccinelli, as Virginia’s attorney general, was the first to challenge the constitutionality of ObamaCare’s mandates, taxes, subsidies, and infringements upon liberty.  


As governor, Cuccinelli’s plan is to cut the state income tax rate by 15 percent for individuals and 33 percent for corporations, creating an environment that is ripe for the free market. 
But libertarians should take note that Cuccinelli’s style is more “pro-economic growth” and less “pro-business,” as evidenced by the fact that his state’s business lobby has had its feathers ruffled by his stand against corporate welfare. Cuccinelli opposed the tax hikes that were sought by Northern Virginia developers to pay for roads and public services, and he pledged to cut the tax credits for special interest groups. 
In addition, Cuccinelli fought, while a state senator, to protect second amendment rights and, consequently, has an “A” rating from the NRA. He also opposed smoking bans when serving as a state senator. 

As Carney states, “Cuccinelli also often chooses government restraint over ‘law and order.'” 
Not afraid to oppose his own party, Cuccinelli, was the only Republican to vote against an expansion of the death penalty in 2009, even during a competitive primary for attorney general. 
Cuccinelli’s strong character was visible in his unwavering effort to exonerate Thomas Haynesworth, a black man who was wrongly convicted of rape and jailed for 27 years. Cuccinelli argued successfully to obtain a rare “writ of actual innocence,” which was possible because as a state senator, he had advocated for a law that would make such exoneration easier. 

Carney questions why, with Cuccinelli having libertarian bona fides, Ed Crane, former president of the Cato Institute, and other libertarians are supporting Sarvis and spending $300,000 on his campaign? 
He suspects, he says, that identity politics plays a role: 

I asked Sarvis why a libertarian should oppose Cuccinelli, and the first words out of his mouth were “social issues.” Crane’s only critique of Cuccinelli when announcing the $300,000 buy for Sarvis: “Ken Cuccinelli is a socially intolerant, hard-right conservative with little respect for civil liberties.” 
Cuccinelli is undoubtedly conservative. He’s an observant Catholic with seven children and a home-schooling wife. He’s a hero to the pro-life cause and an opponent of gay marriage. 
Libertarians, as a rule, support gay marriage, and most libertarians are pro-choice. But pro-life views fit within the libertarian framework: If you believe an in utero baby is a person, and if you believe the government has a legitimate role in protecting the innocent from violence, it’s logical to restrict abortion. 
And Cuccinelli, while unwavering in his moral opposition to abortion, is a moderate among Virginia Republicans when it comes to government restrictions on abortion: He worked behind the scenes trying to remove a GOP-created requirement that women undergo an ultrasound before getting an abortion. 

Carney gets to the crux of the matter, however, when he asserts, that “social liberals’ attack on Cuccinelli conflates his personal conservatism with his policy views.” 
The fact is that, while Cuccinelli might not personally agree with a law, he knows his job is to uphold the laws in his state. So, when he prosecuted a 47 year-old sexual predator who had sex with a minor, he defended his state’s “Crimes Against Nature” law but did not attempt to “ban sodomy” or homosexuality, as his critics say. He also has never attempted to “ban contraception,” as Planned Parenthood and its minions have charged. 
As Carney contends, Ken Cuccinelli may personally live a conservative lifestyle, but his record as both a state senator and attorney general is one that demonstrates that liberty is worth fighting for. Shouldn’t libertarians respect his choice to live as he does, while he also works to keep Virginians free?

A new poll conducted jointly by The Washington Post and ABC News revealed some interesting trends. Among other findings, more Americans feel that Obama and his administration are lying about Benghazi. A majority feel that the IRS acted inappropriately by targeting conservative groups.  The media are still distrusted, with a majority feeling that the Justice Department’s seizure of the AP’s phone records was justified. Despite all this disapproval, Obama’s approval rating is still just over 50 percent positive.
An important metric in the ABC/WashPost poll was the question of whether or not government is doing more to protect or threaten our rights. 54% felt that the government had become a threat to our rights while only 34% said that the government was acting properly to protect our rights. The American people’s faith in government is at a low ebb.
This distrust is echoed when the poll turned to the specific cases of Benghazi and the IRS.


55% said that they feel that Obama is trying to cover up what happened during the terror attacks on our facilities in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012. Only 33% felt he was honestly disclosing what he knew.
This doesn’t seem to have helped the GOP too much though. 45% still felt the GOP was just engaging in political posturing by criticizing Obama’s actions on that fateful day. 44% felt the GOP was raising legitimate concerns.
Granted this close 50/50 split tends to shadow how the nation feels about Obama, Congress and the two parties.

As to the IRS scandal, a large majority felt that the tax agency was inappropriate in its targeting of conservative groups. 74% said it was inappropriate while only 20% said that it was appropriate. Further, 37% felt the IRS acted illegally with another 32% said they felt it was inappropriate but maybe not illegal.
Also, 56% felt that the IRS was acting in a partisan manner, deliberately trying to harass conservative groups, and 45% feel that Obama is trying to cover up the facts about that targeting.
The other most recent scandal in the news was Obama’s Justice Department seizing the personal and business phone records of some 100 reporters from the Associated Press. It appears that the media are still not well liked by these respondents.
52% said that the DOJ’s spying on the phone calls of the AP reporters was justified. Only 33% said it isn’t justified. Worse for the media, most respondents weren’t concerned at all that the DOJ might be improperly intruding on the freedom of the press. 32% said they were very concerned that freedom of the press was being trampled upon, but 37% said they were only somewhat concerned, and an additional 29% said they weren’t concerned about it. In a blow to the media, here, more are not very concerned about the AP phone records scandal than are.
Finally, despite that a majority of 57% feel the country is on the wrong track, Obama is still hovering around the break even line in approval. More respondents approved of his work as president (51% to 44%), he split even on his handling of the economy (48% to 48%), and in the matchup between Obama and the Republicans, 46% felt he was handling the economy well compared to only 37% who thought that the GOP was handling it better.
The GOP is not succeeding in getting their message across, clearly.
As to Hillary Clinton, she is still enjoying a relatively high approval rating. 62% of respondents felt she handled her job as Secretary of State well, while only 28% disapproved of her actions.
The poll, conducted in the middle of May, was taken among respondents that self-identified as 33% Democrat, 22% Republican, with 38% self-identifying as independents.

On Friday, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh praised Pat Caddell, the frustrated Democrat who has often spoken out against the political establishment, for his thunderous speech at CPAC on Thursday condemning the Republican consultant class.
Caddell accused GOP consultants of caring more about money than winning elections or principles and engaging in acts that could border on racketeering. 
Limbaugh said Caddell “launched both barrels at CPAC” and let the Republican consultant class “have it” while blowing “the lid off of CPAC” with what Limbaugh described was a message that “the Republican consultant class is taking the party down the tubes, that they’re making filthy amounts of money–$150 million a campaign–whether the candidate wins or loses.”



“In my party we play to win. We play for life and death,” Caddell said at a panel in a room that was only one-third full when it started and was standing room only once word spread throughout CPAC that Caddell was blistering the Republican elite. “You people play for a different kind of agenda…Your party has no problem playing the Washington Generals to the Harlem Globetrotters.”
Caddell said this mentality infected Romney, whose campaign consultants thold him to “back off” toward the end of the 2012 election and failed to realize that “you must also get your base” while courting independents. 

He then blasted the “CLEC–the consultant, lobbyist, and establishment complex,” which he said was a “self serving interconnected network of individuals and organizations interested in preserving their own power far more than they’re interested in winning elections.”
“I blame the donors who allow themselves to be played for marks,” Caddell continued. “I blame the people in the grassroots for allowing themselves to be played for suckers….It’s time to stop being marks. It’s time to stop being suckers. It’s time for you people to get real.”
Limbaugh read these quotes on his radio show and wholeheartedly endorsed them, for Limbaugh told his listeners that for years he has warned of consultants who claim they have the secret formula for winning over so-called “independents” at the expense of conservatives, and the “candidates fall for it year after year after year” and lose. 
“They’re all moderates. None of them are really conservative,” Limbaugh said of the GOP consultant class. “They say they are, and they think they’ve got the recipe to win.”
Limbaugh said the consultant class thinks “people in the middle, these great moderate independents, aren’t conservative. And furthermore, they think that conservatism scares these people” and they “make no effort to educate or inform or correct that impression.”

The conservative radio show host said he has always been confused by consultants who think Republicans will turn off independents by getting aggressive because “Democrats are the meanest, most extreme, insufferable” people and, “there’s nothing nice about them.”
“Somehow that doesn’t scare the independents,” Limbaugh said. 

Case in point: Romney’s 2012 loss to Obama. 
“He won the independents, just like these brainiacs said,” Limbaugh said. “But four million conservatives sat home and didn’t vote.”
Limbaugh noted that Caddell was right to know that consultants get advertising commissions whether the candidate wins and the GOP leaders threaten candidates they will not receive institutional support if the candidate does not hire their cronies from a list of “approved” consultants and strategists. 

He said this was the “foundation for Caddell’s speech at CPAC” and consultants who led the charge of, “The era of Reagan is over,” are not big fans of him or conservatives. He emphasized that he has always been confused about why Republicans have the two Reagan campaigns as blueprints for how to win majorities by running on core beliefs and principles and fail to use them. 
Limbaugh said Caddell’s speech about the CLEC was “really important” because it explains why Republicans continue to lose national elections because the consultant class just wants to be liked by the liberal Washington mainstream media and ecosytem. 
“You’re happy to be walked all over. You’re just happy to be in the game. You’re happy to be acknowledged,” Limbaugh said of the permanent political class. “I really believe the pursuit to make everybody like you is the greatest prison you could put yourself in.”
Limbaugh said Republicans who want to get liked “cease being” who they are and then “you end up not even knowing who you are.” 
Limbaugh blamed Romney’s consultants for telling Romney to “back off” on critical issues like Benghazi and not attack Obama in the final days of the campaign because they did not want to be disliked by their liberal peers in the mainstream media and Washington’s permanent political class.
“You try to be all things to all people, and that can’t be done,” Limbaugh said, noting that the mainstream media wants Republicans to be content with being “perennial losers” who know their place. “This effort to make themselves liked never gets anywhere. They never gain respect.”

Even though Karl Rove’s American Crossroads brand has been damaged after the group declared war against conservative candidates, the group will reportedly try to influence the 2014 midterm elections by bullying campaigns and creating groups that, on the surface, do not seem to be affiliated with them.
According to the New York Times, Crossroads “appears to be testing” its “new approach” in Kentucky. The Conservative Victory Project, the group formed to take on conservative candidates, has stayed out of Kentucky’s Senate primary between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Tea Party challenger Matt Bevin. Instead, a group called “Kentuckians for Strong Leadership” is curiously backing McConnell while getting most of its cash from Crossroads donors. It is “legally separate from Crossroads;” but Stephen Law, the president of Crossroads, sits on its board, and the two groups share a treasurer. 
Crossroads may set up “similar groups in races in which its brand may be less appealing to voters or donors.” The Times notes that this is an approach Crossroads may have to take because Rove’s organization has been so tarnished among the conservative base that candidates fear donors will not contribute to any group associated with him.


In other races, Crossroads has been threatening Senate candidates, saying the group and its affiliates will not support them if they accept support from other super PACs. According to the Times, Law warned a Republican West Virginia Senate candidate (Rep. Shelly Moore Capito) that if her campaign formed its own super PAC, Crossroads would not offer it support. 

Other Republicans said they were “unwilling to let Mr. Rove and his colleagues decide which Senate candidates get the most support.” “You don’t want someone playing God above you saying, ‘You don’t need any more money in your race. You can win by a few less points,'” a Republican told the Times. 
Crossroads and its affiliated groups spent nearly $450 million during the 2012 election cycle with no wins to show for it. Law said the group had good financial controls in place so that its money is not wasted.

In the final weekend of the campaign for Virginia Governor, Republican Ken Cuccinelli has announced rallies with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Congressman Ron Paul, among other Republicans. The Cuccinelli campaign has put its hopes for a come-from-behind victory in energizing base Republican and conservative voters. Walker and Paul both have unique appeal with voters Cuccinelli needs on Tuesday. 
Walker will attend two rallies for Cuccinelli on Saturday, appearing in Spotslyvania and Woodbridge, two Northern Virginia suburbs were the Republican needs a strong vote. Ron Paul will attend an evening rally on Monday, the eve of the election in Richmond. 
Libertarian candidate Richard Sarvis has unexpectedly polled strongly in the race, attracting around 10% of voters. According to polls, Sarvis is drawing more support away from Cuccinelli than Democrat McAuliffe. Ron Paul has a very strong following among Sarvis supporters and his appearance with Cuccinelli is meant to stem the tide of defections from the Republican. 


For most of the campaign, Cuccinelli ran a very conventional race. He downplayed his conservative positions and focused on more narrow Virginia-specific issues. After an exceptionally negative campaign, both he and McAuliffe have high negative ratings with voters. With turnout expected to be low, Cuccinelli is returning to conservative themes to energize grass roots turnout. 

On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Cuccinelli, at least twice, mentioned he was the “pro-liberty” candidate. He reiterated his early opposition to ObamaCare. He stressed that Obama’s campaigning this weekend for McAuliffe made the election a “referendum” on ObamaCare. Cuccinelli is, at last, trying to nationalize the election. 
McAuliffe’s decision to campaign with President Obama is risky. It is also a sign that the Democrat is worried about his supporters’ enthusiasm. While he has slightly more support among Democrats than Cuccinelli has among Republicans, his high personal negatives could dampen turnout of voters he needs. 
Cuccinelli does not hold a lead in any public poll. McAuliffe has held a small, but steady, lead in the polls for several weeks. A Cuccinelli victory on Tuesday would be a big upset, but one that is possible given the expected low turnout. 
Scott Walker and Ron Paul excite key segments of the voters Cuccinelli needs. We’ll know Tuesday if it is enough.

After President Obama’s second inaugural address, Van Jones, former Obama White House “green jobs” czar, praised the speech, calling it “Djobama Unchained” (after the controversial movie Django Unchained, about a freed slave taking revenge). On Wednesday night, during a lecture at Loyola University Chicago, I asked Jones what he meant. He explained that while President Obama is not a socialist, he is, in fact, a “communitarian.”

After a long recapping of the first four years of the Obama’s presidency, Jones elaborated:

It’s very interesting to see him now, actually, free.

Watching this man for four years, for everything he’s done to try to reach out to the other side, and frankly neglect his base, has just been called socialism, and just been called divisive, no matter what he does.
I was happy to see him unleashed and unchained and just be able to speak from his heart.

And what he said was, similar to what I’ve been saying, there is a “New Patriotism.”

(The rest of Jones’s answer is here.)
Jones compared the president’s address to that of Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and recommended that the theater full of college students read Reagan’s “powerful” and “strong,” inaugurals, which he said were “rooted in American tradition and values,” but “unabashedly” and “unapologetically conservative.”

Following Jones’s comparison of President Obama to Ronald Reagan, the “unabashedly conservative” president, I pressed Jones further for some insight into what and who President Obama really is.
Jones replied: “He is a communitarian.” He then elaborated briefly: “I mean you always have individualism, communitarianism, as a part of the, American story, and I think we’ve overbalanced the individualistic direction and I think he’s trying to rebalance toward communitarianism.”
Later, when asked (off tape) to define “communitarian,” Jones was unable to answer or to point toward any source for a definition. He said there wasn’t really a way to look up “communitarianism.” 
He did reiterate, however, that he saw communitarianism as a counterbalance to libertarianism, which he equated to “individualism.”

Jones declined an interview with Breitbart News following the lecture.

The Florida Secretary of State has discovered 53,000 dead voters registered to vote. The Secretary of State has also flagged thousands of potential non-citizens who are also registered to vote. This discovery is indicative of a wider national problem with dead and ineligible voters on the rolls heading into the Presidential election.
In the 2012 legislative session, Florida finally passed a law requiring the use of the Social Security Death Index (SSDI) to determine if dead people are registered to vote in Florida. Secretary of State Kurt Browning and then-State Election Director Don Palmer proposed this idea in the previous legislative session, but the bill did not pass.
Florida discovered the dead voters by matching voter rolls against the SSDI.


The SSDI is the list of Americans who have died and applied for death benefits. Because an application must be submitted by the next of kin and carries criminal penalties for false statements, it is considered the most accurate list of dead voters available.
Yet most states don’t use the SSDI. Instead, they use a hodge-podge of other information, usually compiled from the state bureaus of vital statistics. But state bureau reporting is slow and incomplete.
Three counties in Florida have reported more citizens registered to vote than people alive eligible to vote – St. Johns, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa – according to the most recent Election Assistance Commission report.

Having dead people infesting the rolls is the first step to voter impersonation.
Federal law requires states to have a reasonable voter list maintenance program and gives the Eric Holder Justice Department the power to sue states that don’t. Not surprisingly, Holder’s DOJ has not brought a single case under the law to require states to clean up corrupted voter rolls. Indeed, when I served at the DOJ Voting Section, an announcement was made in November 2009 that this provision of the law would not be enforced. The political leadership was philosophically opposed to the law, and they said so.
Make no mistake, the problem of corrupted voter rolls is not confined to Florida. It extends to New Mexico, Iowa, Indiana, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and other states. Judicial Watch has notified various states they are in violation of the law and will be filing lawsuits to force the sort of clean-up that Florida has now started.
Many resist cleaning up the voter rolls as directed by the Secretary of State. Brenda Snipes, the Supervisor of Elections in Broward County (Fort Lauderdale) is one.
“I’m feeling really uncomfortable about this,” Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes told officials with the state’s Division of Elections.

With the election just months away, the time for removing ineligible voters is now. Unfortunately, millions are on the rolls across the nation, and election officials from the DOJ to local offices are reluctant to act.

Monday morning, more than 60 leaders of conservative and grass roots organizations sent a letter to RNC Chair Reince Priebus, urging him to consider Rules changes that would reverse a power-grab by the national party at the convention in Tampa. In August, the RNC adopted a number of rules changes that stripped state parties of their control of convention delegates, among other changes. The rules changes further centralized control over the nominating process for the Presidency. They would give DC greater control over picking the GOP nominee. 
Many of the changes to the RNC rules adopted in Tampa may seem innocuous, but their effect would shorten the presidential primary and strengthen the position of any front-runner at the beginning of the contest. They would eliminate the proportional allocation of delegates in early primaries and limit the candidates whose names could be offered at the convention for the nomination. It would also allow stripping state-elected convention delegates of their voting rights. 
The letter reads in part:



Conservatism and the Reagan coalition that created the modern Republican Party represents the fusion of economic conservatives, social conservatives, and national security conservatives. Rather than allowing political consultants and other elite minorities to shed our principles in the name of political expediency, we must reaffirm our commitment to these timeless American principles and the work that it will take to again make them relevant to a majority of our citizens.

The signers of the letter cover the breadth of the conservative and grass roots base of the party. They seek to reverse the recently adopted rules at the upcoming Spring meeting of the RNC, to ensure that all voices in the party have a role in selecting its Presidential candidate. 

Engaging and winning a competitive primary does not drain a nominee of resources or energy, as many in DC contend. Rather, it makes the nominee stronger, having been forced to build a broad coalition from all wings of the party. A candidate who is successful at that is well on their way to building a winning general election coalition.

Thousands of Tea Party activists will gather Monday at rallies across the nation to mark Tax Day, April 15–and to re-ignite a movement that had been written off as dormant by the media and the political classes.
After propelling the Republican Party to the majority in the House of Representatives in 2010–and likely for the next decade thereafter–the Tea Party seemed to retreat. It failed in its political aim of defeating President Barack Obama in 2012, largely because of its earlier failure to find an alternative nominee to Gov. Mitt Romney. It was tarnished unfairly as racist, extremist, and–especially after the Tuscon shooting of Jan. 2011–violent, and was blamed even by some Republicans for the debt ceiling impasse in mid-2011.
Yet the Tea Party also succeeded in stopping the rapid growth of federal spending and taxation. The Tea Party ensured that there would be no bailouts for profligate states and no large-scale tax increases. Though it had to swallow the tax increases of the “fiscal cliff” deal in the early hours of 2013, it essentially preserved 98% of the Bush-era tax cuts. And by shifting the national debate in favor of deficit reduction, the Tea Party laid the foundation for the budget sequester–a set of across-the-board spending cuts that the American public has largely tolerated, even in the face of President Obama’s attempts to create panic and outrage.


The Tea Party ought to be fading into the background. The issues that the Obama administration has placed on the national agenda–immigration, gun control, and gay marriage–are thought to be ones where the Tea Party is weakest, far from the fiscal agenda that gave it early momentum and prominence. And yet the Tea Party has new momentum as an opposition force. Without articulating clear policy positions on any of these divisive issues, the Tea Party has rallied opposition nonetheless, holding the line in Congress and the states. 

The key has been the Tea Party’s continued stress on the Constitution–not just the Second Amendment, but also the fundamental principle of the rule of law, and the federalist structure that Washington has done so much in recent decades to erode. These general principles are enough of a foundation for a political stand–and broad enough to admit wide differences of opinion on the substantive underlying issues themselves. 
Recent months have proved challenging for conservatives, especially as politicians once backed by the Tea Party have begun reshaping themselves as moderates–Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) on immigration, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) on gun control, and several governors on Obamacare funding for state Medicaid expansion. Yet the Tea Party appears set for a revival–partly because of the failures of Republican national leadership, partly because of the emergence of new leaders, but largely because the country needs the opposition that it provides. 
In a system there the two parties find themselves unable to undo the worst aspects of policies in which they have often colluded, and the mainstream media no longer bother to hold Washington in check, only the Tea Party seems to have the potential to provide the spark for the country’s urgent renaissance.

On Wednesday, the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee Jeff Sessions (R-AL) said he plans to vigorously oppose President Barack Obama’s Treasury Secretary nominee Jack Lew.
“Jack Lew must never be Secretary of Treasury,” said Mr. Sessions in a statement. “His testimony before the Senate Budget Committee less than two years ago was so outrageous and false that it alone disqualifies.”
On Feb. 13, 2011, Mr. Lew appeared on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley and said of Mr. Obama’s proposed budget:



Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we’re not adding to the debt anymore; we’re spending money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing down our national debt.

During Senate testimony, Mr. Sessions blasted Mr. Lew’s false statement and said he was “flatly in error”:

Lew, who is a former director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has at times displayed a striking level of ignorance over how the budgetary process operates.

During the Crowley interview, Mr. Lew said that the reason Mr. Obama has failed to pass a budget in the Senate is because such bills can be filibustered. But as anyone familiar with the process knows, budgets are considered “privileged,” meaning they do not require a filibuster-proof majority 60 votes and can instead be passed with a simple majority.

Mr. Lew repeated the elementary error to NBC’s David Gregory. “One of the things about the United States Senate that I think the American people don’t realize,” said Mr. Lew confidently, “is that it takes 60 votes, not 50, to pass something.”

One would think the former head of OMB–the nation’s top budget post–would know how the budget process works. But apparently Mr. Lew does not.

Now, Mr. Lew has been nominated to become Treasury Secretary of the United States in the worst economy since the Great Depression. That, says Mr. Sessions, cannot happen:

It’s time for a Secretary of Treasury to look the American people in the eye and lay out an economic plan for America that will end our debt path that has endangered our future and which will find support among the American people and the world’s financial community. Far from being a positive force towards this essential good, Mr. Lew has given priority to the political interests of the President, in whose White House inner circle he has now served for several years.
At this time of unprecedented slow growth, high unemployment, and huge deficits, we need a Secretary of Treasury that the American people, the Congress, and the world will know is up to the task of getting America on the path to prosperity not the path to decline. Jack Lew is not that man.

Questions have also emerged over a $950,000 bonus Mr. Lew received in 2009 in his role as chief operating officer of Citigroup’s Alternative Investments unit–a group that bet billions against homeowners paying their mortgages. Mr. Obama has previously railed against “obscene” Wall Street bonuses wherein “fat cats” get “awarded for their failure.” Still, Mr. Lew took the money.
In a letter to Mr. Lew, Sen. Chuck Grassley asked, “How is it in the public’s interest for you to receive a $1 million bonus on the eve of a massive $301 billion commitment to rescue Citigroup?”
Mr. Lew’s response: “My position at Citi was a management position. I was not an investment adviser. My compensation was in line with other management executives at the firm and in similarly complex operations.”
It is presently unknown whether Mr. Sessions plans to filibuster the Jack Lew nomination.

Pro-amnesty organizations are campaigning heavily for Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and a close ally of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Virginia’s gubernatorial election on Tuesday.
“Latino groups are intensifying get-out-the-vote efforts in the Virginia governor’s race against a national backdrop of a congressional struggle over immigration reform,” NBC News Latino reports. “The groups said Thursday immigration reform is a critical issue on which candidates will be measured by Latino voters in the race.
As the groups work to have a strong showing of Latino turnout in Tuesday’s race, pressure has intensified on House Republicans to move immigration reform legislation in the waning days of this congressional year. That has helped keep the issue in the forefront as the Virginia candidates head to Election Day and groups try to turn out Latino voters in the state, home to the 16th largest population of Hispanic-eligible voters.”


NBC Latino quotes the National Council of La Raza Action Fund’s executive director Matthew McClellan who said his group and others are organizing 75,000 phone calls on behalf of McAuliffe and conducting door-to-door get-out-the-vote efforts, running ads in Spanish-language media and sending direct mail to more than 27,000 homes. “The Latino community is tired of talk and demanding action,” McClellan said. “Saying the right thing is not enough and we will be looking for action after is over.”

Labor Council for Latin American Advancement executive director Hector Sanchez called on Hispanics who want comprehensive immigration reform to show up at the polls for McAuliffe. “It’s very important for everyone to turn out to the polls, to analyze where those candidates are and make sure those candidates are representing Latinos on issues that are critical for the community,” Sanchez said.
They are specifically pushing DREAM Act proposals, ones that would grant amnesty to young illegal immigrants who crossed the border or entered or stayed in the country illegally before they became adults. Ken Cuccinelli, the GOP candidate running against McAuliffe, opposes amnesty and DREAM Act proposals.
No matter the result, these leftwing groups and others are likely to try to extrapolate the election results in Virginia to fit their national agenda, as both House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) and House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) are from the Commonwealth. Cantor and Goodlatte are key players in the immigration debate, and both thus far remain publicly open to attempts from House GOP leadership to go to a conference committee to negotiate with the Senate and its “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Cantor and Goodlatte remain open to such efforts despite the fact that the Senate bill’s key GOP sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), has publicly come out against such efforts

After failing to turn out the base as Mitt Romney’s Vice Presidential pick in the 2012 elections, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) told the Des Moines Register in Iowa that he thinks the GOP should focus on going into minority communities to seek votes.
“Go into inner cities, go into minority communities,” Ryan said in an interview with the state paper. “Go into communities that have not seen or heard from Republicans in a long time.” Ryan was in Iowa on Saturday for a fundraiser and birthday event for the state’s GOP Gov. Terry Branstad.


Ryan and Romney lost the presidential election last year by failing to turn out the GOP base. As Byron York pointed out in the Washington Examiner in May of this year, six months after the election, the GOP duo would have needed to get 73 percent of the Hispanic vote to have won the election by solely focusing on Hispanics–when Republicans have not, at any point in history, been able to even break 45 percent of the Hispanic vote. George W. Bush got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004, the highest a Republican has ever gotten in a nationwide election.
“In 2012, President Obama famously won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote to Mitt Romney’s 27 percent,” York wrote. “If all other factors remained the same, how large a percentage of the Hispanic vote would Romney have had to win to capture the White House? What if Romney had won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, the high-water mark for Republicans achieved by George W. Bush in 2004? As it turns out, if Romney had hit that Bush mark, he still would have lost, with 240 electoral votes to 298 for Obama.”
York presented several other “unrealistic” scenarios, such as Romney and Ryan winning 50 percent or 70 percent of the Hispanic vote–only to show that the numbers prove if they were somehow miraculously able to pull off such a feat, they still would have lost the election. York noted that Romney and Ryan would have needed 73 percent of the Hispanic vote to beat Obama–if all the other numbers, such as the low GOP base turnout, stayed the same.

“The most serious of those problems was that Romney was not able to connect with white voters who were so turned off by the campaign that they abandoned the GOP and in many cases stayed away from the polls altogether,” York wrote. “Recent reports suggest as many as 5 million white voters simply stayed home on Election Day. If they had voted at the same rate they did in 2004, even with the demographic changes since then, Romney would have won. Likewise, the white vote is so large that an improvement of 4 points — going from 60 percent to 64 percent of those whites who did vote — would have won the race for Romney.”
Nonetheless, Ryan still believes somehow that pushing certain policies like amnesty that pander to the left will somehow win the GOP minority votes. Ryan is currently in the process of writing a bill that would legalize the status of America’s at least 11 million illegal aliens.
As part of his interview with the Des Moines Register, Ryan praised New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie’s re-election as evidence that the GOP can win minority communities in blue states. 
“Absolutely,” Ryan answered when asked by the local paper if lessons can be learned from Christie’s re-election in New Jersey. “It shows that we have to go and campaign in non-traditional areas, non-traditional neighborhoods, and by showing up not just a few months before the election, but by being in these communities all year round, that will make a difference.”
“What Chris’s victory shows is that conservatives can win blue states if we focus on being inclusive and campaigning in every facet of this country, we can open up the electoral map, far more than where it has been,” Ryan added.
As part of the interview, Ryan pushed harder than he has in a long time in public for amnesty as well. Ryan said, in the words of the Des Moines paper, that pushing for amnesty for illegal aliens is “crucial.”
“When we get to it [amnesty], it’s not extremely clear,” Ryan said. “But there are many of us who still would like to see it happen in a step-by-step process before the end of the year. But if that doesn’t occur, we’ll still keep moving for it because, again, the status quo is unacceptable.”
Ryan is at odds with the entire rest of the House GOP leadership–and the GOP base–when it comes to immigration legislation. House Minority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has publicly promised there will be no immigration legislation voted on in the House of Representatives for the rest of 2013, something Ryan does not agree with as evidenced by this interview he did with the Des Moines paper. McCarthy, House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), House Speaker John Boehner, House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and scores of other Republicans and conservatives have publicly come out in opposition to ever going to a conference committee with the Senate “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Ryan is on record as being supportive of a conference committee, and refused to join the rest of House Republicans save for a few outliers who also support amnesty in denouncing any effort to save the Senate bill via conference after Speaker Boehner publicly promised last week there would never be a conference.
Ryan has taken a beating in polls for his support for amnesty. Ryan and Senate Gang of Eight GOP frontman Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)–who has since expressed regret for supporting the Senate bill and publicly opposed conference committee in a Breitbart News exclusive—combined for less than 10 percent of the total support from GOP base voters in the straw poll at the recent Values Voter Summit. Those GOP base voters are the same people who York noted did not show up to vote for Romney and Ryan at the polls last November–the real reason the GOP lost its shot to unseat incumbent President Barack Obama in November 2012.

At the beginning of the year, President Barack Obama’s new 501(c)4 political nonprofit, Organizing For Action, was launched with all the usual bells and whistles. But the tech wizards at OFA forgot one important rule in today’s Internet world: Register all the iterations of your website address before someone else does. 
Now Obama’s team is filing complaints against the folks smart enough to get the addresses before he did.


As Obama’s OFA made its debut, no one in his purportedly Internet-savvy campaign had obtained the corresponding .com, .net, .org or .us sites, nor did OFA register other names that are close to its official one, as is the sensible practice. In the case of the .net address, a fellow named Derek Bovard had already registered the .net address by the time Obama’s team took notice.
Bovard has routed his new site to the homepage of the National Rifle Association.
So, whenever anyone goes to www.organizingforaction.net they end up seeing the homepage of the NRA.

Naturally, Obama and his fellow community organizers were furious. So furious, in fact, that they have replied by filing complaints against Bovard–and, apparently, a variety of other people who had registered domain names that OFA now wants. 
Obama’s group filed the complaints with the authority that governs website domain addresses, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The complaints were filed under Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) rules. Obama’s case number is 1483257 and was filed on Feb 6. UDRP cases are usually decided within one to two months after first filing.
Bovard told Breitbart that he feels he has a solid case that he owns the .net address fair, square, and legally.
“We have been granted ‘Service Mark’ #85838531 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the website as ‘Providing an on-line website featuring information on the United States Constitution and Conservative values’ and we were also the first to use it in ‘commerce.’ So I don’t believe they have any valid legal ground to stand on in regards to this website name. Before purchasing this site I had checked TESS (Trademark Electronic Search System) for any existing Trademarks or Service Marks and found none. I also searched for any existing companies called Organizing for Action and found none. So I bought it, legally.”
Bovard said he intends to use the site address to provide “information on the United States Constitution and Conservative values.”
“This site is going to be used strictly to discuss political views and ideas based on Conservative Values, the US Constitution, the Bill of Rights and Freedom of Speech in the USA which seems to be overlooked quite often. My partner and I are firm believers in not only the First and Second Amendment Rights, but in ALL Rights granted to us by our country, my country.”
Bovard also disputed several reports that he offered the address for sale to team Obama.
“I also want to make it perfectly clear that I have no intentions of selling this website name to Obama’s group nor did I purchase it with the intent of selling it to them or anyone else. It’s never been for sale, I’ve never solicited it for sale. I have indicated a personal opinion about it’s worth but that’s it.”
“We have taken what little action we could to contribute to the fight against anyone who attempts to defy or go against the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the rights contained within them. We are sickened by the mockery being made of our country and our government and then advertising this mess to our fellow citizens and the rest of the world,” Bovard said in an email.

In the final weekend of the campaign for Virginia Governor, Republican Ken Cuccinelli has announced rallies with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Congressman Ron Paul, among other Republicans. The Cuccinelli campaign has put its hopes for a come-from-behind victory in energizing base Republican and conservative voters. Walker and Paul both have unique appeal with voters Cuccinelli needs on Tuesday. 
Walker will attend two rallies for Cuccinelli on Saturday, appearing in Spotslyvania and Woodbridge, two Northern Virginia suburbs were the Republican needs a strong vote. Ron Paul will attend an evening rally on Monday, the eve of the election in Richmond. 
Libertarian candidate Richard Sarvis has unexpectedly polled strongly in the race, attracting around 10% of voters. According to polls, Sarvis is drawing more support away from Cuccinelli than Democrat McAuliffe. Ron Paul has a very strong following among Sarvis supporters and his appearance with Cuccinelli is meant to stem the tide of defections from the Republican. 


For most of the campaign, Cuccinelli ran a very conventional race. He downplayed his conservative positions and focused on more narrow Virginia-specific issues. After an exceptionally negative campaign, both he and McAuliffe have high negative ratings with voters. With turnout expected to be low, Cuccinelli is returning to conservative themes to energize grass roots turnout. 

On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Cuccinelli, at least twice, mentioned he was the “pro-liberty” candidate. He reiterated his early opposition to ObamaCare. He stressed that Obama’s campaigning this weekend for McAuliffe made the election a “referendum” on ObamaCare. Cuccinelli is, at last, trying to nationalize the election. 
McAuliffe’s decision to campaign with President Obama is risky. It is also a sign that the Democrat is worried about his supporters’ enthusiasm. While he has slightly more support among Democrats than Cuccinelli has among Republicans, his high personal negatives could dampen turnout of voters he needs. 
Cuccinelli does not hold a lead in any public poll. McAuliffe has held a small, but steady, lead in the polls for several weeks. A Cuccinelli victory on Tuesday would be a big upset, but one that is possible given the expected low turnout. 
Scott Walker and Ron Paul excite key segments of the voters Cuccinelli needs. We’ll know Tuesday if it is enough.

FALLS CHURCH, Virginia — While giving a speech endorsing Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s Virginia gubernatorial bid at a small concert and theater venue just outside Washington, D.C., former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took several veiled shots at President Barack Obama and the way her 2008 Democratic primary opponent has run Washington since being first elected five years ago. 
While Clinton never mentioned Obama by name, she used innuendo and some indirect references to try to separate herself from the president ahead of what is widely expected to be another run at the White House for her in 2016. 
“I thought hard about what I wanted to say to Virginians today,” Clinton opened her remarks by saying. “I’ve been out of politics for a few years now. I’ve had a chance to think a lot about what makes our country so great, what kind of leadership is required to keep it great.”


Later in the speech, Clinton noted her work as Secretary of State and said she has come across leaders worldwide who divide and leaders who unite, a reference to Obama’s aloof and divisive style of politics and leadership.
“I’ve spent four years traveling across the globe, a great honor and privilege to represent all of you,” she said. “I’ve learned even more about what it takes to make the decisions, what it takes to bring people together to build the kind of future that we all want for our children and grandchildren. I’ve seen leaders who are divisive. And I’ve seen leaders who are unifiers. I’ve seen leaders who are exclusive. And I’ve seen leaders who are inclusive.”
A few minutes later, Clinton got even more direct in her criticism of current leadership in Washington, D.C., presumably a reference to both how Republicans and Democrats have handled ongoing policy battles.

“Now recently in Washington, unfortunately, we’ve seen examples of the wrong kind of leadership,” Clinton said. “When politicians choose scorched earth over common ground, when they operate in what I call the ‘evidence-free zone’ with ideology trumping everything else. We’ve seen that families in Virginia and across the country have felt the consequences, workers furloughed, businesses suffering, children thrown out of Head Start, poor mothers worried they won’t get the help they need to buy formula and food for their babies, that is not the kind of leadership we need in Virginia and America today.”
Clinton then touted bipartisanship, something that has been Obama’s weakest trait since being elected–a fact that has been on display even more so in recent weeks during the government shutdown and debt ceiling debate.
“Virginia has a history of getting it right, of electing problem-solving governors like Mark Warner and Tim Kaine,” she said. “We know well that both Mark and Tim reached across the aisle, focused on getting answers to the questions that Virginians had. That is the kind of leader Terry is. That is the kind of governor he will be.” 
“For example, when Gov. McDonnell worked with the legislature to make historic investments in transportation that are vital to Virginia’s future, Terry supported him and the legislature every step of the way,” she explained. “Some might say: ‘Why would he do that? It’s a Republican governor and a Republican legislature.’ Well, there’s a simple answer: It was the right thing to do.”
Clinton also took a shot at people who are corrupted by ideology, by special interests, or both–another sideswipe at Obama. Much of the liberal base of the Democratic Party is upset that Obama has not been stricter with Wall Street and is similarly upset that he seems more consumed with ideology than with solving problems.
“If it’s only about yourself, if it’s only about you wanting to get a job and get the perks that go with it and, you know, have people stand up when you come into a room, that’s not enough anymore because it’s hard,” Clinton said. “Politics is hard, as the lieutenant governor and attorney general candidates know, because people are weary.” 
“They’re wondering ‘Could I give this person my vote and will he then remember me? If I vote for him or her, will they do what I heard them say they will do? Will they get diverted by big money or ideology or power will they remember who put them into office?'” she continued. “I can tell you, you don’t have to worry about that with Terry McAuliffe.”

The New York Times was quick to report on the edited Mother Jones “secret” video of Mitt Romney speaking at a fundraiser back in May, and they were quick to do so in a straightforward way. Their original story has been wiped from their website and replaced with one dripping with left-wing spin to the point you’d think it was a press release from the Obama campaign. 
Unfortunately for the Times, there are a lot of websites that republish their work the minute it’s posted. That means it lives forever, even after they’ve killed it.


It’s unfortunate for them, but very fortunate for those of us who like to expose how media bias works. 
The original piece contains this paragraph:
Romney told reporters Monday night that his remarks were “not elegantly stated” and were “spoken off the cuff.” But he says Obama’s approach is “attractive to people who are not paying taxes.”

In the new piece that paragraph reads like this:
Mr. Romney addressed the video, somewhat awkwardly, at a fund-raiser Monday night in Costa Mesa, Calif., summoning reporters with a few moments’ notice to walk through the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, which was filled with guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.
The first one simply conveys facts, the second one adds commentary designed to paint a picture of bumbling with “somewhat awkwardly” and of elitism with “guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.” 
But it doesn’t end there.  
The original reads:

Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was “shocking” that Romney would “go behind closed doors” to describe nearly half of the country in such terms.
Again, straightforward reporting. But the new version reads quite differently:
Mr. Romney, who has been under fire for releasing only two years of his tax returns, was quickly attacked by the Obama campaign. Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was “shocking” that Mr. Romney would “go behind closed doors” to describe nearly half of the country in such terms. 
Weird how, in a story that has absolutely nothing to do with tax returns, the Times feels the need to editorialize about Romney’s tax returns. The only people “firing” at Romney for his tax returns are on the payroll of the Obama campaign and “journalists” who write things like this that read as if they’re padding their resume for a position in a second term. 
The new version of the story has nearly double the words as the original and is full of editorializing of the sort listed above. The original reads like a news story. 
In a tale of two stories, the former “new” version is committed to attacking Mitt Romney and reelected the President, the latter is simply committed to conveying facts. That’s probably why the former has been scrubbed from the Times‘ website and latter exists.

On Thursday, semi-retired radio talker Neal Boortz predicted the Republican Party will not win control of the U.S. Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, despite all the pitfalls the Democrats and President Barack Obama are facing, particularly with regards to Obamacare.
The reason, Boortz said, would be the GOP’s tendency to run on issues related to social conservatism.


Boortz explained the importance to the republic for a GOP win next year while guest hosting Sean Hannity’s Thursday radio show:


This whole thing about Phil Robertson and what have you – it speaks a lot to what we have coming up in the election next year. We desperately need to get the Democrats out of control of the United States Senate. The survival of our republic may depend on getting the Democrats out of control of the Senate, sending Harry Reid into the position of minority leader in the U.S. Senate – the survival of the republic may depend on that. And the Democrats are afraid that is indeed what is going to happen. That is why Harry Reid pulled the nuclear option a couple of weeks ago – because they were afraid we may lose the Senate.

However, Boortz admitted he did not think the Republican Party would succeed in saving the republic because it could not resist the temptation to run on social issues in the upcoming midterms.

Let me tell you what I think is going to happen – I don’t think the Republicans are going to take the Senate next year. They’ll keep the House, but they’re not going to get the Senate and I’ll tell you why – because they simply cannot resist the urge, the impulse to get into this social conservatism. The Republicans can’t run on fiscal responsibility. The Republicans, they can’t get out there and say, ‘Look, we are trillions of dollars in debt.’ They can’t stick to that. They can’t say, ‘We need private sector options to ObamaCare that can give people choices in the private marketplace.’ They can’t do that. They can’t stick to fiscal conservatism. They can’t stick to the small government message. The Republicans have this drive, this maniacal, this obsessive drive to get into social conservatism.

Boortz pointed to the race for the seat currently occupied by outgoing Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA). He noted that it could be a loss for the GOP should they nominate Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA) in a contest that might have Michelle Nunn, daughter of former longtime Sen. Sam Nunn (D-GA), as the Democratic opponent.

11969	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/18/Why-Obama-Fears-the-Gettysburg-Address	News	0	Elections	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
President Barack Obama has elected not to attend the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address on Tuesday, Nov. 19th. Instead, he will be meeting with Senators at the White House to persuade them not to impose new sanctions on Iran, and to convince them of the merits of an agreement that will allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium at low levels. No doubt, that is important–but it is also a revealing choice.
Lincoln’s speech is remembered because it expressed, simply and elegantly, why hundreds of thousands risked their lives for an idea: “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” When President Obama sought to rouse Americans to support a “targeted military strike” on Syria, he failed to move the nation. Now, he prefers to counsel the nation to accept a weak compromise with tyranny.


The contrast is striking. Obama has repeatedly likened himself to Lincoln, launching his presidential campaign from the Old State House in Springfield. He cast his candidacy as the fulfillment of the promise Lincoln made at Gettsyburg–“that all men are created equal.” Like Lincoln, Obama came up through the Illinois legislature. Like Lincoln, Obama became known for his oratory. But Lincoln’s speeches had something Obama’s never will.

Lincoln’s speeches are admired not just because they are well-constructed, but because they contain timeless principles to which he devoted his career and to which he committed the nation. The fate of Obama’s speeches is to serve a political purpose, then fade. His speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, an appeal to unity, launched his national career. Today, it is largely forgotten amidst the failures of his divisive presidency.
Obama’s address on race in Philadephia, in the midst of the 2008 presidential primary, was praised by Chris Matthews and mainstream media as “a speech worthy of Abraham Lincoln.” Yet just weeks after declaring he could “no more disown” his pastor, the race-baiting Jeremiah Wright, than he “could disown the black community,” Obama severed ties with Wright and his church, the platitudes of Philadelphia quickly cast aside.
Lincoln’s speeches were more than words–which is why his words are still cherished. The highlight of the commemoration at Gettsyburg in 1863 had been the 13,000-word speech by Edward Everett, a rousing, anti-Confederate diatribe. But Lincoln did not distinguish among Union and Confederate dead. All, he suggested, fought in their own way for the same cause. He was committing the nation, and himself, to reconciliation.
Obama has never shown the same inclination to put partisanship aside for the sake of the nation’s needs. He has coveted the aura of Lincoln’s charisma, but has never humbled himself to learn from Lincoln’s example the way Ronald Reagan humbled himself before “The Boys of Pointe du Hoc.” For Obama to speak at Gettysburg, to stand where Lincoln had once stood, would only sharpen the contrast. That is why he is staying away.

11991	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/14/New-Report-Scales-Back-Global-Warming	News	1	Environment	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

On September 27, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will release part of their fifth assessment report on climate change. For the first time since 1990, this report will scale back the hysteria on global warming.
Matt Ridley at The Wall Street Journal viewed a few leaks from the 31-page document and talked to one of the senior climate scientists. The temperature rise due to man-made carbon dioxide is lower than their prediction in 2007. Originally a three degrees Celsius increase was predicted, but that number is now expected to be between 1-2.5 degrees Celsius. 

Specifically, the draft report says that “equilibrium climate sensitivity” (ECS)–eventual warming induced by a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which takes hundreds of years to occur–is “extremely likely” to be above 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), “likely” to be above 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and “very likely” to be below 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit). In 2007, the IPPC said it was “likely” to be above 2 degrees Celsius and “very likely” to be above 1.5 degrees, with no upper limit. Since “extremely” and “very” have specific and different statistical meanings here, comparison is difficult. 
Most experts believe that warming of less than 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels will result in no net economic and ecological damage. Therefore, the new report is effectively saying (based on the middle of the range of the IPCC’s emissions scenarios) that there is a better than 50-50 chance that by 2083, the benefits of climate change will still outweigh the harm. 
Warming of up to 1.2 degrees Celsius over the next 70 years (0.8 degrees have already occurred), most of which is predicted to happen in cold areas in winter and at night, would extend the range of farming further north, improve crop yields, slightly increase rainfall (especially in arid areas), enhance forest growth and cut winter deaths (which far exceed summer deaths in most places). Increased carbon dioxide levels also have caused and will continue to cause an increase in the growth rates of crops and the greening of the Earth–because plants grow faster and need less water when carbon dioxide concentrations are higher. 

Ridley pointed out that many papers in the last year have come to this same conclusion. Scientists at the University of Illinois and Oslo University in Norway found the ECS levels would be lower than the models showed. Three papers followed, including one produced by 14 lead authors of the IPCC report, that backed the evidence. Francis Zwiers and others at the university of Victoria, British Columbia found that global warming was overestimated by 100% over 20 years.

All Friday morning, every hour on the hour, CNN has been broadcasting a fear-mongering segment about rising water levels in the city of Miami, Florida. The hysterical CNN reporter not only blames Global Warming but also any country that burns energy. You can watch the segment below, but what you won’t see are CNN anchors Carol Costello and Ashleigh Banfield fret over the fact that we are all doomed:

What the anti-science CNN is withholding from its audience, though, is the good news that there actually is no Global Warming. Global temperatures have not increased for fifteen years. Moreover, we have just learned that the Antarctic sea ice is at its highest level in 35 years. 

CNN is lying through the dark art of omission. Context is kryptonite to any left-wing media outlet trying to pose as objective.  
Moreover, if CNN truly believed that burning energy dooms the planet and mankind, why doesn’t CNN go off the air? The energy this network burns to spew anti-science reports likely puts more carbon in the air in an hour than I will during my entire lifetime — and I regularly burn tires in front of my hippie neighbors. 
But that is the whole thing with these anti-science Global Warming truthers, isn’t it — that they don’t behave like people who actually believe burning energy is dooming the planet. And that is because they know it is a lie. Global Warming is a left-wing hoax; it is not some coincidence that the only way to save the planet is to check off every box on The Socialist Wishlist.   
When Carol Costello and Ashleigh Banfield rent a single room, ride a bike, and throw away the overused stair-stepper, that might get my attention. 
As it is, though, CNN is not only dishonest and anti-science; they are a bunch of flaming hypocrites.

12030	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/12/Obama-Ethanol-Policy-Eroding-Conserved-Lands	Opinion	1	Environment	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Doug Davenport, a Department of Agriculture official, is a true believer in the conservation of America’s land. When Davenport told the Associated Press he was deeply concerned about the havoc ethanol production was causing to these lands, he got an email from Tom Vilsack, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. The message was to stop talking.
Vilsack wants to make sure all are in line: “We just want to have a consistent message on the topic.” Recently, he insisted to an audience of ethanol lobbyists on Capitol Hill that being for ethanol is a good thing. In contrast, environmentalists argue that the push for ethanol has increased prices for corn, incentivizing farmers to convert millions of acres of erodible land for the planting of additional corn fields. This practice has ruined the lands, poisoned streams, and devastated fragile eco-systems.


Converting corn to ethanol was conceived as a “green” program to decrease fossil fuel emissions and to therefore aid in the reduction of global warming. Unfortunately, “green” programs sometimes don’t turn out so green. The mandate which dictates that gasoline have a certain percentage of ethanol has proven to be ineffectual when looking at the overall energy equation in America. 

Since Barak Obama came into office five years ago, he has proselytized and created policy encouraging farmers to reap the rewards of ethanol production. As a result, five million acres of green grassy rolling hills that had been reserved for conservation purposes are gone. Moreover, the process of growing this vast amount of corn draws upon countless other energy sources, using excessive water resources and increased natural gas and coal usage. The rise in fertilizer usage has amplified nitrates and nitrogen in water streams, creating aquatic dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Sadly, children have also been stricken with “blue baby” syndrome as a result of the nitrate poisoning.
 All of this leads to the conclusion that this slaughter of our environment is not only destructive but pointless. In a Congressional report on the effects of ethanol production, the EPA indicated it was “uncertain” that farmers should plant on land set aside for conservation, while the Department of Energy was resolute, saying conservation land “is unsuitable for use for annual row crop production.” 
Bob Sussman, retired EPA senior policy counsel, lamented, “I don’t remember anybody having great passion for this.” He added, “I don’t have a lot of personal enthusiasm for the program.”

President Barack Obama will deliver a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday afternoon in which he will call for new regulations aimed at restricting carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, not just new ones. Previously, Obama had aimed regulations at new coal plants. Shares of U.S. coal stocks plummeted ahead of the speech, though the Washington Post suggested global market turmoil played a role.
The Obama administration has been uniquely hostile to coal and other fossil fuels, despite the fact that the rapid expansion of natural gas development through “fracking” and oil production from shale deposits has driven much of the growth that the U.S. economy has mustered during his presidency. Permits for oil and gas exploration and development on federal land have slowed; offshore oil and gas activity has been blocked, especially after the Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010, even in defiance of the courts; and the Environmental Protection Agency has pushed new emissions rules despite Congress’s refusal to pass a cap-and-trade bill.


Obama has long singled out coal in particular. In January 2008, as he sought to outflank rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the left, then-Sen. Obama promised to “bankrupt” new coal plants. His administration issued heavy-handed new regulations on coal, forcing many plants out of production. And his left-wing supporters in Hollywood have cheered him on, encouraging him to bypass Congress, far from the job losses that will occur. Politicians of both parties in coal-producing state have protested, to little avail.

Earlier this week, seven governors wrote to the president to urge him to stop new EPA regulations on the new source performance standard (NSPS) for new coal power plants, arguing that they would cause plants to be shuttered, and pointing out the industry’s own progress on reducing emissions. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) was one of the seven, and wrote to the president: “It is imperative that abundant natural resources such as coal continue to be available to meet our base load electricity needs. I am convinced that we can achieve this goal, while lowering emissions. Significant technological advancements in generating plant efficiency and emission capture and reduction are within reach, but need regulatory flexibility that does not discriminate against our own home-grown energy resources if they are to be achieved.”
Nevertheless, Obama is expected to announce an expansion of regulations. The New York Times reported last week that the president would seek to apply regulations to existing coal plants as well as new ones. 
In his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany last week, President Obama warned of the need to take action against “coastlines that vanish, oceans that rise”–an echo of his much-lampooned 2008 speech in Minneapolis upon winning the Democratic nomination, in which he said that he was “absolutely certain” that future generations would remember his nomination and anticipated victory as the moment that “when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.”
For Obama and his most radical supporters, that moment was much delayed–perhaps, until today.

In the past two months, in attempts to offer an argument against same-sex marriage, two children have testified before their state legislators, countering other children who have been testifying for it. The two children testifying against it have either been crudely insulted or received death threats.


In February, speaking to the Minnesota House Committee on Civil Law, 11-year-old Grace Evans offered this statement:
My name is Grace Evans, and I would like to thank you for letting me speak today. Even though I’m only 11 years old, I know that everyone deserves to have a mom and a dad. If you change the laws that two moms or two dads can get married, it would take away something very important for children like me across the state. My mom is very important to me, because she teaches me things about being a girl. She is  kind, thoughtful, gentle and beautiful. She cares for me and others and listens vey well to the things I want to talk to her about. I am learning from her to be a good woman, wife and mother someday. Even though I learned some of these things from my dad, my mom teaches them in a very special way. Without my mom, it would be very hard for me to learn them. She is my role model in how to be a girl and I love her very much. My dad is also very important to me because he protects me and helps me get the confidence to be a girl who is growing up to be a woman. He takes care of problems in a way that my mom cannot. Just like the way my mom could not be the woman she is without my dad, I wouldn’t be the woman I want to be without my dad. Because he is strong, wise and different from my mom, I learn things from him that I would not be able to learn in the same way from my mom. Since every child needs a mom and dad to be born, I don’t think we can change that children need a mom and a dad. I believe God made it that way. I know some disagree, but I want to ask you this question: which parent do I not need, my mom or my dad? I’ll ask again, which parent do I not need, my mom or my dad? I hope that you can see that every child needs a mom and a dad. Please don’t change your law to say otherwise. Thank you for letting me speak today.
Her father, Jeff Evans, revealed the treatment Grace had received from political opponents:

We haven’t had any physical threats, but we’ve had some rather colorful comments about my 11-year-old. I’ve been monitoring it to keep my family safe and have a heads up on it. It’s really shameful the things that people will say, hiding behind an Internet alias. We see it as more representative of where political discourse is in our country, where you can’t take a position without receiving a great deal of flak, which is unfortunate.
YouTube comments included one calling Grace “an 11-year-old bigot.” Another said, “when did 11 year old children become so repugnantly smug? this is gross and offensive, and not just to gay people. single mothers, widowers, divorced parents… i mean,? just shut the fuck up until you until you’ve seen a little more of the world, puppet child.” On the Facebook page for A Minnesota news website, the heading read “Stupid Indoctrinated Child.”
Evans said, “Supporters of gay marriage are deceitfully claiming that the legalization of gay marriage won’t affect our religious freedoms or freedom of speech. I do not believe them. These attacks on Grace are an example of how we have already lost many of these freedoms. In fact, it’s so bad, they aren’t afraid to viciously attack an 11-year-old girl. Imagine what it will be like if gay marriage becomes legal in Minnesota.”
In January, Sarah Crank, 14, received death threats after testifying before the Maryland state senate. She testified:
Hi, I’m Sarah Crank. Today’s my 14th birthday, and it would be the best birthday present ever if you would vote “no” on gay marriage. I really feel bad for the kids who have two parents of the same gender. Even though some kids think it’s fine, they have no idea what kind of wonderful experiences they miss out on. I don’t want more kids to get confused about what’s right and okay. I really don’t want to grow up in a world where marriage isn’t such a special thing anymore.

It’s rather scary to think that when I grow up the legislature or the court can change the definition of any word they want. If they could change the definition of marriage then they could change the definition of any word. People have the choice to be gay, but I don’t want to be affected by their choice. People say that they were born that way, but I’ve met really nice adults who did change.  So please vote “no” on gay marriage. Thank you.
TFP Student Action, a Roman Catholic organization, recorded some of the threats on the YouTube video of Sarah’s speech went viral on homosexual websites. Some of them read:
                If I ever see this girl, I will kill her. That’s a promise.
Her parents should be exterminated.
Kill this child and his [sic] parent, for my 11 birthday would be a wonderful gift, thanks.”
I hope you? get raped by your married parents.–madisonen;
Stupid bi**h – I? hope you die on your Bday!!!!!–geminiboi007;
A dumb way for a dumb bi**h to? do dumb things. Stop talking nonsense that your Christian, Anti-Gay parents are force-feeding you through a thin straw, and learn to accept other people. Now shut up bi**h, before I smack you.–123adbnvcs

Nothing “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson said was anything close to anti-gay. It might have been characteristically blunt, but Robertson neither singled out homosexuals nor questioned the humanity of gay people. Robertson focused on sexual behavior, including the sexual behavior of heterosexuals. The major media are merely using Robertson’s quotes to advance their own anti-Christian bigotry by smearing Christian beliefs as de facto bigotry and launching a McCarthyist campaign to silence Christians. 
When you have major media outlets declaratively describing Robertson’s expression of his Christian beliefs as “anti-gay,” what you are really seeing is major media outlets outing themselves as anti-Christian. 


Politico. CNN. The Hollywood Reporter. Entertainment Weekly. Yahoo. Variety. And so on…
Robertson listed more than a half-dozen sins other than homosexual behavior, including a number of heterosexual behaviors, and “the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers”. 
It is certainly possible to try to disguise anti-gay bigotry as Christianity. Singling out gay people and not distinguishing between homosexuals as people and homosexual behavior are two of the most glaring examples. 

But Robertson did neither. What he did do was to speak a Christian truth about various sins, and the media know this. 
Anti-sin is not anti-gay. 
But because the media and left are desperate to toxify Christianity as bigotry and bully Christians into silence, Robertson’s remarks are seen as the perfect opportunity to do both. 
Of course it is an added benefit to the media to try to tarnish a culturally conservative mega-hit, and maybe drive it off the air. 
What we have here is nothing more than the media practicing McCarthyism and disguising it as tolerance. 

Notice how the media are not reporting on the most important thing Robertson said:

You put in your article that the Robertson family really believes strongly that if the human race loved each other and they loved God, we would just be better off. We ought to just be repentant, turn to God, and let’s get on with it, and everything will turn around.

Governor Sarah Palin put this exactly right when she said this is an attack on “all of us.” 
 

This post has been updated to add a correct Robertson quote about loving the human race.

If you want proof of how vicious the mainstream media is when it comes to punishing black conservatives for daring to be black and conservative, look no further than the media’s coordinated attack against the openly conservative Dr. Ben Carson for making the exact same kind of argument about same-sex marriage as Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor did on the exact same day. 
Tuesday night, during an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” Sean Hannity asked Dr. Carson about his thoughts on same-sex marriage. Here is Carson’s response in full: [emphasis added]


DR. BEN CARSON
Marriage is between a man and a woman. It is a well-established fundamental pillar of society, and no group — be they gays, be they NAMBLA [North American Man/Boy Love Association], be they people who believe in bestiality — no matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition. So it’s not something that’s against gays; it’s against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definition of pillars of society.  It has significant ramifications.
It took a few days for Media Matters and the rest of the organized-left to gin up the outrage needed to grab hold of the mainstream media’s attention. But by Friday afternoon, Dr. Carson found himself under direct fire. NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell brought Carson on her MSNBC show for a grilling, as did CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. 

Mitchell and Blitzer were equally horrified over what they characterized as Carson’s comparing of gay relationships to relationships that are considered immoral and illegal. Carson did apologize, but he also explained (in so many words) that he was not engaging in an argument of comparison, but rather a slippery-slope argument of where changing the definition of marriage could eventually lead. 
Obviously that is what Carson was doing. And as shown below, it is a commonplace thing to do and an important consideration when lawyers, judges, and adults discuss significant and fundamental legal changes of the sort raised by the question of same-sex marriage before the Supreme Court.  
But that didn’t matter to a CNN and NBC desperate to publicly destroy a man who “doesn’t know his place.” We’ve seen this media playbook before with Clarence Thomas, and most recently with Herman Cain. (In CNN’s defense, they did not stoop as low as NBC News.)
If you want proof that what NBC News and CNN engaged in yesterday was nothing more than an ideological witch hunt against a racial apostate, where was the outrage from this very same media on Tuesday after Justice Sotomayor raised the exact same kind of slippery-slope argument Carson did, herself citing illegal and immoral examples?
Below is from the official Supreme Court transcript of Tuesday’s oral arguments on the constitutionality of Prop 8, which bans same-sex marriage in the state of California. According to page 46 of the transcript, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor (a liberal Obama appointee) compared same-sex relationships to polygamy and the horrors of incest:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you’re being asked — and — and it is one that I’m interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to — that could get married — the incest laws, the mother and the child, assuming they are of age — I can — I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on — on protecting the a child until they’re of age to marry, but what’s left?
To be clear, I do not believe Sotomayor compared homosexuality to anything. What she did is what Dr. Carson did: she played devil’s advocate about the slippery-slope of what might come next if we open the Pandora’s box of changing the definition of marriage. And to make that argument, like Dr. Carson, she used illegal and immoral relationships (not homosexuality) as slippery slope concerns should the definition of marriage be held to include gay marriage.
But no one on the left or in the media cared that Sotomayor used the horror of incest to make a point about same-sex marriage — because Sotomayor is a leftist and they know which way she is going to rule. Moreover, the point she was making was obvious.
The point Carson was making was just as obvious. But because the right-leaning Carson is both black and conservative, which makes him a threat to the left-leaning mainstream media’s  attempted stranglehold on the Narrative, doesn’t “know his place,” Wolf Blitzer and Andrea Mitchell and NBC News and CNN played “gotcha” with him to “put him back in his place.”
Mitchell and Blitzer are not racists, but they do need to take a step back and realize that, in their zeal to aid and abet the left, they are wielding the same kind of double standards and show-trials of humiliation we saw in the segregated South. Back then it was all about the use of character assassination to keep blacks from obtaining the kind of political power that comes with public prestige. Today the media and left use similar tactics against those the media sees as “apostates” — especially black conservative men. 
And the goal is to send a message that says, “Shut up or this will happen to you.”

If anyone wants to argue that the same government currently forcing religious institutions to purchase the abortion pill through ObamaCare will not eventually use civil rights violations in order to attempt to force the Church to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies — good luck with that.  
But this would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
It was just three months ago that the White House and media piled on a reverend for preaching the Bible’s teachings on homosexuality. The result was his invitation to speak at Obama’s inauguration being rescinded. 


This would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
With the election of Pope Francis, we have news anchors openly clamoring that the Church is out of step on same-sex marriage.
This would have been unthinkable five years ago. 

Fifteen years ago, the same leftists and media assuring us today that same-sex marriage won’t be imposed on the Church were telling us that civil unions (which I’ve always supported) would never lead to gay marriage.
With all that in mind, am I really supposed to buy that, within five years (maybe five days), the left and the media won’t be incessantly asking this question: “If the Church cannot legally refuse to marry an interracial couple, how can it legally refuse same-sex couples?” 
There are many good and well-intentioned people who believe same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. Much of the support from the right comes from our “live and let live” philosophy, which I share. But another liberty is on the line, and that is religious liberty. This push from the media has never been about allowing gay couples to marry; it’s about the left’s lifelong crusade to destroy the Church. 
The endgame is to declare the Bible and Christian beliefs de facto bigotry:
I have a right to defend myself. And to point out the hypocrisy of people who justify anti-gay bigotry by pointing to the Bible, and insisting we must live by the code of Leviticus on this one issue and no other. 

That is not some crackpot talking. That is Dan Savage, who has worked with no less than President Obama. And Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi… And the media loves him. 
Once this idea turns into anything close to mainstream with the left, the left’s legal harassment and outright harassment against the Church will be unceasing. (Muslims, of course, will never be bothered.)
Offering committed same-sex couples the same legal rights (and headaches) married couples enjoy is something I have supported for about twenty years. 
Civil unions are something I feel strongly enough about that, here in North Carolina, I did not vote in favor of making same-sex marriage unconstitutional last year. My concern was that the wording of the referendum would give lawmakers the power to ban civil unions. 
But I oppose same-sex marriage because marriage is a sacrament, and there is a big difference between asking one to be tolerant, and demanding one condone. 
Being gay is no more a sin than being straight. But just as straight people can engage in sinful behavior, so can gays. Asking me to condone anyone’s sinful behavior is asking too much. That is the complete opposite of bigotry, by the way — you know, applying the exact same standard to everyone. 
But when the State and its media attempt to force the Church to condone such a thing (and they will), what is unthinkable to many of the well-intentioned today will become a terrible reality. 
UPDATE: Erick Erickson at RedState:

Within a year or two we will see Christian schools attacked for refusing to admit students whose parents are gay. We will see churches suffer the loss of their tax exempt status for refusing to hold gay weddings. We will see private businesses shut down because they refuse to treat as legitimate that which perverts God’s own established plan. In some places this is already happening. …
The left cannot allow Christians to continue to preach the full gospel. We already see this in, of all places, Canada. Gay marriage is incompatible with a religion that preaches that the unrepentant are condemned, even of a sin the world has decided is not one. The religious freedom will eventually be ended through the judiciary. We should work to extend that freedom as long as we can.
Now many of you have read through this and you are shaking your head in denial. “No way this is possible,” you say. But then just a decade ago no one seriously considered gay marriage as possible. And we are already seeing signs we’re headed in this direction. It’s coming. Get ready.

In a display of utter political incoherence, President Obama plans to meet with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocates in Russia while visiting the Kremlin, even as he attempts to lobby Russian President Vladimir Putin for support on an international military action against Syria. Russian opposition to American intervention in Syria has been a major factor in Obama’s decision to seek approval from Congress for military action in Syria. On Saturday, Obama blasted the UN Security Council, a veiled reference to Russia, by calling it “completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold [Syrian President Bashar] Assad accountable.”
While in Moscow, Obama plans to meet with human rights activists Lev Ponomarev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, legal aid non-governmental-organization director Pavel Chikov, and Coming Out.


Russia and the United States have been at odds over myriad issues over the past few months, including Russia’s grant of asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden, Russia’s law against “gay propaganda,” and Russia’s Middle Eastern policy in support of Iran and Syria.

President Obama’s language has become markedly dismissive of Putin and Russia; in a recent press conference, Obama characterized Putin as demonstrating the body language of a “bored kid in the back of a classroom.” That language was said to have infuriated the notoriously prickly Putin. During that same press conference, Obama said, “One of the things I’m really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we’re seeing there.”
The White House website brags about Obama’s stellar relationship with Russian leadership: “In one of his earliest new foreign policy initiatives, President Obama sought to reset relations with Russia and reverse what he called a ‘dangerous drift’ in this important bilateral relationship.”

In a game-changer for the legal fight over same-sex marriage that gives credence to opponents’ “slippery slope” arguments, a federal judge has now ruled that the legal reasoning for same-sex marriage means that laws against polygamy are likewise unconstitutional. 
In his 91-page opinion in Brown v. Buhman, on Dec. 13, U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups struck down Utah’s law making polygamy a crime. In so doing, he may have opened Pandora’s Box. 
As a condition for becoming a state in 1896, Congress required Utah to outlaw polygamy, which is marriage between three or more persons. This case involved a family of fundamentalist offshoots of nineteenth-century Mormonism. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints disavowed polygamy in 1890, and again in 1904, but some splinter groups continue the practice. 


Waddoups’ opinion would not only cover such groups, however, but also Muslims or anyone else who claims a right–religious or otherwise–to have multiple-person marriages. He notes that the Supreme Court ruled against polygamy in its 1878 case Reynolds v. U.S., but said he cannot simply rest upon that decision “without seriously addressing the much developed constitutional jurisprudence that now protects individuals from the criminal consequences intended by legislatures to apply to certain personal choices.” 
In its 2003 Lawrence v. Texas case, the Supreme Court overruled previous sexuality precedents by declaring unconstitutional laws that made homosexual sodomy a crime, holding that although the Constitution says nothing about sex or marriage, there is nonetheless a right to consensual sexual activity between adults that government cannot regulate. This was over the vigorous dissent of conservative justices, who said that the Constitution commits such questions of marriage and morality to the states and the democratic process, and that therefore federal courts have no power to impose their own moral judgments.
The Lawrence case lays the foundation that has been cited for a decade now in court to make the case for a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. If government cannot forbid homosexual conduct, this argument goes, then neither can it deny those who define themselves by homosexual behavior to officially recognize any such relationship as a marriage. It began a political, religious, and philosophical debate in America between two different definitions of marriage and family. 

For over 5,000 years of recorded human history, marriage laws worldwide were about providing a social structure for producing and raising children. These laws simply acknowledged the biological reality that only sex between a man and a woman can produce a baby, and that, correspondingly, that every child born into the world has two parents, one of which is a man, the other a woman. 
Marriage laws were designed to secure parental rights for that man and woman over the child they had created, and also imposed strict duties and obligations on each of them for raising that child. As part of that, those laws also bound the man and woman to each other, imposing obligations of sexually exclusivity, mutual care, and support. 
Those laws were created for the nurturing of those children, and assign the gender role of demanding the man’s protection and support of the woman during pregnancy and once the children were born. They were designed primarily for the protection of children, and secondarily for the support of women. 
A man and woman would form a new family to act as a single unit in society, and care for any children resulting from their monogamous sexual relationship. Thus, marriage has been defined as the union of one man and one woman. More precisely, it is the union of (1) two consenting persons, (2) of opposite biological sex, (3) who are not close blood relatives. 
The new conception of marriage, rooted in the proliferation of no-fault divorce laws in the 1970s and the sexual revolution, is that marriage is about personal happiness and fulfillment. People should be free to form whatever relationships they find personally satisfying and to follow whatever their personal sexual inclinations are to engage in whatever form of sexual behavior they find gratifying. 

If, therefore, you have a right to officially recognize those homosexual relationships through redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, then there is no reason to say it cannot include more than two people, so long as everyone is a consenting adult. 
This lawsuit is the brainchild of Prof. Jonathan Turley at George Washington University. He’s designed a two-step strategy, piggybacking on same-sex marriage: first, decriminalize polygamy, then assert a right to official recognition of polygamy. 
As Turley explained in previous court filings, he believes there is a “right to self-determination of private relations and family matters free of government intrusion.” He noted that many oppose polygamy, and goes on to assert that polygamists “are entitled to protection from such majoritarian animus and bias vis-à-vis their private lifestyles and relations. Their status under domestic law is a civil rights issue deserving the same protections afforded to homosexuals and other minority groups.”
The exact legal arguments for same-sex marriage equally apply to multiple-person marriages. Turley acknowledges that marriage laws that do not include both are “a tool for the imposition of a uniform moral agenda or tenets on citizens.”
Turley then goes on to make clear he is not only arguing for the form of polygamy technically called polygyny, which is one man with multiple women. In other words, he also argues for a right to polyandry (one woman with multiple men) and polyamory (multiple men with multiple women). 
Waddoups concluded that Reynolds has been overtaken by Lawrence and other recent legal developments. While keeping in place for now the Utah law against issuing multiple marriage certificates for polygamous marriage (the second step of the Turley strategy), he invalidated the criminal law against multiple adults cohabiting together as a family, which is the core of the laws against polygamy. 
This case will likely now go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver.

It worked last time. Last year, when oral arguments in the Obamacare case seemed to go against the administration, the left targeted Chief Justice John Roberts with a series of attacks from President Barack Obama on down. The attacks may have worked, as Roberts apparently changed his vote and upheld Obamacare by effectively rewriting the legislation itself to define the individual mandate as a tax.
The attacks on Roberts last year included President Obama’s general–and bizarre–assertion that the Supreme Court could not overturn congressional legislation, as well as a direct attack on Roberts by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), who admonished the Chief Justice about “the proper role of the judicial branch.” The left media joined in enthusiastically, bullying the Chief Justice into deferring to Congress and the President.


This time, the charge is being led by the left media, including Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post, who penned a front-page article attacking Roberts for his past rulings on race and discrimination. Roberts’s Obamacare decision, or his support for overturning most of Arizona’s allegedly discriminatory immigration law (another 2012 debacle) apparently earned no points from Grim, who castigates Roberts for ignoring race.

“Roberts has in the past been dismissive of the need for voting rights protections or affirmative action, viewing the world as without the sort of racism that might require such remedies,” Grim writes scornfully. He seizes on Roberts’s skepticism that the Defense of Marriage Act was motivated by anti-homosexual animus, pointing to a passage in the Congressional Record about the moral disapproval of homosexuality.
Grim makes use of a familiar left-wing tactic: casting moral disapproval of homosexuality as moral disapproval of gay people. Many supporters of traditional marriage are careful to distinguish between the two. Moreover, Roberts asked: “So eighty-four Senators–it’s the same question I asked before–eighty-four Senators based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people?” He was not denying that some might have acted out of animus, but doubting that all had done so.
The point was not lost on Justice Elena Kagan, who quoted the same passage from the Congressional Record to which Grim refers. She admitted, after Roberts’s question, that most Senators who voted for the act likely did not act out of anti-gay bigotry. Grim ignores that and twists Roberts’s words to cast him as willfully blind–not just to anti-gay bigotry, but bigotry in general.
There is, Grim implies, one way for Roberts to redeem himself–for the moment, anyway–and that is to vote to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. Then he can prove he is not blind, or bigoted himself–until the next constitutional controversy comes up, when the left will dip its pens in poison again and attack the Chief Justice, believing him to be the Court’s weakest link. Based on his recent history, they would not be wrong.

Gay rights, religious liberty, and free speech collide in a case offered this morning to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the justices take this case, it will be a defining case on American’s freedom to speak and act according to their religious beliefs when those beliefs include that marriage is between a man and woman. 
The case is Elane Photography v. Willock. Elane Huguenin is a photojournalist; she takes pictures to draw a narrative that conveys a story message. She and her husband Jonathan own and operate Elane Photography LLC. 
One type of work Elane does is photographing weddings in a way that celebrates marriage. Because the Huguenins are Evangelical Christians, they believe marriage is only the union of a man and woman. 


Breitbart News explained the facts and history of this case in a report on Aug. 22. Elane and Jonathan were assessed a fine by the New Mexico Human Rights Commission for declining to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony. (It’s not a marriage or civil union ceremony, because neither of those were recognized under New Mexico law at the time.) 
The New Mexico Supreme Court upheld that penalty, holding that Elane and Jonathan’s religious beliefs must be secondary to the cause of gay equality. As Breitbart News quoted one justice in the court’s opinion, “The Huguenins are free to… pray to the God of their choice… But there is a price, one that we all have to pay somewhere in our civic life.”
On Friday, the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), representing Elane Photography, filed a petition for certiorari at the Supreme Court of the United States, asking SCOTUS to reverse the New Mexico court. ADF specifically challenges the New Mexico ruling for violating the Huguenins’ First Amendment right of free speech, since it compels Elane and Jonathan to convey a message approving of gay marriage which is contrary to the Huguenins’ beliefs. 

The petition begins by quoting a recent U.S. Supreme Court case where the justices wrote, “At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression.”
This means that the government cannot compel a person to say something or convey a message that the person does not actually believe. The petition continues, “The First Amendment right to freedom of speech includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking.”
This case is vitally important in that it concerns whether people of faith–especially Christians who believe biblical teachings on marriage and sexuality–can be forced to choose between being true to their beliefs or putting food on their kitchen table by earning a paycheck in their chosen profession. As the petition explains regarding the New Mexico court’s decision:

Such disregard for the constitutional rights of these professionals threatens to drive them from the marketplace. Not only would that limit the expressive options available to the public, it would cost these individuals their livelihoods. Whether the First Amendment permits this result is a question that warrants this Court’s review.

Jordan Lorence is ADF’s lead counsel on this case. The New Mexico court found that Elane Photography is a “public accommodation,” like a restaurant or restroom that could not turn away a black or Hispanic person. Reacting to that declaration, Lorence told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement, “The First Amendment protects all Americans from government coercion forcing them to promote ideas they don’t support. Those in power should not misuse public-accommodation laws to punish those who decline to affirm the prevailing liberal orthodoxy on marriage.”
If the Supreme Court takes this case, it will mark the first time the Court draws the line between the gay-rights agenda and First Amendment rights of free speech and religious liberty–and who wins when those are in conflict. 
The Court should vote in January whether to take the case.

If you want proof of how vicious the mainstream media is when it comes to punishing black conservatives for daring to be black and conservative, look no further than the media’s coordinated attack against the openly conservative Dr. Ben Carson for making the exact same kind of argument about same-sex marriage as Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor did on the exact same day. 
Tuesday night, during an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” Sean Hannity asked Dr. Carson about his thoughts on same-sex marriage. Here is Carson’s response in full: [emphasis added]


DR. BEN CARSON
Marriage is between a man and a woman. It is a well-established fundamental pillar of society, and no group — be they gays, be they NAMBLA [North American Man/Boy Love Association], be they people who believe in bestiality — no matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition. So it’s not something that’s against gays; it’s against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definition of pillars of society.  It has significant ramifications.
It took a few days for Media Matters and the rest of the organized-left to gin up the outrage needed to grab hold of the mainstream media’s attention. But by Friday afternoon, Dr. Carson found himself under direct fire. NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell brought Carson on her MSNBC show for a grilling, as did CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. 

Mitchell and Blitzer were equally horrified over what they characterized as Carson’s comparing of gay relationships to relationships that are considered immoral and illegal. Carson did apologize, but he also explained (in so many words) that he was not engaging in an argument of comparison, but rather a slippery-slope argument of where changing the definition of marriage could eventually lead. 
Obviously that is what Carson was doing. And as shown below, it is a commonplace thing to do and an important consideration when lawyers, judges, and adults discuss significant and fundamental legal changes of the sort raised by the question of same-sex marriage before the Supreme Court.  
But that didn’t matter to a CNN and NBC desperate to publicly destroy a man who “doesn’t know his place.” We’ve seen this media playbook before with Clarence Thomas, and most recently with Herman Cain. (In CNN’s defense, they did not stoop as low as NBC News.)
If you want proof that what NBC News and CNN engaged in yesterday was nothing more than an ideological witch hunt against a racial apostate, where was the outrage from this very same media on Tuesday after Justice Sotomayor raised the exact same kind of slippery-slope argument Carson did, herself citing illegal and immoral examples?
Below is from the official Supreme Court transcript of Tuesday’s oral arguments on the constitutionality of Prop 8, which bans same-sex marriage in the state of California. According to page 46 of the transcript, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor (a liberal Obama appointee) compared same-sex relationships to polygamy and the horrors of incest:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you’re being asked — and — and it is one that I’m interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to — that could get married — the incest laws, the mother and the child, assuming they are of age — I can — I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on — on protecting the a child until they’re of age to marry, but what’s left?
To be clear, I do not believe Sotomayor compared homosexuality to anything. What she did is what Dr. Carson did: she played devil’s advocate about the slippery-slope of what might come next if we open the Pandora’s box of changing the definition of marriage. And to make that argument, like Dr. Carson, she used illegal and immoral relationships (not homosexuality) as slippery slope concerns should the definition of marriage be held to include gay marriage.
But no one on the left or in the media cared that Sotomayor used the horror of incest to make a point about same-sex marriage — because Sotomayor is a leftist and they know which way she is going to rule. Moreover, the point she was making was obvious.
The point Carson was making was just as obvious. But because the right-leaning Carson is both black and conservative, which makes him a threat to the left-leaning mainstream media’s  attempted stranglehold on the Narrative, doesn’t “know his place,” Wolf Blitzer and Andrea Mitchell and NBC News and CNN played “gotcha” with him to “put him back in his place.”
Mitchell and Blitzer are not racists, but they do need to take a step back and realize that, in their zeal to aid and abet the left, they are wielding the same kind of double standards and show-trials of humiliation we saw in the segregated South. Back then it was all about the use of character assassination to keep blacks from obtaining the kind of political power that comes with public prestige. Today the media and left use similar tactics against those the media sees as “apostates” — especially black conservative men. 
And the goal is to send a message that says, “Shut up or this will happen to you.”

If anyone wants to argue that the same government currently forcing religious institutions to purchase the abortion pill through ObamaCare will not eventually use civil rights violations in order to attempt to force the Church to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies — good luck with that.  
But this would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
It was just three months ago that the White House and media piled on a reverend for preaching the Bible’s teachings on homosexuality. The result was his invitation to speak at Obama’s inauguration being rescinded. 


This would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
With the election of Pope Francis, we have news anchors openly clamoring that the Church is out of step on same-sex marriage.
This would have been unthinkable five years ago. 

Fifteen years ago, the same leftists and media assuring us today that same-sex marriage won’t be imposed on the Church were telling us that civil unions (which I’ve always supported) would never lead to gay marriage.
With all that in mind, am I really supposed to buy that, within five years (maybe five days), the left and the media won’t be incessantly asking this question: “If the Church cannot legally refuse to marry an interracial couple, how can it legally refuse same-sex couples?” 
There are many good and well-intentioned people who believe same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. Much of the support from the right comes from our “live and let live” philosophy, which I share. But another liberty is on the line, and that is religious liberty. This push from the media has never been about allowing gay couples to marry; it’s about the left’s lifelong crusade to destroy the Church. 
The endgame is to declare the Bible and Christian beliefs de facto bigotry:
I have a right to defend myself. And to point out the hypocrisy of people who justify anti-gay bigotry by pointing to the Bible, and insisting we must live by the code of Leviticus on this one issue and no other. 

That is not some crackpot talking. That is Dan Savage, who has worked with no less than President Obama. And Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi… And the media loves him. 
Once this idea turns into anything close to mainstream with the left, the left’s legal harassment and outright harassment against the Church will be unceasing. (Muslims, of course, will never be bothered.)
Offering committed same-sex couples the same legal rights (and headaches) married couples enjoy is something I have supported for about twenty years. 
Civil unions are something I feel strongly enough about that, here in North Carolina, I did not vote in favor of making same-sex marriage unconstitutional last year. My concern was that the wording of the referendum would give lawmakers the power to ban civil unions. 
But I oppose same-sex marriage because marriage is a sacrament, and there is a big difference between asking one to be tolerant, and demanding one condone. 
Being gay is no more a sin than being straight. But just as straight people can engage in sinful behavior, so can gays. Asking me to condone anyone’s sinful behavior is asking too much. That is the complete opposite of bigotry, by the way — you know, applying the exact same standard to everyone. 
But when the State and its media attempt to force the Church to condone such a thing (and they will), what is unthinkable to many of the well-intentioned today will become a terrible reality. 
UPDATE: Erick Erickson at RedState:

Within a year or two we will see Christian schools attacked for refusing to admit students whose parents are gay. We will see churches suffer the loss of their tax exempt status for refusing to hold gay weddings. We will see private businesses shut down because they refuse to treat as legitimate that which perverts God’s own established plan. In some places this is already happening. …
The left cannot allow Christians to continue to preach the full gospel. We already see this in, of all places, Canada. Gay marriage is incompatible with a religion that preaches that the unrepentant are condemned, even of a sin the world has decided is not one. The religious freedom will eventually be ended through the judiciary. We should work to extend that freedom as long as we can.
Now many of you have read through this and you are shaking your head in denial. “No way this is possible,” you say. But then just a decade ago no one seriously considered gay marriage as possible. And we are already seeing signs we’re headed in this direction. It’s coming. Get ready.

The Obama administration may have had direct involvement in shaping the Trayvon Martin shooting narrative, including direct involvement in forcing Sanford, FL sheriff Bill Lee to temporarily step down.
An Orlando Sentinel article detailing how the Department of Justice’s secretive Community Relations Service worked to bring about Sheriff Lee’s ouster raises troubling questions about the Obama administration’s involvement, especially when coupled with the cozy relationship that Attorney General Eric Holder has with one of the lead Trayvon Martin agitators, the Rev. Al Sharpton.
What is the DOJ’s Community Relations Service? The Sentinel article, entitled “DOJ ‘peacemakers’ helped Sanford stay cool amid rising tension,” paints a generally rosy, if slightly creepy, picture of the organization and its role during the Trayvon Martin shooting and the aftermath:


In their Navy blue windbreakers, polo shirts and dark sunglasses, they look like federal agents.
Their caps are embroidered with the Justice Department’s seal. They watch and listen silently. But they say little publicly.
When reporters try to chat them up, they remain stoic, saying simply they cannot talk to the media.
The peacekeepers have a specific mandate outlined in the 1964 Civil Rights Act to go into conflict zones within American communities that perceive discrimination or feel wronged because of their particular race, color or national origin.

However, the original mandate of the CRS was expanded with the passage of recent hate crime legislation. A 2010 article by liberal journalist Ryan Reilly on Main Justice quotes former Community Relations Service director Ondray T. Harris as saying the CRS had become more ‘preventative’.
Others give a less positive view of the CRS. One source familiar with the division describes them as “federal spies, federal muscle, all in the guise of mediation.”
The Sentinel quotes a number of people saying positive things about the CRS and their role in Sanford, but all of them appear to be people or organizations who were calling for George Zimmerman’s arrest, such as the Seminole County NAACP.

Despite claiming to be unbiased, DOJ head Eric Holder recently spoke in praise of Al Sharpton, one of the main agitators in the Trayvon Martin story, at an event hosted by Sharpton’s Nation Action Network–at the same time Sharpton was calling for increased civil disobedience.
According to the Sentinel, the Department of Justice and CRS had a hand in bolstering Rev. Al Sharpton’s claim of Police Department bias by helping to facilitate the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee Jr. from the Stanford Florida Police Department, just two days before President Obama’s Rose Garden statement about Trayvon Martin.
As the Orlando Sentinel reported:
They helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee, said Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
“People are more relaxed and satisfied when they know they have someone from the outside, like the DOJ who have no ties to the community to try and relax the emotions,” Clayton said

We have previously reported that in 2006, then Senator Barack Obama was involved in a Florida case with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump and Rev. Sharpton that acted as the publicity blueprint for the Martin case.
That connection has still not been reported in the mainstream media, and itself raises serious questions about the level of coordination between the Obama administration, Mr. Crump and Rev. Sharpton.

In 2011, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law California Assembly Bill 109, a piece of legislation designed to relieve overcrowded prisons in accordance with a Supreme Court decision. AB 109 enshrined “realignment” into law – a plan to place supposedly “non-violent, non-serious, and non-sex offenders” in county jails rather than state prisons. In other words, local governments were handed the problem of prisoners the state didn’t want to hold. On January 8, 2013, Brown said, “we’ve gone from serious constitutional problems to one of the finest prison systems in the United States.”

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation calls the realignment plan “historic legislation that has helped enable California to close the revolving door of low-level inmates cycling in and out of state prisons.” But in reality, realignment has created a revolving door for criminals: they cycle in, they leave, and they harm innocent citizens across the state.

David Mulder, 43, was shot and killed by police on Sunday night after stabbing a woman to death in a car near the San Bernardino Freeway. He had been released from prison early under realignment in September. 

Last week, a felon with convictions for grand theft auto, drug possession, receiving stolen property, and robbery was arrested for an alleged rape in Fontana. The former inmate, Juan Francisco Aguilera, 30, had been turned over to county supervision.
In February, 34-year-old Raoul Leyva was convicted of attempted voluntary manslaughter after beating his girlfriend, 21-year-old Brandy Marie Arreola, nearly to death. She still sits in a wheelchair, and has brain damage. She spent three months in a coma. Leyva was released early under realignment. He had already spent time in the system for domestic violence and parole violation.

These are not isolated incidents. They are evidence of a broad trend. According to statistics provided to Breitbart News by the office of Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, 11,473 criminals have been sent to Los Angeles County jails rather than state penitentiaries since realignment kicked in. Over 43,000 inmates are doing their time in local jails rather than state pen. By 2014, that number will skyrocket to 54,000. Now here’s the kicker: under the Brown realignment plan, Los Angeles county misdemeanor offenders will serve approximately 10-15% of their sentences. Then they will be released. That number will drop as jails become more crowded.
More criminals, more crime. According to statistics from the Los Angeles County Sheriff and Probation Departments, burglaries have increased dramatically, from 175% in Hawaiian Gardens to 45% in South Los Angeles to 50% in Compton; auto theft is up 365% in Artesia, 100% in Marina Del Rey, and 92% in Bellflower. The Criminal Justice Legal Foundation reports that in the six-month period after realignment, California’s crime rates rose across the board, including a 7.6% jump in homicide. The recent Northridge boarding house murderer, who killed four people execution style, was out thanks to realignment. Tobias Dustin Summers, wanted for kidnapping a 10-year-old Southern California girl, was out due to realignment.
For his part, Jerry Brown maintains that we don’t need more prisons. “I don’t think that’s smart, and I don’t think the law requires it, and moreover, management of a prison is quintessentially an executive function,” he said in January. The proof is in our hands, and it is bloody.

George Zimmerman was back in court today for a hearing on the start date for his trial on murder charges. Zimmerman, of course, was the Hispanic neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Florida, who trailed a young black man named Trayvon Martin after calling 911, got into an altercation with Martin in which Martin ended up pounding Zimmerman’s head into the pavement, and then ended up shooting Martin in the chest. The media used the Zimmerman case as an opportunity to bully Americans over their supposed racial intolerance. Even the President of the United States weighed in in the midst of an election cycle, suggesting that if he had a son, he’d look like Trayvon Martin.
Breitbart News had the opportunity to sit down for a one-on-one interview with George’s brother, Robert, in Los Angeles. Excerpts of that interview played tonight on Fox News’ Hannity.


Robert didn’t pull any punches about President Obama’s role in raising the threat level to his brother – and to his family. “We do feel that we’re threatened,” Robert told Breitbart News. “There’s not been a legal resolution in this matter. And even the day that there is legal resolution in this matter, the day that happens I don’t think that every single fear of some kind of retribution will simply just go way, but we’re coping as bets we can, day by day.”


Robert saved especially harsh criticism for President Obama, who inserted himself in the Zimmerman case, even inviting race-baiter Al Sharpton to the White House shortly after Sharpton threatened the town of Sanford over the Police Department’s decision not to arrest Zimmerman originally. When the President was asked about the Zimmerman case in the Rose Garden, Robert said, “Here was this president, from the backdrop of the Rose Garden, making comments about someone based on his skin color. I think we felt bullied, we were a little let down initially, and that disappointment grew because if you don’t have the support of at least the law on your side, of the most powerful man in the Western Hemisphere reminding the world that it is entitled to watch, reminding Americans that the world is watching and that we will get through this with due process, but instead bringing up statements about his skin color … it was alarming to say the least.”
Robert went further: “I don’t think a white president would have been able to get away with the same thing from the Rose Garden in an election season.”

The fallout to the Zimmerman family has been extreme. According to Robert, they often require security for everyday tasks. They have had to move around to avoid targeting. And now, George faces a trial in a case where many legal observers agree there is no evidence to support the prosecutor’s second degree murder charge. No matter what happens, George Zimmerman will, thanks to the President and the media, remain a racist in many Americans’ minds. “If you can’t rebut assertions of racism,” said Robert, “the noise kind of drowns you out. You’re really left defenseless, and you have no other choice but to go into hiding.”

When NBC News granted Al Sharpton the honor of having a prime time news show on their cable outlet, MSNBC, they lauded his role as an “elder statesman” of the Democratic Party. They named the show “Politics Nation” and positioned the nightly broadcast as a left-leaning political show focusing on national politics as a natural lead-in to “Hardball.”  It was a well-orchestrated PR strategy to distance Sharpton from his controversial and odious past as a race-baiting advocate for proven liars Tawana Brawley and the antagonist in the Duke Lacrosse case. 
The message was clear: Sharpton isn’t the charlatan race-baiter you’ve grown to loathe; he’s now a power player in the Democratic Party and is here to bring his unique, seasoned perspective to the national political conversation. 
Oh what a difference a year makes. 


These days, Politics Nation has turned into the Trayvon Martin Show as Sharpton goes right back to his roots as a sensationalist willing to advocate for any victim of a crime as long as they are the right race and the alleged perpetrator is white (or “white hispanic” in this case). 

Friday night Sharpton had Trayvon Martin’s family attorney on to discuss the George Zimmerman trial scheduled to begin in 10 days. Understand that Martin’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, has no actual standing in this case as it is the state of Florida against Zimmerman in these criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, Sharpton allowed Crump to lay out the state’s case against Zimmerman with Sharpton cheering and participating in the multi-media opening and closing arguments. By the time the segment was done, Zimmerman was all but tried and convicted with the most inflammatory and defamatory language possible: 

Crump:  When you really think about it in the totality of circumstances, George Zimmerman as this neighborhood watch patrol volunteer going around the neighborhood with a gun on prescription medication is every parent’s worse nightmare, because God help you if he comes up to your teenage child and says ‘what are you doing around here’ and your teenager doesn’t answer the question right. Then you have a Trayvon Martin situation at your doorstep. And we can’t have that in a law-abiding society.

Hearing that un-refuted and damning narration, no jury in the world would move to acquit Zimmerman. And that’s the point. Sharpton is using his NBC News platform to set the Zimmerman case up as an open and shut case of 2nd degree murder, and if anything short of a conviction comes from the Florida jury, well, you know the reason why. 
At that point, if Zimmerman is acquitted, get ready for Politics Nation to then be used to advocate for social justice and political unrest until there is “justice for Trayvon.” 
NBC News might as well replace Sharpton’s microphone with a bullhorn now. 
Watch the segment here:

(AFP) – African-American faith leaders vowed Tuesday to harness anger over the Trayvon Martin case to overturn “stand-your-ground” laws and reassert the case for greater civil rights.
Speaking outside Department of Justice headquarters, Reverend Al Sharpton announced a National Justice for Trayvon Day for Saturday with rallies outside federal buildings and court houses in more than 100 cities nationwide.


“People all over the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit,” said the civil rights firebrand, flanked by more than a dozen other African-American clergy members.
“This is a social movement for justice.”
Sharpton added that “tens of thousands” would converge on Washington for a protest march on August 24, the Saturday before the 50th anniversary of the late Martin Luther King’s historic mass march on the US capital.

Saturday’s acquittal of gun-toting neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed Florida teenager Martin has stirred anger and unrest across the African-American community.
Sharpton is pressing the Department of Justice to reopen a civil rights investigation into the incident that was suspended when Zimmerman was arrested six weeks after the killing.
US Attorney General Eric Holder, calling Martin’s death “tragic and unnecessary,” called Monday for a dialogue on the racially-charged issues it raises, but he stopped short of announcing civil proceedings.
Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, pledged a major campaign against so-called stand-your-ground laws in Florida “and 29 other states” that allow citizens who feel threatened to use lethal force in self-defense.
“The stand-your-ground law was not used directly at this (Zimmerman) trial, but it had everything to do with what happened at this trial,” he said, adding that such laws represented “a new threat to civil and human rights.”

“Let us be clear. It is now because of these laws where anyone walking, committing no crime, can be followed or approached by another civilian, and they can use deadly force and say it was self-defense,” he said.
“That is something that is frightening and cannot be allowed to sustain itself in this country.”
Setting out a strategy against stand-your-ground laws — including a boycott of corporations known to support such legislation — will be the topic of a three-day meeting of faith leaders in Miami next week, he said.
Separately, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday that pop music legend Stevie Wonder has vowed never to perform in any state or country with a stand-your-ground law on its statute books.
“I decided today that until the stand-your-ground law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,” it quoted Wonder as saying Sunday in Quebec City, where he was playing the Canadian city’s summer festival.
“As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.”

When the media can aid Obama’s re-election through the fabrication of a divisive and completely phony black vs. white racial narrative, then the media are very interested in hate crimes and American racism. But when the media are handed an actual hate crime that involves a black man accused of gunning down four white people because they are white, the media collectively shrug.
The media also claim to be interested in mass-shootings. For days and sometimes weeks, we have seen our media turn their outlets over to obsessive coverage of one mass shooting after another. So you would think a racially-motivated mass-shooting would explode in the media. 


But according to our media, not all racially-motivated crimes and mass shootings are alike. In fact, if the media see no political upside, some racially-motivated mass-shootings are ignored as though they never even happened.  
In Greenville, North Carolina, it is now official. According to the Grand Jury indictments, a black man named Lakim Faust entered a Walmart in June with more than a hundred rounds of ammunition, and targeted white people based on their race:
Police said Faust’s first victim on June 21 was an insurance adjustor in the parking lot of a law firm. He then crossed a five-lane highway and shot three more people in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart, investigators said.

Three of the four people wounded in the shooting suffered permanent and debilitating injuries, according to the indictments. Details of those injuries were not specified.
In a just world, a local crime such as this would not deserve national coverage. One man does not in any way say anything larger about our society as a whole. But I do not write the rules, the media does; and the media poses as an objective institution concerned with hate crimes — so concerned, in fact, that they went so far as to manufacture evidence as a way to falsely accuse the Hispanic George Zimmerman of being both white and a racist. 
But an actual, official hate crime in North Carolina is completely ignored by this very same media. 
The reason is obvious: the objective, unbiased, not-at-all-liberal media see no political upside in a hate crime that can’t be used to gin up the left’s version of white guilt, push gun control, or falsely portray America as a country where white people still oppress minorities and therefore need a larger government to right these wrongs. 
The media ignoring this racially-motivated murder spree also has nothing to do with protecting black people. 
Sadly, the media don’t care about black people. This is why Chicago is ignored. Hundreds of black people are gunned down every year in Chicago. But the national media refuse to pressure the politicians in charge of that city and state to do anything, because on paper Chicago is a Liberal Utopia. The city also enforces some of the strongest gun control laws in the country.
If the media questions what is happening in Chicago, that would be mean questioning the very foundation of liberalism. And the media simply doesn’t believe a few hundred dead black people is worth doing anything that might undermine their political agenda.

Another brilliant column from National Review’s Rich Lowry at Politico. Lowry makes the indisputable point that the same media that have spent years attacking the Tea Party, and months savaging the NRA, are now revealing brazen hypocrisy when it comes to protecting their own rights. In spirit and goal, the media are now one with the Tea Party and NRA.
What animates the Tea Party and NRA is a legitimate concern that the government — especially under President Obama — has made a disturbing pivot from their Constitutional requirement to protect our liberties, to infringing upon our liberties. In turn, Obama and his media label us as anti-government crazies suffering from paranoid delusions.  


But look at the reaction this week from that very same media in the wake of the Associated Press scandal. Suddenly the media don’t like Big Government doing to them what ObamaCare and background checks will do to the rest of us. Moreover, the very same media that suggest not trusting the government is a form of extremism, is now demanding a law be immediately passed to shield them from government intrusion. 
The media don’t trust the government anymore than we do. Who is the paranoid crazy now? 
Lowry:

At his briefing, Carney hung to the word “unfettered” like a drowning man. He said over and over again things like the president believes in an “unfettered ability to pursue investigative journalism” but that there should be “balance.” The implicit reaction in the room was: “Balance? Don’t give us any stinkin’ balance. Give us our rights.”
In this, the reporters exhibited a healthy impulse toward vigilance about liberty. The phrase “chilling effect” has been bandied about often. A chill comes not necessarily from what government is doing to you but from what it might do to you. Very few reporters will ever have their records secretly subpoenaed by the government, but it is intolerable to them that it could happen. On top of everything else, it is the principle of the thing — an infringement, or even a potential infringement, on the constitutional rights of even a handful of reporters is an affront to all.
There are lots of people who share this way of thinking about rights and government. Some of them gather every year at places like CPAC and the National Rifle Association annual convention.
We have just gone through a period when scorn was heaped on the NRA for opposing new gun rules out of the very same logic that compels reporters to react so strongly against the AP subpoena. The NRA will not abide an infringement on anyone’s legitimate right to bear arms, and it fears what could come of enhanced state power. Like the reporters, it casts a jaundiced eye on the reassurances of government. What they are to the First Amendment, it is to the Second.
Read it all.
At his Politico perch, Lowry is writing one of the best columns around. Keep an eye out for it.

Sen. John McCain (R-Sunday Shows) expressed bewilderment on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that GOP Sens. Cruz, Lee and Paul would filibuster gun control legislation. “I don’t understand it,” McCain said. “The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand.” With all due respect to Sen. McCain, that is almost completely backward. 
The purpose of the US Senate is not to be some federal debating society. It is not tasked with taking the great issues of the day and giving its “august” members a platform for their musings on policy. The public does not look to the Senate for guidance in its deliberations on the issues.
The Senate’s first, and only, task is to uphold the Constitution. Originally, the Senate was designed to act as the states’ check on an encroaching federal government. Senators were appointed by state legislatures to be their voice in Washington. The House was designed to be the voice of the people. Sadly, those days are long gone. 


Today, Senators are just House members juiced-up on steroids. Worse, they have a habit of putting decorum and the traditions and processes of the institution above foundational principles. 

“I don’t understand why United States senators want to block debate when the leaders said we could have amendments,” McCain noted.
If one believes a legislative proposal is, on its face, unconstitutional, the ability to offer amendments is of little solace. Sens. Cruz, Lee and Paul, among other Senators, believe legislation to limit gun rights is, by its nature, unconstitutional. Amending the legislation to make it slightly less unconstitutional is a fool’s game, and a large reason our federal government has grown so large. 
A filibuster against gun control legislation is upholding the greatest tradition of the Senate, i.e. acting as a bulwark against the federal government’s natural inclination to expand its power. Knowing how specific Senators voted on shredding the Constitution won’t put it back together again. Any proposal that tramples on constitutional rights should never grace the floor of the Senate.  
Sen. McCain, once the GOP candidate for President, is becoming marginalized within the GOP Senate caucus. New, more conservative, Senators are stepping up to defend Constitutional principles and becoming a vocal, loyal opposition to the Administration and its curtailing of our liberties. They should be applauded.

Speaking in the final Virginia gubernatorial debate on October 24, Democrat candidate Terry McAuliffe said he doesn’t care “what grade [he] got from the NRA” and that more gun control is necessary.
The debate took place at Virginia Tech, and McAuliffe referenced the 2007 shooting on that campus as justification for more gun control. 
Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli correctly stated more gun control would not have prohibited that shooting and that shooters like the killer in that instance, Seung-Hui Cho, are “almost impossible” to find before they decide to start shooting. McAuliffe replied, “Some people should not own guns.” He then defended his gun control proposals, saying: “I don’t care what grade I got from the NRA. I never want to see another Newtown or Aurora or Virginia Tech again.”


Cuccinelli’s argument is in line with experts on the subjects of firearms and the mentally ill. Mayo Clinic psychiatrist J. Michael Bostwick, M.D., recently wrote that more gun control aimed at the mentally will not end mass shootings. According to Bostwick, not even confiscating guns from the mentally ill will do that. 

He says this is because the great percentage of the mentally ill are not dangerous, while individuals who commit mass shootings and are mentally ill are usually only discovered to suffer from mental illness after the fact. 
On top of this, an internal investigation by a Virginia Tech Review Panel reported that more gun control would not have stopped the Virginia Tech shooting. Looking particularly at bans on “high capacity” magazines–bans which McAuliffe supports–the review panel said having 10 round magazines instead of 15 round magazines “would have not made that much difference in the incident.”

UPDATE 12:56 AM EST — 
(AP) Colo. lawmakers lose recalls over gun laws supportBy COLLEEN SLEVINAssociated PressDENVERTwo Colorado state lawmakers who backed gun-control measures in the aftermath of the mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut last year have been ousted in recall elections.Pueblo voters in Democratic Sen. Angela Giron’s district approved her recall, with results coming in late Tuesday. Returns earlier showed Democratic Senate President John Morse also lost his seat in Colorado Springs.In Giron’s race, voters chose Republican George Rivera, a former Pueblo police officer, to replace her.The firearms legislation package Giron supported this year included size limits for ammunition magazines and expanded background checks for private and online gun purchases.Her working-class district favors her party but includes Democrats who are big supporters of the Second Amendment.
UPDATE 12:26 AM EST — Senator Angela Giron is now down 60 to 40 with over half the votes counted and FOX31 Denver predicts she will follow Morse out the door.  Giron says she is not conceding yet and will wait for more votes to be counted before speaking.
UPDATE 11:37 EST — Morse has conceded. Morse said, “It has been an honor to represent the 11th Senate District. It’s been hugely rewarding.” He is the first Colorado legislator ever successfully recalled. He vowed that Democrats will continue the fight for gun control.
UPDATE 11 pm EST — With 75% of the vote in, Morse is now down 52 to 47.  
Kurt Bardella, a communications consultant for the Colorado recall effort, told Breitbart News: “If the early voting trends hold steady, history will be made in Colorado tonight that will reverberate throughout the country. After tonight, no one should underestimate the political potency of the gun-control debate. Democrats have targeted Colorado in recent cycles and have had some real success turning the state from red-to-purple. The fact that the sitting State Senate President is on the cusp of being the first-ever recalled state official in Colorado’s history should give anyone who is considering moving forward with additional gun control legislation real pause.”

With early voting results in, it looks as though Colorado state Senator Angela Giron (D-Pueblo) may be able to hold her seat, but Senate President John Morse (D-Colo. Springs) is in trouble.
Early voting was 52% to 48% against Morse. 


Ironically, it was Morse who not only ignored the voice of his constituents on gun control but actually went on television to say “he was proud he ignored [them].” 

At 10:20 PM EST, Basic Freedom Defense Fund Spokeswoman Jennifer Kerns told Breitbart News: “Early results indicate a four point lead in favor of the recall effort. While it is still early, the majority of the votes are in at this hour and it will be very difficult for Morse to overcome this margin.”
Giron said that if either she or Morse lost a recall election it meant NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s gun control group “might as well fold it up.”

Six gun companies have announced plans to stop selling any of their products to any government agency in states that severely limit the rights of private gun ownership.
Disappointed with New York State lawmakers and other jurisdictions around the country who have passed strict gun control legislation, the companies–composed of firearm manufacturers, gunsmiths, and sporting goods retailers–have announced these policies in the past week. 
Their various statements emphasize that such laws create a class of government employees with rights and and a class of citizens without rights. Thus, they refuse to aid the enforcement of such inequality.


The announcements read:

LaRue Tactical 


Effective today, in an effort to see that no legal mistakes are made by LaRue Tactical and/or its employees, we will apply all current State and Local Laws (as applied to civilians) to state and local law enforcement / government agencies. In other words, LaRue Tactical will limit all sales to what law-abiding citizens residing in their districts can purchase or possess.


Olympic Arms


Due the passing of this legislation, Olympic Arms would like to announce that the State of New York, any Law Enforcement Departments, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee of such an entity – will no longer be served as customers. 
In short, Olympic Arms will no longer be doing business with the State of New York or any governmental entity or employee of such governmental entity within the State of New York – henceforth and until such legislation is repealed, and an apology made to the good people of the State of New York and the American people. 


Extreme Firepower Inc, LLC 


The Federal Government and several states have enacted gun control laws that restrict the public from owning and possessing certain types of firearms. Law-enforcement agencies are typically exempt from these restrictions. EFI, LLC does not recognize law-enforcement exemptions to local, state, and federal gun control laws. If a product that we manufacture is not legal for a private citizen to own in a jurisdiction, we will not sell that product to a law-enforcement agency in that jurisdiction.


Templar Custom


We will not sell arms to agents of the state of New York that hold themselves to be “more equal” than their citizens.
As long as the legislators of New York think they have the power to limit the rights of their citizens, in defiance of the Constitution, we at Templar will not sell them firearms to enforce their edicts.
Templar Custom is announcing that the State of New York, any Law Enforcement Departments, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee will no longer be served as customers.


York Arms


Based on the recent legislation in New York, we are prohibited from selling rifles and receivers to residents of New York. We have chosen to extend that prohibition to all governmental agencies associated with or located within New York. As a result we have halted sales of rifles, short barreled rifles, short barreled shotguns, machine guns, and silencers to New York governmental agencies.


Cheaper than Dirt 


Recently, companies such as LaRue Tactical and Olympic Arms have announced that they will no longer sell prohibited items to government agencies and personnel in states that deny the right to own those items to civilians. It has been and will continue to be Cheaper Than Dirt’s policy to not to sell prohibited items to government agencies and/or agents in states, counties, cities, and municipalities that have enacted restrictive gun control laws against their citizens. We support and encourage other companies that share in this policy.

Second Amendment activist groups Guns Save Life and Grass Roots North Carolina are currently urging big gun manufacturers Sig Sauer, Smith and Wesson, and Glock to halt their sales to government agencies within states that have clamped down on their residents’ right to bear arms.

While the left is frequently up in arms about the about the Koch brother’s money funding political and campaign projects,  there is no shortage of big leftist corporate and foundation money floating around hot political issues. 
Both the Joyce Foundation and Google are established players in the anti-second amendment movement as well as other progressive political causes.


The Joyce Foundation has injected large chucks of money into the anti-gun movement, including Mayor’s Against Gun Control and the Violence Prevention Center.   (Aside: Who was on the Board of the Joyce Foundation? None other than President Barack Obama who keeps assuring us that he doesn’t want to take our guns away. Obama sat on the board of the Joyce Foundation from 1994-2002.)

Likewise, Google’s support for anti-gun “advocacy” is no secret. 
Specifically, they’ve banned results related to firearms and other products that they don’t deem to be “family safe.” Until recently, gun-related products appeared with other products in search results on the shopping section. Many of America’s 80 million gun owners have used Google as a powerful price-comparison tool. Not anymore.
And the connections go further, Ben Howe writes: 
We know that Obama campaign manager Jim Messina received personal mentoring on both technology approaches and management style from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, his friend since the 2008 campaign.  We know that Google employees overwhelmingly contributed to Democrats in the last cycle (and aggregate individual employee contributions outnumbered the company’s PAC contributions). We know that Google vice president and “chief Internet evangelist” Vint Cerf received a presidential appointment to the National Science Board following last year’s election.
The left wing Joyce Foundation just funded a digital advocacy study co-authored by Organizing for Action’s (formerly Obama for America) Michael Slaby, who used to work for Google’s Eric Schmidt. 
As we continue hear wailing and lamenting about “big money” in politics and the need for campaign finance reform, let’s keep in mind the left is as big a benefactor if not bigger of “big money” as the right.

(AP) – Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that Arizona Sen. John McCain probably would have beat his boss in the 2008 presidential election had the economy not collapsed.
Biden’s comment about McCain and President Barack Obama came during the opening dinner of an annual forum among the Red Rocks of Sedona in northern Arizona. He and McCain, a Republican, touched on the gun control debate following the Newtown shootings and the bombings in Boston, but made no mention of Syria. Just as the night came to a close, Biden turned to the grueling nature of presidential campaigns.


“The truth of the matter is, Barack knows it, I know, had the economy not collapsed around your ears, John, in the middle of literally — as things were moving — I think you probably would have won,” Biden said. “But it would have been incredibly, incredibly, incredibly close. You inherited a really difficult time.”
The forum is part of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a program formed by McCain as a way to debate foreign affairs. This year’s theme for the Sedona Forum is “How can we promote freedom and democracy effectively?”
Rather than a discussion between McCain and Biden, the two sat on stage together with McCain posing questions to his former Democratic adversary on gun control and whether background checks are necessary, human rights abuses at the hands of the United States and the recent bombings at the Boston marathon.

McCain and Biden both said that despite their disagreements, they’ve never lost respect for one another.
On gun control, Biden said it’s never been a simple issue, but that Congress has miscalculated how deeply the public feels about it and has failed to stand up to groups like the National Rifle Association, particularly after the shootings in Newtown. He said the public is looking to Congress to be mature enough to figure out a way to diminish the chance it will happen again.
“For the first time ever, you have people who are for gun safety, for increasing background checks,” Biden said. “Two out of three of them say it will be a major determining factor in how I vote. That’s the political dynamic that has changed. So I think we’re going to get this anyway. I think this will pass before the year is out, within this Congress.”
In responding to a question about the vulnerabilities of the United States when it comes to terrorist attacks, Biden said that the radical, lone wolves have been the most difficult to catch. But he said America shouldn’t change its values, how it treats people abroad or people coming into the United States. Nor should America adopt policies that keep people from freely walking down the street without being frisked by police or carrying identification cards, he said.
“The moment we change any of those things, that’s when they win,” Biden said. “Because they don’t see how you can have a society that is not ordered and regimented and wedded to an orthodoxy that is theirs. That’s the point that bothers them most about us.”
McCain followed up by saying that those who tortured U.S. prisoners, in violation of the Geneva convention, should be exposed and be held responsible to prevent repeated abuses.
Biden agreed with the man once held as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. He said the internal debate in Congress and at the White House is how things got to that point, but it’s not yet resolved.
“I think the only way you excise the demons is you acknowledge what happened, straightforward,” Biden said.

For those of us foolish enough to live in a crime-gripped city while also summarily denied our constitutional right to protect ourselves, this week’s massacre at the Navy Yard pretty well sums up our insane, defenseless existence.
Our Capitol Hill neighborhood drowned in the scream of sirens as police cars, vans, trucks, and armored vehicles streaked through the narrow streets at deadly speeds. The skies filled with the constant wapping of countless helicopters.


Just back from dropping children off at school, neighbors began frantically calling, texting and emailing one another to see what was wrong. The crisp morning reminded many of Sept. 11, 2001.
Police dispatched text and email alerts to residents that there was an “active shooter” at the nearby Navy Yard, just blocks from where our children play little league baseball. Many were dead and more injured, we were told. 
Then the terrifying news: As many as two more shooters were on the loose and being sought. 

D.C. police concluded their advisory to residents with the same admonishment that punctuates every crime alert: “DO NOT TAKE ACTION.” Instead, we are given an “event” number and instructed to call 911.
As any decent American knows, there is no feeling more powerless than to realize that a couple of mass murderers are loose in your neighborhood and you are denied the right to keep a gun to defend yourself, your family, or your home. A sickening knot tightens in your gut.
“DO NOT TAKE ACTION.”
Then came the latest Orwellian phrase in the “homeland security” lexicon: “Shelter in place!”
So, not only are you not allowed to defend yourself against mass murderers, you are not supposed to run from them either.

This, my fellow countrymen, is pure insanity.
And all the terror and real bloody carnage took place inside the most impenetrable fortress of gun control utopia.
The very guns Aaron Alexis used to kill 12 people are banned in this city, unless you submit to an exhaustive, invasive, and expensive process and prove to the city bureaucracy that you are worthy of your Second Amendment rights. Clearly, that failed.
We now know that Alexis was run through to the normal background checks already in place to purchase a gun from a gun dealer. He submitted to even more exhaustive background checks to get his job and access to the Navy Yard. All of those background checks, and he still massacred 12 people. 
We also now know that Alexis had multiple run-ins with police in various states and was accused of committing numerous gun crimes, including firing a gun into his neighbor’s occupied apartment and blasting the tires off of a car in a fit of rage. In those cases, existing laws were already in place to nab the lunatic and strip him of his gun rights. For whatever reason, these laws that should have flagged him as a dangerous criminal were not enforced.
So here we are with 12 good people dead, living in the land of gun control, where terror reigns because the criminals have guns and the rest of us are scolded “DO NOT TAKE ACTION” and “Shelter in place!”
The great cartoon philosopher Gary Larson once drew a panel of what he imagined a boneless chicken ranch might look like. Already flightless, the limp birds lay all about unable to even raise their heads with their legs splayed out in ridiculous fashion.
That is what we are here. Flightless and defenseless. As a cartoon about boneless chickens is hilarious; as a way of life, it is terrifying.

When Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper signed expanded background checks and a “high capacity” magazine ban into law on March 20, the lesson for other states was that this is what you get if you give Democrats the reins of power.
Colorado is a gun state, always has been. But Under Hickenlooper and the Democrat-controlled state legislature, Colorado’s immediate future is one of ever expanding gun control. 
How pro-gun was Colorado before Democrats rolled into town? Think about it this way–in Colorado there are no special permits required to buy a handgun, a shotgun, or a rifle. They have concealed carry laws within their state which even recognize the right to carry firearms on college and university campuses for self-defense.


Moreover, Colorado used to have open carry within the state–which means anyone over 21, with no felonies, used to be able to strap their revolver or pistol on their hip and go about their day with their firearm in plain view. I lived in Colorado in the 1990’s, and not only remember carrying a gun in this manner but also seeing many others carry one as well.

However, by the late 1990’s, the Democrats’ influence was beginning to take hold, and people were being discouraged from carrying guns thus. Now, the laws regarding open carry are best described as “vague,” and I would not risk carrying in the open if I were in the state. 
Add to this Gov. Hickenlooper’s ban on “high capacity” magazines and the ban on private gun sales, which is part and parcel to the expanded background checks, and it’s easy to see how far Colorado gun laws have fallen. 
Here’s the lesson for other states: Democrats cannot be trusted with your guns–period. And given time and power, they will turn any gun state into a gun control state.

The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is mobilizing for a massive four-front conflict with President Barack Obama over the Constitution and gun rights after a made-for-TV meeting today at the White House between Vice President Joe Biden, Attorney General Eric Holder, and a top NRA operative.
Obama appointed Biden–who throughout his career has opposed gun rights–to lead his gun-control task force after the horribly tragic Newtown shooting. Biden and Holder met Thursday with Jim Baker, director of the Federal Affairs Division of the NRA’s political arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. The meeting took place in the Old Executive Office Building, part of the White House complex adjacent to the West Wing. 
It’s revealing that Obama and Biden brought Holder into the meeting. In 2008, when the Supreme Court decided the historic Second Amendment case D.C. v. Heller, Holder joined a brief arguing that the Court should uphold D.C.’s complete ban on gun ownership because the Second Amendment does not apply to private citizens. Holder’s position is that no American citizen has the right to own a gun, and the federal government can ban guns nationwide. 


This casts doubt on Obama’s claim of being willing to find “common-sense solutions” and “middle ground” regarding firearms. Polls show 74% of Americans support their constitutional right to keep and bear arms, yet Obama taps two people from the other 26% to remake national policy on this issue. 
According to sources familiar with the meeting, it seems NRA was asked to meet with Biden and Holder so that the White House could tell the country that the administration sought input from all sides of the gun-control debate before launching new gun-control measures. “It’s clear they brought NRA in to lecture us, not to have a serious discussion in good faith,” remarked one member of the NRA’s board of directors. 
The NRA’s leaders are developing a multi-tiered strategy to combat threats on four fronts. First, anti-gun legislators in both the House and Senate are introducing gun-control bills. These are targeting so-called “assault weapons,” banning high-capacity magazines, shutting down gun shows, and seeking to create a national database of gun owners, complete with fingerprints. 

Second is executive action without legislation, through executive orders and new agency regulations. NRA leaders are getting word of various possible routes where Obama will seek to act without any new laws, claiming that existing laws give him all the authority he wants. Given that Obama claims the power to make “recess appointments” when the U.S. Senate is not in recess (which the courts are likely to strike down) and the power to order churches who their leaders will be (a claim the Supreme Court unanimously rejected), many are concerned that he will likewise make a move against gun owners. 
Third is foreign policy. Obama said he wants the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, which is officially intended to stop the illicit trade of small arms but would do so by giving the world body–most of whose members do not allow their citizens to own guns–authority to regulate gun ownership over the entire planet and obligate the United States to follow its dictates.  
And fourth is at the state level. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo–an Obama ally planning a 2016 presidential bid–went on an anti-gun rant during his State of the State Address, saying that confiscating guns is possible. Meanwhile, Obama’s home state of Illinois is planning new anti-gun measures, as is California’s plan to restrict bullets, rendering guns useless.   
Americans are taking sides. NRA membership has skyrocketed by over 100,000 new members in less than a month, as the White House organizes all its allies to push gun control. The Second Amendment survived by only a single vote in the 2008 Heller case, then again survived in another 5-4 vote in the 2010 case McDonald v. Chicago. If Obama gets more Supreme Court picks, they could overrule these cases to effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Supreme Law of the Land.  
So the Second Amendment is becoming a major political fight in Obama’s second term, the latest battle over government power versus individual liberty in what some are calling a power grab by an imperial president.

Today the White House launched its four point plan to “protect our children and our communities by reducing gun violence.” The brochure capitalizes on the Sandy Hook tragedy to push a scatter-shot package of progressive measures which the White House insists are merely “common sense.”
The first page offers an executive summary of what follows along with references to Sandy Hook, Newtown, Aurora, Oak Creek and Tucson. It closes by once again focusing on children, “If even one child’s life can be saved, then we need to act.”
The rest of the document is broken into four major points with many sub-sections. Point one is closing background check loopholes and it opens with another reference to Sandy Hook:



We must strengthen our efforts to keep guns from falling into the wrong hands…The single most important thing we can do to prevent gun violence and mass shootings, like the one in Newtown, is to make sure those who would commit acts of violence cannot get access to guns.

The guns used in the Newtown shooting were bought legally by the shooter’s mother. He stole her guns, shot her while she slept and made his way to the school. There is literally nothing in this section that, if enacted, would have changed the outcome. Sub-points include expanding background checks and insuring all states are contributing to the national database of people with mental illness. These might be worthy changes but again suggesting it would have stopped what happened in Newtown is pure emotional manipulation.
Step two is to ban “military-style assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines. This is essentially an effort to reinstate the ban which existed from 1994-2004. But this section also includes four other sub-sections covering everything from additional law enforcement “tools” to spending federal money on gun violence research. 
One of the priorities in this section is a “national responsible gun ownership campaign.” The document isn’t specific but this would likely be modeled on other government campaigns such as the one against smoking or drug use (“This is your brain on guns”). In practice this could be safety tips about gun storage or it could becomes a media slush-fund to stigmatize gun owners as heartless monster, like the people who let their second hand smoke waft toward babies.

The big budget item in this section is a plan to spend $4 billion keeping 15,000 cops “on the streets.” But again it’s not clear how this priority connects to any of the mass shooting incidents the document is ostensibly aimed at preventing. How will 15,000 more cops prevent the next school shooting if they are not on campus when the shooting begins?
In section three we finally get to “Making Schools Safer” which really ought to be the focus. Obama is proposing funding for 1,000 school resource officers at a cost of $150 million. This is a fraction of what he proposes to spend on cops in general ($4B) and seems insignificant in a country with more than 70,000 public schools. Chances that your elementary school will get an armed officer as a result of this program are exceedingly slim.
The other parts of this section include insuring schools have an emergency management plan and creating a “safer climate” at schools. The former seems like a good idea but the latter is rather vague. It involves spending $50 million to have the Department of Education train 8,000 schools to “improve climate.” There is a mention of “more intensive steps for groups of students exhibiting at-risk behavior” but it’s not clear from the document what this means or which groups are at risk.
Section four is titled “Improving Mental Health Services.” Here the documents suggests but never quite says outright that mental issues were involved in the shootings at “Newtown, Tucson, Aurora, and Virginia Tech.” The proposal involves training teachers to identify troubled kids and then insure they get treatment. It also lays out a proposal to train 5,000 mental health professionals to work with kids and young adults.
The mental health approach does seem like common sense though it’s not clear the items proposed would have prevented the shootings mentioned prominently in the document. Adam Lanza, Jared Loughner and Seung-Hui Cho were all known to have social/mental problems by their parents and teachers. They had been identified (James Holmes’ problems seem to have cropped up later) but obviously didn’t get sufficient help. Is that because help wasn’t available or because their parents wanted to avoid the stigma?
The President’s gun proposal throws a lot of progressive spaghetti  at the wall (to mix metaphors) in the hope that some of it will stick. Some of it will and perhaps some of it really should, but the items which seem most likely to prevent another Sandy Hook–cops in schools, mental health intervention–receive less money and attention than the ones designed primarily to please Obama’s progressive constituency. It’s an odd mix until you realize this is as much a political document as it is a practical one.

Last Friday, the Obama campaign fired up its vaunted voter machine and urged supporters to call Congress in support of gun control. The email alert to Obama’s list of more than 20 million supporters was intended to flood Congress with calls in support of the President’s gun control proposals. After a week, it is clear the effort fizzled. 
The Obama campaign’s action alert last week tickled lefty journalists like BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith. The White House stenographer took to twitter to boast about the mobilization. 

So Messina unleashed the kraken on the congressional switchboard today
— Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 25, 2013


Yeah, not so much.

Breitbart News talked with a dozen Congressional offices, in both the Senate and the House. None reported any increase in calls as a result of Obama’s action alert. One Senate office said that, in the week since the alert went out, they had received around 20 calls in support of gun control and around 150 in support of gun rights. 
Without a doubt, Obama has built an impressive turnout machine for elections. His campaign has vowed to use this to mobilize on issues important to the White House. This initial failure, however, suggests it will be difficult to translate voter’s personal support of the President to specific issues. 
In the weeks since the tragic shooting in Newtown, Obama has used the full wattage of his bully pulpit to press for actions on guns. The media has provided a powerful assist by devoting enormous attention to guns and the issue of gun violence. Yet, Obama’s well-oiled machine can’t generate enthusiasm from his supporters on the issue. 
This is further evidence of the fundamental challenge faced by supporters of gun control. While large numbers of voters say they support more restrictions on gun rights, they aren’t particularly motivated by the issue. It is merely one of many issues they support. Those who believe in gun rights, however, are singularly motivated on the issue. Not only is their vote determined by that issue, their level of political engagement is determined by it as well. 
Not even Obama can fix that math.

Gun rights return to the Supreme Court this year, challenging a federal regulation that resulted in a police officer’s felony conviction when he purchased a firearm for his uncle. 
Bruce Abramski is a former police officer whose uncle wanted to buy a firearm. His uncle is a law-abiding person who can legally purchase, but since Abramski is a former policeman, there are gun shops where he can buy firearms at a discount. Thus, he decided to buy the gun for his uncle. 
Everyone who purchases a firearm at a federally-licensed firearm retail store is familiar with Form 4473. The form is created by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and, among other things, asks whether you are the actual purchaser of the firearm, versus purchasing for someone else. Form 4473 tells you that if you say you are not the actual buyer, you cannot purchase the gun.


Abramski and his uncle checked with several gun dealers, all of whom said the legal way to proceed was for Abramski to purchase in his home state of Virginia as the actual buyer, then go to his uncle’s home in Pennsylvania, where they could go to another federally-licensed firearm dealer to have his uncle fill out the same ATF paperwork and undergo the same background check, then have the firearm transferred to the uncle. 
Abramski did so. Then he was charged and convicted of a federal felony for making a false statement that is “intended or likely to deceive” a gun dealer “with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the [gun] sale.”
Federal appeals courts with jurisdiction over many of the states in America understand that this provision of federal law is designed only to prevent “straw man” sales, where a buyer obtains the firearm on behalf of a convicted felon, domestic batterer, mentally ill person, or some other sort of person prohibited from buying guns. It is to make sure someone doesn’t get a gun on behalf of someone else who would be refused the sale after they failed a federal background check. In the Supreme Court’s words from 1976, it is to “keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency.” It was not written to prevent a policeman from being a nephew who tried to save his law-abiding uncle some money. 

Nonetheless, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond (with jurisdiction over the Mid-Atlantic states) agreed with two other federal appeals courts in holding that when Abramski checked the box affirming he was the purchaser, he committed a serious federal crime. 
If Abramski purchased the gun on his own, then decided to give it to his uncle as a free gift, that would be legal. Or if Abramski bought it for himself, then the following week decided to sell it to his uncle, that would be legal. But because his uncle wrote him a check for the gun before Abramski went to the store to buy the gun, and thus was acting as his uncle’s agent to buy a gun, Abramski became a federal felon. 
Question 11a on Form 4473 is poorly worded. That wording was chosen by ATF, not Congress. If Question 11a instead asked if you are purchasing on behalf of someone who cannot legally purchase a firearm, then Abramski would honestly have said “no,” and there would not be any criminal conviction. 
On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court granted review in Abramski v. U.S. Arguments are likely around February, with a decision before July 2014.

Washington, D.C. has historically been one of America’s most difficult places for law-abiding citizens to obtain and own a firearm, especially a handgun. D.C. had a complete ban on handguns since 1976 until a 2008 Supreme Court decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, that struck down what was ruled an unconstitutional ban.
“Local lawmakers in DC have managed to keep a de facto ban in tact by making it very difficult for law-abiding citizens to get guns,” said AWR Hawkins, Ph.D, a military historian and writer for Breitbart News. He pointed out in an interview for this article that D.C. officials’ gun control efforts only affect law-abiding citizens while criminals simply ignore the laws.
He pointed out that criminals did not pay attention to the past unconstitutional handgun ban or any of the D.C. rules on keeping guns unloaded and unlocked or disassembled. Dr. Hawkins explained his views on the previous formal ban and the now de facto ban:


These laws clearly give criminals the upper hand in at least two ways: 1) They make it clear that law-abiding citizens will be unarmed (defenseless) against an armed attack as they go through their daily routines on the streets of DC. 2) These laws are so burdensome they actually dissuade people from getting guns to begin with.
Dr. Hawkins’ analysis is reinforced greatly by the recent July 2, 2013 prison sentences handed down in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to six narcotics traffickers and money launderers. The U.S. Attorney’s office said “agents and detectives seized multiple handguns, more than a kilogram of powder cocaine, large quantities of crack cocaine, and over $40,000 in cash.”
The U.S. Attorney’s office described the investigation that led to the six arrests, prosecutions, and sentences as “a long-term investigation.” This indicates that the area’s gun-bans resulted in an extended period of time where the only people carrying firearms were criminals with no regard for law. The case further indicates that even with some of the nation’s strictest guns laws, it took a long-term effort to apprehend and charge gun-toting felons and prevent their guns from being a threat to law-abiding citizens who are left defenseless against such criminals.

It hasn’t always been the case that only MPs can carry firearms on U.S. military bases. A mere twenty years ago, “gun free zones” made their way to these facilities under the watch of President Bill Clinton. 
According to a Washington Times editorial written days after the Nov. 5, 2009 attack on soldiers at Fort Hood, one of Clinton’s “first acts upon taking office… was to disarm U.S. soldiers on military bases.”
Clinton’s actions birthed Army regulations “forbidding military personnel from carrying their personal firearms and making it almost impossible for commanders to issue firearms to soldiers in the U.S. for personal protection.”

Today the White House launched its four point plan to “protect our children and our communities by reducing gun violence.” The brochure capitalizes on the Sandy Hook tragedy to push a scatter-shot package of progressive measures which the White House insists are merely “common sense.”
The first page offers an executive summary of what follows along with references to Sandy Hook, Newtown, Aurora, Oak Creek and Tucson. It closes by once again focusing on children, “If even one child’s life can be saved, then we need to act.”
The rest of the document is broken into four major points with many sub-sections. Point one is closing background check loopholes and it opens with another reference to Sandy Hook:



We must strengthen our efforts to keep guns from falling into the wrong hands…The single most important thing we can do to prevent gun violence and mass shootings, like the one in Newtown, is to make sure those who would commit acts of violence cannot get access to guns.

The guns used in the Newtown shooting were bought legally by the shooter’s mother. He stole her guns, shot her while she slept and made his way to the school. There is literally nothing in this section that, if enacted, would have changed the outcome. Sub-points include expanding background checks and insuring all states are contributing to the national database of people with mental illness. These might be worthy changes but again suggesting it would have stopped what happened in Newtown is pure emotional manipulation.
Step two is to ban “military-style assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines. This is essentially an effort to reinstate the ban which existed from 1994-2004. But this section also includes four other sub-sections covering everything from additional law enforcement “tools” to spending federal money on gun violence research. 
One of the priorities in this section is a “national responsible gun ownership campaign.” The document isn’t specific but this would likely be modeled on other government campaigns such as the one against smoking or drug use (“This is your brain on guns”). In practice this could be safety tips about gun storage or it could becomes a media slush-fund to stigmatize gun owners as heartless monster, like the people who let their second hand smoke waft toward babies.

The big budget item in this section is a plan to spend $4 billion keeping 15,000 cops “on the streets.” But again it’s not clear how this priority connects to any of the mass shooting incidents the document is ostensibly aimed at preventing. How will 15,000 more cops prevent the next school shooting if they are not on campus when the shooting begins?
In section three we finally get to “Making Schools Safer” which really ought to be the focus. Obama is proposing funding for 1,000 school resource officers at a cost of $150 million. This is a fraction of what he proposes to spend on cops in general ($4B) and seems insignificant in a country with more than 70,000 public schools. Chances that your elementary school will get an armed officer as a result of this program are exceedingly slim.
The other parts of this section include insuring schools have an emergency management plan and creating a “safer climate” at schools. The former seems like a good idea but the latter is rather vague. It involves spending $50 million to have the Department of Education train 8,000 schools to “improve climate.” There is a mention of “more intensive steps for groups of students exhibiting at-risk behavior” but it’s not clear from the document what this means or which groups are at risk.
Section four is titled “Improving Mental Health Services.” Here the documents suggests but never quite says outright that mental issues were involved in the shootings at “Newtown, Tucson, Aurora, and Virginia Tech.” The proposal involves training teachers to identify troubled kids and then insure they get treatment. It also lays out a proposal to train 5,000 mental health professionals to work with kids and young adults.
The mental health approach does seem like common sense though it’s not clear the items proposed would have prevented the shootings mentioned prominently in the document. Adam Lanza, Jared Loughner and Seung-Hui Cho were all known to have social/mental problems by their parents and teachers. They had been identified (James Holmes’ problems seem to have cropped up later) but obviously didn’t get sufficient help. Is that because help wasn’t available or because their parents wanted to avoid the stigma?
The President’s gun proposal throws a lot of progressive spaghetti  at the wall (to mix metaphors) in the hope that some of it will stick. Some of it will and perhaps some of it really should, but the items which seem most likely to prevent another Sandy Hook–cops in schools, mental health intervention–receive less money and attention than the ones designed primarily to please Obama’s progressive constituency. It’s an odd mix until you realize this is as much a political document as it is a practical one.

President Barack Obama lashed out defiantly and viciously at political opponents who defeated his efforts to expand federal gun regulations today. Standing with families of victims of the Newtown school shooting at the White House, the president claimed that opponents of expanded federal background checks had “no coherent arguments” for their position, and that the “gun lobby” had “willfully lied” in the course of the debate.
Ironically, while accusing others of lying, President Obama resorted to false claims and statistics about current laws, including the repeatedly debunked argument that 40% of gun sales are private, and that guns can be bought over the Internet without background checks. It was partly the dishonesty of those very arguments that had led potential supporters of new bipartisan legislation to doubt the administration’s motives in supporting the bill.


The administration’s defeat came earlier Wednesday, when the Senate failed to pass a cloture motion to end debate on a bipartisan proposal introduced by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). Only 54 votes of the necessary 60 votes could be found to support an expanded federal background check system (among other changes), partly because of fears that extending such checks would require the creation of a federal gun registry that could lead to confiscation.
The failure brought an end to four months of fervent campaigning by the president during which he used the Newtown disaster–or, in the eyes of many critics, exploited it–to make an argument about the urgent need for new laws, even if such laws would not have prevented the Newtown atrocity itself. Many Democrats rallied behind him, hoping at first to pass a new assault weapons ban, then abandoning that effort for more modest regulations.
Along the way, the administration lost the support of Democratic Senators in conservative states, many of whom will face re-election in 2014. President Obama made clear his intention to use Wednesday’s defeat to rally supporters against Republicans, whom he blamed directly and angrily, suggesting that they had defied the will of the American people and attempted to silence the families of Newtown victims who had a “right” to be heard in the debate.

Forced to cover a rare political defeat for the president, the mainstream media largely echoed his emotions. Virtually all of CNN’s correspondents agreed that the Manchin-Toomey bill had been defeated because of the power of the National Rifle Association and the fear of politicians afraid to take on Second Amendment activists. None considered that support for gun control has been declining, or that the legislation itself was deeply flawed.
Again and again, President Obama noted that 90% of Americans, and a majority of National Rifle Association members, supported expanded background checks. The former constitutional law lecturer seemed to expect that that majority’s will should be self-executing, ignoring the fact that constitutional rights like the Second Amendment exist precisely to protect minorities against majoritarian passions and presidential demagoguery.
Indeed, while the president described the failure of the legislation as a failure of “Washington,” it was also–and primarily–a failure of his administration. A White House operation and Obama campaign apparatus that is regarded as brutally effective ought to have been able to sell a proposal allegedly supported by 90% of the voting public. Yet persistent troubles in execution and failures of policy raise questions about whether Obama secretly preferred failure to success.
His opponents, the president insisted, refused to make it more difficult for “dangerous criminals” to buy weapons–ignoring one of the core arguments of the other side, namely that dangerous criminals frequently ignore the law to obtain weapons, while law-abiding citizens bear the burden of new rules and restrictions. He reduced his opponents’ motives to pure politics, accusing them of being afraid of being punished by an organized, determined minority.
Rarely have Americans ever seen a president attack his opponents so viciously, expressing and evoking such visceral emotions–especially at a time of mourning. President Obama’s tirade contrasted with his reserved, measured response to the Boston Marathon bombings, in which he urged Americans to speak and act with restraint. If this has been, as he claimed, “a pretty shameful day in Washington,” the president’s tantrum was the most shameful moment of all.

Apparently the word has come down from the White House to Democrats across the nation, get in line behind the Obama Administration on gun control. The National Conference of Democratic Mayors are now threatening to have their police departments boycott the purchase of guns from manufacturers who won’t adhere to the Obama Administration’s strictures.
The mayors are going to grade the manufacturers on their record of support vis-à-vis Obama’s plans for gun control, including universal background checks, the elimination of high-capacity magazines and sharing information on crime and mental health.


The leader of this crusade is Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, who stated:


When we were lobbying on Capitol Hill, it became clear that our goal of trying to pass laws that make it easier to make our communities safe was going to be opposed by the gun and ammunition manufacturers. We recognize as mayors, we help fund that, because we are one of the largest purchasers of guns and ammunition in the country. So at the Democratic mayors meeting last night, we agreed that we would all go back to our communities, gather information from our police chiefs and procurement officers about how many guns and how much ammunition we purchase, bring that in from the Democratic mayors so that we have a common list of how much money we’re spending, what purchases are pending and who we’re buying from.

Rybak added that the group will join Michael Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns to grade the manufacturers.
Rybak concluded:

Then we’re going to do everything we can as mayors to use … the collective buying power of many millions of dollars in guns and ammunition, to support those who will support common-sense laws and oppose those who are fighting us in Congress. I am not going to have the people, the taxpayers of Minneapolis, pay for people to stop the Congress from passing laws that keep our people safe. It’s especially galling, paying money from our police departments to produce loopholes that allow illegal handguns into my communities that could be used against police officers.

On Friday night, the National Conference of Democratic Mayors resolved support for the gun control and public safety proposals of the White House.

Colorado Democrats are prepared to launch an all-out war on guns with legislation that includes bans on “high capacity” magazines, requirements for universal background checks, fees for existing background checks, and allowing victims of gun violence to sue firearm manufacturers for the misuse of weapons.
The proposed ban on “high capacity” magazines and the call for universal background checks are both reflective of similar measures being pushed by Democrats around the country. 
As I have made clear in earlier posts, if universal background checks are implemented, they will not only stop private sales and close the “gun show loophole,” but will also take away a grandfather’s ability to simply give his favorite rifle to his grandson or for a mother to give a handgun to her daughter for self-defense. 


In both scenarios, the guns will have to be registered, the government will have to be notified, specified fees will have to be paid, and background checks will have to be performed. 

The measure to add a fee to existing background checks for gun purchases is nothing less than a new state-level tax on gun purchases. If this law passes, the fee could eventually be raised high enough to rule out buying a gun in the first place. 
The proposal to allow crime victims to sue gun manufacturers is very onerous for gun companies. Although it would ostensibly only apply to makers of “assault weapons” if implemented, Colorado state Sen. Greg Brophy (R) said it “is the equivalent of holding Coors, the distributor, and the 7-Eleven from which the 12-pack of beer was stolen responsible for the drunk-driving accident.”
Even if the law allowing Coloradans to sue gun manufacturers passes, it will be impossible to implement currently because a federal law bans lawsuits against gun manufacturers over the misuse of their products. 
The state’s Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, has yet to show his hand regarding where he stands on all these proposals. One thing that is known is that 56% of Coloradans say the NRA best represents their views on guns and gun rights.

Last Friday, the Obama campaign fired up its vaunted voter machine and urged supporters to call Congress in support of gun control. The email alert to Obama’s list of more than 20 million supporters was intended to flood Congress with calls in support of the President’s gun control proposals. After a week, it is clear the effort fizzled. 
The Obama campaign’s action alert last week tickled lefty journalists like BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith. The White House stenographer took to twitter to boast about the mobilization. 

So Messina unleashed the kraken on the congressional switchboard today
— Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 25, 2013


Yeah, not so much.

Breitbart News talked with a dozen Congressional offices, in both the Senate and the House. None reported any increase in calls as a result of Obama’s action alert. One Senate office said that, in the week since the alert went out, they had received around 20 calls in support of gun control and around 150 in support of gun rights. 
Without a doubt, Obama has built an impressive turnout machine for elections. His campaign has vowed to use this to mobilize on issues important to the White House. This initial failure, however, suggests it will be difficult to translate voter’s personal support of the President to specific issues. 
In the weeks since the tragic shooting in Newtown, Obama has used the full wattage of his bully pulpit to press for actions on guns. The media has provided a powerful assist by devoting enormous attention to guns and the issue of gun violence. Yet, Obama’s well-oiled machine can’t generate enthusiasm from his supporters on the issue. 
This is further evidence of the fundamental challenge faced by supporters of gun control. While large numbers of voters say they support more restrictions on gun rights, they aren’t particularly motivated by the issue. It is merely one of many issues they support. Those who believe in gun rights, however, are singularly motivated on the issue. Not only is their vote determined by that issue, their level of political engagement is determined by it as well. 
Not even Obama can fix that math.

12926	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/09/Abortion-record-poem-vagina	Opinion	0	Gun Rights Regulation	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
An abortion supporter, Katie Heim, wrote a poem likening her vagina to a gun which was read into the Texas Senate record as the Senate debated the bill outlawing abortion after twenty weeks. The poem, titled, “If My Vagina Was a Gun,” went like this: 

If my vagina was a gun, you would stand for its rights, 

You would ride on buses and fight all the fights. 

If my vagina was a gun, you would treat it with care, 
You wouldn’t spill all its secrets because, well, why go there. 

If my vagina was a gun, you’d say what it holds is private 
From cold dead hands we could pry, you surely would riot. 
If my vagina was a gun, its rights would all be protected, no matter the body count or the children affected. 

If my vagina was a gun, I could bypass security, concealed carry laws would ensure I’d have impunity. 
If my vagina was a gun, I wouldn’t have to beg you, I could hunt this great land and do all the things men do. 
But my vagina is not a gun, it is a mightier thing, 
With a voice that rings true making lawmakers’ ears ring. 

Vaginas are not delicate, they are muscular and magic, 
So stop messing with mine, with legislation that’s tragic. 
My vagina’s here to demand from the source, 
Listen to the voices of thousands or feel their full force.
Some questions for Ms. Heim:

You do know that it should be “If My Vagina Were a Gun”?
If your vagina is “a mightier thing” than a gun, how do you plan to use it if confronted by a thug intent on robbing or brutalizing you? 
Fetuses, which Ms. Heim presumably references, reside in the uterus, not the vagina. Is she aware of this? 
Could Ms. Heim possibly do a worse disservice to pro-choice advocates than to read this nonsense into the legislative record?

The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is mobilizing for a massive four-front conflict with President Barack Obama over the Constitution and gun rights after a made-for-TV meeting today at the White House between Vice President Joe Biden, Attorney General Eric Holder, and a top NRA operative.
Obama appointed Biden–who throughout his career has opposed gun rights–to lead his gun-control task force after the horribly tragic Newtown shooting. Biden and Holder met Thursday with Jim Baker, director of the Federal Affairs Division of the NRA’s political arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. The meeting took place in the Old Executive Office Building, part of the White House complex adjacent to the West Wing. 
It’s revealing that Obama and Biden brought Holder into the meeting. In 2008, when the Supreme Court decided the historic Second Amendment case D.C. v. Heller, Holder joined a brief arguing that the Court should uphold D.C.’s complete ban on gun ownership because the Second Amendment does not apply to private citizens. Holder’s position is that no American citizen has the right to own a gun, and the federal government can ban guns nationwide. 


This casts doubt on Obama’s claim of being willing to find “common-sense solutions” and “middle ground” regarding firearms. Polls show 74% of Americans support their constitutional right to keep and bear arms, yet Obama taps two people from the other 26% to remake national policy on this issue. 
According to sources familiar with the meeting, it seems NRA was asked to meet with Biden and Holder so that the White House could tell the country that the administration sought input from all sides of the gun-control debate before launching new gun-control measures. “It’s clear they brought NRA in to lecture us, not to have a serious discussion in good faith,” remarked one member of the NRA’s board of directors. 
The NRA’s leaders are developing a multi-tiered strategy to combat threats on four fronts. First, anti-gun legislators in both the House and Senate are introducing gun-control bills. These are targeting so-called “assault weapons,” banning high-capacity magazines, shutting down gun shows, and seeking to create a national database of gun owners, complete with fingerprints. 

Second is executive action without legislation, through executive orders and new agency regulations. NRA leaders are getting word of various possible routes where Obama will seek to act without any new laws, claiming that existing laws give him all the authority he wants. Given that Obama claims the power to make “recess appointments” when the U.S. Senate is not in recess (which the courts are likely to strike down) and the power to order churches who their leaders will be (a claim the Supreme Court unanimously rejected), many are concerned that he will likewise make a move against gun owners. 
Third is foreign policy. Obama said he wants the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, which is officially intended to stop the illicit trade of small arms but would do so by giving the world body–most of whose members do not allow their citizens to own guns–authority to regulate gun ownership over the entire planet and obligate the United States to follow its dictates.  
And fourth is at the state level. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo–an Obama ally planning a 2016 presidential bid–went on an anti-gun rant during his State of the State Address, saying that confiscating guns is possible. Meanwhile, Obama’s home state of Illinois is planning new anti-gun measures, as is California’s plan to restrict bullets, rendering guns useless.   
Americans are taking sides. NRA membership has skyrocketed by over 100,000 new members in less than a month, as the White House organizes all its allies to push gun control. The Second Amendment survived by only a single vote in the 2008 Heller case, then again survived in another 5-4 vote in the 2010 case McDonald v. Chicago. If Obama gets more Supreme Court picks, they could overrule these cases to effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Supreme Law of the Land.  
So the Second Amendment is becoming a major political fight in Obama’s second term, the latest battle over government power versus individual liberty in what some are calling a power grab by an imperial president.

Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), a member of the Democratic Party’s leadership in the House of Representatives, suggested to Jason Mattera at a Feb. 13 women’s rights rally that plans for an assault weapons ban and private-sales background checks were only the beginning of a broader gun control agenda extending to handguns as well.
Schakowsky evidently did not recognize Mattera, a conservative video journalist and senior investigative reporter for Talk Radio Network, who infamously confronted Vice President Joe Biden in the Capitol. (Mattera introduced himself to Schakowsky by name but did not indicate that he was filming or that he is conservative.) She spoke to Mattera as if he were a fellow gun control enthusiast–and Mattera played along, eliciting answers about Schakowsky’s enthusiasm for gun control.



“We want everything on the table,” Schakowsky told Mattera. “This is a moment of opportunity. There’s no question about it.”
One poignant exchange was as follows:


Schakowsky: We’re on a roll now, and I think we’ve got to take the–you know, we’re gonna push as hard as we can and as far as we can.
Mattera: So the assault weapons ban is just the beginning?
Schakowsky: Oh absolutely. I mean, I’m against handguns. We have, in Illinois, the Council Against Handgun… something [Violence]. Yeah, I’m a member of that. So, absolutely.

In another exchange, Schakowsky proposed allowances for states and municipalities to ban guns–though such laws have been repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court:

Mattera: We’ll never get a handgun ban with the Second Amendment as stated.
Schakowsky: I don’t know. I don’t know that we can’t. And there may be an allowance, once again, for communities–I have communities in my district that prohibited handguns within their borders. The rights of municipalities and states to view that as a sensible way to keep people safe–I don’t think it’s precluded.

When Mattera asked why legislators were not pressing for a handgun ban, given that most murders are committed with handguns, Schakowsky replied: “Because we’re not going to be able to win that. Not now.” She went on to explain why background checks were a useful interim policy, arguing that they would “address any kind of weapon.”

Schakowsky’s remarks about plans for broader gun control are not the first time she has revealed the long-term goal behind short-term policy debates. She has a tendency to do so when speaking to apparently sympathetic audiences. In 2009, she told a crowd that the goal of Obamacare would be to “put the private insurance industry out of business.”
Officially, Democrats–including Schakowsky–hew to the party line as laid down by the president, which pledges support for the Second Amendment and for gun ownership in rural communities where hunting and shooting are viewed as traditional pastimes.
Gun owners fear that the Sandy Hook-inspired gun control measures before Congress–none of which would have stopped the mass shooting at Sandy Hook–are a prelude to broader regulations, including the banning of handguns and the eventual registration and confiscation of firearms, despite earnest assurances by Democrats to the contrary.
The Democratic Party has taken a hard line on guns recently, with President Obama’s strategist, David Axelrod, joining New York mayor Michael Bloomberg in backing gun control enthusiast Robin Kelly over former Rep. Debbie Halvorson, who has an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association, in the recent primary to replace former Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr. of Illinois. Kelly has promised to be a “leader” in “banning guns.”

UPDATE 12:26 AM EST — Senator Angela Giron is now down 60 to 40 with over half the votes counted and FOX31 Denver predicts she will follow Morse out the door.  Giron says she is not conceding yet and will wait for more votes to be counted before speaking.
UPDATE 11:37 EST — Morse has conceded. Morse said, “It has been an honor to represent the 11th Senate District. It’s been hugely rewarding.” He is the first Colorado legislator ever successfully recalled. He vowed that Democrats will continue the fight for gun control.
UPDATE 11 pm EST — With 75% of the vote in, Morse is now down 52 to 47.  
Kurt Bardella, a communications consultant for the Colorado recall effort, told Breitbart News: “If the early voting trends hold steady, history will be made in Colorado tonight that will reverberate throughout the country. After tonight, no one should underestimate the political potency of the gun-control debate. Democrats have targeted Colorado in recent cycles and have had some real success turning the state from red-to-purple. The fact that the sitting State Senate President is on the cusp of being the first-ever recalled state official in Colorado’s history should give anyone who is considering moving forward with additional gun control legislation real pause.”

With early voting results in, it looks as though Colorado state Senator Angela Giron (D-Pueblo) may be able to hold her seat, but Senate President John Morse (D-Colo. Springs) is in trouble.
Early voting was 52% to 48% against Morse. 


Ironically, it was Morse who not only ignored the voice of his constituents on gun control but actually went on television to say “he was proud he ignored [them].” 

At 10:20 PM EST, Basic Freedom Defense Fund Spokeswoman Jennifer Kerns told Breitbart News: “Early results indicate a four point lead in favor of the recall effort. While it is still early, the majority of the votes are in at this hour and it will be very difficult for Morse to overcome this margin.”
Giron said that if either she or Morse lost a recall election it meant NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s gun control group “might as well fold it up.”
Breitbart News will update this story as more information becomes available.

Sen. John McCain (R-Sunday Shows) expressed bewilderment on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that GOP Sens. Cruz, Lee and Paul would filibuster gun control legislation. “I don’t understand it,” McCain said. “The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand.” With all due respect to Sen. McCain, that is almost completely backward. 
The purpose of the US Senate is not to be some federal debating society. It is not tasked with taking the great issues of the day and giving its “august” members a platform for their musings on policy. The public does not look to the Senate for guidance in its deliberations on the issues.
The Senate’s first, and only, task is to uphold the Constitution. Originally, the Senate was designed to act as the states’ check on an encroaching federal government. Senators were appointed by state legislatures to be their voice in Washington. The House was designed to be the voice of the people. Sadly, those days are long gone. 


Today, Senators are just House members juiced-up on steroids. Worse, they have a habit of putting decorum and the traditions and processes of the institution above foundational principles. 

“I don’t understand why United States senators want to block debate when the leaders said we could have amendments,” McCain noted.
If one believes a legislative proposal is, on its face, unconstitutional, the ability to offer amendments is of little solace. Sens. Cruz, Lee and Paul, among other Senators, believe legislation to limit gun rights is, by its nature, unconstitutional. Amending the legislation to make it slightly less unconstitutional is a fool’s game, and a large reason our federal government has grown so large. 
A filibuster against gun control legislation is upholding the greatest tradition of the Senate, i.e. acting as a bulwark against the federal government’s natural inclination to expand its power. Knowing how specific Senators voted on shredding the Constitution won’t put it back together again. Any proposal that tramples on constitutional rights should never grace the floor of the Senate.  
Sen. McCain, once the GOP candidate for President, is becoming marginalized within the GOP Senate caucus. New, more conservative, Senators are stepping up to defend Constitutional principles and becoming a vocal, loyal opposition to the Administration and its curtailing of our liberties. They should be applauded.

When Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper signed expanded background checks and a “high capacity” magazine ban into law on March 20, the lesson for other states was that this is what you get if you give Democrats the reins of power.
Colorado is a gun state, always has been. But Under Hickenlooper and the Democrat-controlled state legislature, Colorado’s immediate future is one of ever expanding gun control. 
How pro-gun was Colorado before Democrats rolled into town? Think about it this way–in Colorado there are no special permits required to buy a handgun, a shotgun, or a rifle. They have concealed carry laws within their state which even recognize the right to carry firearms on college and university campuses for self-defense.


Moreover, Colorado used to have open carry within the state–which means anyone over 21, with no felonies, used to be able to strap their revolver or pistol on their hip and go about their day with their firearm in plain view. I lived in Colorado in the 1990’s, and not only remember carrying a gun in this manner but also seeing many others carry one as well.

However, by the late 1990’s, the Democrats’ influence was beginning to take hold, and people were being discouraged from carrying guns thus. Now, the laws regarding open carry are best described as “vague,” and I would not risk carrying in the open if I were in the state. 
Add to this Gov. Hickenlooper’s ban on “high capacity” magazines and the ban on private gun sales, which is part and parcel to the expanded background checks, and it’s easy to see how far Colorado gun laws have fallen. 
Here’s the lesson for other states: Democrats cannot be trusted with your guns–period. And given time and power, they will turn any gun state into a gun control state.

Politico notes that the biggest obstacle to Democrats’ hopes of re-taking the House of Representatives in 2014 may be President Barack Obama. And the reason? His crusade for gun control:

Adding to the complications of running as a conservative Democrat is the lingering presence of billionaire New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has essentially declared war on pro-gun Democrats. Last month, Bloomberg funneled $2 million into his super PAC to sink the fortunes of a pro-NRA Democrat in a special primary election for an Illinois congressional seat. (A Democrat closer to Bloomberg’s gun stance is expected to win the general election.)
Polls consistently show Obama’s positions on issues ranging from immigration to the minimum wage to gun control picking up wide support across the country. But the 2014 battle for the House won’t be fought nationally — it will most likely be decided in several dozen districts, all but a handful of which favor Republicans.

Politico understates the importance of that Illinois race. The Democrat whom Bloomberg–and Obama–backed, Robin Kelly, has said she is in favor of “banning guns” outright and boasted of her “F” rating from the NRA. David Axelrod mocked her opponent, former Rep. Debbie Halvorson, suggesting that she was ironically insensitive to the “carnage” in the district she was running to represent. The real irony was that the Obama machine had recruited the pro-Second Amendment Halvorson to run in 2008.



“@politico: NRA ally Debbie Halvorson could win Jesse Jackson Jr.’s Chicago seat: politi.co/Whw4xE“Ironic, given carnage in 2d CD.
— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) January 27, 2013

Kelly was backed by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), who is featured in today’s Breitbart News story talking about how the assault weapons ban is merely the first step in a long-term agenda to ban handguns.

That might work in urban districts where Democrats rarely lose. It won’t work in swing districts that Obama lost in 2012, which are the districts that Democrats need to pick up in 2014. And it can’t help that they have anti-gun zealots like Schakowsky and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi leading the charge.

Barack Obama, in an attempt to appear sympathetic to gun owners’ concerns as he pursues a gun-banning agenda in the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting, recently bragged that he goes skeet shooting at Camp David “all the time.” 
Responding to the blowback from skeptics who doubted Obama was telling the unvarnished truth (Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) challenged Obama to a skeet shooting contest), the White House not only released a photo of Obama shooting skeet, but White House press secretary Jay Carney also tried to water down Obama’s statement. 


Carney claimed Obama had “never pretended to or suggested that he had grown up as a hunter or engaging in sports activities with weapons.” According to the White House spokesman, “[Obama] simply said that he had, and this is the truth, that he had enjoyed shooting at Camp David. That’s a fact.” 

He went on to explain why the photo had been released while continuing to assert that Obama’s comments about shooting had been entirely unplanned:
The fact is the president was asked a question–did not volunteer, but was asked a question about whether or not he had ever shot a weapon. He answered with the truth, which is that he has enjoyed shooting competitively with friends at Camp David on multiple occasions… there were persistent questions about this, and we decided to release a photo of the president shooting at Camp David.
Obama told The New Republic that he was a skeet shooter, stating, “Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time. Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.” 
When asked whether Obama liked skeet or trap shooting better, Carney replied that Obama “has gotten better” at shooting.

Connecticut State Representative Stephen D. Dargan (D-New Haven), co-chairman of the state’s Public Safety Committee, has introduced a bill that would make public the names and addresses of gun permit holders in Connecticut under the state’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
Dargan’s bill is in response to the Dec. 14th shootings in the Sandy Hook School in Newtown, CT, and also occurs as a Westchester County, NY newspaper, the Journal News, is drawing widespread, nationwide anger for publishing a map with the names and addresses of gun permit holders. The bill, if passed, would reverse the state legislature’s decision, made nearly two decades ago, to protect gun permit holders’ personal information from disclosure.  


Connecticut’s General Assembly will return to Hartford next week, when a five-month session will begin, one in which gun control is expected to be a dominant issue. The state has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country, yet is one of the most lenient toward serious crimes, having just repealed the death penalty last spring, and having passed, in 2011, a controversial early release amendment for some prisoners who demonstrate good behavior while incarcerated.  
“Most things are FOIA-able now,” Dargan said in an interview Thursday. “Go to the local city clerk’s office and you can find out where Steve Dargan owns property. I don’t know why a responsible gun owner is worried about whether a permit for a revolver is FOIA-able or not.” 
Dargan added that in a “computer age” it is reasonable for people to want to know gun ownership information. “Maybe their kids are going over to Johnny Smith’s and maybe they want to see whether they have guns in the house.” 

The bill has drawn criticism from both Robert Crook, executive director of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen, and Richard Burgess, head of Connecticut Carry, a nonprofit group that advocates for citizens’ right to bear arms as provided for in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  
“It’s a tool for criminals,” Crook said. “You don’t see the pistol permit holders in the newspapers. They just don’t break the law, normally.” Crook added that Adam Lanza, the presumed shooter in the Newtown massacre, broke many laws leading up to the shootings, starting with stealing his mother’s legally owned guns. 
“I don’t have a solution,” said Crook. “But I don’t think releasing the names of handgun owners will have an effect…except to give some people, and I mean criminals, an option.” 
Burgess also criticized the proposed legislation. “It’s crazy for someone to think this is a good idea,” he said. “I can only see harm that could come from it. Do we want to give criminals access to a database that tells you where every handgun in Connecticut is?” 
Dargan said he introduced the bill because “people want to have a discussion” about guns after perhaps “the worst school tragedy in history, with kids who are just learning how to tie their shoes gunned down by a madman.”

Questions are being raised whether outgoing billionaire New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is courting Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe (D) to enact gun control measures in Virginia if he should win the statehouse in November. 
On Tuesday, voters in Colorado recalled two state senators–Angela Giron (D-Pueblo) and Senate President John Morse (D-Colorado Springs)–that supported Colorado Gov. John Hickenloooper’s (D) sweeping gun control legislation, which he signed into law in March. As Breitbart News reported, Morse lost his recall election 51 to 49 percent, and Giron lost hers by a “whopping 56 to 44 percent.”
Bloomberg reportedly called Hickenlooper on at least two occasions before the Colorado governor signed the gun control laws, and he gave $350,000 more to his Mayors Against Illegal Guns group to back the efforts of Morse and Giron to fight the recall efforts against them leading up to the elections. With Bloomberg’s gun control dreams fading in Colorado, he may be turning his sights on Virginia through McAuliffe.


At the end of August, as the Colorado recall efforts were heating up, Bloomberg and McAuliffe reportedly met in McAuliffe’s native state of New York. The meeting prompted Second Amendment advocates in Virginia to wonder if Bloomberg and McAuliffe may have discussed something similar to NY SAFE Act for Virginia as a condition of Bloomberg’s financial support or endorsing McAuliffe; this would presumably help McAuliffe court Virginia’s business-oriented independent voters, particularly in Northern Virginia. Virginia, like Colorado, is quickly becoming a national bellwether on a host of issues. 

As Breitbart News reported, at least “one New York-based gun manufacturer” decided to move from the state because of NY SAFE Act. The Syracuse Post-Standard noted the law “expands a ban on military-style weapons, requires mental health professionals to report threats, limits magazines to seven bullets, taxes bullets, and creates a registry.” 
Politico, which reported the meeting between McAuliffe and Bloomberg, said it was unclear what the meeting was for, but noted that Bloomberg has indeed spent more than $15 million on his Mayors Against Illegal Guns group and candidates who back his gun control agenda. 
In the RealClearPolitics average of polls, McAuliffe has nearly an eight-point lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli in the gubernatorial contest, though recent polls have found that roughly 10% of the electorate is undecided. Election forecasters have the race pegged as “lean McAuliffe” or “tossup”; it is often difficult to predict turnout in an off-year elections in which the most fervent supporters are the only ones guaranteed to go to the polls. 
As Breitbart News noted, McAuliffe reportedly purchased a gun for the first time in January of 2013, and the National Rifle Association has given him an “F” rating.

On Monday, Congressman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) challenged President Obama to a skeet shooting contest to prove the veracity of his recent claim that not only has he fired a gun, but that “up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.” The new Presidential revelation came in an interview with the left-leaning New Republic conducted in part by a former staffer on his 2008 campaign and published on Saturday:

New Republic: Have you ever fired a gun?
President Obama: Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.
New Republic: The whole family?
President Obama: Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. 

Journalists, politicians, and the general public alike reacted with understandable skepticism to this politically expedient claim by the President. No one could recall ever seeing a photograph of President Obama shooting skeet, nor had he ever claimed before that he had ever participated in the sport. 
At the regular White House press briefing on Monday morning, a skeptical Jessica Yellin, CNN’s White House correspondent, pressed White House secretary Jay Carney on the issue. His response was less than convincing:



Yellin:    On a different topic, how often does the President go skeet shooting?  (Laughter.)  And are there photographs of him doing so?  
Carney:  I would refer you simply to his comments.  I don’t know how often.  He does go to Camp David with some regularity, but I’m not sure how often he’s done that.
Yellin:    Is there a photograph of him doing it?
Carney:  There may be, but I haven’t seen it.
Yellin:   Why haven’t we heard about it before?
Carney:  Because when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs.

Congressman Blackburn was among those skeptical of the President’s claim who remained unconvinced by Carney’s explanation. Monday night on CNN she issued her skeet shooting challenge to the President:


My money is on Congressman Blackburn.

Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has quietly added a slew of new measures to his self-sponsored gun control bill currently making its way through the Senate.
Schumer has been fighting to get his Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers Act of 2013 (S 374)–now called the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2013–passed into law, but one of the early problems with the bill was that it was essentially a shell or placeholder bill, incomplete at the time of introduction.
Ostensibly, Schumer’s bill is meant to change current laws to require that all firearm sales initiate a background check on the buyer before the sale is finalized. Currently, private citizens are exempt from performing background checks when they sell guns to other private citizens.


Though the original bill introduced was a shortened version, the New York Senator has since added  new amendments to his bill that raise concerns for gun rights advocates.

Schumer’s new Section 202 will make it illegal for an unlicensed person to transfer a gun to any other non-licensed person. The law would require that a licensed gun seller perform an NICS check and fill out a Form 4473 before a transfer would be legal.
Exceptions include transfers from husband to wife or immediate family, short-term transfers for hunting purposes (if the owner is present), or at a shooting range or for firearms instruction.
Section 202 also sets maximum fees for the paperwork and demands that the FFL keep the paperwork during the length of the transfer.
Section 203 is the more problematic section, as it requires that gun owners report the theft or loss of a firearm within 24 hours after discovering the loss. Unless a report is filed with the “Attorney General and to the appropriate authorities,” the gun owner faces five years of imprisonment.
Second Amendment supporters have been fighting to make sure these transfer records are not kept by the federal government in what would essentially become a national gun owner’s database.

“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”
Those twenty-seven words enshrined in the Constitution by our founding fathers clearly give us the right to own firearms in the protection of God-given liberty.
Most Americans agree with the right to bear arms. According to a recent Rasmussen survey, 65% of Americans see gun rights as “a protection against tyranny.” Among those 65% are thousands of uniformed local and state police officers who see real criminals on a daily basis who not only have not properly registered their firearms or submitted to a background check; regardless of what liberals and the Obama Administration try to jam through Congress, they’re not going to succeed. 


As the Supreme Court affirmed in the 1997 case Printz v. United States, county sheriffs are the chief law-enforcement officers in their jurisdictions, with more authority than even federal agents. As such, sheriffs work for their constituents and must comply with their oath to defend both the United States and state constitutions, not do the bidding of out-of-control politicians in Washington who apparently recognize no limits on their power. 
So elected leaders, such as Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman, Milwaukee County Sherriff David Clarke Jr., and others are speaking out against Obama’s campaign against gun ownership. Almost 300 sheriffs from across the country and at least 13 state sheriff organizations have announced their opposition to President Obama’s proposed gun control measures, pledging to defend the Second Amendment within their jurisdiction. That number is increasing on a daily basis.
While some liberal legal scholars find ambiguity in the unusual wording of the 2nd Amendment, most state constitutions are very explicit in allowing citizens to own guns. For example, the Ohio Constitution states “The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security[…],” while Delaware’s Constitution goes further: “A person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and State, and for hunting and recreational use.”

However, with the Executive Branch under control of Barack Obama, and too many liberal Democrats in Congress, our Constitutionally-protected rights are under attack
Using the senseless carnage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut as a vehicle (remember Rahm Emanuel’s comment that you should never let a crisis go to waste?), gun control advocates have shamelessly stood upon the graves of innocent children to promote their misguided political agenda. President Obama has already taken immediate steps to limit legal gun usage through constitutionally questionable executive orders; he promised more limitations during his recent State of the Union Address.
In Congress, the anti-gun efforts are lead by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who recently announced proposed legislation that would ban 157 makes and models of military-style “assault” rifles, pistols, shotguns, and semi-automatic weapons. In addition, she proposes to outlaw fixed ammunition clips that can hold more than 10 rounds and ban civilian variations of military combat model firearms.
Feinstein was the author of the 1994 assault weapons ban (which expired in 2004) and had access to plenty of data which suggests crime rates did not drop during the ban. Murder and violent crime rates never went above what they were in the year prior to the ban sunsetting. Most policemen will gladly tell you that criminals almost always use handguns.
Our rights are in jeopardy. Police officers, while they serve our communities proudly, cannot be everywhere at once, and law-abiding citizens must have the ability to protect their families before help arrives. It is time to support our police officers by standing up to President Obama’s anti-gun agenda.

Six gun companies have announced plans to stop selling any of their products to any government agency in states that severely limit the rights of private gun ownership.
Disappointed with New York State lawmakers and other jurisdictions around the country who have passed strict gun control legislation, the companies–composed of firearm manufacturers, gunsmiths, and sporting goods retailers–have announced these policies in the past week. 
Their various statements emphasize that such laws create a class of government employees with rights and and a class of citizens without rights. Thus, they refuse to aid the enforcement of such inequality.


The announcements read:

LaRue Tactical 


Effective today, in an effort to see that no legal mistakes are made by LaRue Tactical and/or its employees, we will apply all current State and Local Laws (as applied to civilians) to state and local law enforcement / government agencies. In other words, LaRue Tactical will limit all sales to what law-abiding citizens residing in their districts can purchase or possess.


Olympic Arms


Due the passing of this legislation, Olympic Arms would like to announce that the State of New York, any Law Enforcement Departments, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee of such an entity – will no longer be served as customers. 
In short, Olympic Arms will no longer be doing business with the State of New York or any governmental entity or employee of such governmental entity within the State of New York – henceforth and until such legislation is repealed, and an apology made to the good people of the State of New York and the American people. 


Extreme Firepower Inc, LLC 


The Federal Government and several states have enacted gun control laws that restrict the public from owning and possessing certain types of firearms. Law-enforcement agencies are typically exempt from these restrictions. EFI, LLC does not recognize law-enforcement exemptions to local, state, and federal gun control laws. If a product that we manufacture is not legal for a private citizen to own in a jurisdiction, we will not sell that product to a law-enforcement agency in that jurisdiction.


Templar Custom


We will not sell arms to agents of the state of New York that hold themselves to be “more equal” than their citizens.
As long as the legislators of New York think they have the power to limit the rights of their citizens, in defiance of the Constitution, we at Templar will not sell them firearms to enforce their edicts.
Templar Custom is announcing that the State of New York, any Law Enforcement Departments, Law Enforcement Officers, First Responders within the State of New York, or any New York State government entity or employee will no longer be served as customers.


York Arms


Based on the recent legislation in New York, we are prohibited from selling rifles and receivers to residents of New York. We have chosen to extend that prohibition to all governmental agencies associated with or located within New York. As a result we have halted sales of rifles, short barreled rifles, short barreled shotguns, machine guns, and silencers to New York governmental agencies.


Cheaper than Dirt 


Recently, companies such as LaRue Tactical and Olympic Arms have announced that they will no longer sell prohibited items to government agencies and personnel in states that deny the right to own those items to civilians. It has been and will continue to be Cheaper Than Dirt’s policy to not to sell prohibited items to government agencies and/or agents in states, counties, cities, and municipalities that have enacted restrictive gun control laws against their citizens.

It hasn’t always been the case that only MPs can carry firearms on U.S. military bases. A mere twenty years ago, “gun free zones” made their way to these facilities under the watch of President Bill Clinton. 
According to a Washington Times editorial written days after the Nov. 5, 2009 attack on soldiers at Fort Hood, one of Clinton’s “first acts upon taking office… was to disarm U.S. soldiers on military bases.”
Clinton’s actions birthed Army regulations “forbidding military personnel from carrying their personal firearms and making it almost impossible for commanders to issue firearms to soldiers in the U.S. for personal protection.” 


In other words, thanks to Clinton, citizens who join the military to use guns to defend liberty abroad cannot practice their constitutional right to keep and bear arms while on active duty at home. 
As the Times editorial board put it: “Because of Mr. Clinton, terrorists would face more return fire if they attacked a Texas Wal-Mart than the gunman faced at Fort Hood.”
The same theme ran true at the Navy Yard in DC on September 16. Police were called after the shooter opened fired, and reports indicate it took approximately three to seven minutes for them to arrive. Each minute is an eternity when a lunatic with a weapon decides the “gun free zone” rules do not apply to him.

13217	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/26/Screenwriter-David-Mamet-Assault-Weapons-Ban-Is-A-Political-Appeal-To-The-Ignorant	Opinion	0	Gun Rights Regulation	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Writer and film director David Mamet has weighed in on the current gun control push, and what he sees as government overreach couched in an “assault weapons” ban that is actually “a political appeal to the ignorant.”
Mamet describes it as a “hoax”- a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist, because “assault weapons” are used in few crimes, and the very designation “assault weapon” is based on a gun’s cosmetics–i.e., does it look menacing?
Going after such guns makes some people feel safer because they have slowly, and perhaps unknowingly, traded their independence for a “government knows best” mentality. 


Think about Ronald Reagan’s 10 most dangerous words in the English language–“Hi, I’m from the government and I’m here to help.” Reagan saw these words as dangerous because they were indicative of an encroaching government that had taken unto itself the role of determining what was best for you and for me: a role for which our government simply was not designed.

Mamet sees the government doing this very thing with an “assault weapons” ban, in that he sees it determining what guns we can and can’t own based on what has been determined that we do or don’t need. And as Mamet so ably points out, government officials exercise Marxist principles when they limit our exercise of freedom based on what they think we need.
This is all part of the “hoax.” It takes our eyes off of the real solution to crime in this country-namely, the strength of the individual and an armed citizenry-and it makes us think the answer is a blind trust in the supposed-altruistic aims of our government.
According to Mamet, the height of hypocrisy is that the people who are trying to disarm us are themselves surrounded (protected) by heavily armed guards. 
He specifically mentions Obama in this instance, and the way Obama has ordered armed guards for himself and his family for life. To this Mamet simply says: “Evidently, [Obama] feels he is best qualified to determine his needs, and of course, he is.” And subsequently, remarks Mamet, “I [too] am best qualified to determine mine.”

Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), a member of the Democratic Party’s leadership in the House of Representatives, suggested to Jason Mattera at a Feb. 13 women’s rights rally that plans for an assault weapons ban and private-sales background checks were only the beginning of a broader gun control agenda extending to handguns as well.
Schakowsky evidently did not recognize Mattera, a conservative video journalist and senior investigative reporter for Talk Radio Network, who infamously confronted Vice President Joe Biden in the Capitol. (Mattera introduced himself to Schakowsky by name but did not indicate that he was filming or that he is conservative.) She spoke to Mattera as if he were a fellow gun control enthusiast–and Mattera played along, eliciting answers about Schakowsky’s enthusiasm for gun control.



“We want everything on the table,” Schakowsky told Mattera. “This is a moment of opportunity. There’s no question about it.”
One poignant exchange was as follows:


Schakowsky: We’re on a roll now, and I think we’ve got to take the–you know, we’re gonna push as hard as we can and as far as we can.
Mattera: So the assault weapons ban is just the beginning?
Schakowsky: Oh absolutely. I mean, I’m against handguns. We have, in Illinois, the Council Against Handgun… something [Violence]. Yeah, I’m a member of that. So, absolutely.

In another exchange, Schakowsky proposed allowances for states and municipalities to ban guns–though such laws have been repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court:

Mattera: We’ll never get a handgun ban with the Second Amendment as stated.
Schakowsky: I don’t know. I don’t know that we can’t. And there may be an allowance, once again, for communities–I have communities in my district that prohibited handguns within their borders. The rights of municipalities and states to view that as a sensible way to keep people safe–I don’t think it’s precluded.

When Mattera asked why legislators were not pressing for a handgun ban, given that most murders are committed with handguns, Schakowsky replied: “Because we’re not going to be able to win that. Not now.” She went on to explain why background checks were a useful interim policy, arguing that they would “address any kind of weapon.”

Schakowsky’s remarks about plans for broader gun control are not the first time she has revealed the long-term goal behind short-term policy debates. She has a tendency to do so when speaking to apparently sympathetic audiences. In 2009, she told a crowd that the goal of Obamacare would be to “put the private insurance industry out of business.”
Officially, Democrats–including Schakowsky–hew to the party line as laid down by the president, which pledges support for the Second Amendment and for gun ownership in rural communities where hunting and shooting are viewed as traditional pastimes.
Gun owners fear that the Sandy Hook-inspired gun control measures before Congress–none of which would have stopped the mass shooting at Sandy Hook–are a prelude to broader regulations, including the banning of handguns and the eventual registration and confiscation of firearms, despite earnest assurances by Democrats to the contrary.
The Democratic Party has taken a hard line on guns recently, with President Obama’s strategist, David Axelrod, joining New York mayor Michael Bloomberg in backing gun control enthusiast Robin Kelly over former Rep. Debbie Halvorson, who has an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association, in the recent primary to replace former Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr. of Illinois. Kelly has promised to be a “leader” in “banning guns.”

Democrats enjoy a supermajority in the Illinois House of Representatives, holding 71 seats to the GOP’s 47. On Wednesday, the same day the US Senate voted down gun control legislation, powerful Democrat Speaker Michael Madigan tried to push a restrictive gun control measure through his chamber. The result was an open revolt by downstate Democrats, with almost half the Democrat caucus joining the GOP to kill the measure. The bill went down 31-76, a rare defeat for the legendary Madigan. 
Illinois is currently the only state in the country which doesn’t allow its citizens to have a concealed-carry gun permit. In December 2012, a federal appeals court struck down the state’s ban on concealed-carry permits, effectively ordering the state to enact the gun rights’ permit. The state is under a court-ordered deadline to pass the legislation.
On Wednesday, Dem leadership in the House moved legislation that would put severe restrictions on concealed-carry permits. It would provide that local law enforcement officials “may issue” permits, a provision that would allow local officials to effectively deny citizens in a particular jurisdiction a permit. “Must issue” permits, as long as certain criteria are met, conform more to our 2nd Amendment rights as local officials are not given the power to deny the permits. 


My first political job was in the Illinois legislature a life-time ago. Madigan, who is Chair of the IL Democrat party and father to state Attorney General Lisa Madigan, was Speaker then, as well. He is among the more shrewd and calculating political power-brokers in the country. He almost never loses a floor vote. 

It is possible, however, that he orchestrated the vote to allow his members from outside Chicago to vote against the measure. It wouldn’t be the first time he allowed the defeat of a progressive policy to protect members of his caucus. 
Either way, the Democrat revolt on the gun control measure shows the bad politics around the issue. Even while Obama embraces gun control at the federal level, Democrats in his home state reject them. Unlike Obama, they have to face voters again.

“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”
Those twenty-seven words enshrined in the Constitution by our founding fathers clearly give us the right to own firearms in the protection of God-given liberty.
Most Americans agree with the right to bear arms. According to a recent Rasmussen survey, 65% of Americans see gun rights as “a protection against tyranny.” Among those 65% are thousands of uniformed local and state police officers who see real criminals on a daily basis who not only have not properly registered their firearms or submitted to a background check; regardless of what liberals and the Obama Administration try to jam through Congress, they’re not going to succeed. 


As the Supreme Court affirmed in the 1997 case Printz v. United States, county sheriffs are the chief law-enforcement officers in their jurisdictions, with more authority than even federal agents. As such, sheriffs work for their constituents and must comply with their oath to defend both the United States and state constitutions, not do the bidding of out-of-control politicians in Washington who apparently recognize no limits on their power. 
So elected leaders, such as Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman, Milwaukee County Sherriff David Clarke Jr., and others are speaking out against Obama’s campaign against gun ownership. Almost 300 sheriffs from across the country and at least 13 state sheriff organizations have announced their opposition to President Obama’s proposed gun control measures, pledging to defend the Second Amendment within their jurisdiction. That number is increasing on a daily basis.
While some liberal legal scholars find ambiguity in the unusual wording of the 2nd Amendment, most state constitutions are very explicit in allowing citizens to own guns. For example, the Ohio Constitution states “The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security[…],” while Delaware’s Constitution goes further: “A person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and State, and for hunting and recreational use.”

However, with the Executive Branch under control of Barack Obama, and too many liberal Democrats in Congress, our Constitutionally-protected rights are under attack
Using the senseless carnage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut as a vehicle (remember Rahm Emanuel’s comment that you should never let a crisis go to waste?), gun control advocates have shamelessly stood upon the graves of innocent children to promote their misguided political agenda. President Obama has already taken immediate steps to limit legal gun usage through constitutionally questionable executive orders; he promised more limitations during his recent State of the Union Address.
In Congress, the anti-gun efforts are lead by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who recently announced proposed legislation that would ban 157 makes and models of military-style “assault” rifles, pistols, shotguns, and semi-automatic weapons. In addition, she proposes to outlaw fixed ammunition clips that can hold more than 10 rounds and ban civilian variations of military combat model firearms.
Feinstein was the author of the 1994 assault weapons ban (which expired in 2004) and had access to plenty of data which suggests crime rates did not drop during the ban. Murder and violent crime rates never went above what they were in the year prior to the ban sunsetting. Most policemen will gladly tell you that criminals almost always use handguns.
Our rights are in jeopardy. Police officers, while they serve our communities proudly, cannot be everywhere at once, and law-abiding citizens must have the ability to protect their families before help arrives. It is time to support our police officers by standing up to President Obama’s anti-gun agenda.

Not for days, not for weeks, but for months, Joe Scarborough and his Morning Joe panel not only pushed, begged and berated Congress to pass new gun control laws — they threatened, shamed, mocked, and laughed in the faces of anyone who dared disagree. But Tuesday, voters in the bluer-than-red state-of Colorado told Scarborough and company to go get their shine box.  Here is their unforgettably awkward and red-faced reaction:
—



—
What we saw from Scarborough and company, in the months following the terrible murders at Sandy Hook Elementary, wasn’t even concern-trolling; it was The Sanctimony of Our Betters coming from those who had deluded themselves into believing the GOP and NRA were on the path to irrelevance unless they reversed course and restricted Americans’ Second Amendment civil rights with laws that would have done absolutely nothing to stop another Sandy Hook. 
To listen to Scarborough, it was NRA that was losing its political clout. To listen to Scarborough, it was the GOP ensuring they would lose seats. “Oh, no,” Joe screamed! “The ‘lying‘ GOP is doomed if they don’t listen to me and hand Obama a victory on guns!”

Even after Manchin-Toomey died in the Senate, Scarborough and his peanut-gallery practiced a scorched-earth policy to hammer the NRA and GOP as out-of-touch, suicidal nitwits for not caving to their relentless emotional blackmail and cherry-picked polls. 
Well, a funny thing happened on the way to Reality, a funny thing called democracy — something that would not have caught The Bubbled off-guard had they been adult enough to consider this poll, or perhaps this one. Tuesday in Colorado, although outspent by the opposition, everyday citizens, with some help from the NRA, booted out two Democrat State Senators for passing the same gun control laws Scarborough demanded the GOP pass in order to survive. 
In other words, Scarborough was 100% wrong — it is Democrats and Bloomberg’s anti-gun group that took a beating for taking Scarborough’s advice. 
So watch the video again… This what a boorish, unrelenting, shrill, dishonest, and holier-than-thou crusade looks like after it meets American Liberty.

The California Obamacare exchange, Covered California, has enrollment snags preventing thousands of customers from obtaining insurance. Many who selected a plan as early as October are now being told by insurance companies that they have no record of their enrollment. Consumers are enduring long waiting periods on the phone, computer errors, and conflicting information from California navigators and insurers. 
Meanwhile, the state is still trying to clear a log jam of October and November paper applications that they received by mail.


“The back end is so backed up, and no one can give me an answer,” said Thomas Gallo, who was a strong supporter of Obamacare. Gallo signed up for healthcare for his family on October 2 but did not hear back for weeks. When he followed up on his application, he was told at the end of November that it was lost. “What happens if we don’t get coverage by Jan. 1? There are real problems here,” Gallo said. 

Blue Shield of California Chief Executive Paul Markovich admitted, “There are certainly some people who have enrolled or think they have enrolled and haven’t received confirmation. It’s our version of Black Friday right now and that is what we are coping with.”
The target date of January 1 is extremely important for Bret Winton and his wife because they are expecting their first child in early January. Winton is a self-employed consultant living in the Venice, CA. His insurance is being cancelled as a result of Obamacare, along with one million other Californians, because his family plan does not meet the requirements set out by the Affordable Care Act. Winton endured repeated glitches and delays as he struggled with the online exchange. He ultimately selected an Anthem Blue Cross policy, which would provide access to his wife’s doctor and hospital. 
Winton called the Covered California exchange and a recording said he would be called back in four hours. He never got the call back. He resorted to a sanctioned chat line that told him he would need to wait 14 days and then he could reapply. 
California resident Jim Arenson, a self-employed engineer, also had difficulty with the online exchange. He complained it took him two months to finally receive notice confirming he was covered through Blue Shield. “I was very scared I wouldn’t have health insurance,” said Arenson, who needs additional care after cancer surgery this year. “The exchange and the insurance company were pointing fingers at each other. There could be a lot of people falling through the cracks.”
State Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), chairman of the Senate health committee, is deeply concerned that time is running out to fix some of these enrollment problems. Now that Obamacare is the law of the land, “The question now is whether we can meet that demand. Everything seems to be bottlenecked until we open more lanes,” Hernandez said.

On Tuesday, Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer appeared on Fox & Friends and revealed that former Vice President Al Gore and other Obama cronies are cashing in on the Obamacare debacle.
In 2004, David Blood and former Vice President Al Gore co-founded Generation Investment Management. Schweizer says despite the perception that Gore’s investments are all green energy-related, Blood and Gore’s investment portfolio is currently comprised of 27% health care investments and stands poised to score big from Obamacare. 
“David Blood was a bundler for Barack Obama,” said Schweizer. “Even though they talk about being in green technology, 27% of their investment portfolio right now is in health insurance companies designed to profit from this sector.” 


Blood bundled over $500,000 in campaign donations for Obama in 2012.


Schweizer, whose new book Extortion debuted at number eight on the New York Times bestseller list, said other Obama fundraisers are also cashing in on the government health care overhaul. 
“The same thing goes for the private equity firms,” said Schweizer. “Evercore Partners–who is headed by Roger Altman, a bundler for the Obama campaign–they are said to cash in on what everybody is saying is going to be massive mergers between hospital companies, etc. Wall Street firms need to broker those deals and a company like Evercore Partners is perfectly positioned to do that.” 
Even as 4.9 million Americans are losing their health insurance plans under Obamacare, Schweizer says top Obama campaign fundraisers and insiders stand to rake in millions.  
“It’s a great business for them because the law basically creates a market for products that didn’t exist before,” said Schweizer. 
“Your book, Extortion, is going to open a lot of eyes,” said Fox & Friends co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

A New York Times investigative article based on two dozen interviews with industry insiders and confidential Obama Administration documents reveals that the catastrophic $500 million Obamacare rollout “has deeply embarrassed the White House” and has the technology companies involved “publicly distancing themselves” from the Obamacare fiasco. 
“These are not glitches. The extent of the problems is pretty enormous,” an insurance executive who participated in Obamacare conference calls told the Times. “At the end of our calls, people say, ‘It’s awful, just awful.'” 
The Times says those closest to the three-and-a-half year-long building of Obamacare, like embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, ignored or quashed the myriad warning bells sounding all around them. On Tuesday, the Republican National Committee released a #FireSebelius web ad calling for Sebelius’s ousting. 



“We foresee a train wreck,” one insurance executive working on Obamacare IT said in February. “We don’t have the IT specifications. The level of angst in health plans is growing by leaps and bounds. The political people in the administration do not understand how far behind they are.” 
The comments mirror those made in April by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) who helped craft Obamacare. At the time, Baucus said Obamacare was “a huge train wreck coming down.”  

Now, the companies that bagged millions to build the Obamacare digital architecture are scurrying to avoid public ridicule and scrutiny. “Worried about their reputations, contractors are now publicly distancing themselves from the troubled parts of the federally run project,” reports the Times. 
Development Seed President Eric Gundersen told the Times his company built the busted HealthCare.org website but “had nothing to do with what happened after a user hit the ‘Apply Now’ button.”
Oracle, which was subcontracted to handle identity management software used in the Obamacare registration process, claims its services are running swimmingly. “Our software is running properly,” said Oracle communications vice president Deborah Hellinger.
One of Obamacare’s biggest winners of taxpayer dollars has been CGI Group. Washington Examiner reporter Richard Pollock says that the U.S. subsidiary of Canadian company CGI (which stands for “Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique”) Group, CGI Federal, received a no-bid sweetheart contract worth $93 million. Since 2009, CGI has scored $678 million in taxpayer money for 185 separate task orders. 
Even progressive Democrats are now blasting Obamacare’s failures. 
Former Obama White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs says President Barack Obama should fire those responsible for the “excruciatingly embarrassing” Obamacare rollout. 
Progressive Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein, a strong Obamacare supporter, wrote on Monday that “So far, the Affordable Care Act’s launch has been a failure. Not ‘troubled.’ Not ‘glitchy.’ A failure.” 
Obamacare will cost taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years.

As Senate leaders hammer out a deal to end the partial government shutdown and lift the nation’s debt ceiling, sources on Capitol Hill tell Breitbart News that labor unions are poised to win a significant delay in an ObamaCare tax. The delay in the tax, which has long been a goal of Big Labor, is expected to be part of a spending agreement brokered by Sens. Reid and McConnell. 
At issue is a “reinsurance” tax levied against all group health plans. The funds raised would be used to compensate insurance companies for providing coverage to extremely sick individuals. Labor unions have made eliminating the tax a top priority, arguing that it would drive up the cost of health insurance for union members. At the recently concluded AFL-CIO annual meeting last month, union members passed a resolution calling for a repeal of the tax. The outlines of the emerging Senate spending deal will delay imposition of the tax for one year. 
When House Republicans passed their government spending bill, with a one-year delay in ObamaCare’s individual mandate, President Obama countered that the health care program was the “settled” law of the land. Which, apparently, is true unless one has a PAC that showers millions of dollars in campaign contributions on lawmakers. 


Earlier this year, the Obama Administration delayed for one year the mandate that large employers provide health insurance to their employees. This came soon after a similar one-year delay in the set-up of health exchanges for small businesses. Since ObamaCare passed Congress, the Administration has issued hundreds of waivers to special interests, exempting them from the effects of the law. 
It seems that only the average American citizen will be made to comply with the ObamaCare program. Democrats, throughout the fiscal stand-off, have argued that ObamaCare should not be altered or reformed. Unless, of course, you are a labor union.

In a speech at Boston’s Faneuil Hall on Wednesday afternoon, President Barack Obama discarded his now-infamous broken promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep your health insurance.” Instead, he offered a new promise: “You will be getting a better deal,” the president told health insurance consumers. 
He blamed insurance companies, not Obamacare, for the canceled policies:



Now, if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law, and you really like that plan, you were able to keep it. That’s what I said when I was running for office. That was part of the promise we made. But ever since the law was passed, if insurers decided to downgrade or cancel the substandard plans, what we said under the law is that you have got to replace them with quality, comprehensive coverage because that, too, was a central premise of the Affordable Care Act from the very beginning…
So if you’re getting one of these letters [canceling your insurance policy], just shop around in the new marketplace. That’s what it’s for…
For the fewer than 5% of Americans who buy insurance on your own, you will be getting a better deal. So anyone peddling the motion that insurers are canceling people’s plan without mentioning that almost all the insurers are encouraging people to join better plans with the same carrier and stronger benefits and stronger protections, while others will be able to get better plans with new carriers through the marketplace, and then many will get new help to pay for these better plans and make them actually cheaper–if you leave that stuff out, you’re being grossly misleading, to say the least.

Ignoring evidence that the “better deal” is often far more expensive than existing plans, the president updated his promise without apologizing for misleading voters for years about the consequences of Obamacare. He also ignored the fact that companies were compelled by the law to change their plans to comply with new rules.
Obama, repeating a common Democrat talking point, also cited Medicare Part D to claim that Democrats had helped Republicans improve that policy, even though they had opposed it. However, as Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC) pointed out in Congress earlier Wednesday, Medicare Part D is voluntary–unlike Obamacare.

To the average American, ObamaCare is part web site disaster, part shattered campaign promise writ very, very large.
Millions of Americans have already been forced out of their existing health care policies, a number that may skyrocket in the new year.


Russell Simmons sees it differently.

The hip-hop mogul says ObamaCare is already so successful it’s saved thousands, if not millions of lives.
Yes, we initially wanted single payer, and we had to compromise back in 2009 for the Affordable Care Act. But, it is a damn good piece of legislation that has already saved hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives. So, let us not give up now.
Simmons blasted the 39 house Democrats who voted in favor of tweaking ObamaCare, but he saved his harshest words for the GOP in toto.

I know where Republicans stand. They have voted 47 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, so their stance is clear. If you get sick, you’re on your own. If you can’t pay for your medical expenses, declare bankruptcy. If you have a pre-existing condition, they’ll send you a get well card when you’re on your death-bed. Whatever President Obama stands for, they stand for the opposite. Even if it goes against every principle they have advocated for in the past, they would rather destroy our country, than see President Obama pass policy that is good for ALL Americans.

As for the millions who already lost their health care plan thanks to ObamaCare’s arrival, Simmons says they should simply say, “good riddance.” He simply knows better than you. Period.

And please don’t tell me this about people whose healthcare was canceled…because that healthcare is predatory and it is unconscionable that we would allow anyone in this country to own such policies.

***UPDATE: Media reports say that President Obama selected a health insurance ObamaCare plan Monday. This is a symbolic act. The president will continue to get his health care from the military.  
Via Twitter, April Ryan, White House Correspondent and Washington Bureau Chief for American Urban Radio Networks, reports that President Obama will enroll in ObamaCare sometime before the end of the day Monday.The president is currently vacationing in Hawaii. Today is the last day to enroll in ObamaCare if you want coverage to begin at the beginning of the new year.

Just off phone w/Valerie Jarrett @vj44 POTUS will sign up for for Health Insurance on the Market place by the end of today 2 lead by example
— AprilDRyan (@AprilDRyan) December 23, 2013

Whether the president will risk signing up while cameras are rolling is still unknown. The risk in the president doing so is that HealthCare.gov crashes on him and in front of the entire world. As recently as Friday, the site collapsed. 

Regardless, it certainly can’t hurt for Obama to sign up. Currently, reports show that ObamaCare enrollment is way behind where it needs to be if the program is going to be financially viable.  
Moreover, reports on the number of enrollees the White House releases and the media slavishly repeats are inaccurate. You have to pay your first month’s policy in order to be enrolled and insured. Both the White House and the media are reporting those who have only put a health plan in their shopping cart as “enrolled.” 
Studies show that the online abandonment rate of items placed in a shopping cart is as high as 65%. 
Currently, the media have shown little interest in digging up or demanding the real ObamaCare enrollment numbers.

Last week, President Obama apologized for misleading the American public with his false claim that “if you like your insurance, you can keep it.” Without this assurance, it is unlikely ObamaCare would have passed. Obama was not the only politician fudging the truth. Most Democrat lawmakers repeated this claim on the campaign trail and in meetings with constituents. If Obama apologized, they should as well, as they are equally culpable. 
Breitbart News has compiled a list of the Top 10 Senate Democrats who should follow Obama’s lead and apologize to the American public. These particular lawmakers either went all-in on the false claim for partisan reasons or were in a position to know that millions of Americans would not be able to keep their health insurance. 
If a reader interprets this list as a guide for whom to call in Congress, so be it. 


10. SEN. MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA): “If you like the insurance that you have, you’ll be able to keep it.” (MSNBC’s Hardball, 12/16/09)
Mary Landrieu, like all Senate Democrats, provided the deciding vote on passing ObamaCare. After 3 years, it is hard to remember all the parliamentary tricks the Democrats used to pass a bill that almost none of them had read. Landrieu, who is up for reelection next year, lied on TV. She should apologize. 
9. SEN. KAY HAGAN (D-NC): “We need to support the private insurance industry so that people who have insurance they’re happy with can keep it while also providing a backstop option for people without access to affordable coverage.” (“Republicans Vent As Other Compromise Plans Get Aired,” National Journal’s Congress Daily, 6/18/09)

160,000 residents of North Carolina has lost their health coverage. Sen. Hagan has been most aggressive in trying to separate herself from ObamaCare. No wonder, since even a Democrat poll has found her now in a statistical tie with any of her possible Republican challengers. In September,  Hagan held a 12-17 point lead. She is up for reelection next year and should apologize. 
8. SEN. MARK BEGICH (D-AK): “If you got a doctor now, you got a medical professional you want, you get to keep that. If you have an insurance program or a health care policy you want of ideas, make sure you keep it. That you can keep who you want.”
Begich won his Senate seat in 2008, after DOJ staffers trumped up false charges against the sitting GOP Senator Ted Stevens. Begich is running for reelection in Alaska, without the Obama wave and without a mythical DOJ investigation. He should apologize. 
7. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): “We should begin with a basic principle: if you have coverage and you like it, you can keep it. If you have your doctor, and you like him or her, you should be able to keep them as well. We will not take that choice away from you.”
Sen. Bennet heads to DSCC, the party arm to elect Democrats to the US Senate. He will have an outsized role in races across the country. He said his position on ObamaCare was based on a “basic principle.” He should apologize.  

6. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): “Again, if you like what you have, you will be able to keep it. Let me say this again: If you like what you have, when our legislation is passed and signed by the President, you will be able to keep it.” (Sen. Murray, Congressional Record, S.6400, 6/10/09)
Let me say this again, as a senior member, and now Chair of the Budget Committee, Sen. Murray must have been in a position to know that these claims were false. She won her first race for Senate campaigning as a “soccer mom” in “tennis shoes.” Insert your own joke. 290,000 residents of Washington have lost their health insurance. She should apologize. 

5. SEN. TOM HARKIN (D-IA): “One of the things we put in the health care bill when we designed it was the protection for consumers to keep the plan they have if they like it; thus, the term ‘grandfathered plans.’ If you have a plan you like –existing policies–you can keep them. …we said, if you like a plan, you get to keep it, and you can grandfather it in.” (Sen. Harkin, Congressional Record, S.7675-6, 9/29/10)
Sen. Harkin has long been a slippery politician. As Chair of the Health Committee in the Senate, Harkin would have had more intimate knowledge of ObamaCare than most other lawmakers. His yowler here is he tries to claim that the “put in” language to ensure people could keep the plan they like. That is a sin of commission. Harkin, who is retiring, should absolutely apologize. 
4. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): “If you like your insurance, you keep it.” (U.S. Senate, Finance Committee, Bill Mark-Up, 9/24/09)

Schumer, who was in a position to know the inner-workings of the law seems to have lied. Asking him for an apology, though, is like asking Anthony Weiner to become modestly self-aware. Still, he should apologize. 
3. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): “This bill before us on the Senate floor makes it clear that if you have an insurance policy that you like, you can keep it. If you like the doctor that you’re currently doing business with, you can continue to use that doctor.” (Sen. Durbin, Teleconference, 12/4/09)
Durbin is the Number 2 Democrat in the Senate, amazingly. He seems preternaturally disposed to obscuring the truth. He actually said the legislation “makes it clear” that you can keep your insurance. He either can’t read legislation or he was intentionally misleading the public. In any event, he should apologize. 
2.SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV):”In fact, one of our core principles is that if you like the health care you have, you can keep it.” (Sen. Reid, Congressional Record, S.8642, 8/3/09)
Core principles, apparently, aren’t what they used to be. Sen. Reid emptied out the parliamentary cupboard to get ObamaCare passed. As Majority Leader, he had to have a keen understanding of what was in the bill and what the consequences would be. The White House, at the time, was aware of the fact that many Americans would lose their health insurance. Surely, Sen. Reid was privy to the same information. He should apologize.
And, the #1 Senate Democrat who should apologize… 
1. SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT): “That is why one of the central promises of health care reform has been and is: If you like what you have, you can keep it. That is critically important. If a person has a plan, and he or she likes it, he or she can keep it.” (Sen. Baucus, Congressional Record, S.7676, 9/29/10)
Sen. Baucus wrote most of the bill that became ObamaCare. He has been steeped in health care policy for decades. He was in a position to know, and had to know, that the “central promise” that people could keep their current health care coverage was a lie.
He should apologize, but unfortunately, he has chosen to retire rather than face the voters. I can only hope he does not go softly into the night.

Although polls show the American people’s opposition to ObamaCare is increasing to all-time highs, Senate majority Leader Harry Reid is making no secret of the fact that Democrats look at Obama’s signature legislation as merely a step towards putting ObamaCare on steroids through a single-payer system. 
The Las Vegas Sun reports that during an appearance on “Nevada Week In Review, Reid answered, “Yes. Yes. Absolutely, yes,” when asked if “the country would have to have a health care system that abandoned insurance as the means of accessing it.”
The idea of introducing a single-payer national health care system to the United States, or even just a public option, sent lawmakers into a tizzy back in 2009, when Reid was negotiating the health care bill.


“We had a real good run at the public option … don’t think we didn’t have a tremendous number of people who wanted a single-payer system,” Reid said on the PBS program, recalling how then-Sen. Joe Lieberman’s opposition to the idea of a public option made them abandon the notion and start from scratch.
Reid also said that ObamaCare was “a step in the right direction” and that America has to “work our way past” insurance-based health care.
“Single-payer” is a deceptive term that means “socialized medicine.” Insurance companies are put out of business and the government takes over as the sole payer of all health care costs.

This also means that the government decides on how much will be reimbursed for services and which procedures are paid for and which ones are not. These policies frequently result in what is known as health care rationing and “death panels.” If certain procedures are not covered or adequately reimbursed, doctors will not perform them (except for the very rich who can pay out of pocket). 
Lousy reimbursements, government red tape, and the lack of flexibility and innovation that comes in a free market tend to drive health care professionals to professions that the government does not exert full control over. Fewer doctors equals health-care rationing and the long waits for vital procedures that are common in countries currently under a single-payer system. 
The first services usually axed by death panels staffed with a handful of bureaucrats are the costly and uncertain experimental procedures that sometimes fail many times before leading to a breakthrough, as well as expensive, life-saving operations on the ill, handicapped, and elderly. 
Some Democrats, most notably Howard Dean, are already pushing back against the “death panels” that are already a part of ObamaCare.

On Thursday, President Barack Obama said of his health care law: “Despite all the evidence that the law is working the way it’s supposed to,” there are critics out there. He says they must be doing it for purely political reasons. That sound you hear is the fire alarm going off in the White House. 
Shortly after the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) was signed into law on Mar. 23, 2010, the administration announced that the massive Title VIII of the law–the CLASS Act that would set up a national system of elderly case–would never be implemented, because the Obama administration cannot find any way either to implement the system or to pay for it. 


Over the past three years, the Obama administration has been issuing “waivers” for various ACA requirements regarding how much companies must pay out in health care benefits to employees, because many low-wage employers like McDonald’s couldn’t meet those requirements, and would have to cancel all health care benefits for those employees. (It should also be noted that the “waivers” are unlawful, because the ACA imposes that requirement on employers and does not allow the government to waive them.) 
A year ago, the Supreme Court struck down as a violation of the Tenth Amendment the mandatory expansion of Medicaid in all 50 states, making it entirely optional. The White House started scrambling when half the states in the nation refused to go along with this unaffordable and unmanageable expansion of government health care. 
Also a year ago, the IRS issued a new regulation saying that the massive subsidies that taxpayers would have to pay on health care policies purchased from state-run government exchanges in all 50 states would also apply to policies purchased on an exchange run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, because it became clear that many states would not participate in that government-run model either. (In fact, 34 states have refused to set up exchanges, and the IRS’s regulation is being challenged in court as illegal.) 

Then two weeks ago, the Treasury Department announced that for the first year it is in effect (2014), the IRS would not enforce the Employer Mandate requiring large employers to provide healthcare to employees. The system was ready to implode and deprive millions of Americans of both health care and work hours (forcing many employers to cut hours to 29/week for full-time employees), and the IRS could not develop an effective reporting or enforcement system. (Like the “waivers” above, this too is illegal.) 
And just this week, HHS announced that the massive state exchange system may be put off a year as well. It was supposed to start on Oct. 1, 2013, and is having so many severe problems that it too cannot start when the ACA says it must. 
Yet with all that, Obama says that the ACA is working great, and those who deny it must have sinister political motives. (Set aside the fact that now some of the ACA’s biggest critics are major unions like AFL-CIO and the Teamsters, normally Obama’s biggest allies and without whose zealous support the ACA would never have passed Congress.)
It’s like George Orwell’s 1984. The government literally could say 2+2=5, and no one would call them on it. If a conservative leader said such things, the media would call for his head. But when a liberal does it, they ignore it. (Or if you’re MSNBC, you applaud his “courage” and might offer him a TV show to anchor.)
If any private citizen said such things, we’d have a one-word label for him: “liar.” But most people in this country rightly show great respect for the institution of the presidency that we don’t use such terms (unless they’re committed liberals and the president happens to be a conservative Republican–in which case you can call him anything you want). Instead, we say he’s “got his facts wrong” or he’s using “fuzzy math,” or some other such softer statement. 
So using such a word would be disrespectful, and we won’t do it here. But if the smoke detectors go off at the White House, there’s no need to call the fire department. The smoke is because President Obama’s pants are on fire.

On Wednesday, as Tea Party activists rallied against the IRS and the Senate immigration bill on Capitol Hill, President Barack Obama’s campaign-turned-lobbying arm, Organizing for Action (OfA), emailed a warning about “threats on women’s health” in Congress. It urged its members to sign a petition against a “terrifying” decision the GOP “to stand between a woman and her doctor when it comes to her health care decisions.”
Meanwhile, for the past several weeks, Republicans have sent fundraising pitches to their donors expressing indignation over the IRS scandal, in which the agency targeted conservative groups on the basis of their names and views for additional, and excessive, scrutiny. They are seeking to capitalize on grass-roots outrage–outrage that is often equally directed at Republican leadership–as they ramp up campaign efforts for 2014.


The OfA email about abortion is a re-hash of the 2012 presidential campaign’s “war on women” theme–and is aided, once again, by the mainstream media’s eagerness to focus on conservative gaffes, to the exclusion of mistakes by the president or members of his party. In addition to the abortion issue, Democrats are seizing on controversy over sexual assault in the military to signal to female voters that they are fighting for them.

The abortion issue has, in fact, gained new poignancy–though not in a way that favors the pro-choice side. The trial and conviction of Dr. Kermit Gosnell for the gruesome murders of babies delivered at his abortion clinic was ignored by the mainstream media but inspired pro-life activists to press for legislation limiting abortions past 20 weeks–the bill that inspired the OfA email but which, curiously, it does not describe.
Democrats are clearly worried about a midterm lull–which is why they have not only found it necessary to re-ignite old issues, but to share, selectively, in conservative outrage. As the IRS scandal has unfolded, for example, Democrats have strained to argue that “progressive” and liberal non-profits were also “targeted” by the IRS. Some Democrats have also split openly with the White House over the NSA and Prism scandals.
Meanwhile, Republicans are buoyed by a sense that frustration at the Obama administration scandals will help bring millions of conservative voters back to the polls after many apparently sat out the 2012 contest. The redistricting that followed the 2010 elections will also help ensure the party holds the House. But the race for the Senate has pit the GOP establishment against the base, as have issues like immigration reform. 
In that context, the IRS scandal represents a rare point of unity, which is why even those Republicans busily defending the NSA’s surveillance programs against the party’s resurgent libertarian wing are citing the IRS scandal as a legitimate grievance. The full extent of the IRS abuses is unknown, and questions remain about who ordered the targeting, and why. Yet the issue has already become part of the 2014 election lexicon.
Midterm elections typically have lower turnout than presidential elections, which is why the 2014 effort by both sides will be aimed at motivating their party’s base voters. Republicans already have a wide variety of new conservative grievances to harness; Democrats are, thus far, returning to themes that have worked in the past. In the thick of the fight, the actual issues at the core of these debates risk being hijacked or obscured.

Obama explains that when he told Americans they could keep their healthcare plans, “period,” under the Affordable Care Act, he actually meant the promise was conditional.
For the second time in a week, President Barack Obama backtracked on his promise to Americans that they could keep their health insurance plans under Obamacare, telling a group of activists on Monday that what he had really meant was that Americans could keep their healthcare plans “if it hasn’t changed since the law passed.” 



Speaking at an Organizing for Action health care summit in Washington, D.C., Obama revised a signature mantra of his stump speeches during the Obamacare debate and the 2012 campaign in which he repeatedly said that under Obamacare, “If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.” 

In 2009, the President even cut off the possibility of modifiers to that plan. In a speech to the American Medical Association, he stated, “If you like your healthcare plan, you’ll be able to keep your healthcare plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.”
In his Monday speech, however, the promise took on newfound nuance. “Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,” Obama said. “So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act, you’re grandfathered in on that plan. But if the insurance company changes it, then what we’re saying is they’ve got to change it to a higher standard.
“They’ve got to make it better, they’ve got to improve the quality of the plan they are selling. That’s part of the promise that we made too. That’s why we went out of our way to make sure that the law allowed for grandfathering.”
In addition to the malfunctioning HealthCare.gov website, millions of Americans have been receiving cancellation notices from their health insurance providers since Obamacare went into effect in October. Mainstream media outlets and personalities–from the Washington Post to MSNBC’s Chuck Todd–that were some of Obama’s fiercest defenders the last four years have called him out on this falsehood, even admitting in hindsight that they were skeptical of Obama’s signature claim.
Obama attempted his first rewrite of history last Wednesday in his healthcare speech at Boston’s Fanueil Hall after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was grilled in front of Congress and apologized for Obamacare’s rollout, which she conceded was a “debacle.” 
“For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it,” Obama said last week in Boston. Obama then said that Americans who were receiving cancellation letters merely had “substandard” insurance plans.

On Monday, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin urged Americans to light up Capitol Hill switchboards to urge senators to live up to their campaign promises and support Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) in their effort to defund Obamacare. 
“Remember, we elected these senators precisely for moments like this. If they can’t do anything with the power we’ve given them through their elected office, then perhaps it’s time for them to retire and let someone else have a go,” Palin said. “Opposition to Obamacare carried us to victory in 2010. And 2014 is just around the corner.”


On Saturday, Palin wrote an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News backing Lee and Cruz. In her Facebook post on Monday, the day the Obamacare fight started in the Senate, Palin said it was even more important for Americans living in red states–like Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina–represented by Democrats to “politely” let their senators know there will be consequences at the ballot box if they vote procedurally to shut down debate in the Senate: 


Please call your senators and politely ask them to stand with Senator Cruz. This is especially important if your senator is a Democrat up for re-election in a red state in 2014. That would be Senators Mark Begich (D-AK), Mark Pryor (D-AR), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), and Kay Hagan (D-NC). Remind them politely that we are watching their votes very carefully and even a procedural vote that shuts down this debate will be regarded as a vote for Obamacare, and there will be consequences for them at the ballot box next year. The same goes for Republicans up for re-election. We definitely expect them to stand shoulder to shoulder with Senator Cruz through thick and thin.

The House passed a short-term resolution to fund the government except for Obamacare on Friday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is attempting to insert an amendment to that bill that funds Obamacare before sending the bill back to the House. On Monday, Cruz asked that there be a 60-vote threshold for amendments on the House bill being taken up in the Senate. 
Palin reiterated, “We shouldn’t preemptively surrender the fight to those who rammed through this outrageously burdensome and unaffordable ploy for government control of health care even though some are trying to convince us that the fight is futile.”
“Just because a fight isn’t easy, doesn’t mean it’s not worth fighting,” she said.
Palin then included information about where Americans could find the contact information for their senators: 

The number for the Capitol Hill Switchboard is 202-224-3121. Ask for your senator’s office. You can also find their contact information and contact them online at

In the wake of Sandy Hook, to justify openly pressuring Congress to restrict our Second Amendment gun rights, the national media frequently pointed to polls showing majority public support for laws that would broaden the scope of background checks. When this law failed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, the media bellyached for weeks about the filibuster and the GOP “obstructionism” that thwarts the will of the people. 
This is not a new kind of media attack against the political right. Ever since Obama assumed the presidency, under the guise of reporting, the media have attacked our “do nothing” congress as dysfunctional and incapable of accomplishing anything. According to the media, a legislative body  “doing nothing” is a huge problem. As the media push to see millions of Democrats legalized through immigration reform, look for this media narrative to explode at the GOP Congress. 


But in reality, we all know that this is wild hypocrisy and that our media see some obstructionists who thwart the will of the people as a lot more equal than others. 
Take for instance, State Senator Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who is now a full-fledged national Media Dahling after her 11-hour filibuster managed to block the Texas Senate from passing laws that would have outlawed abortion after 20 weeks and made abortion clinics safer. 
As I write this, Davis is being hailed all across the national news as a courageous, principled, instant superstar. ABC News, CBS News, The Washington Post… all hailed her obstructionism. Left-wing cable news outlets — CNN and MSNBC — were  just as gushing; as were the morning news shows. 

Anyone familiar with our media knows what the Media Narrative is here — all about gender politics, “reproductive rights,” and any other buzzword that can be utilized to place Wendy Davis astride a white horse, and her political opponents grunting away in that Neanderthal cave known as Texas. 
Naturally, though, most of the national media are ignoring any pertinent facts inconvenient to their agenda. Here are five of them:
1. The Texas Bill will Make Abortion Safer: After the horrors discovered at the clinic of abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell (which the media all-but ignored), many of which were only possible due to the local government’s politically motivated lack of oversight towards abortion clinics, Texas decided to act to make abortion safer. One of the primary objectives of the bill Davis filibustered is to ensure that women who seek a legal abortion are properly cared for. 
This is what is in the bill Davis obstructed, and what some in media are cynically and dishonestly portraying as a move to force abortion clinics to close:
In truth, clinics would close only if they failed to meet new safety standards that have been drawn in response to the horror stories in Philadelphia and Houston. The new rules, as summarized by the Texas Alliance for Life, would have “increase[d] abortion facility safety standards to the level of ambulatory surgical centers to shut down Gosnell-like abortion providers in Texas,” “require[d] the 18,000 RU-486 abortions performed each year be done according to FDA safety standards,” and “require[d] physicians who perform abortions to be qualified to treat life-threatening complications after botched abortions and have privileges at a local hospital.”

2. The American People Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of the American people who, by 48% to 44%, favor what’s in the Texas bill: a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. A full 80% want abortion banned after the second trimester. 
3. A Majority of American Women Back the Ban: Davis also obstructed the will of American women, who support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks at a higher percentage than men, 50% to 44%. 

4. A Huge Majority of Texans Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of Texans; almost two-thirds (62%)  of whom  favor this ban on abortion after 20 weeks. 
5.  Late-term Abortion Ban Is More Popular with Women than ObamaCare: Yep.
—

We could add a number 6. Abortion is especially horrific after just a few weeks. Here is a fact the media never-ever report on, what the act of abortion really is:
At six weeks, the baby’s brain, spinal cord, and central nervous system are all pretty well formed — in outline at least. By the two-month mark, sensory organs begin to develop and bone replaces cartilage. …
At each of these stages, had the bill been passed, it would have remained legal in Texas to kill the child. The law that Wendy Davis and her fellow “pro-science” acolytes so bravely stood against would have rendered it illegal to kill the child after this point. And when I say kill, I mean kill. I mean break bones, rip apart limbs, crush skulls, drain fluids, still a beating heart, annihilate a brain that is capable of dreaming, and crush a nervous system. I mean: Kill.
Other than winning Barack Obama elections, nothing brings out our media’s bias, dishonesty, and hypocrisy like the issue of abortion. 
My thanks to Charles W. Cooke over at National Review whose superb Tuesday editorial both inspired this post and made it possible.

The prize for best line of questioning to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius at the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Wednesday morning must go to Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC), for pinning Sebelius down on the question of why Obamacare requires men to buy maternity coverage. Sebelius tried to squirm away–as she had done with many other questioners, but Ellmers was on her “A” game.
Ellmers’s performance was particularly commendable because she is lower in the congressional pecking order and therefore had to wait until the end, with less time to spare. She even found time, using a pointed yes-or-no question, to puncture Democrats’ favorite dodge–namely, that helped Republicans improve Medicare Part D, even though they had opposed it. (Unlike Obamacare, Medicare Part D is voluntary, as Sebelius had to admit.)


Next, Ellmers turned to the fact that Obamacare makes consumers pay more for insurance they do not need (much like being forced to buy a fancy car with all of the options, when a basic new car or used car would have been fine). 

The ensuing exchange should be studied by Republicans for future reference. This is how it’s done:


Rep. Ellmers: You also brought up the issue, when you were in Kansas [as governor and health insurance commissioner], that you fought against discriminatory issues. Now I–you know, as far as the essential health benefits [of Obamacare], correct me if I’m wrong, do men not have to buy maternity coverage? 
Sec. Sebelius: Policies will cover maternity coverage for young and healthy– 
Rep. Ellmers: Including men?
Sec. Sebelius: Under 30-year-olds will have a choice also of a catastrophic plan which has no maternity coverage.
Rep. Ellmers: The men are required to purchase– 
Sec. Sebelius: Well, an insurance policy has a series of benefits, whether you use them or not. And one of the benefits will be– 
Rep. Ellmers: And that is why the health care premiums are increasing this high, because we’re forcing them to buy things they will never need. Thank you, madam chairman.
Sec. Sebelius: The individual policies cover families. Men often do need maternity coverage for their spouses and for their families, yes. 
Rep. Ellmers: Single male, age 32, does not need maternity coverage. 
[Crosstalk]
Rep. Ellmers: To the best of your knowledge has a man ever delivered a baby?
Sec. Sebelius: I don’t think so.
Chair: The gentlelady’s time has expired.
[Laughter]

Apparently the media is growing tired of the White House selectively releasing ObamaCare data that gets to the heart of nothing but makes the program look like it is much more popular than it likely is. For instance, today the White House informed the media that between Sunday and Friday, Healthcare.gov enjoyed 3.7 million visits. 
We have also been told  that the site’s error rate was .077 percent, the response time averaged under a second, and a whopping (and improbable) 93% of consumers did come back later after they were asked to due to the site being too busy. 


As The Hill points out, though, that data is all hollow happy talk that tells us nothing about what really matters. What the White House refuses to disclose, or claims it doesn’t yet have the data to disclose, just happens to be the information that will tell us if ObamaCare is or is not working:
The Obama administration is selectively releasing data and metrics on ObamaCare to bolster its case that the rollout is going better in the month of December.
Tidbits of information from federal health officials — especially figures that show improvements at HealthCare.gov — have become a key tool in the effort to “reboot” the law in the eyes of the public.

But the limited nature of the releases has created conflict with the media and put the spotlight on outstanding areas of concern for the rollout, such as the enrollment site’s back end.
The White House has blithely changed the definition of the world “enrollee” to someone who has not yet enrolled, but has only selected an insurance plan and placed it into a shopping cart. Studies show that the abandonment rate for shopping carts is 67%. 
Up until now, though, the media have breathlessly reported “enrollment” numbers spoon-fed to them by the White House without doing any of their own independent reporting to find out how many have actually enrolled. Maybe those days are coming to an end. 
The Hill points out the other vital metrics the White House has thus far not released:
Since late October, federal health officials have touted traffic to the site, error rates and page load times almost daily in an effort to illustrate positive changes.

Enrollment figures are only discussed monthly, and leaked sign-up numbers are not confirmed. Vital information for judging the growing risk pools, such as applicants’ ages, goes undiscussed.
The administration appears to have largely chosen data over anecdotes as the most powerful way to communicate site improvements to the media.
The metrics released are difficult to independently verify, but provide easy headlines and talking points for anxious supporters of the Affordable Care Act, including congressional Democrats.
Another area where the White House has dissembled rather than been forthcoming involves the number of meetings between Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama during the three years after the passage of ObamaCare. A Government Accountability Institute study finds only a single meeting between the two recorded on any White House calendar or log. Friday, Jay Carney would only say that the two met frequently, but provided no details. 
While we are sure to be hit with all kinds of selective data leaks before the end of the year that are only meant to make ObamaCare look successful, The Hill reports that a number that will not be released until the end of the year is a breakdown of those who are truly enrolled — in other words, those who have actually paid for a premium.
The fact that the White House always has positive data that sounds good but means nothing, but never the data that matters, has raised the suspicions of the American people from the beginning. It is good to know now, that after two-plus months of this Administration Hustle, the media has apparently had enough.

On Tuesday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) indicated on the floor of the Senate he was “open to having a vote” on Senator David Vitter’s (R-LA) amendment to eliminate the Obamacare exemption for members of Congress, according to a Breitbart source on Capitol Hill. Today, however, he and his Democratic colleagues are singing a different tune, and the lyrics come straight from that timeless phrase used by hypocrites throughout American history: “What’s good for thee is not good for me.”
In early September, Reid defended the exemption to Obamacare granted to members of Congress and their staffers by the Office of Personnel and Management on August 7. As Heritage’s The Foundry pointed out, “there is no statutory authority, either in Obamacare or in Title V of the U.S Code, for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to make government insurance contributions on behalf of federal employees to any plan other than an FEHBP plan.”
But when Vitter introduced his No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment on September 12, Reid was forced to make a decision on whether it should be brought to a vote. As Majority Leader of the Senate, Reid exercises power by determining what bills will come to a vote in committees and before the full Senate. 


Reid has indicated from the outset that he opposes Vitter’s amendment, but he has attempted to maintain the public fiction that the amendment would receive the same treatment as any amendment proposed by any member of the Senate.

Despite significant evidence to the contrary, Reid continues to insist that the Congressional exemption authorized by the Office of Personnel Management is contained within the law. But on Tuesday, Vitter called the Congressional Obamacare exemption “flat out against the law,” and that exposure of Reid’s blatant hypocrisy may have been too much for the Majority Leader to take.
When Senate Democrats subsequently prevented Vitter’s amendment from coming to a vote, Vitter took to the floor of the Senate and delivered a statement that called Reid out on his hypocrisy.  “After freaking out last Thursday with threats and bribery, this week Harry Reid said he’s fine with an up-or-down vote on my No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment. I guess that was just a weak attempt at disguising his fear about losing his special exemption,” he said.
According to a statement issued by his office on Thursday, “Vitter’s amendment would reverse and clarify the decision by the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) on Obamacare. The legislation will require that all Members of Congress, the President, Vice President, and all political appointees in the Administration must purchase their health insurance on the Obamacare Exchange without the help of taxpayer-funded subsidies. Congressional staff would be prohibited from receiving any contribution greater than what they would receive if they were not employed by a congressional office.”
Tea party stalwart Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) are co-sponsors of the Vitter amendment, along with Senators Mike Enzi (R-WY), Dean Heller (R-V), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Jim Inhofe (R-OK).

On Tuesday, NBC News reporter and MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell revealed she did not know that lawmakers in Congress must be enrolled in Obamacare. Her remarks bolster Rep. Sean Duffy’s (R-WI) claim that the mainstream press may be both ill-prepared and unwilling to critically question the Obama administration on its signature healthcare legislation. 
Appearing on Mitchell Reports, Duffy and Mitchell got into a contested debate about whether a one-year delay of the individual mandate, which Republicans want as part of a short-term resolution to fund the government, was negotiable and whether the mainstream media has properly questioned the administration on Obamacare. 
At one point during the exchange, Duffy said:

And why won’t he join us in ObamaCare? Why wasn’t Michelle Obama on October 1st at the computer with her family signing up for ObamaCare? Or Jay Carney? They have their own gold-plated health care plan that they’re in and they don’t-


Mitchell then responded, “So do you.” 


Instantly, Duffy replied that he did not have a “gold-plated” plan because he had to be on Obamacare: 


No I’m not, I’m in ObamaCare. I’m in ObamaCare, Andrea. All members of Congress are, and my family. The President should join us in ObamaCare, and the rest of America. Is that pretty reasonable? We should all be treated equally under the law? Why should members of Congress be in ObamaCare and not the President? Explain that one. Isn’t that fair?


Duffy continued to ask Mitchell if she could “defend why the President shouldn’t be in ObamaCare like members of Congress and their staffs?”

“I think the media should start doing its job,” Duffy said.
Mitchell, visibly annoyed, then semi-sardonically responded, “Thanks for your advice. Thank you, Congressman.”
Earlier in the interview, Mitchell insisted Duffy’s demands were “non-negotiable” before Duffy said Obama is essentially saying, “I get my gold-plated health care plan but I want members of Congress and the rest of America to be in ObamaCare.” 
He then pointed out that a big issue many Americans have with the media is that the it does not ask the question, “Why are you treating families different than big businesses?” 
“You need Jon Stewart on Comedy Central to ask Secretary Sebelius, ‘Hey, why won’t you treat these two equally?'” Duffy said. “And she can’t answer it. I mean, that’s how pathetic I think news reporting has become, when we won’t ask tough questions to the administration.”
Duffy kept pressing Mitchell and asked her if she and her colleagues have asked Obama and those in his administration, “Why do you want your own health care and you won’t join us in ObamaCare?” 
After Mitchell surmised what she thought Sebelius’s response would be to such a question, Duffy pointed out Mitchell could not point out how Sebelius has answered the question because members of the mainstream press have not posed it to her.

Though the Obama administration said that individuals making under $45,960 would get Obamacare subsidies, low-income young people in most of America’s big cities who relied on that promise are discovering they will be ineligible for them. 
According to a CNN report, though young people are now required to purchase insurance under Obamacare or pay a fine, “many low-income younger Americans won’t get any subsidy at all” because, as the Obama administration claims, the “cost of insurance is lower than the government initially expected.”
In April, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius “told a congressional subcommittee that any individual making under that $45,960 threshold–or four times the poverty level of $11,490 for an individual–would qualify for ‘an upfront tax subsidy.'”


According to CNN, “subsidies are based on a formula set by law, applying to individuals with annual incomes of one to four times the poverty level–or $11,490 to $45,960.” And to calculate the subsidies, “the government sets a maximum amount that low-income customers will have to pay for insurance as a percentage of their income. That cap is then subtracted from the cost of a mid-level insurance plan in the individual’s region, and the difference is their subsidy.”
And though insurance companies are required to “knock that amount off the price of premiums before the customer pays,” the subsidy is “zero” if the baseline plan insurance plans are cheap enough. That means many low-income younger Americans who are forced to buy insurance are discovering, to the surprise of many, that they will have to do so without the subsidies they were promised, as CNN noted:

In Chicago, a 27-year old will receive no subsidy to help offset premiums of more than $165 a month if he makes more than $27,400 a year.
In Portland, Oregon, subsidies for individuals making just $28,725 a year phase out for those younger than 35 years old.
In Nashville, a 25-year old making $25,500 will not qualify for a subsidy.
In Minneapolis, Minnesota, a 4o-year old  making $28,725 a year will not get a subsidy.

Conservatives, and Republicans in general, have been accused of having “no strategy” in the showdown with President Barack Obama and the Democrats over Obamacare, the government shutdown, and the debt ceiling. It might be argued that the Republicans only adopted their strategy by accident, but they do have one, and it is both necessary and long overdue: win back disenchanted voters by fighting for their interests–hard.
The conventional wisdom in Washington, DC, repeated ad infinitum in the opinion pages and on the weekend news shows, is that Republicans blundered by allowing President Obama to cajole them into a government shutdown. Now, the thinking goes, Democrats have a way to shift the weight of policy failures, scandals, and the Obamacare disaster: they can blame Republicans for causing fiscal and economic chaos–and warn of more.
It is true that the public blames Republicans for causing the shutdown–and well they might. It is also true, however, that the public understands that President Obama has been inflicting as much pain on them as possible in an effort to win a political fight. His refusal to negotiate, and his willingness to use petty tactics such as closing open-air war memorials, have caused his approval ratings to drop to nearly unprecedented levels.


Had Republicans followed the conventional wisdom on Obamacare and waited until 2016 to fight the issue, none of the above would have happened. Meanwhile, millions of Americans would have faced the daunting prospect of losing their health insurance or their jobs to a new, unfamiliar, unwieldy, and ultimately more expensive policy. They would have looked to Washington, only to see no one–at all–fighting to protect them.

Amidst the many competing versions of what a new Republican strategy should look like after 2012, the one common theme was that the party needed to learn how to relate to the concerns of ordinary people. There is nothing more basic, no issue more “kitchen table,” than the cost of health insurance. Symbolic votes against Obamacare may look good on campaign literature, but voters are smart enough to see through those tactics.
Another repeated exhortation was the need to reach out to Latino voters. And yet it has gone virtually unnoticed that the man leading the revolt against Obamacare on Capitol Hill, the man who shifted the GOP out of its torpor, is a Hispanic Republican–easily now the most recognizable Hispanic leader in America. For his trouble, he has been vilified by the wiser heads in his own party, who think appealing to Latinos means amnesty.
The major strategic challenge facing Republicans prior to the shutdown fight was the fact that millions of core GOP voters stayed home in 2012 and looked likely to do so again after the party leadership became consumed by debates over immigration reform. With few swing districts at stake in 2014, and Democrats vulnerable in key Senate races, the task–though many GOP leaders ignored it–was to reach out to the base.
Yes, the shutdown exposed Republicans to possible defection by independent voters. But President Obama, who evidently believes that the shutdowns of the 1990s foretell victory today, has missed one of the key lessons of that battle. President Bill Clinton won largely because he cast himself as a savior–of health care, education, and the environment. President Obama, in contrast, has auditioned for the role of executioner.
And so, ironically, Republicans have been able to cast themselves as the protectors of popular government programs by passing “rifle-shot” bills to fund each of them alone. At the very least, the GOP has prevented the damage from being worse. They do not look mean, as Gingrich did in 1995-6; they merely look irresponsible. And in that category, the president is giving them stiff competition by taking an ill-advised hard-line position.
All year, the Republicans’ clear–if quiet–legislative strategy has been to use the Full Faith and Credit Act as a backstop against default, strengthening their position in debt ceiling talks with the president. The only immediate political effect of the shutdown was to move that fight forward a week. But the strategic effect was great, and profound: the GOP is now back on course to connect with its missing voters–just in time for 2014.

13604	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/25/Two-Cheers-for-Ted	Opinion	1	Healthcare	None	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
The pundits in D.C. jeered as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) began his lengthy speech (a “fauxlibuster,” they joked) on Tuesday. Some cast it as a self-serving gesture, done to impress “dumb” people outside the Beltway who don’t get that defunding Obamacare just isn’t possible. But as the night wore on, it was clear that Cruz’s stand was as passionate and articulate an attack on Obamacare and a defense of liberty as the nation has ever seen.
A few even began to see its wisdom, circulating an essay by David Frum acknowledging that even a defeat served Cruz’s political purposes. Charles Krauthammer, who the day before had traded jokes about Cruz’s Canadian birth, acknowledged on Tuesday that he had executed a brilliant maneuver, if not to defeat Obamacare than to highlight its flaws, and to seize the mantle of leadership of a conservative movement needing inspiration.


What was most impressive about Cruz’s gambit, however, was not the strategy but the substance. In plain language, Cruz laid out the fundamental problems with Obamacare as policy, outlining the cost to working families in higher insurance premiums, dropped health plans, and lost work hours or job opportunities. He also reminded Washington of how the bill was passed, and upheld, in defiance of the people and the Constitution.

A few Democrats eventually wandered down to the Senate floor to debate Cruz, some to try poking holes in his arguments, reminding him that President Barack Obama had won a new mandate from the voters even after passing the Affordable Care Act. Cruz patiently, and deftly, handled their objections, noting that even the unions were turning against the law, and blasting both sides for approving congressional exemptions from it.
It was also difficult not to be moved by Cruz’s passion. No empty gesture could sustain the hours upon hours of explication, analysis, and debate that Cruz tackled on the Senate floor. Agree or disagree with his decision to force the issue into a debate over the budget and the debt ceiling, it is impossible not to be impressed by his sheer will, and by the self-evident sincerity of a man so fluent and ardent in his arguments.
It occurred to me that when I ran for Congress in 2010, and voters would urge me to “do something” if I got to Washington, that this is the type of “something” they meant. They know that a freshman in Congress is barely even worth his or her vote but that a person willing to take risks can change history. And millions went to bed last night knowing someone on Capitol Hill was, finally, keeping watch over their liberty as they slept.
There was one flaw in Cruz’s approach, however. It became clear in the reactions of those who might otherwise have supported his effort but were put off by his attacks on fellow Republicans. Cruz sometimes turned sincere disagreement over tactics into differences in courage and conviction. Despite Cruz’s moderate demeanor, his rhetoric sometimes reflected a political media culture mired in the language of absolutes.
Cruz has withstood intense hostility with uncommon grace, but he should reserve terms like “surrender caucus” and Neville Chamberlain analogies for real enemies if he wants to rally the broader support he deserves. Overall, however, his stand was brilliant. His remarks should be printed separately as a primer on Obamacare, and his tactics should inspire the opposition. He will soon run out of time. But he has turned the tide.

13610	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/13/California-Care-Exchange-Frustrates-Enrollees	News	1	Healthcare	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
The California Obamacare exchange, Covered California, has enrollment snags preventing thousands of customers from obtaining insurance. Many who selected a plan as early as October are now being told by insurance companies that they have no record of their enrollment. Consumers are enduring long waiting periods on the phone, computer errors, and conflicting information from California navigators and insurers. 
Meanwhile, the state is still trying to clear a log jam of October and November paper applications that they received by mail.


“The back end is so backed up, and no one can give me an answer,” said Thomas Gallo, who was a strong supporter of Obamacare. Gallo signed up for healthcare for his family on October 2 but did not hear back for weeks. When he followed up on his application, he was told at the end of November that it was lost. “What happens if we don’t get coverage by Jan. 1? There are real problems here,” Gallo said. 

Blue Shield of California Chief Executive Paul Markovich admitted, “There are certainly some people who have enrolled or think they have enrolled and haven’t received confirmation. It’s our version of Black Friday right now and that is what we are coping with.”
The target date of January 1 is extremely important for Bret Winton and his wife because they are expecting their first child in early January. Winton is a self-employed consultant living in the Venice, CA. His insurance is being cancelled as a result of Obamacare, along with one million other Californians, because his family plan does not meet the requirements set out by the Affordable Care Act. Winton endured repeated glitches and delays as he struggled with the online exchange. He ultimately selected an Anthem Blue Cross policy, which would provide access to his wife’s doctor and hospital. 
Winton called the Covered California exchange and a recording said he would be called back in four hours. He never got the call back. He resorted to a sanctioned chat line that told him he would need to wait 14 days and then he could reapply. 
California resident Jim Arenson, a self-employed engineer, also had difficulty with the online exchange. He complained it took him two months to finally receive notice confirming he was covered through Blue Shield. “I was very scared I wouldn’t have health insurance,” said Arenson, who needs additional care after cancer surgery this year. “The exchange and the insurance company were pointing fingers at each other. There could be a lot of people falling through the cracks.”
State Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), chairman of the Senate health committee, is deeply concerned that time is running out to fix some of these enrollment problems. Now that Obamacare is the law of the land, “The question now is whether we can meet that demand. Everything seems to be bottlenecked until we open more lanes,” Hernandez said.

The Washington Post reports that the White House will announce Sunday that it has met its self-imposed deadline to fix the federal ObamaCare exchange known as HealthCare.gov. The Post also reports that, like everything else surrounding ObamaCare, this announcement is not even close to true. 
The faulty $600 million site has been improved over the course of the last two months. Still, though, it can only handle 50,000 users at a time. Moreover, the site still loads slowly and the capacity for 50,000 users hasn’t yet been fully tested. 


Earlier this month, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration’s goal was to make the site usable for 80% of users — another moving of the goal posts since the White House announced November 30 as a target date.  
Other deadline misses include the HealthCare.gov program that allows small businesses to enroll online. This feature, known as SHOP, has been delayed until after the 2014 midterm elections. What hasn’t been postponed, though, are the insurance policy cancellations already plaguing small business owners. 
In order to re-insure their employees, business owners will now have to work through a broker or insurance agent. That is if the the increased costs and hassles surrounding ObamaCare don’t result in small business owners deciding that insuring their employees just isn’t worth it. CBS News reported last week that this is already happening. 

The Wall Street Journal reports that technical problems will still inhibit HealthCare.gov from verifying users’ identities and the transmission of accurate enrollment data to insurance providers. The fallout of the latter problem won’t be readily apparent until someone who has been told they are insured tries to visit a doctor or emergency room only to discover their insurer has no idea who they are. 
Some crucial parts of HealthCare.gov are not even built yet, including the mechanism that pays your insurance carrier the part of your premium covered by the federal government — the infamous subsidy. 
Some reports claim that in order for ObamaCare to meet its March 30 enrollment goal of 7-plus million enrollees (this number is necessary to make the system financially viable), somewhere around 54,000 people must sign up daily. Currently, only around 7,000 enrollments are occurring daily. 
Granted, this is a big improvement over last month’s enrollment numbers, but two times zero is still zero.

Colorado is one of 14 states operating its own ObamaCare exchange for health insurance. As a result, it has had more success enrolling people than the disastrous federal exchange. Still, Colorado’s relative “success” reveals a deeper problem with the new health care entitlement. So far, just 226 people have enrolled for private health insurance. At the same time, 25,000 Coloradans will be newly eligible for Medicaid benefits in January. 
Since the opening of the exchange in Colorado, 16,000 residents have used the system to enroll in the newly expanded Medicaid program. Another 9,000 adults without children were on waiting lists for the program. These individuals will also gain new Medicaid coverage next year. 
Medicaid, a shared federal-state health care entitlement, reimburses health care providers the least amount. Providers typically receive around 18 cents on each dollar billed. Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, pays 23 cents. Private insurers reimburse providers around 38 cents for each dollar billed. 


Pushing more Americans into the system through Medicaid not only increases the demand for health care services, but reduces at the margin the funds available to maintain that system. Either those with private insurance will have to bear a larger burden funding the system or the system will contract so that health care services are difficult to receive. 

Even if a magical pot of money were found to fund these services, it isn’t clear that having Medicaid coverage actually helps anyone. As my former colleague Nick Gillespie recently pointed out, a respected study out of Oregon found no difference in health outcomes from those on Medicaid and those uninsured. 
The problems with ObamaCare and future funding are not just confined to Medicaid, which is the dominant vehicle to provide new health coverage. Some percentage of the 226 Coloradans who have enrolled for private coverage will get federal subsidies to help purchase their insurance. The US Treasury, for the first time, will send premium payments to insurance companies to cover these subsidies. Medicaid and Medicare are already the fastest growing segments of the federal budget. These two programs, as well as the new health insurance subsidies, will likely soon consume all federal revenue. 
Math will prove to be the biggest obstacle to ObamaCare.

On Wednesday, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said it was “inexcusable” and “unpardonable” that President Barack Obama did not meet one-on-one with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since Obamacare passed over three years ago. 
On Fox News’s Hannity, host Sean Hannity referenced the shocking Government Accountability Institute report when asking Lee whether he knew if Sebelius has met with Obama in one-on-one meetings. 
“Not to my knowledge,” Lee answered, before saying, “this is inexcusable” and “absolutely unpardonable.” 


Lee, who was the architect of the strategy to defund Obamacare and one of the fiercest opponents of the healthcare overhaul, continued by saying “there was this little oversight in the launching of this significant an enterprise” and Obamacare is “so much more than about the website.” Lee said ultimately Obamacare is about the “fundamental unfairness and unworkability of the law.”
At a House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Sebelius was flustered when asked to give specific evidence that she and Obama have met “regularly.” Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, exclusively told Breitbart News that he will ask Sebelius for specific dates of those alleged meetings. 
The White House and the Health and Human Services Department have claimed Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly,” but have not provided any firm dates except for an alleged meeting last Thursday, which was a day after the GAI report was released. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said there are many meetings between Obama and cabinet secretaries that are not on the public record. 

When Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer broke the GAI report on Fox News’s Hannity last Wednesday, though, he mentioned that GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.
The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”
According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”
Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.
“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday.

Obama explains that when he told Americans they could keep their healthcare plans, “period,” under the Affordable Care Act, he actually meant the promise was conditional.
For the second time in a week, President Barack Obama backtracked on his promise to Americans that they could keep their health insurance plans under Obamacare, telling a group of activists on Monday that what he had really meant was that Americans could keep their healthcare plans “if it hasn’t changed since the law passed.” 



Speaking at an Organizing for Action health care summit in Washington, D.C., Obama revised a signature mantra of his stump speeches during the Obamacare debate and the 2012 campaign in which he repeatedly said that under Obamacare, “If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.” 

In 2009, the President even cut off the possibility of modifiers to that plan. In a speech to the American Medical Association, he stated, “If you like your healthcare plan, you’ll be able to keep your healthcare plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.”
In his Monday speech, however, the promise took on newfound nuance. “Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,” Obama said. “So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act, you’re grandfathered in on that plan. But if the insurance company changes it, then what we’re saying is they’ve got to change it to a higher standard.
“They’ve got to make it better, they’ve got to improve the quality of the plan they are selling. That’s part of the promise that we made too. That’s why we went out of our way to make sure that the law allowed for grandfathering.”
In addition to the malfunctioning HealthCare.gov website, millions of Americans have been receiving cancellation notices from their health insurance providers since Obamacare went into effect in October. Mainstream media outlets and personalities–from the Washington Post to MSNBC’s Chuck Todd–that were some of Obama’s fiercest defenders the last four years have called him out on this falsehood, even admitting in hindsight that they were skeptical of Obama’s signature claim.
Obama attempted his first rewrite of history last Wednesday in his healthcare speech at Boston’s Fanueil Hall after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was grilled in front of Congress and apologized for Obamacare’s rollout, which she conceded was a “debacle.” 
“For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it,” Obama said last week in Boston. Obama then said that Americans who were receiving cancellation letters merely had “substandard” insurance plans.

MSNBC host and commentator Touré fired a clear and distinct shot at Dr. Ben Carson Friday, hammering the African-American Presidential Medal of Freedom winner for daring to challenge the Obamadoxy parroted by Touré and progressive journalists bent on supporting the President’s policies at all costs.
Dr. Ben Carson splashed onto the national stage with his blistering criticism of ObamaCare last month at the National Prayer breakfast, with President Obama seated just a few feet away.  Carson is a heroic surgeon, Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery, who performed groundbreaking medical miracles at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  He is a brilliant and passionate advocate for free market principals, individual responsibility, and the freedoms and liberty embodied in resistance to bloated big government programs like ObamaCare.  He also happens to be black.  Therefore, he must be stopped, now.
Like Clarence Thomas, Condi Rice, Colin Powell (until he got the message) and Herman Cain before him, Carson will now be the target of the most vile and reprehensible kinds of criticism from black progressives like Touré and his colleague Al Sharpton.  A black man who doesn’t blindly support the president and the big government programs that has created a dependency on government that has crippled America’s underclass is susceptible to name calling that, otherwise, would not be tolerated in American political discourse.





On his show, Touré said this of Carson: 

Carson is a brilliant medical thinker but he’s got intellectual tumors like a flat tax, which is regressive, and ignorant in the face of wealth inequality where the top 1% own 35% and the bottom 60% own 2.3%. I doubt Jesus would tax them equally. Just as I doubt the GOP would entertain a white non-politician with unserious ideas. But Carson has joined the GOP’s version of affirmative action, where blacks that can speak conservative game get raced to the front of the line because then people get to put a bumper sticker on their car that say, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Carson!’ Which would fit nicely over the bumper sticker saying, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Cain?’ Which fit nicely over the bumper sticker saying, ‘How could I be racist? I would have voted for Allen West!’
Yes, any black friend will do, no matter how far outside the political system they emerge from and no matter how unserious their ideas are. Because it’s all make believe. None of them will ever get a nomination for the Presidency, just as the GOP will never get black votes, because the only thing they care about is winning and not the economic or social needs of black people. But in the meantime, imagine away you guys.
At CPAC Carson said, ‘Let’s say you magically put me in the White House.’ But, my brother, no magic is required to accomplish that. As soon as the sequester ends, you could take a White House tour.

Let’s be clear:  Touré holds black men up to a different (lower or higher, not sure) standard when they criticize the President.  He expects black people to think a certain way and pounces when they step out of line and express a different set of ideas than what Touré believes they should believe, due to their skin color. Because Carson is a black man, he is therefore the beneficiary of affirmitive action, in Touré’s mind, and if he dares to present an opposing view from MSNBC’s Obamadoxy, he is an Uncle Tom and betrayer of his race.  
In short, Touré has a special contempt for black men who criticize President Obama.  There may be many different interpretations of the definition of racial prejudice and/or racism, but my understanding of racism is that it is the belief that humans are divided into distinct groups based upon their skin color and genetic make-up, and those groups are expected to behave and think in certain ways (inferior or superior) solely based upon their race.  Touré’s special loathing of Dr. Carson may not be based upon his race, but it certainly appears to be.  And if that doesn’t fall under the description of racism, then I would really appreciate it if Touré could explain the distinction to me, because I’m having trouble seeing it.

If there is at least one benefit of ObamaCare it is watching those who supported nationalizing the purchase of mandated health insurance get their comeuppance. The New York Times reports that “many in New York’s professional and cultural elite” who supported Obama and ObamaCare, and carved themselves out a sweet little health insurance pool “to avoid the sky-high rates in New York’s individual insurance market,” are now out in the cold with the rest of us:
[U]nder the Affordable Care Act, they will be treated as individuals, responsible for their own insurance policies. For many of them, that is likely to mean they will no longer have access to a wide network of doctors and a range of plans tailored to their needs. And many of them are finding that if they want to keep their premiums from rising, they will have to accept higher deductible and co-pay costs or inferior coverage. 


The anguish these elite Obama supporters are going through is no different than those 5.9 million in the real world victimized by insurance cancelations: Stress, sleepless nights, financial burden, and the loss of familiar doctors and hospitals. “We are Obama’s people,” said one author. Today her insurance has been canceled and her doctors are not available through the exchanges. And she is not alone. Take Barbara Meinwald, a solo practitioner lawyer in Manhattan. “I couldn’t sleep because of it,” she said.
Ms. Meinwald, 61, has been paying $10,000 a year for her insurance through the New York City Bar. A broker told her that a new temporary plan with fewer doctors would cost $5,000 more, after factoring in the cost of her medications.
Ms. Meinwald also looked on the state’s health insurance exchange. But she said she found that those plans did not have a good choice of doctors, and that it was hard to even find out who the doctors were, and which hospitals were covered. “It’s like you’re blindfolded and you’re told that you have to buy something,” she said. …

Meinwald now says that had she known this would happen, she would have voted for Mitt Romney. 
[M]any professionals make too much money to qualify for the subsidies, and even if they are able to find comparably priced insurance, the new policies do not have the coverage they are accustomed to.
According to the Kaiser Foundation, these people were intentionally screwed. Although their policies did meet the minimum ObamaCare coverage standards, The Times reports, the policies were still canceled as a way “to prevent associations from selling insurance to healthy members who are needed to keep the new health exchanges financially viable.”
If only the same thing would happen to the elite media, we might actually get somewhere in repealing a boondoggle that is victimizing millions in the working and middle class only to benefit a few thousand.

During Thursday’s congressional hearing, Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) tore into the ObamaCare contractors for a hidden line of source code that secretly surrenders the ObamaCare applicant’s right to privacy. It was yet another damning revelation about the snoopiest White House ever, and by Friday, CNN’s Carol Costello was in full attack mode using misinformation to push back for the Administration.  
Costello invited Barton on her Friday morning show, and after Barton reiterated his concern over ObamaCare’s secret and deceptive disclaimer, Costello dug in:


Well, I’ve been wondering about that. The only health-related question the website asks of you is whether you smoke. It doesn’t ask any other question. So what specifically are you talking about? What specific information would you share on this website that you wouldn’t normally share?

Before we get to Barton’s very specific answer, I have to interrupt to point out how stunningly ignorant Costello’s question is. First off, even if she was correct about the smoking question being the only health-related question, it is still a health-related question, and therefore a violation of HIPAA. Secondly, my understanding of HIPAA is that it not only protects your medical information, but also your personal information. And as someone who actually has gone through the ObamaCare application process, I can testify (and did here in detail) that the site asks a number of personal questions I “wouldn’t normally share.” 
Regardless, why is this secret disclaimer not a big deal to a supposed journalist? We are talking about the federal government slipping in a line of code that will sucker millions into surrendering their privacy rights altogether, not just what qualifies under HIPAA.
But Costello is stuck on her White House talking points that claim HIPAA only covers medical information and the smoking question is no big deal. 

Well, watch what happens next: Barton lists three more medical-related questions the ObamaCare website asks: your current insurance plan and its policy number, your mental and physical condition, and whether or not you are pregnant. 
And what is Costello’s response? Does she say, “Oh, I didn’t know that. If you are correct, that is a problem.” 

Nope. She just babbles on with her talking points as though she didn’t hear Barton answer her question with damning specifics:

The prize for best line of questioning to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius at the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Wednesday morning must go to Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC), for pinning Sebelius down on the question of why Obamacare requires men to buy maternity coverage. Sebelius tried to squirm away–as she had done with many other questioners, but Ellmers was on her “A” game.
Ellmers’s performance was particularly commendable because she is lower in the congressional pecking order and therefore had to wait until the end, with less time to spare. She even found time, using a pointed yes-or-no question, to puncture Democrats’ favorite dodge–namely, that helped Republicans improve Medicare Part D, even though they had opposed it. (Unlike Obamacare, Medicare Part D is voluntary, as Sebelius had to admit.)


Next, Ellmers turned to the fact that Obamacare makes consumers pay more for insurance they do not need (much like being forced to buy a fancy car with all of the options, when a basic new car or used car would have been fine). 

The ensuing exchange should be studied by Republicans for future reference. This is how it’s done:


Rep. Ellmers: You also brought up the issue, when you were in Kansas [as governor and health insurance commissioner], that you fought against discriminatory issues. Now I–you know, as far as the essential health benefits [of Obamacare], correct me if I’m wrong, do men not have to buy maternity coverage? 
Sec. Sebelius: Policies will cover maternity coverage for young and healthy– 
Rep. Ellmers: Including men?
Sec. Sebelius: Under 30-year-olds will have a choice also of a catastrophic plan which has no maternity coverage.
Rep. Ellmers: The men are required to purchase– 
Sec. Sebelius: Well, an insurance policy has a series of benefits, whether you use them or not. And one of the benefits will be– 
Rep. Ellmers: And that is why the health care premiums are increasing this high, because we’re forcing them to buy things they will never need. Thank you, madam chairman.
Sec. Sebelius: The individual policies cover families. Men often do need maternity coverage for their spouses and for their families, yes. 
Rep. Ellmers: Single male, age 32, does not need maternity coverage. 
[Crosstalk]
Rep. Ellmers: To the best of your knowledge has a man ever delivered a baby?
Sec. Sebelius: I don’t think so.
Chair: The gentlelady’s time has expired.

If health insurance prices triple, do we still have to call Obamacare the “Affordable Care Act”? 
A report released yesterday by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce reveals the devastating reality many Americans will face when Obamacare is in full force next year. While the majority of Americans will likely see their healthcare premiums increase, no one will swallow the cost burden more than young Americans.


Previous studies have reported that youth healthcare premiums could increase as much as 45 percent, but the the House Committee report concluded that young Americans could see an increase as much as 203 percent.
“Recent college graduates with entry-level jobs who are struggling to pay off student loan debt could see their premiums increase on average between 145 and 189 percent,” the report said. “Some studies estimate young adults could experience premium increases as high as 203 percent. Any increase, let alone tripling current costs, could break the bank for young adults who have just started out on their own.”
The current average payment for health care premiums among young Americans is $648, but will increase to $1,872 under the Obamacare legislation. The graph below breaks down the average increases in healthcare premiums for young Americans in major cities:

 
According to the report, young Americans are disproportionately affected by Obamacare for three reasons:

Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating: In other words, price controls. Obamacare mandates that all Americans pay healthcare premiums regardless of anticipated medical expenses. Young Americans must subsidize retirees who use healthcare far more often to level the insurance price disparity between younger and older Americans.
Essential Health Benefits: Obamacare mandates certain health servives be covered by health insurance. These include coverage for preventive and wellness services, chronic disease management, rehabilitative and habilitative services, and many more. In short, the more categories you are forced to cover, the more expensive your premium will be. No more affordable catastrophic plans. 
Taxes and Fees on Plans, Drugs, and Medical Devices:  The total cost of new taxes and fees on drug manufacturers, device manufacturers, and health care plans is $165 billion. This will ultimately be passed on to the consumer in higher premiums.

Families will also see a significant increase in their healthcare premiums. One of the studies in the report found that a family could see the costs of their premiums rise to $7,186 in the next decade. 
With a stagnant economy, unprecedented levels of unemployment (youth unemployment currently 17.6 percent), and average household expenses on the rise (gas, food, energy, etc), there are very few people that can afford $800-$4,000 more to pay for the rise in healthcare premiums. 
Remember when President Obama said, “if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan”? Or that Obamacare would “bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family.” Me too.

On Friday a federal appeals court struck down ObamaCare’s HHS contraception mandate, deciding that the requirement is an infringement upon religious liberty.
According to The Hill, the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in favor of two Catholic brothers, Francis and Philip Gilardi, who own a 400-person produce company based in Ohio. The Gilardis argued that they oppose contraception due to the tenets of their Catholic faith, and challenged ObamaCare’s provision that requires them to provide free contraception to their employees through a health insurance plan. 
The brothers claimed that if they chose not to obey the law, they would incur a $14 million fine. 


A requirement that companies cover their employees’ contraception, the court ruled, is unduly burdensome for business owners who oppose birth control on religious grounds, though they may not be purchasing contraception directly. 

The Obama administration argued that the requirement is necessary to protect women’s right to decide whether and when to have children. It is expected the Supreme Court will ultimately pick up the administration’s appeal and make a final decision on its constitutionality. 
“The burden on religious exercise does not occur at the point of contraceptive purchase; instead, it occurs when a company’s owners fill the basket of goods and services that constitute a healthcare plan,” wrote Judge Janice Rogers Brown on behalf of the court. “It is clear the government has failed to demonstrate how such a right – whether described as noninterference, privacy, or autonomy – can extend to the compelled subsidization of a woman’s procreative practices.” 
Brown added that denying coverage of contraception would not undermine the Affordable Care Act’s requirements that health insurance provide preventative care. The Gilardis’ employees will still be covered for counseling, screenings, and tests, the judge observed. 
“The provision of these services — even without the contraceptive mandate — by and large fulfills the statutory command for insurers to provide gender-specific preventive care,” Brown wrote. “At the very least, the statutory scheme will not go to pieces.”   
The two judges on the panel who dissented said the rights of religious people do not extend to the companies they own.

Just a week before young adults return home for the end of year holidays, Organizing for America is debuting a video imploring parents to interrupt their time with their children to promote the benefits of Obamacare in a last-ditch attempt to ease millennial dissatisfaction with President Obama.
The video, debuting on BarackObama.com and promoted through various social media, arrives on the eve of a joint President and First Lady event designed to target mothers of uninsured millennials as they arrive home for their holidays. 
In the clip, a mother and father call their son, presumably about to drive home for Christmas dinner, and warn him that they have something “very important” to talk to him about. The son spends the entire drive home fretting about the worst case scenario (“Your father and I are moving in with you!”) and inexplicably expecting arbitrary pop culture references (“I am the one who knocks!“). The “reveal” that the parents want to talk about health insurance is predictable, as is the fact that the son is, above all, relieved. “That’s it?” he asks.




The ad, titled “Get Ready To Have The Talk,” plays like an ’80s anti-drug PSA, urging parents to use the holidays as a stage for an intervention to stop something unhealthy in their children’s lives. The fact that it happens at the dinner itself (though the accompanying Twitter graphic shows the actor playing the son mid-hot chocolate later in the night) instructs parents to directly address the Obama administration’s agenda in the middle of what, for many celebrating the night, is a religious celebration devoid of political meaning.
The targeted advertising appears to be a last-minute attempt to reverse devastating trends in the Affordable Care Act’s and the President’s nosedive in the public opinion polls as the year wanes and HealthCare.gov continues to fail millions. A Harvard Institute of Politics poll released this month shows 57% of young Americans ages 18-29 disapprove of the ACA and 52% would support removing the President from office. The targeting of parents also appears to be a direct reaction to dwindling support for Obamacare among white women.
Apparently, the White House hopes changing mothers’ minds will cause a trickle down effect that reaches the young uninsured. Or, at least, that is what Democrats should hope the White House is doing, because the video demonstrates a prodigious lack of understanding of youth culture today. 
It makes sense. Young people today were not the young people of five years ago–the young people who truly believed in President Obama–and to the White House, it seems that all these new young people do is quote Breaking Bad at each other in their plaid onesies. It’s a Hail Mary pass from an administration that was previously unstoppable in reaching out to young Americans, one perhaps that is their only move after HealthCare.gov failed so extraordinarily that Ezra Klein wondered aloud why someone in the administration hasn’t been fired over it. 
We’ll have to wait until next week to see just how many parents take this advice, but the outlook doesn’t seem to be so bright if this is the last PR resort.

On Friday, the House voted for a resolution to keep government open but also defund ObamaCare. Within minutes, Nancy Mace, who is opposing Sen. Lindsey Graham in the GOP primary, issued a press release attacking Graham for his past criticism of the defunding strategy. In just two hours, Graham tweeted that he supported the House’s efforts to defund the unpopular health care law. Such is the power of primaries. 

I support the House-passed bill to Defund Obamacare. #SenateMustAct
— Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) September 20, 2013
As recently as July, Graham said that defunding ObamaCare was “a bridge too far for him.” Primary opponents do tend to focus a politician’s mind. 


Graham faces at least three opponents in next year’s primary contest. Normally, multiple challengers give an edge to incumbents, as opposition is split among several challengers. South Carolina, however, uses a run-off system. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, the top two voter-getters face off in a run-off. Multiple challengers increase the odds that Graham falls below 50% and has to face a run-off. 

Graham is no doubt a nice man and would make a good GOP Senator from a state like Maine. His representing South Carolina, however, is a wasted opportunity for conservatives. An East Coast John McCain does a disservice to the Palmetto State. 
Graham’s tweet in support of the House action indicates he is aware of the challenge before him. Few incumbents are so disliked by the grass-roots, both in South Carolina and across the country. A run-off election, with a single conservative challenger, would ignite national interest and possibly create a wave that washes over Graham.
His tweet in support of defunding ObamaCare was a good start. He now has to follow that up over the coming weeks.

As the first hearings on the failed implementation of Obamacare begin Thursday, with the testimony of the healthcare.gov contractors before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Democrats have already developed their strategy for blunting Republican criticism. They will a) assert that repairs are being made; b) attack critics for “politicizing” the problems; and c) demand the GOP join efforts to support the law.
Along the way, Democrats will cling mightily to the straw man upon which they relied throughout 2009-2010 during the debate over the law: namely, that if you oppose Obamacare you are opposed to providing health care to the working poor, to those with pre-existing conditions, to the temporarily unemployed. They will cover the foreseeable failure of a policy that has already hurt millions with the glory of noble intentions.


Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, previewed the Democrats’ strategy on Oct. 22, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN’s The Situation Room. Cummings made clear that his party will try to deflect criticism of Obamacare by casting it as the latest example of alleged Republican overreach on Obama administration scandals:

BLITZER: I know you must be very frustrated. Were you surprised to learn that apparently no one was really in charge of this Web site rollout, even though they had a couple years to plan for it? 
CUMMINGS: Yes, a bit surprised. But Wolf, what we’ve got to concentrate now on is making sure that the Web site works. And I’m hoping that Republicans and Democrats will see this not as a partisan issue, but as one that we have to make work for all the American people. Failure is just not an option….
Keep in mind, Republicans have spent the last few years trying to repeal it over 45 times, trying to defund it, trying to delay it. And so I have not seen a lot of effort on their part to make the law better but simply to destroy it. So that’s the kind of issue that I’m working with, Wolf, on my committee. I’ve got to make sure that we all work together to make sure that the law works for millions upon millions of Americans who need health care….
I think what I’m seeing now is the same play and the same scene all over again. We saw the chairman make strong allegations which were inaccurate with regard to Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. And only to find out that those allegations were simply not accurate and had no basis of fact. So it makes my job a little tougher. 

Note that the country has yet to learn the truth of what happened in Benghazi, Fast and Furious, and the IRS scandal. In every case, Cummings has tried to prevent oversight, not to facilitate it. He acknowledges some failures in the administration, and expresses some minimal outrage, but then tries to cast Republicans as witch-hunters rather than trying to hold the executive accountable. Expect more of the same on Obamacare.

A leading labor union boss delivered an impassioned rebuke of Obamacare at the AFL-CIO convention Thursday, telling attendees, “we’ll be damned if we’re going to lose our health insurance because of unintended consequences in the law!” 
Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA) President Terry O’Sullivan said, “if the Affordable Care Act is not fixed, and it destroys the health and welfare funds that we have all fought for and stand for, then I believe it needs to be repealed. We don’t want it repealed. We want it fixed, fixed, fixed.” 
O’Sullivan added: “We can’t have the unintended consequences for the proud men and women that we represent to be collateral damage in the healthcare fight in this country.” 




Big Labor strongly backed Obamacare before its passage. Now unions say the law threatens to destroy union workers’ health insurance plans if changes are not made soon. 
Last week, the AFL-CIO passed a strongly-worded resolution blasting Obamacare despite the Obama Administration’s attempts to quell union opposition to aspects of the government healthcare overhaul.
O’Sullivan, borrowing from Vice President Joe Biden’s vulgar words whispered to President Barack Obama upon signing the bill, told the audience, “It’s going to be a big frickin’ deal if our members lose our health insurance!” 
Republicans say union members should not be granted special breaks for the Obamacare law they fought to see pass. Sen. John Thune (R-SD) introduced a bill Monday called the Union Bailout Prevention Act to stop the White House from granting unions Obamacare waivers or special taxpayer-funded premium tax subsidies.
“Despite championing ObamaCare’s passage in 2010, union leaders are now awaking to the ugly reality of ObamaCare that most Americans have predicted all along, including higher health care costs,” said Thune. “Now that the full consequences of the Democrats’ law are nearing, these same union leaders are seeking a special backroom deal from the White House.” 
Obamacare’s government healthcare exchanges open in 17 days.

To remove all doubt: The Take Care Clause of the Constitution absolutely forbids any president from doing exactly what Obama did Thursday. 
Obama said he would allow insurance companies to keep offering previously-offered insurance plans that Americans would like to keep. Nobody knows if this means all plans, or only some of them, and how the White House will make such determinations. He says he has “enforcement discretion” to make this change to the Affordable Care Act unilaterally, without consulting Congress. 


This is a frightening claim of a sweeping power that is completely inconsistent with the Constitution. A president has “prosecutorial discretion” to prioritize which lawbreakers to prosecute in federal court, but there is no “enforcement discretion” to determine which laws on the books he will enforce. 
Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution commands of every president: “he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Like every provision in the Constitution, it has a legal meaning–and that meaning is the Supreme Law of the Land, which Congress, the courts, and–yes–each president is bound by his oath of office to follow carefully. 
Everyone should know from their high-school government classes that Article I of the Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to make federal laws, and Article II of the Constitution gives the American president the executive power to administer and enforce those laws. Article II then includes the language about how the president must faithfully execute those laws. 

Among other things, the Take Care Clause was inserted in the Constitution to abolish the Royal Prerogative that the Framers of the American Constitution knew from their lives as Englishmen. It was the power of the king of England to disregard or effectively suspend Acts of Parliament. The king could not make laws, but he could shelve a law that Parliament had passed. 
Obama’s announcement is a flagrant and undeniable violation of his constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause. The provisions of Obamacare causing enormous trouble for insurance plans are mandatory, and only Congress can change those parts of the Affordable Care Act. Every day provides additional proof that Obamacare is a complete train wreck, but it is one regarding which only Congress can change the terms. 
This president’s relationship to Congress is reaching toxic levels, due in large part to the regularity of his hyper-partisan rhetoric and ongoing disrespect. He is learning that the campaign tactics that enabled him to win two presidential elections are manifestly counterproductive when applied to the arduous task of governing, especially in a country as large and diverse as America. 
It is not clear at this point whether anyone would have standing to sue over this matter in court. If the experts who are saying today that this unilateral move will only make matters worse are correct, someone might suffer an individualized injury that they could litigate. 
President Obama should hope that doesn’t happen, because if a federal court can get past the procedural hurtles to reach the merits of the case, it’s an open-and-shut case that this president’s actions are unconstitutional–again.

Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin condemned left-wing women’s groups Friday for ignoring MSNBC host Martin Bashir suggestion that former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin deserved an inhuman punishment once used against slaves which includes defecation in one’s mouth and urination in victims’ eyes and mouth.
After letting his listeners know that Bashir said on his MSNBC show that Palin deserved this “dose of discipline” a Jamaican slave master leveled on his slaves, Levin said Bashir likely had delivered the “most disgraceful rant” yet against Palin. 


“Hey tough guy. You like picking on women? You like picking on a mother and a grandmother?” Levin said to Bashir. “You strike me as not tough at all, if you get my drift.” 
Levin then blasted the “pathetic little carbon footprint called MSNBC” for being so “offended with Palin” comparing the federal debt to slavery that they would allow such rants. He said the network should be called the “animal channel” or the “comedy channel.” 
Levin said Palin was exactly right to compare the federal debt to slavery and nothing was offensive about it, since she was not making a comparison to chattel slavery. 

Levin then said “his people,” the “Jewish people,” were slaves, and he did not for one minute think Palin’s comparison was made to “diminish Jewish people or the early days of the nation.”
Levin then called out women’s group like the National Organization for Women (NOW) for “never” coming to the defense of conservative women like Palin. 
Levin said these groups never defend conservative women from misogyny, even when it takes a turn towards the vile and filthy, because “they are not feminist groups. They are left-wing groups. They don’t care about women. They care about left-wing women.”
He said groups like NOW would “worship” Palin if she were a left-wing politician.

Sources close to House conservative leaders have confirmed to Breitbart News that House GOP leadership is planning to cave and fund Obamacare’s implementation for at least the rest of 2013.
Text of the Continuing Resolution (CR) that will fund the government for 60-75 days will be released on Tuesday, the conservative source said, before a House vote on Thursday. The move comes abruptly as conservatives are ramping up their final push on House leadership with a big Tea Party rally outside the Capitol on Tuesday calling for Obamacare’s defunding.
House Speaker John Boehner’s spokesman Michael Steel told Breitbart News the “CR will include defunding ObamaCare,” but would not specify whether or not a certain procedural “trick” the GOP leadership used in a similar situation in 2011 will be employed yet again.


Breitbart News’ source, a high-ranking conservative movement figure close to House conservatives, said that this CR from House leadership will continue to pay for Obamacare’s implementation without cutting from current levels of taxpayer funding for the healthcare law’s rollout, despite claims from Boehner’s office it will “include defunding ObamaCare.” The source said the budget riders that will be attached to the CR can be removed easily by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, allowing him to pass a CR through the Senate funding Obamacare–a procedural move that does not require the House to revisit its CR and makes the Senate version final. 
The source added that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is “shopping an idea of passing defund through the House with the CR, but with a mechanism that would allow it to be decoupled in the Senate, defeated, and then the base CR be passed without coming back to the House.”
The source said the conservative movement should “reject and pan” this “trick” from Cantor, which allows House GOP members to claim they voted to defund Obamacare but allows Reid to strip out budget riders defunding Obamacare and pass a Senate CR without them.

In rushing the CR to the floor for a vote, Breitbart News’ source said that House GOP leadership will put votes on whether the U.S. should authorize use of military force in Syria off until next week.  
Politico has also confirmed the GOP leadership’s plans, reporting that Cantor and House Speaker John Boehner are “dusting off an old legislative gambit from April 2011 as one way to move ahead this week with a stopgap spending bill for the first months of the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.”
“The goal is to give conservatives a vote on defunding health care reform without resulting in a government shutdown,” Politico’s David Rogers wrote. “It’s worked before, but ‘before’ is the operative word.” 
“And until Tuesday’s Republican Conference, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) won’t really know if this flash-from-the-past can flash again,” Rogers continued. “Most simply the procedure calls for sending the Senate a stopgap spending bill together with a resolution that would alter the text of the bill once it’s enrolled for presentation to President Barack Obama.”
Red State’s Daniel Horowitz notes that this trick from House GOP leadership could give GOP members political cover to oppose the grassroots and Tea Party movement by allowing them to claim they voted not to pay for Obamacare’s implementation. “Based on what I’m hearing from House sources, the worst suspicions are confirmed,” Horowitz wrote. “Eric Cantor is floating an idea to pass a short-term CR with a defund rider. But just as we predicted, they plan to write a rule that will sever the defund rider from the body of the bill after it passes the House.” 

“This will allow the Senate to vote down the defund part separately, and send a clean CR straight to the President’s desk without ever returning to the House,” he explained. “This will ensure that we capitulate while allowing House and Senate Republicans to be shielded from charges of voting to defund Obamacare.”
Rick Manning, the vice president for public policy and communications at Americans for Limited Government, told Breitbart News such a strategy from leadership to buy political cover will likely fail in the end. 
“If Congress ends up funding Obamacare in the Continuing Resolution, House Republicans will own it every bit as much as if they had voted for it in the beginning,” Manning said. “Parliamentary tricks will not save them from this reality.”
Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin said recently that if House Speaker John Boehner allowed a situation like this to happen, Obamacare would forever become known as “BoehnerCare.”
Club for Growth president Chris Chocola denounced the reported plan in a statement Monday afternoon: “Are these news reports from The Onion? Or are they real?” Chocola said. “When members were at home over recess, did they hear their constituents ask for legislative tricks or principled leadership?
“Trying to fool Republicans into voting to fund Obamacare is even worse than offering a bill that deliberately funds it,” Chocola declared. “I hope this proposal is nothing more than a bad joke and is quickly discarded. Republicans should simply do what they say they are for by passing a Continuing Resolution that doesn’t fund Obamacare.”

Barack Obama’s hometown newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, endorsed the president twice for president. Friday, the same Chicago Tribune called for ObamaCare to be immediately repealed before it can do any more damage:
Stop digging. Start over.


As Friday dawns, here’s what a health insurance crisis looks like to many millions of Americans: Barely six weeks shy of 2014, they do not know whether they will have medical coverage Jan. 1. Or which hospitals and doctors they might patronize. Or what they may pay to protect themselves and their families against the chance of medical and financial catastrophe. How much, that is, they may pay in order to satisfy the Democratic politicians and federal bureaucrats who are worsening a metastasizing health coverage fiasco. …
We understand why the president and leaders of his party want to rescue whatever they can of Obamacare. On their watch, official Washington has blown the launch of a new entitlement program … under the schedule they alone set in early 2010.
What we don’t understand is their reluctance to give that failure more than lip service. Many of the Americans who heard their president say Thursday that “we fumbled the rollout of this health care law” would have been pleased to hear him add: So we’re admitting it. This law is a bust. We’re starting over.

You can expect the calls to repeal ObamaCare to grow from non-GOP sources in the coming days. The news released Saturday that thousands of doctors have been dropped from Medicare Advantage is a likely tipping point. Destroying health care for the elderly is The Third Rail on steroids. This is Armageddon for Democrats. The only chance they have is to repeal. If they do not, they will be wiped out in 2014 and 2016.

The pundits in D.C. jeered as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) began his lengthy speech (a “fauxlibuster,” they joked) on Tuesday. Some cast it as a self-serving gesture, done to impress “dumb” people outside the Beltway who don’t get that defunding Obamacare just isn’t possible. But as the night wore on, it was clear that Cruz’s stand was as passionate and articulate an attack on Obamacare and a defense of liberty as the nation has ever seen.
A few even began to see its wisdom, circulating an essay by David Frum acknowledging that even a defeat served Cruz’s political purposes. Charles Krauthammer, who the day before had traded jokes about Cruz’s Canadian birth, acknowledged on Tuesday that he had executed a brilliant maneuver, if not to defeat Obamacare than to highlight its flaws, and to seize the mantle of leadership of a conservative movement needing inspiration.


What was most impressive about Cruz’s gambit, however, was not the strategy but the substance. In plain language, Cruz laid out the fundamental problems with Obamacare as policy, outlining the cost to working families in higher insurance premiums, dropped health plans, and lost work hours or job opportunities. He also reminded Washington of how the bill was passed, and upheld, in defiance of the people and the Constitution.

A few Democrats eventually wandered down to the Senate floor to debate Cruz, some to try poking holes in his arguments, reminding him that President Barack Obama had won a new mandate from the voters even after passing the Affordable Care Act. Cruz patiently, and deftly, handled their objections, noting that even the unions were turning against the law, and blasting both sides for approving congressional exemptions from it.
It was also difficult not to be moved by Cruz’s passion. No empty gesture could sustain the hours upon hours of explication, analysis, and debate that Cruz tackled on the Senate floor. Agree or disagree with his decision to force the issue into a debate over the budget and the debt ceiling, it is impossible not to be impressed by his sheer will, and by the self-evident sincerity of a man so fluent and ardent in his arguments.
It occurred to me that when I ran for Congress in 2010, and voters would urge me to “do something” if I got to Washington, that this is the type of “something” they meant. They know that a freshman in Congress is barely even worth his or her vote but that a person willing to take risks can change history. And millions went to bed last night knowing someone on Capitol Hill was, finally, keeping watch over their liberty as they slept.
There was one flaw in Cruz’s approach, however. It became clear in the reactions of those who might otherwise have supported his effort but were put off by his attacks on fellow Republicans. Cruz sometimes turned sincere disagreement over tactics into differences in courage and conviction. Despite Cruz’s moderate demeanor, his rhetoric sometimes reflected a political media culture mired in the language of absolutes.
Cruz has withstood intense hostility with uncommon grace, but he should reserve terms like “surrender caucus” and Neville Chamberlain analogies for real enemies if he wants to rally the broader support he deserves. Overall, however, his stand was brilliant. His remarks should be printed separately as a primer on Obamacare, and his tactics should inspire the opposition. He will soon run out of time. But he has turned the tide.

Dana Bash of CNN reported Wednesday evening that all of the Democratic Senators facing re-election in 2014 would back a “new” proposal to delay the Obamacare enrollment deadline–not really “new,” since Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) already said he would propose legislation to delay the individual mandate, and House Republicans passed a bill in late September to avoid a government shutdown if the mandate were delayed.

new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline
— Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) October 23, 2013


The House proposal failed in the Senate, 54-46, on a party-line vote. Every single Democrat voted against the proposed delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, including those up for re-election in 2014, including red-state Democrats–all of them. If just five of them had shifted, the shutdown would have been avoided and the delay would have been passed–to face Obama’s veto, but the point would have been made.

Furthermore, there are sixteen Democrats facing re-election in the Senate, almost enough to override the president’s veto. If just a few more Democrats–perhaps the five planning to retire–had switched to back a delay that even the White House is said to be considering in one form or another, then Obama’s veto would not have been a threat. The disastrous Obamacare rollout, and the shutdown, would not have happened.
As I wrote on Sep. 23, that solution was “Win-win. Therefore unlikely.” But it should have happened, if the media had been more interested in the substance of the issue rather than whether Obama would win or lose. Instead, they helped Democrats and the media label the GOP as terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, “Gremlins” (my favorite) and suicide bombers–while some Republicans joined in the insults.
When the polls landed, Democrats became the “terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, and suicide bombers,” pressing their perceived advantage to demand the reversal of the budget sequester–at least until their allies in the media quietly warned them not to squander their victory. Now that some Democrats have embraced what Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and–yes–John Boehner fought for, no one is calling them nasty names.
What’s done is done–and Republicans will have to find a way back from what was, in the end, a very real political loss. But let it be noted, along the way, that the very same Democrats who will now be lining up to support a delay in the enrollment deadline or individual mandate were proud that they “never folded” in the debate just a few weeks ago. They had their chance to protect Americans. They protected Obama instead.

The left-wing Politico deserves credit for reporting what much of the media will not: the fallout yet to come from the rolling ObamaCare debacle. Politico covers the death spiral, sticker shock, and more. Conspicuously missing in Politico’s analysis, though, is the Obama administration’s own prediction that ObamaCare will potentially result in tens of millions of employer-based health plan cancellations. 
Yes, you read that correctly; the Obama administration itself predicted in 2010 that “a majority of group health plans will have lost their grandfather status by the end 2013.” …
The DOJ cites the June 17, 2010, edition of the Federal Register, which acknowledges that within the first year of Obamacare’s employer mandate, the insurance plans offered by many employers will be canceled because their policies will not be grandfathered under the administration’s regulations. 


“The Departments’ mid-range estimate is that 66 percent of small-employer plans and 45 percent of large-employer plans will relinquish their grandfather status by the end of 2013,” the Register says. “The low-end estimates are for 49 percent and 34 percent of small and large-employer plans, respectively, to have relinquished grandfather status, and the high-end estimates are 80 percent and 64 percent, respectively.”
In other words, the Obama administration itself expects that the misery currently roiling the individual market is going to happen to the employer-based or group plan market. If you like your employer-based insurance, there is a better chance than not that you are going to lose it. 
So all this talk from Democrats, the media, and the White House that the cancelation fallout will be restricted to just 5% of the public simply isn’t true. 

Millions of employer-based plans will be canceled because they do not meet the government’s standards for minimum coverage, which means that whatever alternative coverage the insurance provider offers will be more expensive. Some employers might choose to eat all of that extra cost. But many will either pass the cost on to their employees or choose not to provide insurance. 
Millions, then, will not only get herded into the ObamaCare exchanges; they will also lose the benefit of their employer sharing the cost of their health insurance premiums.
The White House knows this. The Democrats know this. The media know this. But they also know that reporting on this possibility will justifiably spook the 95% who think they are safe — and that would almost certainly mean the end of ObamaCare.

A new poll released by the Washington Post/ABC News reports very bad news for Obama. The President has hit record disapproval rating (56% among RVs, 55% among adults) and his Affordable Care Act is tanking in the public’s opinion. 
Not only does the public disapprove of Obama’s job performance, more than half do not like him. Fifty-two percent say they have an unfavorable image of the President. To drive that home, the three metrics used to measure Obama’s “leadership and empathy” are all in the red.  



Half or more now say he is not a strong leader, does not understand the problems of “people like you,” and is not honest and trustworthy. Perceptions of the president as a strong leader have dropped 15 points since January, and over the past year the percentage of registered voters who say he is not honest and trustworthy has increased 12 points.

These ratings carry over to opinions on Obamacare. Fifty-six percent say Obama is not a good manager and this is evident when looking at opinions about his health care program specifically. Almost two-thirds (63%) disapprove of of the program’s roll out and 57% straight up oppose the Affordable Healthcare Act, a 10% jump up from last month. The lynchpin of Obama’s program, the mandate to purchase insurance also performs quite poorly with two thirds (65%) opposing it. 
Polls are considered a snapshot in time, so there is no telling if America’s sour outlook on Obama and Obamacare will stick. Obama has promised to “re-brand” his health care program and it remains to be seen if the country will give him a second chance. Certainly the unintended consequences or rather, the particulars of the law which were concealed from the public, are not popular and indicate that if the public had “read the law before they passed it” it might not have ever been approved.

On Wednesday, CNN’s Dana Bash tweeted that all Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2014 will reportedly support a delay of Obamacare’s enrollment deadline. 
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who is up for re-election in 2014, wrote to Obama on Tuesday and asked him to delay the enrollment deadline for the individual mandate. “Given the existing problems with the website, I urge you to consider extending open enrollment beyond the current end date of March 31, 2014,” Shaheen wrote to the president. “Allowing extra time for consumers is critically important so they have the opportunity to become familiar with the website, survey their options and enroll.”
On Wednesday, Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR), who is facing a tough challenge in his 2014 re-election against Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR), came out in support of Shaheen’s call for a delay of the individual mandate’s enrollment deadline. Pryor had previously been on record as supportive of the mandate as is.


Now, according to CNN’s Bash, the Democratic Party is coordinating an effort to support a delay in the individual mandate.

“new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline,” Bash tweeted on early Wednesday evening.
Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is on record as supporting a one-year delay in the individual mandate as well, although Manchin is not up for re-election in 2014. 
The Democrats’ push comes shortly after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) recently launched a crusade against Obamacare. Cruz’s efforts and those of Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) showed the American people the president and Senate Democrats were unwilling to compromise on Obamacare, and the Democrats’ stubbornness resulted in a temporary partial government shutdown and a short-lived debt crisis scare. 
Many Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), have been predicting for months that the Democrats would look for an Obamacare “escape hatch” ahead of 2014.

During a colloquy aiding Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in his filibuster-like Senate floor speech Tuesday evening, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) challenged the assertion that Senate Republicans must vote for cloture to support the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) that defunds Obamacare, offering two alternative methods for passage which preserve that element of the legislation.
“Now, it’s interesting that what we’re discussing here today, much of what we’ve been discussing today has been on the upcoming cloture vote,” Lee said. “There have been those who have argued that if you want to support the continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives–remember, this is the continuing resolution that will keep our federal government funded while defunding Obamacare–if you want to support that, that you must vote yes on the cloture vote on the bill.”
Lee then questioned the logic of that argument, which has been presented by GOP Senate leadership. 


“It’s anticipated that Senator Harry Reid… and 53 democratic allies, as I understand, will all be voting for cloture on that bill,” he said. “That begs the question… does that mean that Harry Reid and the 53 Democrats likely to follow him are supporting the House-passed Continuing Resolution, the one that keeps government funded while defunding Obamacare? I find that a little strange. I find it a little counterintuitive.”

Lee argued the logic is not sound. 
“That’s a problem, indeed, because that… [allows] neither an open amendment process nor an up-or-down vote on the House-passed resolution in as-is condition–in either of those circumstances, we would be fine,” Lee said. “But we’re not getting that. We’re getting stuck with something else. He wants to gut the House-passed continuing resolution of the defunding language without an open amendment process and without the opportunity for an up-or-down vote.”
“So in that circumstance, I don’t understand why it would be the case that Republicans would feel that voting ‘yes’ would be supporting the House of Representatives and voting ‘no’ would be voting against the House of Representatives.”
Then Lee told Cruz that it seems to him that such a move “would be quite the opposite of that.”
“It seems to me, Senator Cruz, that if–if one, in fact, wanted to stand behind the House of Representatives and stand behind their willingness to defend the American people and protect them from this harmful law… [one] would necessarily need to vote ‘no’ if, in fact, Senator Reid does what we expect him to do later this week.”

President Barack Obama made it no secret he was a proponent of a single payer health care system in America when he first came on to the national scene. However, he explained to his supporters over the years that a “potential transition” would be necessary to break away from the current system. 
Interestingly, as the implementation of the Obamacare exchanges face problems and millions begin to lose coverage from their private insurers, something President Obama promised would not happen, Democrats and their liberal allies are now beginning to suggest a single payer system as a solution to the rickety exchanges.  


Rep. John Larson (D – CT) told Breitbart News last Wednesday that under a single payer system Americans would not be losing their private health care coverage, claiming, “You would be covered automatically. But that’s not the law. The law is that it’s a free enterprise system and they have the right not to enter into the exchange or not to provide for you in the exchange. That is their right.” 
The video below shows clips of Obama explaining to supporters  his views over the years about how he would transition a single payer system into the United States. At the same time he criticizes his detractors, saying the Affordable Care Act is not a “government take over” of American health care. 


Obama – Remarks to AFL – CIO
“I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer health care plan. The United States of America–the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent–14 percent of its gross national product on health care and cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody and that’s what Jim is talking about when he says, ‘Everybody in. Nobody out.’ A single payer health care credit–universal healthcare credit. That’s what I’d like to see, but as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we have to take back the White House and we’ve got to take back the Senate and we’ve got to take back the House.”
Obama – Remarks  – 8/4/07
“This is a two trillion dollar part of our economy and it is my belief that it’s not just politically but economically it is better for us to start getting a system in place–a universal healthcare system signed into law by the end of my first term as president and build off that system to further to make it more rational…”
“By the way, Canada did not start immediately with a single payer system. They had a similar transition step. “

Obama- New Hampshire Public Radio 11/21/07
OBAMA: It’s a transitional system building on the existing systems that we have.
HOST: Transitional to what?

OBAMA: Transitional, hopefully, because the system is currently a patchwork of inefficiency that over time I would want to see Medicaid, Medicare, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)–all those integrated more effectively.
Obama – Public Remarks 4/3/07

“Let’s say that I proposed a plan that moved to a single payer system–Let’s say Medicare plus. Essentially, everybody can buy Medicare, for example…”
“Transitioning a system is a very difficult and costly and lengthy enterprise. It’s not like you can turn on a switch and you go from one system to another. So it’s possible that up front, you wouldn’t need not just– you might need an additional ninety or a hundred billion dollars a year.”
Obama – (SEIU Healthcare Forum) – 3/24/07
“But I don’t think we’re going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately. There’s going to be potentially some transition process. I can envision a decade out or 15 years out or 20 years out..”
Obama – Public Remarks – 1/27/05
“There’s no denying that part of the solution in the health care arena as we transition and deal with the legacy systems that we’ve inherited will probably require some additional money.”
Obama – Remarks to American Medical Association – 6/15/2009
“The public option is not your enemy. It is your friend…Let me also address an illegitimate concern that is being put forward by those who are claiming a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single payer system.”
Obama – (SEIU Healthcare Forum) – 3/24/07

“My commitment is to make sure we’ve got universal health care for all Americans by the end of my first term as president…”
“I would hope that we could set up a system that allows those who can’t go through their employers to access a federal system or a state pool of some sort…but I don’t think we’re going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately. There’s going to be potentially some transition process. I can envision a decade out or 15 years out or 20 years out..”
Rep. Barney Frank (D – MA) – 7/27/09
“I think if we get a good public option, it could lead to single payer and that’s the best way to reach single payer.”
Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D – IL) – 4/18/09
“And next to me was a guy from the insurance company who then argued against the public health insurance option saying, ‘It wouldn’t let private insurance compete–that a public option will put the private insurance industry out of business and lead to single payer.’ He was right. The man was right.”
Obama – Public Remarks 
“Nobody is talking about some government take over of health care.”

Several House members are backing up Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his leadership role in the effort to defund Obamacare in the wake of attacks from the mainstream media and anonymous statements from establishment Republicans and their staffers.
“I do feel obligated to speak because Senator Cruz is my senator and I endorsed him last year in his election against Lt. Gov. [David] Dewhurst,” Rep. Michael Burgess (R-TX) said in response to a question from Breitbart News at Thursday’s Conversations with Conservatives press event on Capitol Hill. “We wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for his vision and his leadership,” he explained. “We are grateful for the fact that we are here today with this opportunity to deliver for the American people. We hope that the American people will help the Senate understand the enormous task that is in front of us.”  
Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) added that Republicans are united in their push to defund Obamacare in the Continuing Resolution (CR). Labrado said he believes it is a “mistake” for some anonymous Republicans to suggest Cruz is somehow splitting the Party.


“Anonymous members and anonymous aides accusing other people of dividing the Republican Party?” Labrador said in response to Breitbart News’ question. “I think that’s a mistake. I think we’re behind this move.” 
“I think you’re going to see a huge number of members, in fact, I almost believe that it’s going to be unanimous with the Republican members in the House,” he ventured. “I don’t think we’ve ever been this unified.”
Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), along with House conservative leaders like Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Tom Graves (R-GA), deserve credit for helping unite the Republican Party around the effort to defund Obamacare. He said the American people also deserve credit for rising up and demanding their lawmakers fight for them. 

“I’ll just echo that the Senators are getting credit and Tom Graves and Jim Jordan and others for helping get us to this point,” Duncan said. “They all deserve credit. But I’ll tell you what: The involvement of the American people cannot be ignored in this. Their voices were heard.” 
“They made phone calls to our offices. They came to a rally here in Washington. They made personal contact during August at town halls,” he continued.” The American people got engaged and so I don’t want to discount them at all and I actually want to give them all the credit for getting us where we are today on this.”
Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) argued that the current debate is the result of the American people wanting leaders in Congress like Cruz to stand up and defund Obamacare.
“Republicans are always blamed for defunding Obamacare and this is like 30 or 40 times we’ve done that,” Yoho said. “We’re not doing it because we want to do it. It’s because the American people have spoken up and said we want this thing done and if you go back to 2009 when the infamous words were ‘we have to pass it to see what’s in it. We have to pass it to see how it’s going to work.'” 
“You’re seeing now what’s coming out and the American people don’t want it. American business said ‘no we don’t want it.’ The unions are saying ‘no we don’t want it.’ So I think the people have spoken loud and clear and I’m proud to be on this team in the 113th Congress where we’ve said we’re going to do this for the American people,” he stated. “This is what’s right for our country. This is what’s going to stimulate our economy by creating jobs and getting rid of this.”
Later on Thursday on a conference call with Cruz and conservative media, Reps. Matt Salmon (R-AZ) and Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) also signaled their thanks and support for Cruz. 
“It’s an honor to be on the phone with Sen. Cruz, and I think we have Jim Bridenstine on the call with us too, another great patriot,” Salmon said. “I just want to thank the leadership in the Senate of Sen. Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee.”  
“It’s been interesting to watch this debate develop,” Bridenstine added. “It started off when this debate first started and Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee have been doing the Lord’s work on this effort.”

Health care wonks are crowing about a “November surge” in enrollment. Will the November surge will be able to make up for the October purge, i.e. the millions who were dropped from existing plans because of Obamacare’s new minimum standards for coverage? In California, there is reason to think it may not.
In a piece posted at Wonkblog Friday, author Sarah Kliff introduced the term  “November surge” into the discussion of enrollment figures. According to Kliff, the uptick in enrollment, especially in California, is reason for optimism:

Some state-based marketplaces had a pretty smooth launch, and are seeing the pace of enrollment speed up daily. California has lead [led] the bunch; the state’s enrollments have grownsteadily in November and now account for nearly a full third of allhealth law sign-ups. The state has had its strongest two weeks ofenrollment this month.

The enrollment surge in California, and the idea that it was part of a broader pattern, was first reported by LA Times health writer Noam Levey a week ago. Levey’s piece was widely quoted, including by Sarah Kliff, but his claims did not stand up to much scrutiny. For instance, Levey claimed that Kentucky was “outpacing” its enrollment estimates. A spokesperson for the state says no such estimates exist. 


Both Levey and Kliff fail to ask the most important question. How soon will current enrollment trends balance out the number of people who have been dropped from their insurance as a result of Obamacare grandfathering regulations? In other words, can a November surge make up for the October purge?

Health insurance expert Bob Laszewski suggests California has a long way to go before the net enrollment shows a gain. He lays out the figures in a post published Monday:

California has 5.3 million uninsured eligible to buy in the exchange with half estimated to be subsidy eligible.
California is cancelling another 1.1 million people of which Covered    California has estimated 510,000 qualify for a subsidy they can only    get if they go to Covered California. At least 80% need to act by    December 23 to avoid losing their coverage.
The state is spending $250 million in federal money to get people signed up–dramatically more than any other state. 
The Covered California goal is to sign-up 500,000 to 700,000 subsidy eligible people by March 31.

Laszewski concludes “Looking at these numbers, if they don’t have well more than 500,000people signed up by December 31, I would have to think the number ofuninsured in California would have grown.”
Any fair accounting of the enrollment figures needs to keep in mind the number of people who–contrary to the President’s oft-repeated promise–have been kicked off plans they had. In California the enrollment figures for November have improved but they are still a long way from bringing the state back to where it was before the cancellation notices went out.

As Senate leaders hammer out a deal to end the partial government shutdown and lift the nation’s debt ceiling, sources on Capitol Hill tell Breitbart News that labor unions are poised to win a significant delay in an ObamaCare tax. The delay in the tax, which has long been a goal of Big Labor, is expected to be part of a spending agreement brokered by Sens. Reid and McConnell. 
At issue is a “reinsurance” tax levied against all group health plans. The funds raised would be used to compensate insurance companies for providing coverage to extremely sick individuals. Labor unions have made eliminating the tax a top priority, arguing that it would drive up the cost of health insurance for union members. At the recently concluded AFL-CIO annual meeting last month, union members passed a resolution calling for a repeal of the tax. The outlines of the emerging Senate spending deal will delay imposition of the tax for one year. 
When House Republicans passed their government spending bill, with a one-year delay in ObamaCare’s individual mandate, President Obama countered that the health care program was the “settled” law of the land. Which, apparently, is true unless one has a PAC that showers millions of dollars in campaign contributions on lawmakers. 


Earlier this year, the Obama Administration delayed for one year the mandate that large employers provide health insurance to their employees. This came soon after a similar one-year delay in the set-up of health exchanges for small businesses. Since ObamaCare passed Congress, the Administration has issued hundreds of waivers to special interests, exempting them from the effects of the law. 
It seems that only the average American citizen will be made to comply with the ObamaCare program. Democrats, throughout the fiscal stand-off, have argued that ObamaCare should not be altered or reformed. Unless, of course, you are a labor union.

Half of the people who have signed up for Obamacare in 17 states have not activated their health insurance plans by making their first premium payment, a trend that threatens to further embarrass and frustrate President Barack Obama and the highly unpopular Obamacare program. 
Health insurance plans purchased through Obamacare only kick in once a customer pays their first month’s premium. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that “only about half of enrollees billed for plans offered by more than 100 insurers in 17 states had paid their first month’s premium,” according to Benaissance chief strategy officer Mark Waterstraat, whose firm serves as a third-party billing company for insurers. Another insurer, Scott & White Health Plan, told the Journal that only 35% of its enrollees have paid for the plans they applied for. 
The Obama administration remains far behind its 7 million enrollment target but has recently celebrated what it calls two million Obamacare “enrollments.” Yet that figure merely reflects the number of applications submitted, not the number of paying customers who have turned on their plans by actually paying for coverage. Whether insurers in the other 33 states are experiencing nonpayment rates in the 35% to 50% range is presently unknown. If those rates extended nationally, they would mean the Obama administration’s claim that it has enrolled two million people in Obamacare would plunge to just 700,000 to one million. 


Even progressive groups like the left-leaning journalism group ProPublica say the emergence of an Obamacare nonpayment gap raises “the prospect that actual enrollment will be far lower than the figures HHS [Health and Human Services] is releasing.” 

Part of the problem may be the costs of the plans offered through Obamacare. A recent USA Today analysis found that over half of all counties in the 34 states on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange “lack even a bronze plan that’s affordable by the government’s own definition.”
“There is also a lot of worrying going on over people making payments,” industry consultant Robert Laszewski told ProPublica. 
Experts say that first-time insurance buyers may not fully understand the duties and responsibilities that come with ownership. A recent study published in the Journal of Health Economics found that only 14% of individuals who have health coverage could correctly answer all four of four basic questions about health insurance, including understanding what a “deductible” and “copay” mean. If comprehension levels are that low for those who already have insurance, analysts worry what that might mean for first-time insurance purchasers, especially for a program as complex as Obamacare.
Persistence of the Obamacare nonpayment trend would pose serious challenges for the Obama administration’s ability to hit its goal of seven million paying customers by the end of March. 
According to the latest CNN poll, support for Obamacare is now at a record low 35%. 
Obamacare will cost U.S. taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years.

Sources close to House conservative leaders have confirmed to Breitbart News that House GOP leadership is planning to cave and fund Obamacare’s implementation for at least the rest of 2013.
Text of the Continuing Resolution (CR) that will fund the government for 60-75 days will be released on Tuesday, the conservative source said, before a House vote on Thursday. The move comes abruptly as conservatives are ramping up their final push on House leadership with a big Tea Party rally outside the Capitol on Tuesday calling for Obamacare’s defunding.
House Speaker John Boehner’s spokesman Michael Steel told Breitbart News the “CR will include defunding ObamaCare,” but would not specify whether or not a certain procedural “trick” the GOP leadership used in a similar situation in 2011 will be employed yet again.


Breitbart News’ source, a high-ranking conservative movement figure close to House conservatives, said that this CR from House leadership will continue to pay for Obamacare’s implementation without cutting from current levels of taxpayer funding for the healthcare law’s rollout, despite claims from Boehner’s office it will “include defunding ObamaCare.” The source said the budget riders that will be attached to the CR can be removed easily by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, allowing him to pass a CR through the Senate funding Obamacare–a procedural move that does not require the House to revisit its CR and makes the Senate version final. 
The source added that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is “shopping an idea of passing defund through the House with the CR, but with a mechanism that would allow it to be decoupled in the Senate, defeated, and then the base CR be passed without coming back to the House.”
The source said the conservative movement should “reject and pan” this “trick” from Cantor, which allows House GOP members to claim they voted to defund Obamacare but allows Reid to strip out budget riders defunding Obamacare and pass a Senate CR without them.

In rushing the CR to the floor for a vote, Breitbart News’ source said that House GOP leadership will put votes on whether the U.S. should authorize use of military force in Syria off until next week.  
Politico has also confirmed the GOP leadership’s plans, reporting that Cantor and House Speaker John Boehner are “dusting off an old legislative gambit from April 2011 as one way to move ahead this week with a stopgap spending bill for the first months of the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.”
“The goal is to give conservatives a vote on defunding health care reform without resulting in a government shutdown,” Politico’s David Rogers wrote. “It’s worked before, but ‘before’ is the operative word.” 
“And until Tuesday’s Republican Conference, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) won’t really know if this flash-from-the-past can flash again,” Rogers continued. “Most simply the procedure calls for sending the Senate a stopgap spending bill together with a resolution that would alter the text of the bill once it’s enrolled for presentation to President Barack Obama.”
Red State’s Daniel Horowitz notes that this trick from House GOP leadership could give GOP members political cover to oppose the grassroots and Tea Party movement by allowing them to claim they voted not to pay for Obamacare’s implementation. “Based on what I’m hearing from House sources, the worst suspicions are confirmed,” Horowitz wrote. “Eric Cantor is floating an idea to pass a short-term CR with a defund rider. But just as we predicted, they plan to write a rule that will sever the defund rider from the body of the bill after it passes the House.” 

“This will allow the Senate to vote down the defund part separately, and send a clean CR straight to the President’s desk without ever returning to the House,” he explained. “This will ensure that we capitulate while allowing House and Senate Republicans to be shielded from charges of voting to defund Obamacare.”
Rick Manning, the vice president for public policy and communications at Americans for Limited Government, told Breitbart News such a strategy from leadership to buy political cover will likely fail in the end. 
“If Congress ends up funding Obamacare in the Continuing Resolution, House Republicans will own it every bit as much as if they had voted for it in the beginning,” Manning said. “Parliamentary tricks will not save them from this reality.”
Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin said recently that if House Speaker John Boehner allowed a situation like this to happen, Obamacare would forever become known as “BoehnerCare.”
Club for Growth president Chris Chocola denounced the reported plan in a statement Monday afternoon: “Are these news reports from The Onion? Or are they real?” Chocola said. “When members were at home over recess, did they hear their constituents ask for legislative tricks or principled leadership?
“Trying to fool Republicans into voting to fund Obamacare is even worse than offering a bill that deliberately funds it,” Chocola declared. “I hope this proposal is nothing more than a bad joke and is quickly discarded. Republicans should simply do what they say they are for by passing a Continuing Resolution that doesn’t fund Obamacare.”

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will agree to expand the state’s Medicaid program under Obamacare on Tuesday.
According to the Newark, NJ-based Star-Ledger, Christie will announce the expansion when he unveils the governor’s new budget in a 3 p.m. speech to a joint session of New Jersey’s Legislature on Tuesday. 


Christie joins Florida’s Rick Scott and Virginia’s Bob McDonnell as two Republican governors who have completely reversed course on the issue after rejecting addition Medicaid funds.
As recently as last summer, Christie had suggested that he would refuse the Medicaid expansion. As he told Fox & Friends in July: “Medicaid is pretty well expanded in our state already because of the legacy of previous Democratic governors. So, I don’t think there’s a lot for us to do in New Jersey in that regard.”
Likewise, McDonnell had said in July: “Expanding Medicaid without fixing Medicaid is a terrible idea.” 

Christie and McDonnell were both elected in 2009 in the first wave of Tea Party-supported Republican campaigns. McDonnell is leaving office after this year; Christie is widely favored to win re-election.
State Sen. Joe Vitale, a Democrat who is chairman of the New Jersey Senate committee that deals with health care, told the Associated Press that he “had been briefed” on Christie’s decision. Health advocacy groups also said they were told by Christie’s staff of the decision that will cover 300,000 uninsured people in New Jersey. 
The Supreme Court, in its Obamacare ruling last year, made Medicaid expansion, which was mandatory in the Obamacare law, optional for the states. However, the federal government attempted to encourage the states to participate by offering to pay 100% of the cost for the first three years, and 90% of the costs thereafter, provided Medicaid eligibility is expanded to include those living within 133% of the poverty line. 
In essence, states that accept the federal government’s deal will have the short-term costs subsidized by federal taxpayers. The Star-Ledger notes that New Jersey is expected to receive “$1.7 billion a year” to cover the initial costs. A recent Government Accountability Office report predicted that Obamacare would add $6.2 trillion to the long-term federal deficit.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 22 states, including the District of Columbia, have now agreed to the Medicaid expansion. Seven of those states are governed by Republicans. 
Though once a conservative hero for his tough stances on the state budget and his willingness to confront New Jersey’s public sector unions, Christie has fallen from grace. In late October, he offered effusive praise for President Barack Obama’s handling of Hurricane Sandy, though all Obama had done was visit the area briefly. Many residents are still struggling to rebuild, and face numerous obstacles, including the federal bureaucracy.

With his credibility shot, CBS News has apparently decided to not take President Obama’s latest ObamaCare promise at face value. Now that millions whom the president reassured could keep their insurance are losing it, CBS dug into Obama’s latest reassurance about the 80% not in the individual market, and also found that that’s not exactly true. The truth is that a so-called “Cadillac Tax” is about to turn millions of employer-based plans into something a little closer to a “junk plan.”
“If you’re one of the 80 percent of Americans who is insured or covered through an employer plan or through Medicare or Medicaid, or the Veterans’ Administration, there is no change for you except for an increase in benefits that everyone receives as a result of the Affordable Care Act,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday.


Yet in the years to come, some workers with employer-provided benefits will see their benefits scaled back because of an Obamacare tax. That portion of the law — known as the “Cadillac tax” — isn’t set to take effect until 2018, but it’s already influencing the benefits packages that employers offer.
“Every employer plan since the passage of the health care law has been working to make sure their health care cost trends keep their plans under the ‘Cadillac tax,'” Steve Wojcik of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit that represents large employers, told CBSNews.com.
It is hard to tell if CBS News is just getting on the record with this report, or if the media is actually going to start doing its job with ObamaCare and give America a heads up on the fallout yet to come. 

From the moment ObamaCare looked like a reality, conservative think tanks and Republican lawmakers sounded the warning that millions would lose their health insurance as a result. All the media did in response, though,  was to either ignore those warnings or push back on behalf of the White House and Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. 
The effect ObamaCare will have on the employer-based market — over a hundred million people — is not limited to this Cadillac Tax. The White House itself estimated that tens of millions could be dropped by their employers and shoved into these ObamaCare exchanges. This could mean losing your doctor and having your health care options limited in a traumatic way, especially if you are already ill. 
Though this unsettling White House report is out there, the media have yet to give it the attention deserved or to push the Administration to explain it, especially now that the president is claiming those 80% have nothing to worry about.  
The carnage that has already blindsided millions of middle class families in the individual market is only the beginning of the financial chaos ObamaCare is almost certain to rain down on tens of millions who made the mistake of taking a president at his word.

It only took five years for the American media to get tired of President Obama’s spoon-fed propaganda — well, at least one aspect of it. Earlier this month, 38 news organizations, including the Associated Press, ABC News, The Washington Post, and Reuters demanded more photojournalist access to the president. The White House responded with what one reporter described as a middle finger. Now some news organizations are responding by formalizing policies not to publish White House-distributed photographs. 
Last week the USA Today announced that it will not use “handout photos originating from the White House Press Office, except in very extraordinary circumstances.” The next day McClatchy joined the conditional boycott:


“The editors of McClatchy newspapers have agreed not to publish photography issued by the White House,” McClatchy Vice President for News/Washington Editor Anders Gyllenhaal told staffers in an email Tuesday night. The policy is not “a significant departure from current practices,” he says.
Both McClatchy and USA Today claim that these were their policies anyway, which makes one wonder what the point is. 
For those of us outside the DC-Manhattan bubble, it is really quite incredible to watch the elite media crybaby in this way. Our media has extraordinary power, when they choose to use it. The problem is that, when it comes to this president, they rarely choose to use it. 

No one respects their sycophants, which is why this White House is so comfortable ignoring, dismissing, and even ridiculing the mainstream media. 
This whole brouhaha surrounding photojournalist access is a perfect example. Nothing changes and what happens? The White House receives a strongly worded internal policy affirmation. 
If the media want some respect from this White House, they need to start doing something as simple as their jobs. But the White House knows that no matter how shabbily they treat the media, the media will still carry their water. For example, the ObamaCare cover ups continue to this day. Sure, the media is covering the smoking guns as they become too obvious to ignore, but they still refuse to warn the public that millions more insurance cancellations are coming. 
The media’s laughable and humiliating impotence will continue until they man up and stop running point for Obama’s agenda. 
Personally, I don’t believe the media’s protests about a lack of photojournalist access have anything to do with journalistic integrity. I think the media’s upset because they can’t get close to their sun king.

14160	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/08/CNN-Blames-Christians-for-Obamacare-Problems	Opinion	0	Healthcare	None	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
CNN has blamed Christians for the problem of Americans without health insurance, calling it “The Obamacare ‘scandal’ you haven’t heard about.” In an article on CNN.com’s Belief Blog, CNN writer John Blake says that, while famous pastors “preach in states where crosses and church steeples dot the skyline,” they do nothing about “the poor who can’t get the health insurance they would receive if they lived elsewhere.”
That refers, in turn, to the decision of twenty-five states not to participate in Obamacare’s expanded Medicaid funding. The states were allowed to opt out following last year’s controversial Supreme Court decision on Obamacare, which upheld the law as a whole but struck down the mandatory state participation in Medicaid expansion, citing the protection provided to state powers under the Tenth Amendment.


Some Republican states took the funding anyway, which provides health insurance subsidies for households with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level. Though the federal government will initially cover almost all of the cost, many Republican governors are wary of potential future costs, and are also worried about the effect on the federal budget itself. Many are also opposed to participating in the Obamacare program on principle.

CNN seems to think that the choice to opt out of Obamacare is somehow the responsibility of well-known pastors such as Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes, who declined to comment for Blake’s article. One minister, Rev. Phil Wages, said he would not preach that states should accept Medicaid funding because he does not believe that care for the poor is the primary responsibility of the government, according to Christian teachings.
Beyond that, most churches are non-profit organizations whose tax-exempt status might be threatened if they became involved in political causes. Blake recognizes that, but strongly suggests that churches have a duty regardless. (Curiously, he does not suggest that churches should preach against Obamacare because of the millions of families that are losing their health insurance plans, contrary to the president’s promises.)
Blake covers different perspectives on the question of speaking out. But the premise of CNN’s article is that churches are to blame for Obamacare’s failures–not the federal government, not the Democrats who passed it, and not President Barack Obama himself. The thinly-veiled implication–a repeated theme in leftist critiques–is that Christians are hypocrites who care about personal salvation, but not about good works.

President Barack Obama made it no secret he was a proponent of a single payer health care system in America when he first came on to the national scene. However, he explained to his supporters over the years that a “potential transition” would be necessary to break away from the current system. 
Interestingly, as the implementation of the Obamacare exchanges face problems and millions begin to lose coverage from their private insurers, something President Obama promised would not happen, Democrats and their liberal allies are now beginning to suggest a single payer system as a solution to the rickety exchanges.  


Rep. John Larson (D – CT) told Breitbart News last Wednesday that under a single payer system Americans would not be losing their private health care coverage, claiming, “You would be covered automatically. But that’s not the law. The law is that it’s a free enterprise system and they have the right not to enter into the exchange or not to provide for you in the exchange. That is their right.” 
The video below shows clips of Obama explaining to supporters  his views over the years about how he would transition a single payer system into the United States. At the same time he criticizes his detractors, saying the Affordable Care Act is not a “government take over” of American health care. 


Obama – Remarks to AFL – CIO
“I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer health care plan. The United States of America–the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent–14 percent of its gross national product on health care and cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody and that’s what Jim is talking about when he says, ‘Everybody in. Nobody out.’ A single payer health care credit–universal healthcare credit. That’s what I’d like to see, but as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we have to take back the White House and we’ve got to take back the Senate and we’ve got to take back the House.”
Obama – Remarks  – 8/4/07
“This is a two trillion dollar part of our economy and it is my belief that it’s not just politically but economically it is better for us to start getting a system in place–a universal healthcare system signed into law by the end of my first term as president and build off that system to further to make it more rational…”
“By the way, Canada did not start immediately with a single payer system. They had a similar transition step. “

Obama- New Hampshire Public Radio 11/21/07
OBAMA: It’s a transitional system building on the existing systems that we have.
HOST: Transitional to what?

OBAMA: Transitional, hopefully, because the system is currently a patchwork of inefficiency that over time I would want to see Medicaid, Medicare, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)–all those integrated more effectively.
Obama – Public Remarks 4/3/07

“Let’s say that I proposed a plan that moved to a single payer system–Let’s say Medicare plus. Essentially, everybody can buy Medicare, for example…”
“Transitioning a system is a very difficult and costly and lengthy enterprise. It’s not like you can turn on a switch and you go from one system to another. So it’s possible that up front, you wouldn’t need not just– you might need an additional ninety or a hundred billion dollars a year.”
Obama – (SEIU Healthcare Forum) – 3/24/07
“But I don’t think we’re going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately. There’s going to be potentially some transition process. I can envision a decade out or 15 years out or 20 years out..”
Obama – Public Remarks – 1/27/05
“There’s no denying that part of the solution in the health care arena as we transition and deal with the legacy systems that we’ve inherited will probably require some additional money.”
Obama – Remarks to American Medical Association – 6/15/2009
“The public option is not your enemy. It is your friend…Let me also address an illegitimate concern that is being put forward by those who are claiming a public option is somehow a Trojan horse for a single payer system.”
Obama – (SEIU Healthcare Forum) – 3/24/07

“My commitment is to make sure we’ve got universal health care for all Americans by the end of my first term as president…”
“I would hope that we could set up a system that allows those who can’t go through their employers to access a federal system or a state pool of some sort…but I don’t think we’re going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately. There’s going to be potentially some transition process. I can envision a decade out or 15 years out or 20 years out..”
Rep. Barney Frank (D – MA) – 7/27/09
“I think if we get a good public option, it could lead to single payer and that’s the best way to reach single payer.”
Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D – IL) – 4/18/09
“And next to me was a guy from the insurance company who then argued against the public health insurance option saying, ‘It wouldn’t let private insurance compete–that a public option will put the private insurance industry out of business and lead to single payer.’ He was right. The man was right.”
Obama – Public Remarks 
“Nobody is talking about some government take over of health care.”

For the past year, most political observers have focused on Republican opportunities to capture Senate seats in red-states like Louisiana and Arkansas. The GOP had a plausible, but narrow, path to capture enough of these seats to win control of the Senate. The ObamaCare disaster, however, has expanded the battlefield for control of the Senate. New polls show high-profile Democrats with negligible leads against phantom Republicans in IA, CO and MI. If these states are in play next year, Dem control of the Senate will be especially vulnerable. 
Republicans, so far, have been unable to attract high-profile candidates to contest the open seats in Iowa and Michigan or challenge Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado. All three seats have been safely in the Democrat column for much of the year. The terrible rollout of ObamaCare, however, has hurt the poll numbers of Democrats everywhere. This has become most pronounced in states that weren’t considered competitive. 
In Colorado, incumbent Sen. Mark Udall doesn’t draw more than 45% support against a host of possible GOP opponents. That level of support is a clear sign of vulnerability. Just a few months ago, Udall was a prohibitive favorite to win reelection. 


Democrats in Iowa have rallied behind Rep. Bruce Braley for the seat of retiring Sen. Tom Harkin. There is no clear GOP challenger, yet Braley can’t reach more than 42% against a number of possible challengers. 

In Michigan, Rep. Gary Peters, a typical union-backed Democrat, is running to replace Sen. Carl Levin. Again, there is no high-profile consensus GOP candidate, yet Peters can’t even crack 40% support in the polls. The most recent poll found Peters leading Republican former Secretary of State, Terri Land, by just one point, 37-36. Months ago, again, Peters was considered the overwhelming favorite.
Polls in these three states suggest that ObamaCare represents an existential threat to the Democrat party next year. Setting aside the problems with the website, the program will exert a gravitational pull on everyone’s health insurance. For most voters, the impact will be negative. 
Barring some unexpected event, Democrats could be slow-walking to their own political oblivion. If the party has to spend money to defend its seat in Michigan, it is unlikely to hold its seats in states like North Carolina or Alaska. 
The 2014 elections may be getting past the point that Republicans can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The party still hasn’t learned the lessons of 2010. They are about to get another primer from voters. Hopefully, the party will know now how to listen.

A bill that would allow non-physicians to perform abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy is awaiting signature by Gov. Jerry Brown of California by Sep. 30. The bill, AB 154, passed both houses of the state legislature with strong support from Planned Parenthood and pro-choice groups. Planned Parenthood stands to benefit most directly from the bill, as non-physician staff at its clinics would be able to obtain abortion licenses. 
One doctor–who identified himself as pro-choice–told Breitbart News that “the bill is a disaster since it sends us back 100 years to the problems of the complications from back-steet abortions.” The bill’s critics warn that the training provided to non-physician staff is weak, that supervision by physicians in clinics will be minimal, and that there is real risk of injury or death to women who will be treated in such conditions.
The California Medical Association has endorsed AB 154 because of “provisions for training in the bill and the amendments that clarify physician supervision.” Yet the training is to be provided by the Board of Registered Nursing, not by physicians, and the protocols for defining “supervision” have not been specified. There is nothing in the legislation requiring a physician to be present or on-site during an abortion.


The bill permits licensed non-physicians to perform two kinds of abortion in the first trimester–by medication, and by aspiration, which requires the insertion of medical instruments into the uterus. Though many doctors agree that non-physicians could provide medications with few risks, the idea that a non-physician would perform an invasive procedure such as aspiration strikes many as rife with risks.

Debate about AB 154, which was introduced by California State Assembly Majority Leader Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), has been muted in a state that pro-choice advocates see as sympathetic to their cause. The Los Angeles Times came out strongly in favor of the measure in an editorial on September 3, arguing that it does not pose safety risks and that it could increase access to abortion services for women early in pregnancy:

In underserved urban areas, women face delays in getting medical appointments at clinics. When a woman can’t get an abortion in the first trimester, she may end up getting one in the later stages of pregnancy, which can mean a more complicated and more expensive abortion.

Advocates of AB 154 also argue that other states have allowed non-physicians to perform abortions safely, including in Planned Parenthood clinics.
Opponents describe AB 154 as an effort by Planned Parenthood and other groups to profit from Obamacare, since the legislation will expand the number of patients eligible for the state Medi-Cal program, and Medi-Cal pays for abortion. They also dispute assurances about the bill’s safety for women, arguing that there has been inadequate monitoring of California abortion clinics even prior to the passage of the new legislation.

Millions of Americans should learn in three weeks whether the U.S. Supreme Court will take a case challenging Obamacare’s HHS Mandate for violating religious liberty. 
The media has been covering Korte v. HHS, where on Nov. 8 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit struck down Kathleen Sebelius’ regulation that implements a provision of the Affordable Care Act by requiring employers to provide abortion and contraception in their healthcare plans. 
The only religious exemption is for churches and other purely-religious employers. But countless secular and for-profit businesses are wholly owned by people of faith, who treat how they run their business as part of how they practice their religious faith, and object to providing products or services they regard as immoral or sinful. 


Five federal appellate courts have ruled on the issue thus far. Three have sided with religious business owners, and two have sided with the Obama administration. 

On Sept. 18, Breibart News broke the news that the first of these cases has been offered to the Supreme Court when lawyers from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) filed a petition with the justices in Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius. Later that same day, the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to review the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, which ruled in favor of the Green family in Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius. 
Two other federal appeals courts have weighed in on the issue. On Nov. 1, the D.C. Circuit sided with religious business owners in Gilardi v. HHS in a well-written opinion by Judge Janice Rogers Brown. And on Sept. 17, the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit supported President Obama and Secretary Sebelius. 
Judge Diane Sykes’ excellent opinion for the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit in Korte has deepened this national split in the federal courts. But despite the significant media attention that decision is getting, last week’s opinion is probably the end of the line for Korte. 
This is because the Supreme Court has now scheduled the petitions from Hobby Lobby and Conestoga for the justices’ closed-door conference on Nov. 26. The results of that conference could be released that afternoon or, more likely, will be announced when the Court holds its next session on Dec. 2.  
It is virtually certain the Supreme Court will take one or both cases. If review is granted, arguments will be in March or April, with a final decision on this issue before July 2014.

Barack Obama’s hometown newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, endorsed the president twice for president. Friday, the same Chicago Tribune called for ObamaCare to be immediately repealed before it can do any more damage:
Stop digging. Start over.


As Friday dawns, here’s what a health insurance crisis looks like to many millions of Americans: Barely six weeks shy of 2014, they do not know whether they will have medical coverage Jan. 1. Or which hospitals and doctors they might patronize. Or what they may pay to protect themselves and their families against the chance of medical and financial catastrophe. How much, that is, they may pay in order to satisfy the Democratic politicians and federal bureaucrats who are worsening a metastasizing health coverage fiasco. …
We understand why the president and leaders of his party want to rescue whatever they can of Obamacare. On their watch, official Washington has blown the launch of a new entitlement program … under the schedule they alone set in early 2010.
What we don’t understand is their reluctance to give that failure more than lip service. Many of the Americans who heard their president say Thursday that “we fumbled the rollout of this health care law” would have been pleased to hear him add: So we’re admitting it. This law is a bust. We’re starting over.

You can expect the calls to repeal ObamaCare to grow from non-GOP sources in the coming days. The news released Saturday that thousands of doctors have been dropped from Medicare Advantage is a likely tipping point. Destroying health care for the elderly is The Third Rail on steroids. This is Armageddon for Democrats. The only chance they have is to repeal. If they do not, they will be wiped out in 2014 and 2016.

I love a defunding fight as much as anyone, but I really want to see ObamaCare get a stake through its heart via widespread civil disobedience. If people refuse to sign up for ObamaCare, the program collapses. Nothing would be more satisfying than to see ObamaCare go the way of Prohibition (without the violence): as something else that pushed the wonderfully unruly American people too far. 
Contrary to what the media are telling you, the shutdown is not helping ObamaCare. Again and again, conservatives have been taunted by the media with the cry of, “If you hadn’t shut down the government, we’d be covering the ObamaCare launch debacle.”
Huh? 


The media are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle, and the coverage is the Obama administration’s worst nightmare because the shutdown has made it impossible for the White House to come up with a plan that would instruct the media in how to mitigate the damage. 
You see, if there was no shutdown, the media coverage of the launch would not be anywhere as negative for the White House as it is now, and here is why…
1. The White House Can’t Do Damage Control – Right now the media and the White House are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle in stark, one-dimensional terms: It is an expensive, disappointing, big government  debacle. Both are too overwhelmed to figure out a way to make it look less worse, which we all know would happen if they had the time and resources. 

2. The White House Can’t Gameplan a Plan B – While the administration obviously bungled the launch, when it comes to cleaning up a mess, this White House can usually move pretty fast. This time the White House can’t. They and the media are too bogged down in the shutdown. With some breathing room, the White House might have been able to set up a massive call center staffed with volunteers — something, anything to get people signed up. But even if they do, there is just no media space available to spread the word. 
3. White House Can’t Reassure Anyone – If the shutdown wasn’t gobbling up White House resources and media space, the administration could fan out its supporters to reassure those interested in signing up for ObamaCare that things are going to get better and that the problems are aggressively being worked on. Instead, all potential enrollees are seeing is error messages and all they are hearing is bad news. 
4. White House Can’t Spin the Sticker Shock – If anything brings down ObamaCare, it will be sticker shock. For four years, Obama, Democrats, and the media have been lying to the American people about the cost of ObamaCare. On top of adding $2.6 trillion to our deficit, individuals are facing shockingly high premiums and premium increases. This, after being lied to again and again about cheaper premiums. I’m not sure how the White House and its media would spin their way out of this, but heaven knows if they had the time and resources, they would find a way. After all, this is the same media that turned Obama’s Libya debacle into a campaign problem for Mitt Romney. 
—
The bottom line to ObamaCare’s success or failure is the number of enrollees paying into the system. In its first year, ObamaCare needs seven million enrollees, three million of them healthy and under age 35. 

If those numbers aren’t met, the program is a failure, the disapproval ratings increase, and the chances of ObamaCare slowly being killed increase. 
ObamaCare is the president’s baby, his only significant accomplishment, his only hope for a legacy — it is burning down before his eyes and he is helpless to do anything to shape the all-important first impression. 
Throughout Obama’s time in the spotlight, this is the only time I have ever witnessed anything he has bungled receiving only harshly negative coverage. It’s a bloodbath because the shutdown is taking up all the space that would normally be used for spin and lies.

Most of the 41 workers at Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Michigan say Obamacare is exploding their premiums and destroying health care as they once knew it. 
“I feel like I’ve been taken to the cleaners,” salesman Neal Campbell told NBC News senior investigative reporter Lisa Myers in a Sunday report. Campbell, who has a wife and three children, says Obamacare is breeding resentment and anger. “We feel betrayed, lied to, and we’re pissed off.” 
“How is this helping the average American that’s working 40 to 50 hours per week?” asked salesperson Terry Hardcastle. “How are we supposed to live?” 


Cathy Smith agreed. “You don’t make that much money to begin with,” said Smith with tears in her eyes. “…the prescriptions are going to kill me.” 

Under Obamacare, the workers’ employer faced a 50% increase in costs to keep worker plans at the same benefit and deductible levels. To remain economically viable, the dealership decided to give each worker an extra $2,400 and let them find plans on their own. Small business insurance broker Michael Harp says it’s all part of the new Obamacare reality for small businesses and their workers: “The overwhelming majority, they’re paying much higher rates and they have lower benefits.” 
Service adviser Steve Williams said Obamacare has destroyed the era of affordable health care. 
“The days of low deductibles and all that stuff are gone,” Williams told NBC. “It’s not going to get any better. It’s just going to get worse.” 
The NBC News report comes as the Obama administration and its progressive allies are reportedly readying yet another public relations campaign in the hopes of resuscitating Obamacare’s lugubrious approval ratings. The administration’s media blitz will highlight the stories of people who scored taxpayer-funded Obamacare coverage. 
The strategy, however, risks further angering the millions of middle-class workers who lost their insurance coverage due to Obamacare or whose premiums and deductibles are soaring in order to pay for the very Obamacare “winners” the administration plans to highlight.
According to the latest CNN poll, Obamacare is at a record low 35% approval rating.

With his credibility shot, CBS News has apparently decided to not take President Obama’s latest ObamaCare promise at face value. Now that millions whom the president reassured could keep their insurance are losing it, CBS dug into Obama’s latest reassurance about the 80% not in the individual market, and also found that that’s not exactly true. The truth is that a so-called “Cadillac Tax” is about to turn millions of employer-based plans into something a little closer to a “junk plan.”
“If you’re one of the 80 percent of Americans who is insured or covered through an employer plan or through Medicare or Medicaid, or the Veterans’ Administration, there is no change for you except for an increase in benefits that everyone receives as a result of the Affordable Care Act,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday.


Yet in the years to come, some workers with employer-provided benefits will see their benefits scaled back because of an Obamacare tax. That portion of the law — known as the “Cadillac tax” — isn’t set to take effect until 2018, but it’s already influencing the benefits packages that employers offer.
“Every employer plan since the passage of the health care law has been working to make sure their health care cost trends keep their plans under the ‘Cadillac tax,'” Steve Wojcik of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit that represents large employers, told CBSNews.com.
It is hard to tell if CBS News is just getting on the record with this report, or if the media is actually going to start doing its job with ObamaCare and give America a heads up on the fallout yet to come. 

From the moment ObamaCare looked like a reality, conservative think tanks and Republican lawmakers sounded the warning that millions would lose their health insurance as a result. All the media did in response, though,  was to either ignore those warnings or push back on behalf of the White House and Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. 
The effect ObamaCare will have on the employer-based market — over a hundred million people — is not limited to this Cadillac Tax. The White House itself estimated that tens of millions could be dropped by their employers and shoved into these ObamaCare exchanges. This could mean losing your doctor and having your health care options limited in a traumatic way, especially if you are already ill. 
Though this unsettling White House report is out there, the media have yet to give it the attention deserved or to push the Administration to explain it, especially now that the president is claiming those 80% have nothing to worry about.  
The carnage that has already blindsided millions of middle class families in the individual market is only the beginning of the financial chaos ObamaCare is almost certain to rain down on tens of millions who made the mistake of taking a president at his word.

On Tuesday, NBC News reporter and MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell revealed she did not know that lawmakers in Congress must be enrolled in Obamacare. Her remarks bolster Rep. Sean Duffy’s (R-WI) claim that the mainstream press may be both ill-prepared and unwilling to critically question the Obama administration on its signature healthcare legislation. 
Appearing on Mitchell Reports, Duffy and Mitchell got into a contested debate about whether a one-year delay of the individual mandate, which Republicans want as part of a short-term resolution to fund the government, was negotiable and whether the mainstream media has properly questioned the administration on Obamacare. 
At one point during the exchange, Duffy said:

And why won’t he join us in ObamaCare? Why wasn’t Michelle Obama on October 1st at the computer with her family signing up for ObamaCare? Or Jay Carney? They have their own gold-plated health care plan that they’re in and they don’t-


Mitchell then responded, “So do you.” 


Instantly, Duffy replied that he did not have a “gold-plated” plan because he had to be on Obamacare: 


No I’m not, I’m in ObamaCare. I’m in ObamaCare, Andrea. All members of Congress are, and my family. The President should join us in ObamaCare, and the rest of America. Is that pretty reasonable? We should all be treated equally under the law? Why should members of Congress be in ObamaCare and not the President? Explain that one. Isn’t that fair?


Duffy continued to ask Mitchell if she could “defend why the President shouldn’t be in ObamaCare like members of Congress and their staffs?”

“I think the media should start doing its job,” Duffy said.
Mitchell, visibly annoyed, then semi-sardonically responded, “Thanks for your advice. Thank you, Congressman.”
Earlier in the interview, Mitchell insisted Duffy’s demands were “non-negotiable” before Duffy said Obama is essentially saying, “I get my gold-plated health care plan but I want members of Congress and the rest of America to be in ObamaCare.” 
He then pointed out that a big issue many Americans have with the media is that the it does not ask the question, “Why are you treating families different than big businesses?” 
“You need Jon Stewart on Comedy Central to ask Secretary Sebelius, ‘Hey, why won’t you treat these two equally?'” Duffy said. “And she can’t answer it. I mean, that’s how pathetic I think news reporting has become, when we won’t ask tough questions to the administration.”
Duffy kept pressing Mitchell and asked her if she and her colleagues have asked Obama and those in his administration, “Why do you want your own health care and you won’t join us in ObamaCare?” 
After Mitchell surmised what she thought Sebelius’s response would be to such a question, Duffy pointed out Mitchell could not point out how Sebelius has answered the question because members of the mainstream press have not posed it to her.

When Establishment Republicans and their Democrat comrades claim there is no path to victory in the fight to defund Obamacare, they are intentionally muddying the waters.  Do not confuse blundering political expedience with winning.
There is a clear path to victory and the folks comprising the new Republican leadership emerging in the House and Senate are smart enough and bold enough to take that path.


They’re playing to win and deserve our support.
Understanding the options available to these new leaders requires an understanding of a few of the basics of Senate rules and process.  Otherwise folks like Karl Rove will tell you to “do the math” counting Democrat Senators without telling you that Senate Republicans have the ability to change the formula.
To help simplify an explanation of the Senate process, think of it like a football game where the rules and timing are set, but there are different plays at your disposal.  Winning requires playing the game with a focus on fundamentals.

Let’s go with one possible scenario that could unfold this week.  As early as Monday, the Senate could agree to take up the House bill passed last Friday that funds everything in the government but Obamacare.  The Senate can do this by something called “unanimous consent,” if no one Senator objects, or if one Senator does object, they can put it to a vote requiring 60 votes to pass.  For the purposes of this exercise, let’s say one or the other is successful and the bill goes to the Senate floor for consideration.
What happens next in this process is debate on the Senate floor begins, where each side argues for or against the bill.
During this debate period, Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could offer an amendment to strip out the language in the House bill that defunds Obamacare.  Reid would also likely choose not to allow any other amendments to the bill.  That is within his power as the leader of the majority party in the Senate. The hard and fast rules, however, require Reid to file his amendment for consideration and reveal for all to see what’s in the amendment before the debate is over.
This is where things can get deceptive.  Establishment Republicans would let you believe the next step in the process is the Senate has a vote on Reid’s amendment.  What these politicians are not telling you is Sen. Reid cannot get a vote on his amendment to put Obamacare funding back in the House bill unless some of the Republicans agree to it.
Here’s how that happens.

We last left the House bill on the Senate floor being debated.  To end that debate period, 60 Senators have to vote to do so. In Capitol Hillspeak, that vote to end debate is called reaching “cloture.” Currently, there are 52 Democrats, two independents (who work with the Democrats) and 46 Republican Senators.  Republicans can win that cloture vote with 41 votes, and debate continues on the Senate floor until Democrats can get 60 votes to stop it.
A vote for cloture is a vote to fund Obamacare. The people understand this, so Senators beware.

Bottom line: Reid cannot get a vote on his amendment that would strip Obamacare defunding out of the House bill unless six Republicans agree to let that vote take place. 
That’s called leverage in anyone’s playbook.  Reid loses his advantage.  He will have to negotiate on the rest of the process–like whether his amendment to fund Obamacare requires 60 votes to pass.  Or not.  That’s up for negotiation, too, if Senate Republicans fight for it.
If Republicans hold together on this, Reid will not be able to change the House bill.  That leaves Harry Reid with some tough choices.  Senate Democrats running for re-election do not want to be forced to vote against the House bill that defunds Obamacare.

Republicans can use this leverage to force Senate Democrats to make concessions.
Americans lucky enough to have a job right now are losing their healthcare plans they liked and wanted to keep. Obamacare is causing full-time jobs to become part-time jobs to get under the 30-hour workweek mandate. Doctors are choosing to retire rather than comply with the Obamacare boondoggle.  We are seeing this every single day in the newspapers.
Even the unions hate Obamacare.
 
If Republicans will force Senate Democrats to support Obamacare in this vote, some will bolt or they will lose their elections next year. By then, Obamacare will have reached out and touched everyone. The consequences in some instances could be fatal.
 
When Democrats and Establishment Republicans shriek “government shutdown,” and “the military won’t be paid,” or “law enforcement won’t be paid,” and every other item in the parade of horribles they’ll put forth, remember this: the House can keep sending bills to the Senate to fund anything they want.
 
Air traffic controllers?  Done! Military?  Done!  Border Patrol?  Done!
 
Funding the government at this point is this and only this: the Senate must stop holding America hostage and vote to fund the government, in whole or piece by piece, without Obamacare in it.
 
In life and as in the game of football, you can never win the victory if you choose to punt every time you touch the ball.

Colorado is one of 14 states operating its own ObamaCare exchange for health insurance. As a result, it has had more success enrolling people than the disastrous federal exchange. Still, Colorado’s relative “success” reveals a deeper problem with the new health care entitlement. So far, just 226 people have enrolled for private health insurance. At the same time, 25,000 Coloradans will be newly eligible for Medicaid benefits in January. 
Since the opening of the exchange in Colorado, 16,000 residents have used the system to enroll in the newly expanded Medicaid program. Another 9,000 adults without children were on waiting lists for the program. These individuals will also gain new Medicaid coverage next year. 
Medicaid, a shared federal-state health care entitlement, reimburses health care providers the least amount. Providers typically receive around 18 cents on each dollar billed. Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, pays 23 cents. Private insurers reimburse providers around 38 cents for each dollar billed. 


Pushing more Americans into the system through Medicaid not only increases the demand for health care services, but reduces at the margin the funds available to maintain that system. Either those with private insurance will have to bear a larger burden funding the system or the system will contract so that health care services are difficult to receive. 

Even if a magical pot of money were found to fund these services, it isn’t clear that having Medicaid coverage actually helps anyone. As my former colleague Nick Gillespie recently pointed out, a respected study out of Oregon found no difference in health outcomes from those on Medicaid and those uninsured. 
The problems with ObamaCare and future funding are not just confined to Medicaid, which is the dominant vehicle to provide new health coverage. Some percentage of the 226 Coloradans who have enrolled for private coverage will get federal subsidies to help purchase their insurance. The US Treasury, for the first time, will send premium payments to insurance companies to cover these subsidies. Medicaid and Medicare are already the fastest growing segments of the federal budget. These two programs, as well as the new health insurance subsidies, will likely soon consume all federal revenue. 
Math will prove to be the biggest obstacle to ObamaCare.

During a Thursday speech pitching a health care plan that seems to grow even more unpopular every time he pitches it, President Obama tore into Fox News by all-but accusing them of lying about the increased costs of health care under ObamaCare:
—



—
The president is lying though omission there. The argument that health care costs aren’t as high as the worst nightmare scenarios predicted does not mean costs are going down, even though that is what Obama is trying to hustle people into believing. The fact is, is that while pushing his health care plan, Obama promised premiums would go down for a family of four by at least $2400 per year. The reality, however, is that costs will increase by almost two times that amount. 

For example, while Obama pointed to a reduction in premiums in New York state, state officials in Ohio say the average premium proposal for individual coverage next year is up 88 percent from this year’s average price as reported by the Society of Actuaries. In Maryland, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield proposed a 25 percent increase in premiums next year, after first seeking a 50 percent increase. Final rates haven’t been determined in either state.                                 
The higher rates, supporters say, buy a health insurance system that guarantees access to coverage for everyone and improves benefits, such as requiring insurers to cover older children and outlawing lifetime spending limits on claims.
Obama did a good job injecting a little energy into the 100th time he’s given a speech that has already failed 99 times. But attacking Fox News by name is just another example of the smallness of a man who seems to delight in making his office smaller in the eyes of the country and his country smaller in the eyes of the world.

14301	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/23/Exclusive-McConnell-Cornyn-whipping-votes-against-Ted-Cruz	News	1	Healthcare	None	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"

A source in Congress tells Breitbart News that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn are using their leadership positions to pressure other Republicans to oppose Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in his campaign to defund Obamacare. 
“Right now in the Senate, Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn are actively whipping Senators to shut down debate on the House continuing resolution so that Harry Reid can gut it with just 51 votes,” a senior congressional staffer with intimate knowledge of the situation said in an email to Breitbart News. “Unbelievably, they actually are leading the fight to fully fund Obamacare.”
McConnell and Cornyn stated earlier Monday that they oppose a possible filibuster from Cruz to keep Reid from adding language funding the Affordable Care Act to the continuing resolution passed by the House of Representatives.


As Breitbart News reported on Saturday, McConnell and Cornyn could help Cruz win:


First, when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid brings the House continuing resolution (CR) to the floor next week, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell needs to deliver 41 Republican votes to filibuster it until Senator Reid agrees not to try and restore funding for Obamacare. McConnell has the power to ensure that Reid cannot get an amendment onto the bill that strips the Obamacare defunding language with a simple majority vote. As Breitbart News laid out on Friday, McConnell has closed down one pathway that Reid could use:  

If [Reid] introduces an amendment before the Senate votes on cloture for the House CR[, t]hat would require a 60-vote threshold, and McConnell’s spokesman Don Stewart told Breitbart News that if Reid attempted that tactic, all Senate Republicans would stand together to block it.

However, a major avenue is still open through which Reid can get the amendment onto the bill with a simple majority. If McConnell decides Obamacare is worth fighting in earnest on must-pass legislation (ie non-symbolic votes), then he will deliver the 41 necessary votes to filibuster until Reid is forced to agree to a clean up-or-down Senate floor vote on the Obamacare defunding CR the House just passed. There is something McConnell can do using his power that could accomplish this: Filibuster the House CR until there is a unanimous consent agreement that any amendments added to it after cloture is invoked would also each require a 60-vote threshold. The power rests now with McConnell. Delivering the 41 votes is essential to help Ted Cruz.

Instead of helping Cruz with their power as Senate GOP leaders, McConnell and Cornyn are working against him, this senior staffer said. But in the end, they will try to make it appear as though they do not support funding Obamacare by voting against Reid’s amendment after allowing Reid to implement it. “Once it’s a 51-vote threshold, both McConnell and Cornyn will hide behind a ‘no’ vote on Reid’s amendment–so they will have yet another show vote,” the staffer said.
“To be clear, nobody is fighting harder to make sure Obamacare is funded than Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn,” the senior staffer added.

A New York Times investigative article based on two dozen interviews with industry insiders and confidential Obama Administration documents reveals that the catastrophic $500 million Obamacare rollout “has deeply embarrassed the White House” and has the technology companies involved “publicly distancing themselves” from the Obamacare fiasco. 
“These are not glitches. The extent of the problems is pretty enormous,” an insurance executive who participated in Obamacare conference calls told the Times. “At the end of our calls, people say, ‘It’s awful, just awful.'” 
The Times says those closest to the three-and-a-half year-long building of Obamacare, like embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, ignored or quashed the myriad warning bells sounding all around them. On Tuesday, the Republican National Committee released a #FireSebelius web ad calling for Sebelius’s ousting. 



“We foresee a train wreck,” one insurance executive working on Obamacare IT said in February. “We don’t have the IT specifications. The level of angst in health plans is growing by leaps and bounds. The political people in the administration do not understand how far behind they are.” 
The comments mirror those made in April by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) who helped craft Obamacare. At the time, Baucus said Obamacare was “a huge train wreck coming down.”  

Now, the companies that bagged millions to build the Obamacare digital architecture are scurrying to avoid public ridicule and scrutiny. “Worried about their reputations, contractors are now publicly distancing themselves from the troubled parts of the federally run project,” reports the Times. 
Development Seed President Eric Gundersen told the Times his company built the busted HealthCare.org website but “had nothing to do with what happened after a user hit the ‘Apply Now’ button.”
Oracle, which was subcontracted to handle identity management software used in the Obamacare registration process, claims its services are running swimmingly. “Our software is running properly,” said Oracle communications vice president Deborah Hellinger.
One of Obamacare’s biggest winners of taxpayer dollars has been CGI Group. Washington Examiner reporter Richard Pollock says that the U.S. subsidiary of Canadian company CGI (which stands for “Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique”) Group, CGI Federal, received a no-bid sweetheart contract worth $93 million. Since 2009, CGI has scored $678 million in taxpayer money for 185 separate task orders. 
Even progressive Democrats are now blasting Obamacare’s failures. 
Former Obama White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs says President Barack Obama should fire those responsible for the “excruciatingly embarrassing” Obamacare rollout. 
Progressive Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein, a strong Obamacare supporter, wrote on Monday that “So far, the Affordable Care Act’s launch has been a failure. Not ‘troubled.’ Not ‘glitchy.’ A failure.” 
Obamacare will cost taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years.

On Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney tried to dismiss a shocking Government Accountability Institute (GAI) report that found President Barack Obama had only a single face-to-face meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since Obamacare was signed over three years ago. 
When asked whether the nonpartisan GAI report shows a deficiency in Obama’s “leadership skills” during his White House press briefing, Carney alleged that “cabinet secretaries don’t regularly get entered into the visitor’s logs” and alleged that Obama meets “frequently” and “regularly” with Sebelius. 
As Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer noted on Fox News’s Hannity on Wednesday, though, GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.


The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was, though, “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”
According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”
As Breitbart News has reported, GAI “recorded listings as they were contained on the White House and Politico presidential calendars; other forms of communications, such as private emails or phone calls, are not able to be quantified.” They also examined public records on Politico’s White House schedule 

Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare
“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday.

In a piece he wrote for Politico on Thursday, Schweizer mentioned that “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” He also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors, and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”
On Fox & Friends on Friday, Schweizer emphasized that ignorance should never be an excuse for a leader. 
“If you’re an executive you need to know for sure–for darn sure–that the rollout is going to work and it’s going to go well,” Schweizer said. “And it’s really incumbent upon a president to contact the people that are involved in this initiative.”
That is not the case with Obama, Schweizer noted, particularly because Obama’s top advisers like Valerie Jarrett “don’t challenge” Obama’s weaknesses and “reinforce this notion that he is so brilliant.” 
Schweizer said presidents consult their top advisers in times of war and peace and that “there’s just simply no excuse for him to be this detached on this important piece of legislation which is reorienting one-sixth of the national economy.”

At the beginning of 2013, Obama and his Democrat party were in firm control of the nation’s political terrain. Obama had won a convincing reelection by again boosting turnout of his young and minority voter base. Contrary to expectations, the Democrats gained two seats in the Senate, extending their control of the chamber, and made modest gains in the House. The Republicans, after squandered an almost unprecedented opportunity, were have something of an existential crisis. What a difference a year makes. 
Not only did 2013 see a resurgence of the Republican party, it provided a number of political surprises throughout the year. The following were the biggest surprises of the year. 
5. The Collapse of Marco Rubio


At the beginning of the year, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) seemed the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in 2016. A poll of Iowa Republicans in January showed him with a commanding lead with a crowded field, running ahead of his closest competitor, Rep. Paul Ryan, by over eight points. In December, however, Rubio polled 8th in Iowa, garnering support from just 6% of Republicans in the state. In national polls, he polls around 6th place. It is a breathtaking political collapse. 
Rubio’s political fortunes were reversed by a fundamental misreading of the electorate on immigration reform. There is a robust case to be made for reforming our nation’s immigration system. The approach adopted by the Senate and promoted by Rubio, however, is arguably worse than the current system. It provides immediate legalization for 11 million illegal immigrants and effectively does almost nothing to secure the border. Even the modest security provisions in the bill would likely be ignored by the Obama Administration, which has ignored existing Congressional directives related to the border. 
Like amnesty legislation in 1986, it provides legalization with a promise of security that will likely never materialize. Also like the deal in 1986, it will likely provide an incentive for even greater illegal immigration in the future. The GOP establishment and its business allies may still approve immigration reform in 2014, but Rubio’s political standing is unlikely to return.  

4. The ObamaCare Rollout Disaster
I always expected ObamaCare to ultimately be a failure. I did not anticipate, however, the smoldering wreckage that was its rollout. The government simply had to build a website with no more complexity than Amazon or any other e-commerce site. It also had hundreds of millions of dollars and three years to build it. Even the government didn’t seem incompetent enough to screw that up. 
Oh, but it did. 
Even more surprising was the very slow response of the Obama Administration to the obvious disaster. Subsequent reports have detailed several warnings to government officials that the website wasn’t ready to launch, wasn’t secure, and wasn’t even accessible. Did no one take these remotely seriously? Did they think unicorns and pixie dust would mask these failures?
In October, in the aftermath of the government shutdown, Democrats led the generic congressional ballot by eight points. In the wake of the ObamaCare rollout disaster, Republicans have gained an unprecedented 13 points and now lead Democrats by 5. 

3. The GOP’s War on Its Base 
Inexplicably, the Republican party establishment reacted to its defeats in 2012 by declaring war on its base, conservative voters. Party officials and strategists blamed their defeat on the “tea party” and conservatives, who presumably turned off more “moderate” voters. The problem with this narrative is that the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, won Independents by five points. Republicans lost because the Democrats did a better job turning out their base voters. For the past two elections, the GOP has given its nomination to the most “moderate” candidate running. It is clearly not a recipe for success. 

In the past few years, there have been some candidates with strong tea party backing who in the end were flawed. There have been far more “establishment” candidates who also lost. Todd Aiken won the GOP primary in Missouri because the tea party was divided between two other candidates. Richard Lugar had the edge over eventual nominee Richard Mourdock, until it was revealed that Lugar didn’t have an actual residence in his state. At least make a pretense of representing a state. At least six “establishment” and “electable” Senate candidates, enough to secure a majority, went down to defeat in 2012.
The party and its business allies, however, have vowed to challenge conservatives in primaries next year. The GOP establishment will no doubt be able to raise millions to wage this pyrrhic war, but it is hard to see how it will have the “boots on the ground” to win elections. It may very well spark its own destruction as a national political force. 
2. Obama’s Irrelevance 

Congress ended its year passing the first budget agreement in five years. Most surprising, though, is that it accomplished this because Obama wasn’t part of the negotiations. The Democrats’ lead negotiator, Sen. Patty Murray, intentionally kept the White House out of the talks. 
It was a dramatic turn around for a President who won a solid reelection just a year ago. At the start of 2013, Obama’s approval rating was nearly 60%. By a combination of political miscalculation and detachment, Obama has squandered all the political capital he won through his reelection. 
He has made high-profile pushes for gun control, immigration reform, climate change and a higher minimum wage. Progress on these issues is arguably harder now than it was before Obama made them priorities. 
In foreign policy, an area where second term presidents generally focus, Obama has led a withdrawal of the US from the world stage. America was a passive observer to the dramatic events in Egypt. Our absence allowed Russia to reassert its influence in the region for the first time in decades. China is expanding its influence throughout the world. Obama drew a line in the sand on Syria and then quickly retreated. His outreach to Iran has angered almost all of our allies. They don’t trust us and our enemies don’t fear us. 
1. Obama’s Political Resilience   
With his approval ratings at the lowest of his Presidency, it may seem counterintuitive to talk about Obama’s political resilience. Consider, however, what he has withstood this year. 
We have learned that the government is engaged in comprehensive surveillance of Americans. The NSA tracks our web activity and even keeps records on every phone call we make. Worse, the Administration has lied about its activities repeatedly. The government even targeted reporters it suspected of working with government whistleblowers. 
We also learned that the government was using the IRS to target its political opponents. This targeting went beyond supervision of tax-exempt groups and included audits of major Republican donors. When a cancer patient went public with the news that he was losing his health insurance as a result of ObamaCare, he quickly learned he was being audited by the IRS. 
PoliticFact names Obama’s oft repeated promise that people can keep their health insurance the “lie of the year.” Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance as a result of his signature legislative achievement. The cancellation of these policies and problems with the law’s implementation raise the real possibility that fewer Americans will have insurance when ObamaCare takes full effect on January 1st. 
I could literally run through a half-dozen more issues, any one of which would cripple most presidencies. That’s even before considering the anemic economic “recovery.” Obama does currently have the lowest approval rating of any 2-term President, at this point, since Richard Nixon. Still, between 40-42% of the public approves of the job he is doing. How is this even possible? 
The most surprising thing about 2013 is that Obama has absorbed more negative shocks than almost all modern-day presidents combined and yet is still supported by only a little less than half the public. Even his currently low approval ratings defy gravity. 
Something’s got to give next year.

A leading labor union boss delivered an impassioned rebuke of Obamacare at the AFL-CIO convention Thursday, telling attendees, “we’ll be damned if we’re going to lose our health insurance because of unintended consequences in the law!” 
Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA) President Terry O’Sullivan said, “if the Affordable Care Act is not fixed, and it destroys the health and welfare funds that we have all fought for and stand for, then I believe it needs to be repealed. We don’t want it repealed. We want it fixed, fixed, fixed.” 
O’Sullivan added: “We can’t have the unintended consequences for the proud men and women that we represent to be collateral damage in the healthcare fight in this country.” 




Big Labor strongly backed Obamacare before its passage. Now unions say the law threatens to destroy union workers’ health insurance plans if changes are not made soon. 
Last week, the AFL-CIO passed a strongly-worded resolution blasting Obamacare despite the Obama Administration’s attempts to quell union opposition to aspects of the government healthcare overhaul.
O’Sullivan, borrowing from Vice President Joe Biden’s vulgar words whispered to President Barack Obama upon signing the bill, told the audience, “It’s going to be a big frickin’ deal if our members lose our health insurance!” 
Republicans say union members should not be granted special breaks for the Obamacare law they fought to see pass. Sen. John Thune (R-SD) introduced a bill Monday called the Union Bailout Prevention Act to stop the White House from granting unions Obamacare waivers or special taxpayer-funded premium tax subsidies.
“Despite championing ObamaCare’s passage in 2010, union leaders are now awaking to the ugly reality of ObamaCare that most Americans have predicted all along, including higher health care costs,” said Thune. “Now that the full consequences of the Democrats’ law are nearing, these same union leaders are seeking a special backroom deal from the White House.” 
Obamacare’s government healthcare exchanges open in 17 days.

Americans who are fed up with Obamacare won a victory yesterday. The House voted to defund Obamacare while still funding the federal government to avoid a “devastating” shutdown. (I shall not digress, but it’s beyond distressing to hear liberals try to convince Americans that any government slowdown is comparable to “terrorism.”) 
Now the battle goes to the Senate, and we’ll find out if Harry Reid is so committed to the horrendous “Un-affordable Care Act” that he’ll be the one to shut down the government to fund the unworkable Obamacare.


Let’s be clear. Republicans in Congress aren’t advocating a government shutdown. That’s why they voted in the House to fully fund our bureaucracy while defunding Obamacare. The conservatives in Congress are listening to the majority of Americans who do not want Obamacare.
Following the will of the people is apparently a novel idea in D.C. these days. Just ask Senator Ted Cruz and his liberty-loving posse on Capitol Hill who have led the charge to defund Obama’s train wreck.
Those of us who hang in there supporting a major political party with our energy, time, and contributions would like to believe that that party would praise principled conservatives like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee for following through on campaign promises. We’d like to believe that the GOP establishment would applaud the way these bold leaders have rallied the grassroots to their cause. But, no, such praise would require a commensurate level of guts and leadership, and the permanent political class in D.C. is nothing if not gutless and rudderless. 

We’re now, once again, subjected to the “anonymous sources” backstabbing game. The Capitol Hill cowards are rushing to anonymously denounce Senator Cruz to any reporter with a pad and pen.
Welcome to our world, Ted. The same people have been denouncing conservatives like me for years (right after they ask for help fundraising for themselves or endorsing the latest candidate they’ve suckered into paying their exorbitant consulting fees). We can compare shiv marks next time we meet, my friend.
If the Senate doesn’t get behind Ted Cruz’s efforts to defund Obamacare, it won’t be because of any failure on Ted’s part. It’ll be because there weren’t enough principled leaders to stand with him, and that would be a tragic loss, not for Ted, but for America.
More and more Americans are waking up to the nightmare of Obamacare as its rollout continues. Hardworking families are losing their employer-provided health care coverage. Businesses are cutting back their employees’ hours to skirt Obamacare’s mandates. Americans barely scrapping by are discovering that Obamacare has made health care completely unaffordable. Those who aren’t part of a protected special interest group have been left in the cold. 
When you’re living on a fixed income, having to pay hundreds of dollars more each month for health care will cut into your ability to pay for basic necessities like food, electricity, or gas (which has increased 90% under Obama). Open your eyes, America. When the full reality of Obamacare strikes home, we’ll thank God that principled leaders like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee took a stand to stop it in its tracks.

But the permanent political class is handwringing and howling that if there’s a government shutdown the media will blame Republicans for it. Here’s a little newsflash, GOP establishment: Whenever anything bad happens, the media blames Republicans for it. That’s not an excuse to roll over and play dead. It’s a call to follow the advice I give my daughters: Woman up, stand your ground, and fight like a girl!
I want no pity. I need no empathy. But use me as a barometer. Over the years, the leftwing media has falsely and irrationally accused me of everything from faking a pregnancy to abetting murder. They lie. Deal with it.
Republicans in Congress support funding the government. If the Democrats block these funding measures, a government shutdown is on them. In the meantime, stop the ridiculous hysterics. Heck, about the most significant thing that happened during the last government shutdown was Clinton hooked up with Monica.
As I said in my speech at CPAC this year, it’s time for the Senate to put itself on Cruz Control.
Ignore the peanut gallery pundits. They’ve written my political obituary so many times, I’m practically Lazarus. Now they’re trying to destroy Ted Cruz. Good luck with that, you weasels. Texans are just as tough as Alaskans. Smaller, but just as tough.
But here’s the important thing that none of these establishment backstabbers understand. It’s not the messenger that matters. It’s the message. You can try to take out someone like Ted Cruz, but that won’t stop the message from catching fire. The message is liberty, and it’s been resounding ever since a band of patriots dumped tea in Boston harbor.
The message only grows stronger. The grassroots is bigger than any one person. We the People will rise up, and we will make our voices heard. Right now, Ted Cruz is speaking for us in this Obamacare fight. God bless him for it.
Hang in there, Ted and Mike. You have millions of supporters among ordinary hardworking Americans. We support you because you don’t shy away from the fray. May your colleagues in the Senate gain the wisdom to support your excellent efforts so that you can see that the view is better from inside the bus than under it.
Oh, and a little reminder to Republican senators up for re-election in 2014: Moose season ends soon, allowing more time on one’s hands. So, we’ll be watching your votes very carefully this week.

A simple fact is missing from all the media hysteria and political establishment temper tantrums over Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee’s attempt to defund Obamacare.
Americans are getting slammed by Obamacare right now. Workforces are decimated as health care prices rise. Public opinion is on our side. If now was not the time to unite and fight it, when was? Those who are attacking Cruz and Lee’s efforts have forgotten how negotiations are won. 


Use as an example the negotiations a governor of energy-rich Alaska must engage in with powerful multinational oil tycoons. In my experience, I found that the key to achieving success for the people you’re elected to serve is to take a firm position, stand solid, and negotiate from there when the other guy is ready to take you seriously. You fight as hard as you can with whatever small edge you’ve got until the other guy respects you enough to wise up, sit down, and come to a mutually acceptable agreement. You get nothing at all if you preemptively surrender before the battle even commences.
Imagine how much stronger the GOP’s hand would have been if every Republican (and those Democrats who’ve finally admitted Obamacare’s devastating flaws) stood together against cloture in order to prevent Harry Reid from cutting off debate and stripping Obamacare defunding from the bill?
Not only would there have been pressure on red state Democrats up for re-election to join the right cause, there would have been pressure on Reid and the White House to negotiate agreements. Even if the GOP couldn’t have defunded all of Obamacare, they could have negotiated some relief for average Americans who now feel they can do nothing but brace for the coming train wreck. We average Americans know we’ll never get the exemptions and favors Obama gave his political cronies and Congress, but any relief for the middle class would have been welcomed. 

But Republicans got nothing from squabbling with each other and denouncing (on and off the record) the brave men who tried to do something.
Ted Cruz and Mike Lee fought to fulfill the campaign promises every Republican made, and their actions have been revelatory for all of us.
Hunters know what flushing dogs do. Cruz and Lee were acting as the grassroots’ flushing dogs. Their actions showed us who was willing to stand up for hard working Americans and who wasn’t. We thank Senators Vitter, Paul, Crapo, Enzi, Fischer, Roberts, Scott, Heller, Grassley, Toomey, Moran, Rubio, Shelby, Risch, Inhofe, Portman, and Sessions for standing with Cruz and Lee.
In 2010, a galvanized grassroots rallied against Obamacare to carry Republicans to victory. But in 2012, many in the grassroots stayed home, and we saw how that turned out for the GOP.
Unfortunately, the message of some politicians today seems to be: “Whoopsie, seems I can’t fulfill my election promises, but vote for me again and I promise to do what I promised last time.”
Sorry, that doesn’t cut it. America, you deserve better. If they can’t do anything with the power you gave them through their elected office, then you deserve someone else to give it a try.
2014 is just around the corner, and we’re ready for it. Support those who do us a favor by flushing out politicians wanting to hide. Retrieving liberty must be the point in all this.

To the average American, ObamaCare is part web site disaster, part shattered campaign promise writ very, very large.
Millions of Americans have already been forced out of their existing health care policies, a number that may skyrocket in the new year.


Russell Simmons sees it differently.

The hip-hop mogul says ObamaCare is already so successful it’s saved thousands, if not millions of lives.
Yes, we initially wanted single payer, and we had to compromise back in 2009 for the Affordable Care Act. But, it is a damn good piece of legislation that has already saved hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives. So, let us not give up now.
Simmons blasted the 39 house Democrats who voted in favor of tweaking ObamaCare, but he saved his harshest words for the GOP in toto.

I know where Republicans stand. They have voted 47 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, so their stance is clear. If you get sick, you’re on your own. If you can’t pay for your medical expenses, declare bankruptcy. If you have a pre-existing condition, they’ll send you a get well card when you’re on your death-bed. Whatever President Obama stands for, they stand for the opposite. Even if it goes against every principle they have advocated for in the past, they would rather destroy our country, than see President Obama pass policy that is good for ALL Americans.

As for the millions who already lost their health care plan thanks to ObamaCare’s arrival, Simmons says they should simply say, “good riddance.” He simply knows better than you. Period.

And please don’t tell me this about people whose healthcare was canceled…because that healthcare is predatory and it is unconscionable that we would allow anyone in this country to own such policies.

Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), chair of the House Budget Committee, told conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes Monday morning that House Republicans had demanded a one-year delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, along with an end to congressional exemptions, while offering a six-week debt ceiling hike to allow room for negotiations on broader budget issues. The offer was made to President Barack Obama last Thursday.
President Obama, said Ryan, listened but declined to respond. In the meantime, Ryan said, it became clear the president was negotiating separately to obtain more favorable terms from Senate Republicans, trying to “jam” the House Republicans in the process. Ryan told Sykes that Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had “overplayed their hand” in attempting to prolong the crisis to maximize political damage to Republicans.


Ryan described the delay to the individual mandate as an “obvious” step to take, given that technical issues with the Obamacare exchanges might prevent the mandate from being enforced at all. “We could have spent the weekend putting an agreement together that says we’re gonna deal with the debt, we’re gonna deal with this economy, and we’re gonna fix these big flaws in Obamacare, or at least give people delays in these penalties.”

Instead, he said, the President and his party had declined, believing that they had a “partisan advantage.” In response to new demands from Democrats to cancel the sequester cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011, Ryan declared: “We are not going to give on these spending numbers.” He said that there were some areas of agreement on changes to entitlements, but that Democrats wanted to spend more money and preserve Obamacare.
Ryan said that he believed the strategy of attempting to defund Obamacare had been a mistake, because the government shutdown would not have prevented Obamacare from being implemented. “It’s an autopilot spending program,” he said, saying that the idea Obamacare could be defunded was a “false impression.” He added, however, that the focus needed to shift to the damage Obamacare was causing to consumers and the economy.
“I do believe that we can still get some changes made to Obamacare that help provide some relief to working Americans,” Ryan said. He was optimistic that the House would craft a workable plan for avoiding default following a meeting of the GOP caucus on Monday evening. “I didn’t go to Congress to kick the can,” he said, noting that his biggest fear was that “a handful of Republicans” in the Senate would join Democrats to “jam” the House.

If there is at least one benefit of ObamaCare it is watching those who supported nationalizing the purchase of mandated health insurance get their comeuppance. The New York Times reports that “many in New York’s professional and cultural elite” who supported Obama and ObamaCare, and carved themselves out a sweet little health insurance pool “to avoid the sky-high rates in New York’s individual insurance market,” are now out in the cold with the rest of us:
[U]nder the Affordable Care Act, they will be treated as individuals, responsible for their own insurance policies. For many of them, that is likely to mean they will no longer have access to a wide network of doctors and a range of plans tailored to their needs. And many of them are finding that if they want to keep their premiums from rising, they will have to accept higher deductible and co-pay costs or inferior coverage. 


The anguish these elite Obama supporters are going through is no different than those 5.9 million in the real world victimized by insurance cancelations: Stress, sleepless nights, financial burden, and the loss of familiar doctors and hospitals. “We are Obama’s people,” said one author. Today her insurance has been canceled and her doctors are not available through the exchanges. And she is not alone. Take Barbara Meinwald, a solo practitioner lawyer in Manhattan. “I couldn’t sleep because of it,” she said.
Ms. Meinwald, 61, has been paying $10,000 a year for her insurance through the New York City Bar. A broker told her that a new temporary plan with fewer doctors would cost $5,000 more, after factoring in the cost of her medications.
Ms. Meinwald also looked on the state’s health insurance exchange. But she said she found that those plans did not have a good choice of doctors, and that it was hard to even find out who the doctors were, and which hospitals were covered. “It’s like you’re blindfolded and you’re told that you have to buy something,” she said. …

Meinwald now says that had she known this would happen, she would have voted for Mitt Romney. 
[M]any professionals make too much money to qualify for the subsidies, and even if they are able to find comparably priced insurance, the new policies do not have the coverage they are accustomed to.
According to the Kaiser Foundation, these people were intentionally screwed. Although their policies did meet the minimum ObamaCare coverage standards, The Times reports, the policies were still canceled as a way “to prevent associations from selling insurance to healthy members who are needed to keep the new health exchanges financially viable.”
If only the same thing would happen to the elite media, we might actually get somewhere in repealing a boondoggle that is victimizing millions in the working and middle class only to benefit a few thousand.

CNS News is reporting that a group of 21 House members have sent a letter to all GOP Senators, warning them against a cloture vote on the Continuing Resolution. A vote on cloture would give Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) the ability to remove the defunding Obamacare provision included in the CR. The House conservatives who signed the letter stated that they consider a cloture vote the same as a vote in support of Obamacare. 

“it is highly likely that Majority Leader Harry Reid will move to amend the House-passed CR and remove the language from the bill that defunds Obamacare before sending it back to the House.
“As you are also aware,” the conservatives wrote, “such a motion can only proceed if three-fifths of the Senate invokes cloture and allows this amendment process to begin. Simply put, the only chance that Senator Reid has to pursue this course of action is if six or more Republican Senators join the Democrats in voting to invoke cloture.
“Therefore,” the House conservatives said to every Republican senator, “it shall be our policy to regard any cloture vote that gives Senator Reid a green light to reinstate Obamacare into this CR the same as a vote for Obamacare itself.” 

The cloture vote will come today and requires 60 votes. It will allow debate to end on the Continuing Resolution and proceed to toward a final vote. Reid controls 54 votes, while the GOP has 46 so should the Senate GOP stand together the cloture vote would be stalled. According to Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK), who authored the letter, “until Harry Reid guarantees a 60-vote threshold on any amendment including his amendment to add back Obamacare” the Senate GOP should vote against cloture. Otherwise a simple majority of the Senate could vote to continue Obamacare funding. 


It is unlikely Reid would use the Senate rule requiring 60 votes on amendments to the CR.

Signers of the letter include: Dave Schweikert (R.-AZ),  Charles Boustany, M.D. (R.-LA ), John Culberson (R.-TX ), Steve King (R.-IA), Ted Yoho DVM (R.-FL ), Thomas Massie (R.-KY), Lynn Westmoreland (R.- GA), Jack Kingston (R.-GA), Jeff Duncan (R.-SC), Paul Broun M.D. (R.-GA ), Ron DeSantis (R.-FL), Michele Bachmann (R.-MN), Matt Salmon (R.-AZ), Steve Stockman (R.-TX), Louie Gohmert (R.-TX), Walter Jones (R.-NC), Scott Garrett (R.-NJ), Scott Perry (R.-PA), Mark Meadows (R.-NC), Tim Huelskamp (R.-KS).

More and more Americans are beginning to realize that they were sold Obamacare on false pretenses. What they are getting in the mail isn’t what they ordered. 
Those responsible for saddling the country with this law, including the law’s chief salesman, President Obama, are scrambling to dodge the hammer of growing public resentment over the bill of goods that they have sold the American people. They are coming up with “fixes”, but I caution the buyer, beware. 


The president, along with members of his party who are facing elections soon, are busy campaigning for proposals they say do what these architects of the law promised in the first place. But folks should think carefully about relying on the same people who repeatedly promised one thing and delivered something far different. Consumers who liked their health care plans are being forced to give them up. People who were told they would pay less for health care will be paying more. Even fans of Obamacare are upset with an archaic, ready-fire-aim website that took years and millions of dollars to develop, but, to put it mildly, is failing miserably. Will Americans again put their faith in the leaders who said the law had to be passed before it was understood? They shouldn’t.

In 2010 on the Senate floor, I warned that rules published in the Federal Register would guarantee that people who liked their health care would lose it. I warned that health care costs would go up. I warned that employers would be forced to cut back worker hours and jobs. I did more than warn this would happen, I offered senators a chance to prevent these calamities. Proponents of Obamacare rejected and ridiculed my legislation. 
These same folks now, fighting for their political lives, are offering patches for their program and excuses for why it isn’t working. However, these folks are the same people who created the problems in the first place. They simply don’t want you to be able to choose the health insurance you want unless it’s health insurance they think you should have. They never did. Their plan was and is for policy makers in Washington to make what the experts believe are the best choices for you. 
The Washington Post reported recently that the president said his administration could not in good faith allow people with inferior insurance plans to keep them. That’s not what he said dozens of times before the law passed and it doesn’t sound like a person ready to fix a problem. This isn’t about a fumbled roll-out or a computer glitch. This law’s problems are inherent within it. The way to get our country out of this bad situation is with the earnest help of people who recognize the benefit of individuals being able to make their own choices. 
I’m a cosponsor of Senator Ron Johnson’s (R-Wis.) “If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep it Act”. The House passed a bill that would allow insurers to continue offering policies that don’t meet the expensive Obamacare mandates. So far we haven’t received much positive feedback from the president or majority in the Senate. Instead, the president announced another exception to a law that is already riddled with them, while the Senate majority proposes more federal mandates to “fix” the mandates they already have imposed on America. But as the Wall Street Journal has pointed out, there is a real difference between letting people keep their plans by unshackling them from federal rules and working with state frameworks versus forcing insurers to comply with more new requirements.
My dad used to say that if you keep on doing what you’ve been doing you are going to end up with what you’ve got. I’ve heard the Senate majority leader say the definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Unless people demand a new approach to health care — bona-fide inclusion of ideas from those who want a new approach — then we’re going to end up with what we have now: broken promises. We can do better.

Health care wonks are crowing about a “November surge” in enrollment. Will the November surge will be able to make up for the October purge, i.e. the millions who were dropped from existing plans because of Obamacare’s new minimum standards for coverage? In California, there is reason to think it may not.
In a piece posted at Wonkblog Friday, author Sarah Kliff introduced the term  “November surge” into the discussion of enrollment figures. According to Kliff, the uptick in enrollment, especially in California, is reason for optimism:

Some state-based marketplaces had a pretty smooth launch, and are seeing the pace of enrollment speed up daily. California has lead [led] the bunch; the state’s enrollments have grownsteadily in November and now account for nearly a full third of allhealth law sign-ups. The state has had its strongest two weeks ofenrollment this month.

The enrollment surge in California, and the idea that it was part of a broader pattern, was first reported by LA Times health writer Noam Levey a week ago. Levey’s piece was widely quoted, including by Sarah Kliff, but his claims did not stand up to much scrutiny. For instance, Levey claimed that Kentucky was “outpacing” its enrollment estimates. A spokesperson for the state says no such estimates exist. 


Both Levey and Kliff fail to ask the most important question. How soon will current enrollment trends balance out the number of people who have been dropped from their insurance as a result of Obamacare grandfathering regulations? In other words, can a November surge make up for the October purge?

Health insurance expert Bob Laszewski suggests California has a long way to go before the net enrollment shows a gain. He lays out the figures in a post published Monday:

California has 5.3 million uninsured eligible to buy in the exchange with half estimated to be subsidy eligible.
California is cancelling another 1.1 million people of which Covered    California has estimated 510,000 qualify for a subsidy they can only    get if they go to Covered California. At least 80% need to act by    December 23 to avoid losing their coverage.
The state is spending $250 million in federal money to get people signed up–dramatically more than any other state. 
The Covered California goal is to sign-up 500,000 to 700,000 subsidy eligible people by March 31.

Laszewski concludes “Looking at these numbers, if they don’t have well more than 500,000people signed up by December 31, I would have to think the number ofuninsured in California would have grown.”
Any fair accounting of the enrollment figures needs to keep in mind the number of people who–contrary to the President’s oft-repeated promise–have been kicked off plans they had. In California the enrollment figures for November have improved but they are still a long way from bringing the state back to where it was before the cancellation notices went out.

With Obamacare coverage beginning in earnest on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reports that thousands of people for which Obamacare plans will block some health care access are rushing to get medical tests and procedures done before their pre-ACA coverage is eliminated.
Those who were receiving medical care before being forced to sign up to a new plan on HealthCare.gov will, in many cases, be locked out of hospitals and prevented from seeing doctors who they had typically used. The WSJ contends that about 70% of new plans are more restrictive in the range of doctors and hospitals available to patients than their predecessors. 
Fearing that the will be unable to use the doctors and hospitals they want with their new plans, doctors are reporting a massive uptick in the number of patients calling for preventative procedures or moving up their planned surgeries to prevent a disaster once Obamacare measures strike.


The paper explains that while supporters of the Affordable Care Act may argue that procedures will continue to be available, the plans severely curb access to certain doctors and hospitals, preventing patients from getting the level of care they are used to at their usual price. In particular, insurers now using the Obamacare system have begun to exclude major academic institutions from their coverage, as these compete with cheaper community hospitals ostensibly providing the same service. 

To prevent patients from spending more of their money on better care, the insurance plans simply eliminate the competition from coverage plans to the benefit of community hospitals. Many plans also require referrals to visit specialists, which would require someone already familiar with a long-time specialist to find a general practitioner to direct them to the doctor they wanted to see in the first place.
These changes will affect the roughly 2 million people that used HealthCare.gov or their state affiliates to buy new insurance. This number is about one million short of the goal the White House set for itself, the result of HealthCare.gov failing to work properly for months and many plans being simply unaffordable to most Americans once they managed to get on the website at all. The White House made an exception to the December deadline to sign up for insurance for those currently insured who have to go through the system, a “hardship” exception in which Obamacare itself is the hardship. 
According to a recent report by the New York Times, the hardest hit Americans are squarely in the middle class.
One professional interviewed by the Journal warned ominously not of the Americans rushing to have procedures done, but those that have no reason to need preventative care and will need it as they grow older. Those without this ability to rush due to their current good health will have a “rude awakening,” said James Conroy, chief health care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges. He warned that these people will likely be surprised at their limited new insurance when they finally need to rely on Obamacare for medical help.

Throughout the Obama administration, our dangerously incurious, acquiescent media have been collectively caught off guard by every White House scandal, from Benghazi to the IRS to “you can keep your insurance.” Each and every time, the media ignored conservatives who warned in advance of what was happening. But the next unexploded scandal — a nuclear bomb in ObamaCare — is an opportunity for the media to redeem itself.
Thursday, Forbes reported that the Obama administration knew in 2010 that by the time the dust settles, 93 million Americans will lose their insurance due to ObamaCare. This time, instead of being caught off guard and surprised by something that is an open secret, maybe the media can get ahead of this story before it is too late — if it isn’t already:


Section 1251 of the Affordable Care Act contains what’s called a “grandfather” provision that, in theory, allows people to keep their existing plans if they like them. But subsequent regulations from the Obama administration interpreted that provision so narrowly as to prevent most plans from gaining this protection.

“The Departments’ mid-range estimate is that 66 percent of small employer plans and 45 percent of large employer plans will relinquish their grandfather status by the end of 2013,” wrote the administration on page 34,552 of the Register. All in all, more than half of employer-sponsored plans will lose their “grandfather status” and get canceled. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 156 million Americans–more than half the population–was covered by employer-sponsored insurance in 2013.
Another 25 million people, according to the CBO, have “nongroup and other” forms of insurance; that is to say, they participate in the market for individually-purchased insurance. In this market, the administration projected that “40 to 67 percent” of individually-purchased plans would lose their Obamacare-sanctioned “grandfather status” and get canceled, solely due to the fact that there is a high turnover of participants and insurance arrangements in this market. (Plans purchased after March 23, 2010 do not benefit from the “grandfather” clause.) The real turnover rate would be higher, because plans can lose their grandfather status for a number of other reasons.
How many people are exposed to these problems? 60 percent of Americans have private-sector health insurance–precisely the number that Jay Carney dismissed. As to the number of people facing cancellations, 51 percent of the employer-based market plus 53.5 percent of the non-group market (the middle of the administration’s range) amounts to 93 million Americans.
Dear Media: This is science, math, and law. How about digging in a little bit on this one? Because it is coming and we all know it.

In a move sure to spark consternation inside the White House, Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA) sent a letter Tuesday to embattled Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius requesting she produce a list of the one-on-one meetings she and President Barack Obama allege to have held in the over three-and-a-half years leading up to Obamacare’s calamitous rollout–meetings that do not appear on the White House’s own official calendar. 
“I have been greatly concerned over the lack of transparency and disregard for straight answers,” says Gingrey in his letter to Sebelius. “The Government Accountability Institute reported this month that according to the White House calendar, you have only met with the President once at the White House since becoming Secretary. Yet the White House has disputed the account and claims that you have been briefing the President regularly.” 


Last week during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, Gingrey, a medical doctor, asked a flustered Sebelius how many one-on-one meetings she had with Obama. “A lot,” replied Sebelius. Gingrey then asked whether she could verify her statement. “I, I…,” Sebelius uttered while flailing her hands. The committee chair then announced that Gingrey’s time for questioning had expired. 
Gingrey says in his letter that the American people deserve to know “how the rollout of the healthcare law has been botched so badly, who in the administration knew what, and when officials received warnings of problems.”
Gingrey’s request to Sebelius comes on the heels of an explosive report and Politico Magazine article by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) that found the official White House calendar and the Politico presidential calendar do not record a single one-on-one meeting between the HHS chief and Obama since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010. Only once does Sebelius’s name appear–in a meeting that also included then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. Curiously, those same calendars record 277 private meetings between Obama and other Cabinet secretaries. 

Specifically, Gingrey says he wants Sebelius to answer the following questions: 

How many times have you met in-person with the president since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)?
How many meetings did you have with White House staffers to discuss ACA?
Were issues regarding implementation deadlines discussed? If so, what directions were given?
How many meetings did you have with White House, CMS, and other agency personnel to discuss ACA implementation?
When it became clear that the ACA would not be ready by October 1, who in the White House was briefed? When was he or she briefed? What were they told?
Specifically, did you meet with the president after you received the McKinsey briefing? If yes, did you inform him of the grave warnings outlined? If no, why not?  

Gingrey’s last question refers to a critical April 4, 2013 meeting wherein McKinsey & Co. consultants presented a 15-slide presentation to Sebelius and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner. The presentation cautioned that the ideal situation for the Obamacare website would include “end-to-end integrated operations and IT testing” and warned that there was “insufficient time and scope of end-to-end testing.” 
The Georgia congressman’s letter to Sebelius places the already beleaguered Obama Administration in a difficult and dangerous political quandary that could further erode the president’s already sinking trustworthiness and approval ratings. 
During his roundly-criticized November 14 press conference, Obama promised the American people that he was unaware of the HealthCare.gov problems until after the website was launched on October 1. But as GAI President Peter Schweizer pointed out in a Politico Magazine article, “If Obama and Sebelius worked together closely and regularly, why did the president publicly state he did not know about the problems with HealthCare.gov?” 
That unanswered question threatens to further unravel Obama’s tenuous standing with Independent voters who tend to base political preferences more on executive performance and leadership traits and less on ideological positions. 
Former counselor to four presidents from both parties David Gergen said on CNN that the GAI report and the White House’s refusal to turn over the dates of the alleged one-on-one meetings between Sebelius and Obama suggests that “there was no one in charge in the administration.”

“(Jenny) McCarthy’s views on vaccinations and autism aren’t just stupid, they are actually dangerous.” So says The Daily Beast in a hard-hitting analysis of the speculation that McCarthy, a former Playboy model, is set to replace Elisabeth Hasselbeck on ABC’s “The View.”
After wading through some gratuitous attacks on Hasselbeck for her conservative views, Tricia Romano then focuses squarely on McCarthy and her activism with regard to the scientifically dubious connections between autism and diet and vaccinations.  

Since 2007, McCarthy has been a vocal opponent of the chemicals in vaccinations,  credulously citing research (she’s neither a doctor nor a medical professional) and experiences with her autistic son as evidence. (It has also been reported that he may not even have autism, but Landau-Kleffner syndrome.)
She has promoted the idea that people are getting an outrageous number of vaccinations today compared with the 1970s or ’80s. According to the book, Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure, the amount has only doubled, from seven to 14, to include vaccinations for the flu, hepatitis, and chickenpox among others, in addition to the measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, and others that are standard.
McCarthy doesn’t let science and facts get in her way. She has written three books about the subject–Louder Than Words: A Mother’s Journey in Healing Autism, Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds, and Healing and Preventing Autism, which have all been New York Times bestsellers. She is the president of an autism organization, which is also averse to vaccination, called Generation Rescue.
When promoting one of her books, she told Oprah how she learned about autism: “The University of Google is where I got my degree from.”

McCarthy’s opinions on autism and suspected “causes” and “cures” have raised eyebrows in the past, including a legendary appearance on The Larry King Show in 2008.  “Give my son the measles! I’ll take that over autism any day,” she yelled at a pediatrician after calling America’s vaccination program “bulls**t.”


Many believe her stances on autism lead parents to have false hope for a “cure” rather than focusing parents on the path of accepting their child’s autism as a part of their unique personality, worthy of respect. They also say McCarthy’s pseudo-science distracts parents from seeking actual help in how to better communicate and interact with their autistic children. As Big Hollywood’s Dana Commandatore points out: 

Once again, we’ve learned that celebrities do not have the answers. Sure, they look good on camera and can deliver a line better than average folks, but they are missing out on something important in the case of autism. Parents don’t need pseudo science and anecdotes. They need real life experiences and tried and tested information. 

Others criticize the anti-vaccine rhetoric as being responsible for thousands of preventable illnesses and deaths. But, as the Daily Beast points out, McCarthy seems unfazed by the increase in diseases as a result of her efforts: 

To promote her book, she essentially suggested to Time magazine that it might be good for polio to reemerge so that people could ask for better, safer vaccines, passing the buck to the medical community, not the anti-vaccine community for the rise in previously suppressed diseases.
She told Time: “I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we’ll use it. It shouldn’t be polio versus autism.”

During a Thursday speech pitching a health care plan that seems to grow even more unpopular every time he pitches it, President Obama tore into Fox News by all-but accusing them of lying about the increased costs of health care under ObamaCare:
—



—
The president is lying though omission there. The argument that health care costs aren’t as high as the worst nightmare scenarios predicted does not mean costs are going down, even though that is what Obama is trying to hustle people into believing. The fact is, is that while pushing his health care plan, Obama promised premiums would go down for a family of four by at least $2400 per year. The reality, however, is that costs will increase by almost two times that amount. 

For example, while Obama pointed to a reduction in premiums in New York state, state officials in Ohio say the average premium proposal for individual coverage next year is up 88 percent from this year’s average price as reported by the Society of Actuaries. In Maryland, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield proposed a 25 percent increase in premiums next year, after first seeking a 50 percent increase. Final rates haven’t been determined in either state.                                 
The higher rates, supporters say, buy a health insurance system that guarantees access to coverage for everyone and improves benefits, such as requiring insurers to cover older children and outlawing lifetime spending limits on claims.
Obama did a good job injecting a little energy into the 100th time he’s given a speech that has already failed 99 times. But attacking Fox News by name is just another example of the smallness of a man who seems to delight in making his office smaller in the eyes of the country and his country smaller in the eyes of the world.

A bill that would allow non-physicians to perform abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy is awaiting signature by Gov. Jerry Brown of California by Sep. 30. The bill, AB 154, passed both houses of the state legislature with strong support from Planned Parenthood and pro-choice groups. Planned Parenthood stands to benefit most directly from the bill, as non-physician staff at its clinics would be able to obtain abortion licenses. 
One doctor–who identified himself as pro-choice–told Breitbart News that “the bill is a disaster since it sends us back 100 years to the problems of the complications from back-steet abortions.” The bill’s critics warn that the training provided to non-physician staff is weak, that supervision by physicians in clinics will be minimal, and that there is real risk of injury or death to women who will be treated in such conditions.
The California Medical Association has endorsed AB 154 because of “provisions for training in the bill and the amendments that clarify physician supervision.” Yet the training is to be provided by the Board of Registered Nursing, not by physicians, and the protocols for defining “supervision” have not been specified. There is nothing in the legislation requiring a physician to be present or on-site during an abortion.


The bill permits licensed non-physicians to perform two kinds of abortion in the first trimester–by medication, and by aspiration, which requires the insertion of medical instruments into the uterus. Though many doctors agree that non-physicians could provide medications with few risks, the idea that a non-physician would perform an invasive procedure such as aspiration strikes many as rife with risks.

Debate about AB 154, which was introduced by California State Assembly Majority Leader Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), has been muted in a state that pro-choice advocates see as sympathetic to their cause. The Los Angeles Times came out strongly in favor of the measure in an editorial on September 3, arguing that it does not pose safety risks and that it could increase access to abortion services for women early in pregnancy:

In underserved urban areas, women face delays in getting medical appointments at clinics. When a woman can’t get an abortion in the first trimester, she may end up getting one in the later stages of pregnancy, which can mean a more complicated and more expensive abortion.

Advocates of AB 154 also argue that other states have allowed non-physicians to perform abortions safely, including in Planned Parenthood clinics.
Opponents describe AB 154 as an effort by Planned Parenthood and other groups to profit from Obamacare, since the legislation will expand the number of patients eligible for the state Medi-Cal program, and Medi-Cal pays for abortion. They also dispute assurances about the bill’s safety for women, arguing that there has been inadequate monitoring of California abortion clinics even prior to the passage of the new legislation.

With Obamacare coverage beginning in earnest on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reports that thousands of people for which Obamacare plans will block some health care access are rushing to get medical tests and procedures done before their pre-ACA coverage is eliminated.
Those who were receiving medical care before being forced to sign up to a new plan on HealthCare.gov will, in many cases, be locked out of hospitals and prevented from seeing doctors who they had typically used. The WSJ contends that about 70% of new plans are more restrictive in the range of doctors and hospitals available to patients than their predecessors. 
Fearing that the will be unable to use the doctors and hospitals they want with their new plans, doctors are reporting a massive uptick in the number of patients calling for preventative procedures or moving up their planned surgeries to prevent a disaster once Obamacare measures strike.


The paper explains that while supporters of the Affordable Care Act may argue that procedures will continue to be available, the plans severely curb access to certain doctors and hospitals, preventing patients from getting the level of care they are used to at their usual price. In particular, insurers now using the Obamacare system have begun to exclude major academic institutions from their coverage, as these compete with cheaper community hospitals ostensibly providing the same service. 

To prevent patients from spending more of their money on better care, the insurance plans simply eliminate the competition from coverage plans to the benefit of community hospitals. Many plans also require referrals to visit specialists, which would require someone already familiar with a long-time specialist to find a general practitioner to direct them to the doctor they wanted to see in the first place.
These changes will affect the roughly 2 million people that used HealthCare.gov or their state affiliates to buy new insurance. This number is about one million short of the goal the White House set for itself, the result of HealthCare.gov failing to work properly for months and many plans being simply unaffordable to most Americans once they managed to get on the website at all. The White House made an exception to the December deadline to sign up for insurance for those currently insured who have to go through the system, a “hardship” exception in which Obamacare itself is the hardship. 
According to a recent report by the New York Times, the hardest hit Americans are squarely in the middle class.
One professional interviewed by the Journal warned ominously not of the Americans rushing to have procedures done, but those that have no reason to need preventative care and will need it as they grow older. Those without this ability to rush due to their current good health will have a “rude awakening,” said James Conroy, chief health care officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges. He warned that these people will likely be surprised at their limited new insurance when they finally need to rely on Obamacare for medical help.

Americans who are fed up with Obamacare won a victory yesterday. The House voted to defund Obamacare while still funding the federal government to avoid a “devastating” shutdown. (I shall not digress, but it’s beyond distressing to hear liberals try to convince Americans that any government slowdown is comparable to “terrorism.”) 
Now the battle goes to the Senate, and we’ll find out if Harry Reid is so committed to the horrendous “Un-affordable Care Act” that he’ll be the one to shut down the government to fund the unworkable Obamacare.


Let’s be clear. Republicans in Congress aren’t advocating a government shutdown. That’s why they voted in the House to fully fund our bureaucracy while defunding Obamacare. The conservatives in Congress are listening to the majority of Americans who do not want Obamacare.
Following the will of the people is apparently a novel idea in D.C. these days. Just ask Senator Ted Cruz and his liberty-loving posse on Capitol Hill who have led the charge to defund Obama’s train wreck.
Those of us who hang in there supporting a major political party with our energy, time, and contributions would like to believe that that party would praise principled conservatives like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee for following through on campaign promises. We’d like to believe that the GOP establishment would applaud the way these bold leaders have rallied the grassroots to their cause. But, no, such praise would require a commensurate level of guts and leadership, and the permanent political class in D.C. is nothing if not gutless and rudderless. 

We’re now, once again, subjected to the “anonymous sources” backstabbing game. The Capitol Hill cowards are rushing to anonymously denounce Senator Cruz to any reporter with a pad and pen.
Welcome to our world, Ted. The same people have been denouncing conservatives like me for years (right after they ask for help fundraising for themselves or endorsing the latest candidate they’ve suckered into paying their exorbitant consulting fees). We can compare shiv marks next time we meet, my friend.
If the Senate doesn’t get behind Ted Cruz’s efforts to defund Obamacare, it won’t be because of any failure on Ted’s part. It’ll be because there weren’t enough principled leaders to stand with him, and that would be a tragic loss, not for Ted, but for America.
More and more Americans are waking up to the nightmare of Obamacare as its rollout continues. Hardworking families are losing their employer-provided health care coverage. Businesses are cutting back their employees’ hours to skirt Obamacare’s mandates. Americans barely scrapping by are discovering that Obamacare has made health care completely unaffordable. Those who aren’t part of a protected special interest group have been left in the cold. 
When you’re living on a fixed income, having to pay hundreds of dollars more each month for health care will cut into your ability to pay for basic necessities like food, electricity, or gas (which has increased 90% under Obama). Open your eyes, America. When the full reality of Obamacare strikes home, we’ll thank God that principled leaders like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee took a stand to stop it in its tracks.

But the permanent political class is handwringing and howling that if there’s a government shutdown the media will blame Republicans for it. Here’s a little newsflash, GOP establishment: Whenever anything bad happens, the media blames Republicans for it. That’s not an excuse to roll over and play dead. It’s a call to follow the advice I give my daughters: Woman up, stand your ground, and fight like a girl!
I want no pity. I need no empathy. But use me as a barometer. Over the years, the leftwing media has falsely and irrationally accused me of everything from faking a pregnancy to abetting murder. They lie. Deal with it.
Republicans in Congress support funding the government. If the Democrats block these funding measures, a government shutdown is on them. In the meantime, stop the ridiculous hysterics. Heck, about the most significant thing that happened during the last government shutdown was Clinton hooked up with Monica.
As I said in my speech at CPAC this year, it’s time for the Senate to put itself on Cruz Control.
Ignore the peanut gallery pundits. They’ve written my political obituary so many times, I’m practically Lazarus. Now they’re trying to destroy Ted Cruz. Good luck with that, you weasels. Texans are just as tough as Alaskans. Smaller, but just as tough.
But here’s the important thing that none of these establishment backstabbers understand. It’s not the messenger that matters. It’s the message. You can try to take out someone like Ted Cruz, but that won’t stop the message from catching fire. The message is liberty, and it’s been resounding ever since a band of patriots dumped tea in Boston harbor.
The message only grows stronger. The grassroots is bigger than any one person. We the People will rise up, and we will make our voices heard. Right now, Ted Cruz is speaking for us in this Obamacare fight. God bless him for it.
Hang in there, Ted and Mike. You have millions of supporters among ordinary hardworking Americans. We support you because you don’t shy away from the fray. May your colleagues in the Senate gain the wisdom to support your excellent efforts so that you can see that the view is better from inside the bus than under it.
Oh, and a little reminder to Republican senators up for re-election in 2014: Moose season ends soon, allowing more time on one’s hands. So, we’ll be watching your votes very carefully this week.

Most of the 41 workers at Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Michigan say Obamacare is exploding their premiums and destroying health care as they once knew it. 
“I feel like I’ve been taken to the cleaners,” salesman Neal Campbell told NBC News senior investigative reporter Lisa Myers in a Sunday report. Campbell, who has a wife and three children, says Obamacare is breeding resentment and anger. “We feel betrayed, lied to, and we’re pissed off.” 
“How is this helping the average American that’s working 40 to 50 hours per week?” asked salesperson Terry Hardcastle. “How are we supposed to live?” 


Cathy Smith agreed. “You don’t make that much money to begin with,” said Smith with tears in her eyes. “…the prescriptions are going to kill me.” 

Under Obamacare, the workers’ employer faced a 50% increase in costs to keep worker plans at the same benefit and deductible levels. To remain economically viable, the dealership decided to give each worker an extra $2,400 and let them find plans on their own. Small business insurance broker Michael Harp says it’s all part of the new Obamacare reality for small businesses and their workers: “The overwhelming majority, they’re paying much higher rates and they have lower benefits.” 
Service adviser Steve Williams said Obamacare has destroyed the era of affordable health care. 
“The days of low deductibles and all that stuff are gone,” Williams told NBC. “It’s not going to get any better. It’s just going to get worse.” 
The NBC News report comes as the Obama administration and its progressive allies are reportedly readying yet another public relations campaign in the hopes of resuscitating Obamacare’s lugubrious approval ratings. The administration’s media blitz will highlight the stories of people who scored taxpayer-funded Obamacare coverage. 
The strategy, however, risks further angering the millions of middle-class workers who lost their insurance coverage due to Obamacare or whose premiums and deductibles are soaring in order to pay for the very Obamacare “winners” the administration plans to highlight.
According to the latest CNN poll, Obamacare is at a record low 35% approval rating.

When Establishment Republicans and their Democrat comrades claim there is no path to victory in the fight to defund Obamacare, they are intentionally muddying the waters.  Do not confuse blundering political expedience with winning.
There is a clear path to victory and the folks comprising the new Republican leadership emerging in the House and Senate are smart enough and bold enough to take that path.


They’re playing to win and deserve our support.
Understanding the options available to these new leaders requires an understanding of a few of the basics of Senate rules and process.  Otherwise folks like Karl Rove will tell you to “do the math” counting Democrat Senators without telling you that Senate Republicans have the ability to change the formula.
To help simplify an explanation of the Senate process, think of it like a football game where the rules and timing are set, but there are different plays at your disposal.  Winning requires playing the game with a focus on fundamentals.

Let’s go with one possible scenario that could unfold this week.  As early as Monday, the Senate could agree to take up the House bill passed last Friday that funds everything in the government but Obamacare.  The Senate can do this by something called “unanimous consent,” if no one Senator objects, or if one Senator does object, they can put it to a vote requiring 60 votes to pass.  For the purposes of this exercise, let’s say one or the other is successful and the bill goes to the Senate floor for consideration.
What happens next in this process is debate on the Senate floor begins, where each side argues for or against the bill.
During this debate period, Democrat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could offer an amendment to strip out the language in the House bill that defunds Obamacare.  Reid would also likely choose not to allow any other amendments to the bill.  That is within his power as the leader of the majority party in the Senate. The hard and fast rules, however, require Reid to file his amendment for consideration and reveal for all to see what’s in the amendment before the debate is over.
This is where things can get deceptive.  Establishment Republicans would let you believe the next step in the process is the Senate has a vote on Reid’s amendment.  What these politicians are not telling you is Sen. Reid cannot get a vote on his amendment to put Obamacare funding back in the House bill unless some of the Republicans agree to it.
Here’s how that happens.

We last left the House bill on the Senate floor being debated.  To end that debate period, 60 Senators have to vote to do so. In Capitol Hillspeak, that vote to end debate is called reaching “cloture.” Currently, there are 52 Democrats, two independents (who work with the Democrats) and 46 Republican Senators.  Republicans can win that cloture vote with 41 votes, and debate continues on the Senate floor until Democrats can get 60 votes to stop it.
A vote for cloture is a vote to fund Obamacare. The people understand this, so Senators beware.

Bottom line: Reid cannot get a vote on his amendment that would strip Obamacare defunding out of the House bill unless six Republicans agree to let that vote take place. 
That’s called leverage in anyone’s playbook.  Reid loses his advantage.  He will have to negotiate on the rest of the process–like whether his amendment to fund Obamacare requires 60 votes to pass.  Or not.  That’s up for negotiation, too, if Senate Republicans fight for it.
If Republicans hold together on this, Reid will not be able to change the House bill.  That leaves Harry Reid with some tough choices.  Senate Democrats running for re-election do not want to be forced to vote against the House bill that defunds Obamacare.

Republicans can use this leverage to force Senate Democrats to make concessions.
Americans lucky enough to have a job right now are losing their healthcare plans they liked and wanted to keep. Obamacare is causing full-time jobs to become part-time jobs to get under the 30-hour workweek mandate. Doctors are choosing to retire rather than comply with the Obamacare boondoggle.  We are seeing this every single day in the newspapers.
Even the unions hate Obamacare.
 
If Republicans will force Senate Democrats to support Obamacare in this vote, some will bolt or they will lose their elections next year. By then, Obamacare will have reached out and touched everyone. The consequences in some instances could be fatal.
 
When Democrats and Establishment Republicans shriek “government shutdown,” and “the military won’t be paid,” or “law enforcement won’t be paid,” and every other item in the parade of horribles they’ll put forth, remember this: the House can keep sending bills to the Senate to fund anything they want.
 
Air traffic controllers?  Done! Military?  Done!  Border Patrol?  Done!
 
Funding the government at this point is this and only this: the Senate must stop holding America hostage and vote to fund the government, in whole or piece by piece, without Obamacare in it.
 
In life and as in the game of football, you can never win the victory if you choose to punt every time you touch the ball.

A simple fact is missing from all the media hysteria and political establishment temper tantrums over Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee’s attempt to defund Obamacare.
Americans are getting slammed by Obamacare right now. Workforces are decimated as health care prices rise. Public opinion is on our side. If now was not the time to unite and fight it, when was? Those who are attacking Cruz and Lee’s efforts have forgotten how negotiations are won. 


Use as an example the negotiations a governor of energy-rich Alaska must engage in with powerful multinational oil tycoons. In my experience, I found that the key to achieving success for the people you’re elected to serve is to take a firm position, stand solid, and negotiate from there when the other guy is ready to take you seriously. You fight as hard as you can with whatever small edge you’ve got until the other guy respects you enough to wise up, sit down, and come to a mutually acceptable agreement. You get nothing at all if you preemptively surrender before the battle even commences.
Imagine how much stronger the GOP’s hand would have been if every Republican (and those Democrats who’ve finally admitted Obamacare’s devastating flaws) stood together against cloture in order to prevent Harry Reid from cutting off debate and stripping Obamacare defunding from the bill?
Not only would there have been pressure on red state Democrats up for re-election to join the right cause, there would have been pressure on Reid and the White House to negotiate agreements. Even if the GOP couldn’t have defunded all of Obamacare, they could have negotiated some relief for average Americans who now feel they can do nothing but brace for the coming train wreck. We average Americans know we’ll never get the exemptions and favors Obama gave his political cronies and Congress, but any relief for the middle class would have been welcomed. 

But Republicans got nothing from squabbling with each other and denouncing (on and off the record) the brave men who tried to do something.
Ted Cruz and Mike Lee fought to fulfill the campaign promises every Republican made, and their actions have been revelatory for all of us.
Hunters know what flushing dogs do. Cruz and Lee were acting as the grassroots’ flushing dogs. Their actions showed us who was willing to stand up for hard working Americans and who wasn’t. We thank Senators Vitter, Paul, Crapo, Enzi, Fischer, Roberts, Scott, Heller, Grassley, Toomey, Moran, Rubio, Shelby, Risch, Inhofe, Portman, and Sessions for standing with Cruz and Lee.
In 2010, a galvanized grassroots rallied against Obamacare to carry Republicans to victory. But in 2012, many in the grassroots stayed home, and we saw how that turned out for the GOP.
Unfortunately, the message of some politicians today seems to be: “Whoopsie, seems I can’t fulfill my election promises, but vote for me again and I promise to do what I promised last time.”
Sorry, that doesn’t cut it. America, you deserve better. If they can’t do anything with the power you gave them through their elected office, then you deserve someone else to give it a try.
2014 is just around the corner, and we’re ready for it. Support those who do us a favor by flushing out politicians wanting to hide. Retrieving liberty must be the point in all this.

The Washington Post reports that the White House will announce Sunday that it has met its self-imposed deadline to fix the federal ObamaCare exchange known as HealthCare.gov. The Post also reports that, like everything else surrounding ObamaCare, this announcement is not even close to true. 
The faulty $600 million site has been improved over the course of the last two months. Still, though, it can only handle 50,000 users at a time. Moreover, the site still loads slowly and the capacity for 50,000 users hasn’t yet been fully tested. 


Earlier this month, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration’s goal was to make the site usable for 80% of users — another moving of the goal posts since the White House announced November 30 as a target date.  
Other deadline misses include the HealthCare.gov program that allows small businesses to enroll online. This feature, known as SHOP, has been delayed until after the 2014 midterm elections. What hasn’t been postponed, though, are the insurance policy cancellations already plaguing small business owners. 
In order to re-insure their employees, business owners will now have to work through a broker or insurance agent. That is if the the increased costs and hassles surrounding ObamaCare don’t result in small business owners deciding that insuring their employees just isn’t worth it. CBS News reported last week that this is already happening. 

The Wall Street Journal reports that technical problems will still inhibit HealthCare.gov from verifying users’ identities and the transmission of accurate enrollment data to insurance providers. The fallout of the latter problem won’t be readily apparent until someone who has been told they are insured tries to visit a doctor or emergency room only to discover their insurer has no idea who they are. 
Some crucial parts of HealthCare.gov are not even built yet, including the mechanism that pays your insurance carrier the part of your premium covered by the federal government — the infamous subsidy. 
Some reports claim that in order for ObamaCare to meet its March 30 enrollment goal of 7-plus million enrollees (this number is necessary to make the system financially viable), somewhere around 54,000 people must sign up daily. Currently, only around 7,000 enrollments are occurring daily. 
Granted, this is a big improvement over last month’s enrollment numbers, but two times zero is still zero.

I’m sure Jeffrey Goldberg got it right. Whatever the reason the President leaked his unhappiness with Bibi to Goldberg just a few days before the Israeli election–whether in an effort to influence the vote against Bibi, serve payback to Bibi for a perceived preference for Romney, or because the President could simply no longer suppress his dissatisfaction–it must indeed be unnerving to be the most powerful man on earth and have the elected leader of a tiny Middle Eastern country defy you. Especially when that country, in your opinion, owes you so much! 
You are their only reliable friend who watches helplessly as that little nation continues to isolate itself through its self-destructive policies. According to Goldberg, Obama has “become inured to what he sees as self-defeating policies of his Israeli counterpart…Obama said privately and repeatedly, “Israel doesn’t know what its own best interests are… Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.”


If only Israel would recognize the President’s genius. If only it would stop building in Jerusalem and E1 and allow the President to sprinkle his magic peace dust, then Hamas would beat its rockets into ploughshares and Hezbollah would turn its bombs into pruning hooks. But no. Ungrateful to the last, Bibi insists on disobeying the President and claiming all of Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capitol.
No doubt the President is likewise mystified at the Israeli people as well. How could the polls show that they will this week re-elect the intransigent Prime Minister who is doing so much to harm their country? The most powerful man on earth is reduced to watching from the sidelines and complaining to journalists that he knows how to protect Israel far better than the Israelis themselves.
Such an ungrateful nation.

And yet, perhaps the Israelis have finally figured out that they are a sovereign people whom, while immensely grateful to America for its friendship and support, are still best qualified to judge their security needs better than anyone else. Perhaps they have come to understand that another Democratic president named Bill Clinton, whom noone would argue has a sincere love of the Jewish people and a Jewish son-in-law, still pushed Israel into the Oslo agreements that left a thousand Israeli civilians blown to bits. Perhaps they have come to understand that if Chuck Hagel, President Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, was correct that, as a legislator from Nebraska he was “not an Israeli senator. I’m a United States senator,” then the Prime Minister of Israel is the likewise the leader of the Jewish state who must put the security of the Israeli people even before a nod of approval from the President of the United States.
Over the past four years Bibi has grown into one of Israel’s greatest ever leaders. The country is booming economically and in terms of security. Cranes dot the skyline of expanding Israeli cities, terror incidents are negligible compared to the Clinton era, and unlike the anemic American economy, Israel is humming along at about four percent annual growth. And if President Obama is right that, in spite of this prosperity, Israel is isolated in world opinion, then it is arguably no more so than it has been in the past, and, besides, what is better, a popular Israel riddled with dead Jews or an unpopular Israel filled with living ones?
But what President Obama does not understand about Netanyahu is that the inflexibility he accuses him of is born not of a narrow-minded obstinacy but rather of a confident Jewish pride and deep-seated conviction that has been Bibi’s lifelong hallmark.
In my desire in 1990 to launch a robust response to anti-Israel speeches at the Oxford Union, I booked Netanyahu to lecture at the University. Bibi, just 41 years old, had already electrified the world as Israel’s most capable defender at the UN. Bibi agreed to come with a single stipulation: “If I’m already making the trip, then work me like a horse.”
We obliged.

We picked him up in a special branch police car and as we drove through the grandeur of Oxford’s ancient center, he commented on the majesty of British academia and its incongruence with some of the petty anti-Israel sentiment that is often expressed within its halls. Arriving at St. Antony’s College for a private forum with Oxford Middle East experts, Bibi put one foot on a chair and for the next 90 minutes held forth on the justice of Israel’s cause, surrounded as it was by nation’s sworn to its destruction. As he finished, the attacks came in fast and furious in what had to be one of the most hostile audiences he ever addressed. He did not blink, he did not flinch, he did not bend. When the last question ended, he turned to me to ask what next. After two more speeches, we took him to my home where we had arranged a dinner with Rhodes Scholars, many of them Jewish, most critical of Israeli policy. This time Bibi was softer in presentation but just as firm in conviction. Israel was a righteous nation, focused on maintaining democracy and human rights while facing existential threats on nearly every border. He spoke to the students of their responsibility to be proud defenders of their people and never bend in the face of opposition. The climax of the day was a lecture at the Union itself. Palestinian and Jewish protesters rallied outside in their hundreds with the rallying cry: “Net-an-ya-hu you should know, we support the P-L-O.” Bibi left his security bubble and walked over to the protesters. “Come inside and listen. Then you can protest. I’ll answer every question you ask.”
Many left their barricades and joined the large crowd inside. What followed was one of the great speeches I have heard, a mesmerizing presentation of the need for democracy across the Middle East and the liberalization of Arab governments that deny their citizens their God-given human rights. At its high point Bibi said, “Many of us in Israel have buried children and lost brothers, in fulfillment of a simple dream for Jews to finally live and prosper in a country of their own in peace.” He did not have to mention whom he was referring to as even his detractors knew of Entebbe and the hero-brother he had lost.
Again he was bombarded with hostile questions. He responded patiently but forcefully. When he finished he was given a standing ovation by most of the students in the hall. It was a night few of us would forget.
No Israeli Prime Minister has ever been as American as Bibi. And yet no Prime Minister has so successfully resisted the pressure from the leader of a country he loves so much for a country he loves even more. And the Israeli people, in supporting Bibi regardless of the absence of a stamp of approval from President Obama, are finally realizing that Israel cannot ultimately be protected from Washington but Jerusalem, especially when the current American Administration is not in step with the strong sympathy of the American people for a tiny and just nation fighting for its life.

National radio host Rush Limbaugh praised former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for taking TODAY show host Matt Lauer “to the cleaners” Monday by refusing to buy progressive media’s talking points about Americans losing insurance and Republicans needing to appeal more to moderates than their base to win elections. 
Regarding the five percent of Americans that the White House conceded were losing their health insurance plans after President Barack Obama had promised that would not happen under Obamacare, Limbaugh said these were merely just the “first wave of cancellations,” and eventually Obamacare will impact “everybody,” because all of the plans will eventually not qualify “by design.” 
“Where do you get this five percent?” Palin asked Lauer. 



It’s not five percent. It’s most Americans will not be able to keep the healthcare policy and programs that they had desired. The new programs that are being forced down our throat are unaffordable. Some of them are still being told, “Well if you like that insurance policy and that coverage, you still will be able to keep it, it’s just going to cost you a little bit more.” That’s the point. If it’s going to cost you more, then it’s not the same policy.

Limbaugh praised Palin for her response and then said she took Lauer “to the cleaners” for also calling him out on the misguided “trick” the mainstream media always use on Republicans to get them to nominate candidates who will lose in the general election. 

“Remember that old saw what the Democrat consultants always used to tell the Republicans and they would believe it?,” Limbaugh said. “The Republican Party gets tricked so easily. They get tricked into not criticizing Obama, they get tricked into not being for what they should be for, and they even get tricked into campaigning for only 20% of the vote.”

Limbaugh blasted consultants for turning candidates “into squishy, linguini-spined moderates, on the theory that’s how you get the independents.”
“So the Republicans have been tricked into shutting up, and every four years they’ve been tricked into campaigning for 20% of the voting public, the independents,” Limbaugh said. “They’re winning the independents and they’re losing elections. You know why? Because they are abandoning their base, and the assumption is the base is always gonna be with you, but the Tea Party is not the case.”
Limbaugh made the point that now that independents are abandoning Obama, the media are calling them “moderates.”  
“The independents–and I know who you are, and you independents know who you are, and you were made to feel special by the media. You were portrayed as the really smart people,” Limbaugh said. “You weren’t ideologues. You decided things issue by issue. You had open minds, not closed minds. You weren’t bigots like the Tea Party. Oh, no, no, no! You independents, you were the cream of the crop–until you stopped voting for Democrats. Now you’re dirt. Now you’re scum.”
He praised Palin for her response to Lauer, whom he blasted for repeating mainstream media talking points that his producer gave him. 
“When you stand in the middle of the road, you’re going to get hit on both sides of the road,” Palin said. “We need to take a stand, especially on this Obamacare, and support those who are just fulfilling their campaign promises. So many politicians ran for reelection and for election saying they would do anything in their power to de-fund the statist socialized medicine program called Obamacare.”

China’s Ministry of Defense on November 30th began enforcing an expanded Air Defense Identification Zone, which now covers a huge off-shore expanse that includes the disputed oil rich Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. 
Forced to rely on the Middle East for oil for electrical production, Asian energy costs are surging, and supply has become unstable due to the continuing Arab Spring turmoil. With American domestic energy costs falling as supplies surge due to the boom in fracking for shale oil and gas, Chinese manufacturers are becoming economically uncompetitive on a cost basis compared to the U.S. producers. With China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea equally desperate to save jobs by exploiting potentially cheap and abundant off-shore oil, energy economics will drive military confrontations in Asia. 
The Chinese claim the discovery and control of the Diaoyu islands from the 14th Century, but Japan took control of the islands from 1895 until its surrender to the U.S. at the end of World War II. During the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands after 1945, it was discovered that oil reserves might be found under the sea near the islands. In anticipation of the turnover of the Senkaku islands, Japan declared a 100 mile ADIZ around the islands in 1969. Since reverting back to Japanese control under the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement, sovereignty around the islands has been disputed by the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, and South Korea. 


The new Chinese rules require that aircraft must ask for permission to fly in the ADIZ; aircraft in the zone must identify and keep in communication with Chinese authorities; all aircraft must “follow the instructions of the administrative organ of the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone”; and warn “China’s armed forces will adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions.” In response to these new Chinese edits, the U.S. flew two unarmed B-52 bombers from Guam on November 25th without notification. Then on 29th, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force scrambled Su-30 and J-11 warplanes in response to 10 flights of Japanese F-15s, E-767s and P-3s; U.S. P-3s and EP-3s; and South Korean fighter jets flying through the ADIZ.
The 1919 Paris Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation recognized the principal of freedom of the skies as an extension of “freedom of the high seas” that limited territorial sea claims of coastal nations to 12 nautical miles off their shores. The Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944 updated air rights, but it was the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which created the framework for exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in waters previously regarded as high seas. The three basic obligations of the treaty: (1) the duty to refrain from the unlawful threat or use of force; (2) the duty to have “due regard” to the rights of others to use the sea; and (3) the duty to observe applicable obligations under other treaties or rules of international law. 
The United States extended what had been its 12 nautical mile territorial sea into a “high seas” Air Defense Identification Zone in response to heightened tensions with the Soviet Union caused by the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. America claims continental ADIZs extending 300 nautical miles in some Atlantic areas and more than 400 nautical miles in Southern California. The United States also maintains ADIZs off the coast of Alaska extending out at least 350 nautical miles into the Bering Sea, similar distance into the Arctic Sea off Alaska’s northern coast, 250 nautical miles around Guam, and up to 250 nautical miles north of the Hawaiian Islands.

The U.S. from 1870 to 1970 dominated manufacturing and won two wars on the back of oil and gas prices that averaged a third of the world’s price. But shrinking domestic production after 1972 destroyed America’s energy cost advantage by the 1980s. Once expanded Middle East oil production equalized energy costs for the world, American manufacturers began relocating jobs to Asia to stay competitive with lower labor costs. 
But U.S. natural gas prices have fallen from $15 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2000 to about $3.50 mcf today. This compares to rising natural gas prices that are $10 mcf in Europe, $12 mcf in China and $17 mcf in Japan. If this cost advantage holds or widens as America exploits its spectacular abundance of shale to frack for oil and gas, Asian employment will fall as huge amounts of manufacturing relocates to the United States. 
No country has more risk from high energy prices than China, which passed the U.S. in 2010 as the world’s largest manufacturer. China passed Russia to grab the number two spot behind the U.S. in defense spending.  Fearing the Peoples’ Liberation Army would become the dominant military power in East Asia, Japan has launched a crash rearmament drive that by next year will have ballooned defense outlays past France and the U.K. to the number four spot, just behind Russia. 
The width of China’s new ADIZ does not extend beyond the international EEZ standard, but according to Stratfor Reports: “Beijing is testing U.S. responses in the Western Pacific, as China attempts to shape a new maritime balance in the area. All sides will use the current standoff to recalibrate the balance of power over energy and maritime geopolitics that, much like during the Cold War.” 
Japan retaliated early this year to China’s growing military assertiveness by extending its ADIZ around the Senkaku Islands by another 15 miles. The current western border of the zone extends at its closest point to just 81 miles off the Chinese mainland. In this escalating tit for tat, between July and September the Japanese military was forced to scramble fighter jets 80 times in response to Chinese warplane and drone intrusions.
Beijing seems distressed enough about the potential loss of millions of manufacturing jobs that they are willing to threaten the use of military force to assert a sphere of influence that will capture most of the off-shore oil and gas drilling rights in the East and South China seas. Facing U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea security agreements, China is employing tools like the ADIZ to force regional competitors to readjust their behavior in light of China’s ambitions and naval heft. 
China’s confrontations may not be intended to lead to a clash, but when armed and dangerous nations play chicken with modern weapons, the risk of a military miscalculation and accidental war accelerates.

MSNBC anchor and NBC News political director and chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd lashed out at Fox News for what he described as “pandering to an audience” over their coverage of President Obama’s enthusiastic handshake with Cuban dictator Raul Castro at Tuesday’s memorial service for Nelson Mandela. 
—



Really? An entire segment on a handshake? Good grief; pandering to an audience
— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2013

The irony of an MSNBC anchor accusing another network of pandering to their audience requires no explanation. 
Todd joins CNN, Politico’s Dylan Byers, and a number of other elite members of the media in revealing his frustration over negative coverage of a historic handshake between a Cuban dictator and an American president. It should also be noted that until today, meetings of any kind between an American president and another world leader were considered legitimate news. 

Because of this sudden change in policy, the pushback from the mainstream media on the handshake has been fierce. Few would question the media’s devotion to Obama and their support for his left-wing agenda. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the media fears the handshake will overshadow the positive coverage the media is already giving to Obama’s Memorial speech.
When challenged on this pandering charge, Todd responded that he does not pander to his audience: 
—

@jpodhoretz I don’t pander to an audience.

While Todd is certainly very good at his job and much more professional than his MSNBC colleagues, anyone who watched The Daily Rundown’s obsession over gun control in the wake of Sandy Hook or the show’s relentless tearing down of Mitt Romney over rape comments made by an Indiana Senate candidate, could argue that while better, Todd has been far from perfect in this regard. 
But back to my question: When exactly did a historic handshake between an American president and a world leader stop being news? When did dissecting the handshake, eye contact, and body language of such a meeting stop being a media sport? 
Apparently, the moment such a meeting might distract from giving Obama a positive news cycle.

The names of the witnesses who will be at the House Oversight Committee Hearing next Wednesday relating to last September’s attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi on have reportedly surfaced.

Gregory N. Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks; Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for Operations in the agency’s Counterterrorism Bureau; and Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was the regional security officer in Libya, the top security officer in the country in the months leading up to the attacks. 

During the months of December and January, Breitbart News specifically asked the State Department switchboard for Benghazi witness Hicks’ contact information; the State Department claimed his location was unknown and they therefore ccould not provide information as to Hicks’ whereabouts. 
Meanwhile, another individual Breitbart News asked the State Department switch board about, who is not on the current witness list but may have had information about the deadly Benghazi attacks, was still correctly listed in with the State Department switchboard. Hicks is a veteran Foreign Service officer whose previous postings included Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen. 


Rep. Jason Chafetz (R-UT) told Fox News in November that Ambassador Christopher Stevens, one of the four Americans ultimately killed in the Benghazi attack, called Hicks for help during the embassy attack.

“He said shortly after 9:40 PM what happened is his phone rang and he didn’t recognize the number so he didn’t answer it. And then it rang again and again he didn’t answer it because he didn’t recognize the number,” Rep. Chaffetz said. “But then given the persistence he did answer it. It was Ambassador Stevens and Ambassador Stevens was saying ‘we’re under attack,'” he added.

On Monday, while the death toll mounted at the Navy Yard, President Barack Obama delivered a strident partisan tirade against Republicans, using the fifth anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse to score political points ahead of the debt ceiling debate. It was an appalling act of division and insensitivity, and unlike George W. Bush’s My Pet Goat moment on 9/11, it was a calculated abdication of leadership.
It was also an act that places Obama’s passivity during the Benghazi attacks–and his decision to fly to Las Vegas the next day for a campaign fundraiser–in perspective. This is a president who, even as Navy Seals approached Osama bin Laden’s hideout, retired to play cards with his pals. The image is of a man with little regard for the lives of Americans in “his” military, or their families, beyond their use as campaign props.


In addition, President Obama–like it or not–leads the entire nation, not just the majority that voted him into office. In moments of terror and tragedy, his job is to bring the American people together, not to split us apart. Conservatives have been willing–eager, even–to embrace Obama on such occasions, as many did after his speech at the memorial for the Tuscon victims in 2011. Yesterday, he foreclosed any such reconciliation. 
What we are seeing is partly the result of Obama’s political foundation as a community organizer–there is never a crisis to waste, so to speak, in stirring up your core supporters against their contrived opponents. But even Alinsky, who had enough sense to criticize those who called police “pigs,” would have counseled against Obama’s speech yesterday, which could not have brought more benefit than harm to his cause.
Yes, Obama did begin by acknowledging the Navy Yard attacks. That is, at least, an improvement from how he reacted to the Ford Hood shooting in 2009, which he only mentioned after several “shout-outs” to his supporters in the audience. 

Yet the speech itself should have been canceled, or postponed. The fact that the White House never even considered that option shows how out of touch Obama is with his basic duties.
A story comes to mind, told by a friend in Chicago who met Obama during his obscure State Senate years. Obama was at a local function for medical professionals, and my friend, having just met the Senator from Hyde Park, tried to introduce him to a friend from the same neighborhood. In the nervous rush of the moment, he forgot that friend’s name. “Well, I guess he isn’t your friend, is he,” Obama deadpanned.
Obama then presented his business card, said, “You’ll be hearing about me,” turned, and left, leaving the two men in shock at his rudeness. 
That’s the real Obama–the one slowly emerging in presidential biographies now that he is safely ensconced in a second term, the one who drops even the most loyal aides when he feels they are no longer of use to him, the man capable of relating to large crowds but not concrete human beings.
Speaker of the House John Boehner said that Obama’s speech was a “shame.” Charles Krauthammer said that it was in “extremely bad taste.” It was worse than that. It was an insult to the victims and their families, a slap in the face to the nation as a whole, a dereliction of the simplest duty of empathy and discretion. He may apologize–he ought to–but what Obama revealed about himself in that moment can never be undone.

14923	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/04/Exclusive-Rep-Yoho-Obama-s-credibility-not-America-s-credibility-at-risk-in-Syrian-situation	News	0	International News	None	SomewhatPositive	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL), a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday morning that it is President Barack Obama’s credibility that is at risk with regard the situation in Syria, not the credibility of America.
Yoho said America’s credibility does not lie solely with the president’s statements and actions. “You have the military’s credibility, and then you have the U.S. government’s credibility,” Yoho said. “I don’t think anybody in the world disputes our credibility of our military. When you go back to the Persian Gulf War, where for CNN it was the first time they broadcasted a war live, and Bernard Shaw was giving you play-by-play bombing descriptions and then you had the Iraq war, the shock and awe that we watched on TV. We hunted down Saddam Hussein, and then we hunted down Osama bin Laden. So I don’t think our credibility of our military is in question at all.”
Really, Yoho said, it is the credibility of the president that is in question. “It’s going back to the red line,” he said. “Not saying, first off, what was said shouldn’t have been said. You don’t make veiled threats, I’ve learned in life. I don’t make threats, I make promises. And you stand by your promises. Your word is your bond. Unfortunately, I think the president spoke out of turn here. Again, I think there’s a better [way] to handle this and it should be through diplomacy. I would wait until the U.N. report came out to verify 100 percent that it was Sarin gas because there is still controversy over that and there is still controversy over who launched it.”


Yoho points to the president’s comments on the world stage on Wednesday in Sweden where he says he did not draw a “red line” in Syria. “First of all, I didn’t set a red line,” Obama said on Wednesday. “The world set a red line. The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world’s population said the use of chemical weapons are [inaudble] and passed a treaty forbidding their use, even when countries are engaged in war. Congress set a red line when it ratified that treaty. Congress set a red line when it indicated that in a piece of legislation entitled the Syria Accountability Act that some of the horrendous things happening on the ground there need to be answered for. So, when I said in a press conference that my calculus about what’s happening in Syria would be altered by the use of chemical weapons, which the overwhelming consensus of humanity says is wrong, that wasn’t something I just kind of made up. I didn’t pluck it out of thin air. There’s a reason for it.”
That is a direct contradiction to what Obama said back over a year ago, in which he refers to a “red line” he was drawing in Syria. A backgrounder on the White House website includes several references to how President Obama did indeed “set a red line.”
Yoho said that President Obama’s foreign policies are in jeopardy because of his credibility issues on the world stage. “I think the lack of credibility you’re seeing in the U.S. foreign policy reflects right back to the unsuredness of the president’s word and the message coming out of our administration,” Yoho said. “He drew a red line. We all know he drew a red line. And now he’s saying he didn’t draw a red line.”

Yoho points to Egypt and to Benghazi as examples of where Obama’s foreign policy credibility is lacking. 
“The military coup in Egypt, which I firmly believe it is–if you look at the definition of a coup, it’s relinquishing of your power without your approval by a military and then to be put under house arrest–and yet our president doesn’t call it a coup because of the ramifications of having cut off military aid?” Yoho said. “His message has been inconsistent. It usually comes out after the fact, what he meant to say. This hurts our credibility. This even goes back to Benghazi. When Ms. Clinton said what difference does it make, the difference is this: If we lie to the American people, about the cause of a terrorist act saying it was a video, when we know the facts and I think you’ll see in our hearings, how can you expect another country or ally to take you at your word?”
When asked if the only people in the country who really want to go to war with Syria are those in the political class in Washington, D.C., Yoho said “I think you’re probably about 100 percent right on that.”
“If we look at the phone calls and the letters we get and the personal contact, I’m going to say 90 to 95 percent are saying ‘stay out of Syria,'” he said. “I represent my constituents in North Central Florida, and I’m not going to support this.”
While he thinks that the Obama administration has taken its foreign policy too far into the realm of failure, Yoho thinks the problem has its roots in Washington as far back as a few decades ago. That said, though, Yoho thinks this is an opportunity for America to lead again. 
“Our foreign policy has really been lost in this administration, but I’ll say this: our foreign policy in the Middle East over the last 30 to 35 years has really been off track,” Yoho said. “This is a perfect opportunity for us to lead and get people to the negotiation table. Of all the countries that signed the CWC [Chemical Weapons Convention] accord, there’s 189 of us, we need to have 189 at the table including all the Arab League countries and the U.N. on one side of the table, and Mr. Assad on the other side and we need to have a diplomatic solution to this. The thing I was encouraged with today was Russia’s president [Vladimir] Putin said that he would look at the evidence and if it was conclusive he would stand with us. I think that’s monumental because if he can do that, China can do it. And Iran also signed the CWC. With China and Russia putting pressure on them, it is possible that they could come to the table and tell Mr. Assad to stop. That would be diplomacy at its finest and I think it would reset our foreign policy and our way to handle it.” 
Yoho said this situation reminds him somewhat of Iraq, where Colin Powell had sold everyone on how Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD’s) were definitely there. “We don’t want to make that mistake again,” he said. “If you go back to the CWC accords, it says any country that produces, stockpiles, transfers or sells or uses chemical weapons are in violation of that treaty. So does that mean now that if we know North Korea has it, we go in there? Or what about Iran that is supposedly developing a nuclear weapon? Where do you draw the line? Do you act in totality? Or do you just say we’re just going to go after Syria? I think it’s a very dangerous precedent to start because this could be a prelude to start saying ‘Well, North Korea has this and Iran has this, so we should attack them too.’ I know the American people won’t stand for that and I won’t stand for it and I think there’s a better way we can do this.”  
Congress could step up and lead America out of this situation, Yoho added, but currently congressional leadership of both parties are jumping in to help the president. House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, as well Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have all thrown their weight behind Obama. “Our country is starved for leadership and selling what’s best for America,” Yoho said. “If things are best for America, I think the world benefits from that. There’s no doubt in my mind. I know Americans will grow a stronger and bigger America. We’ll be more competitive. The middle class will grow. That’s the stuff we need to focus on, not focusing on another war. That is just absolutely crazy. Keep in mind, we’re broke. We don’t have the money to do this. If China gets involved because they said they don’t want us involved, and we’re running out of money, well, who are we going to borrow money from? China? I mean, we need to stay home and take care of our own. Let’s work through this diplomatically, which I don’t feel like we’ve done a strong enough job in that yet.”
Instead of getting involved in another country’s civil war where there has been no clear and present threat to America’s national security or the security of America’s allies presented thus far, Yoho thinks the U.S. government should focus more on solving domestic problems and taking care of Americans first. “I’ve only been here a little over seven or eight months,” he said. “What I saw was a broken system. I saw crisis management. They go from one frying pan into the next, instead of long-term planning. We’ve now taken the focus off immigration, we’ve taken the focus off our debt ceiling, we’ve taken the focus off Social Security and Medicare, and we have the Obama healthcare bill coming out that needs to be repealed 100 percent. That’s going to be a disaster. We’re at $17 trillion in debt and that bill will increase our spending $2 trillion to start with and that’s just the beginning. Social Security is going broke and Medicare is going broke and we’re talking about going to another war? I mean this is ludicrous.”

Gregory N. Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks; Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for Operations in the agency’s Counterterrorism Bureau; and Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was the regional security officer in Libya, the top security officer in the country in the months leading up to the attacks. 

During the months of December and January, Breitbart News specifically asked the State Department switchboard for Benghazi witness Hicks’ contact information; the State Department claimed his location was unknown and they therefore ccould not provide information as to Hicks’ whereabouts. 
Meanwhile, another individual Breitbart News asked the State Department switch board about, who is not on the current witness list but may have had information about the deadly Benghazi attacks, was still correctly listed in with the State Department switchboard. Hicks is a veteran Foreign Service officer whose previous postings included Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen. 


Rep. Jason Chafetz (R-UT) told Fox News in November that Ambassador Christopher Stevens, one of the four Americans ultimately killed in the Benghazi attack, called Hicks for help during the embassy attack.

“He said shortly after 9:40 PM what happened is his phone rang and he didn’t recognize the number so he didn’t answer it. And then it rang again and again he didn’t answer it because he didn’t recognize the number,” Rep. Chaffetz said. “But then given the persistence he did answer it. It was Ambassador Stevens and Ambassador Stevens was saying ‘we’re under attack,'” he added.

MSNBC anchor and NBC News political director and chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd lashed out at Fox News for what he described as “pandering to an audience” over their coverage of President Obama’s enthusiastic handshake with Cuban dictator Raul Castro at Tuesday’s memorial service for Nelson Mandela.

Really? An entire segment on a handshake? Good grief; pandering to an audience
— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2013

The irony of an MSNBC anchor accusing another network of pandering to their audience requires no explanation. 
Todd joins CNN, Politico’s Dylan Byers, and a number of other elite members of the media in revealing his frustration over negative coverage of a historic handshake between a Cuban dictator and an American president. It should also be noted that until today, meetings of any kind between an American president and another world leader were considered legitimate news. 

Because of this sudden change in policy, the pushback from the mainstream media on the handshake has been fierce. Few would question the media’s devotion to Obama and their support for his left-wing agenda. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the media fears the handshake will overshadow the positive coverage the media is already giving to Obama’s Memorial speech.
When challenged on this pandering charge, Todd responded that he does not pander to his audience: 
—

@jpodhoretz I don’t pander to an audience.

While Todd is certainly very good at his job and much more professional than his MSNBC colleagues, anyone who watched The Daily Rundown’s obsession over gun control in the wake of Sandy Hook or the show’s relentless tearing down of Mitt Romney over rape comments made by an Indiana Senate candidate, could argue that while better, Todd has been far from perfect in this regard. 
But back to my question: When exactly did a historic handshake between an American president and a world leader stop being news? When did dissecting the handshake, eye contact, and body language of such a meeting stop being a media sport? 
Apparently, the moment such a meeting might distract from giving Obama a positive news cycle.

15006	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/04/Exclusive-Rep-Yoho-Obama-s-credibility-not-America-s-credibility-at-risk-in-Syrian-situation	Opinion	1	International News	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL), a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday morning that it is President Barack Obama’s credibility that is at risk with regard the situation in Syria, not the credibility of America.
Yoho said America’s credibility does not lie solely with the president’s statements and actions. “You have the military’s credibility, and then you have the U.S. government’s credibility,” Yoho said. “I don’t think anybody in the world disputes our credibility of our military. When you go back to the Persian Gulf War, where for CNN it was the first time they broadcasted a war live, and Bernard Shaw was giving you play-by-play bombing descriptions and then you had the Iraq war, the shock and awe that we watched on TV. We hunted down Saddam Hussein, and then we hunted down Osama bin Laden. So I don’t think our credibility of our military is in question at all.”
Really, Yoho said, it is the credibility of the president that is in question. “It’s going back to the red line,” he said. “Not saying, first off, what was said shouldn’t have been said. You don’t make veiled threats, I’ve learned in life. I don’t make threats, I make promises. And you stand by your promises. Your word is your bond. Unfortunately, I think the president spoke out of turn here. Again, I think there’s a better [way] to handle this and it should be through diplomacy. I would wait until the U.N. report came out to verify 100 percent that it was Sarin gas because there is still controversy over that and there is still controversy over who launched it.”


Yoho points to the president’s comments on the world stage on Wednesday in Sweden where he says he did not draw a “red line” in Syria. “First of all, I didn’t set a red line,” Obama said on Wednesday. “The world set a red line. The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world’s population said the use of chemical weapons are [inaudble] and passed a treaty forbidding their use, even when countries are engaged in war. Congress set a red line when it ratified that treaty. Congress set a red line when it indicated that in a piece of legislation entitled the Syria Accountability Act that some of the horrendous things happening on the ground there need to be answered for. So, when I said in a press conference that my calculus about what’s happening in Syria would be altered by the use of chemical weapons, which the overwhelming consensus of humanity says is wrong, that wasn’t something I just kind of made up. I didn’t pluck it out of thin air. There’s a reason for it.”
That is a direct contradiction to what Obama said back over a year ago, in which he refers to a “red line” he was drawing in Syria. A backgrounder on the White House website includes several references to how President Obama did indeed “set a red line.”
Yoho said that President Obama’s foreign policies are in jeopardy because of his credibility issues on the world stage. “I think the lack of credibility you’re seeing in the U.S. foreign policy reflects right back to the unsuredness of the president’s word and the message coming out of our administration,” Yoho said. “He drew a red line. We all know he drew a red line. And now he’s saying he didn’t draw a red line.”

Yoho points to Egypt and to Benghazi as examples of where Obama’s foreign policy credibility is lacking. 
“The military coup in Egypt, which I firmly believe it is–if you look at the definition of a coup, it’s relinquishing of your power without your approval by a military and then to be put under house arrest–and yet our president doesn’t call it a coup because of the ramifications of having cut off military aid?” Yoho said. “His message has been inconsistent. It usually comes out after the fact, what he meant to say. This hurts our credibility. This even goes back to Benghazi. When Ms. Clinton said what difference does it make, the difference is this: If we lie to the American people, about the cause of a terrorist act saying it was a video, when we know the facts and I think you’ll see in our hearings, how can you expect another country or ally to take you at your word?”
When asked if the only people in the country who really want to go to war with Syria are those in the political class in Washington, D.C., Yoho said “I think you’re probably about 100 percent right on that.”
“If we look at the phone calls and the letters we get and the personal contact, I’m going to say 90 to 95 percent are saying ‘stay out of Syria,'” he said. “I represent my constituents in North Central Florida, and I’m not going to support this.”
While he thinks that the Obama administration has taken its foreign policy too far into the realm of failure, Yoho thinks the problem has its roots in Washington as far back as a few decades ago. That said, though, Yoho thinks this is an opportunity for America to lead again. 
“Our foreign policy has really been lost in this administration, but I’ll say this: our foreign policy in the Middle East over the last 30 to 35 years has really been off track,” Yoho said. “This is a perfect opportunity for us to lead and get people to the negotiation table. Of all the countries that signed the CWC [Chemical Weapons Convention] accord, there’s 189 of us, we need to have 189 at the table including all the Arab League countries and the U.N. on one side of the table, and Mr. Assad on the other side and we need to have a diplomatic solution to this. The thing I was encouraged with today was Russia’s president [Vladimir] Putin said that he would look at the evidence and if it was conclusive he would stand with us. I think that’s monumental because if he can do that, China can do it. And Iran also signed the CWC. With China and Russia putting pressure on them, it is possible that they could come to the table and tell Mr. Assad to stop. That would be diplomacy at its finest and I think it would reset our foreign policy and our way to handle it.” 
Yoho said this situation reminds him somewhat of Iraq, where Colin Powell had sold everyone on how Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD’s) were definitely there. “We don’t want to make that mistake again,” he said. “If you go back to the CWC accords, it says any country that produces, stockpiles, transfers or sells or uses chemical weapons are in violation of that treaty. So does that mean now that if we know North Korea has it, we go in there? Or what about Iran that is supposedly developing a nuclear weapon? Where do you draw the line? Do you act in totality? Or do you just say we’re just going to go after Syria? I think it’s a very dangerous precedent to start because this could be a prelude to start saying ‘Well, North Korea has this and Iran has this, so we should attack them too.’ I know the American people won’t stand for that and I won’t stand for it and I think there’s a better way we can do this.”  
Congress could step up and lead America out of this situation, Yoho added, but currently congressional leadership of both parties are jumping in to help the president. House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, as well Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have all thrown their weight behind Obama. “Our country is starved for leadership and selling what’s best for America,” Yoho said. “If things are best for America, I think the world benefits from that. There’s no doubt in my mind. I know Americans will grow a stronger and bigger America. We’ll be more competitive. The middle class will grow. That’s the stuff we need to focus on, not focusing on another war. That is just absolutely crazy. Keep in mind, we’re broke. We don’t have the money to do this. If China gets involved because they said they don’t want us involved, and we’re running out of money, well, who are we going to borrow money from? China? I mean, we need to stay home and take care of our own. Let’s work through this diplomatically, which I don’t feel like we’ve done a strong enough job in that yet.”
Instead of getting involved in another country’s civil war where there has been no clear and present threat to America’s national security or the security of America’s allies presented thus far, Yoho thinks the U.S. government should focus more on solving domestic problems and taking care of Americans first. “I’ve only been here a little over seven or eight months,” he said. “What I saw was a broken system. I saw crisis management. They go from one frying pan into the next, instead of long-term planning. We’ve now taken the focus off immigration, we’ve taken the focus off our debt ceiling, we’ve taken the focus off Social Security and Medicare, and we have the Obama healthcare bill coming out that needs to be repealed 100 percent. That’s going to be a disaster. We’re at $17 trillion in debt and that bill will increase our spending $2 trillion to start with and that’s just the beginning. Social Security is going broke and Medicare is going broke and we’re talking about going to another war? I mean this is ludicrous.”

Protestors in South Africa, thought to be affiliated with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, dumped raw sewage at the Cape Town International Airport on Tuesday. President Barack Obama is due to arrive in South Africa on Friday and will speak in Cape Town on Sunday. The protest was linked to a series of ongoing demonstration in the so-called “toilet wars” over sanitation policy in the city. It was not aimed at Obama, but took place against a backdrop of demonstrations and internal battles surrounding Obama’s visit.
Local news sources report that the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), which is technically a governing partner with the ANC, plans to “disrupt” Obama’s visit to the country by staging demonstrations involving thousands of protestors. Cosatu specifically objects to Obama’s foreign policy, which it describes as imperialist and militaristic. Local Muslim groups are joining the protest, too, with the local Muslim Lawyers Association calling on the government to arrest President Obama on his arrival for war crimes.


Several left-wing academics are vowing to boycott Obama’s a ceremony at the University of Johannesburg in which Obama is to receive an honorary doctorate. The centrist Democratic Alliance, meanwhile, has come under fire for attempting to bestow an award on the President and First Lady Michelle Obama. 

Obama’s visit has also affected growing debates around the country’s ailing former president, Nelson Mandela, who is said to be on life support. Mandela’s relatives are engaged in a very public round of infighting over where he should be buried when he dies. There is some speculation that Mandela is being kept on life support until Obama’s visit, though the two are not scheduled to meet. NBC, citing one of Mandela’s daughters, reported Tuesday that Mandela had opened his eyes and smiled when being told of Obama’s imminent arrival in the country, but that report was not confirmed by other sources.

15080	http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2013/04/23/House-Releases-Report-on-Benghazi-Attack	News	1	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
A report on the Benghazi attack by five different House committees has made the following findings. [Note this is a report issued by House Republicans including Howard McKeon chairman of Committee on Armed Services, Ed Royce chairman of Committee on Foreign Affairs, Bob Goodlatte chairman of Committee on the Judiciary, Darrell Issa chairman of Committee on Oversight & Government Reform and Mike Rogers Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]:
Before the Attacks:



After the U.S.-backed Libyan revolution ended the Gadhafi regime, the U.S. government did not deploy sufficient U.S. security elements to protect U.S. interests and personnel that remained on the ground.
Senior State Department officials knew that the threat environment in Benghazi was high and that the Benghazi compound was vulnerable and unable to withstand an attack, yet the Department continued to systematically withdraw security personnel.
Repeated requests for additional security were denied at the highest levels of the State Department. For example, an April 2012 State Department cable bearing Secretary Hillary Clinton’s signature acknowledged then-Ambassador Cretz’s formal request for additional security assets but ordered the withdrawal of security elements to proceed as planned.
The attacks were not the result of a failure by the Intelligence Community (IC) to recognize or communicate the threat. The IC collected considerable information about the threats in the region, and disseminated regular assessments to senior U.S. officials warning of the deteriorating security environment in Benghazi, which included threats to American interests, facilities, and personnel.
The President, as Commander-in-Chief, failed to proactively anticipate the significance of September 11 and provide the Department of Defense with the authority to launch offensive operations beyond self-defense. Defense Department assets were correctly positioned for the general threat across the region, but the assets were not authorized at an alert posture to launch offensive operations beyond self-defense, and were provided no notice to defend diplomatic facilities.

During the Attacks:


On the evening of September 11, 2012, U.S. security teams on the ground in Benghazi exhibited extreme bravery responding the attacks by al-Qa’ida-affiliated groups against the U.S. mission.
Department of Defense officials and military personnel reacted quickly to the attacks in Benghazi. The effectiveness of their response was hindered on account of U.S. military forces not being properly postured to address the growing threats in northern Africa or to respond to a brief, high-intensity attack on U.S. personnel or interests across much of Africa.

After the Attacks:

The Administration willfully perpetuated a deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the attacks evolved from a political demonstration caused by a YouTube video. U.S. officials on the ground reported – and video evidence confirms – that demonstrations outside the Benghazi Mission did not occur and that the incident began with an armed attack on the facility. Senior Administration officials knowingly minimized the role played by al-Qa’ida-affiliated entities and other associated groups in the attacks, and decided to exclude from the discussion the previous attempts by extremists to attack U.S. persons or facilities in Libya.
Administration officials crafted and continued to rely on incomplete and misleading talking points. Specifically, after a White House Deputies Meeting on Saturday, September 15, 2012, the Administration altered the talking points to remove references to the likely participation of Islamic extremists in the attacks. The Administration also removed references to the threat of extremists linked to al-Qa’ida in Benghazi and eastern Libya, including information about at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi. Senior State Department officials requested – and the White House approved – that the details of the threats, specifics of the previous attacks, and previous warnings be removed to insulate the Department from criticism that it ignored the threat environment in Benghazi.
Evidence rebuts Administration claims that the talking points were modified to protect classified information or to protect an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Email exchanges during the interagency process do not reveal any concern with protecting classified information. Additionally, the Bureau itself approved a version of the talking points with significantly more information about the attacks and previous threats than the version that the State Department requested. Thus, the claim that the State Department’s edits were made solely to protect that investigation is not credible.
The Administration deflected responsibility by blaming the IC for the information it communicated to the public in both the talking points and the subsequent narrative it perpetuated. Had Administration spokesmen performed even limited due diligence inquiries into the intelligence behind the talking points or requested reports from personnel on the ground, they would have quickly understood that the situation was more complex than the narrative provided by Ambassador Susan Rice and others in the Administration. 
The Administration’s decision to respond to the Benghazi attacks with an FBI investigation, rather than military or other intelligence resources, contributed to the government’s lack of candor about the nature of the attack.
Responding to the attacks with an FBI investigation significantly delayed U.S. access to key witnesses and evidence and undermined the government’s ability to bring those responsible for the attacks to justice in a timely manner.

The President of the United States might not believe there is any “there” there regarding his administration’s now-admitted mishandling of the September 11 terror attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, but a new Gallup poll seems to indicate the America people aren’t quite as sure. A full 52% “strongly agree” that Benghazi is a “serious issue that needs to be investigated,” while 17% “agree.” That’s a total of 69%. 
Because the mainstream media has conspired (it must be noted that there are a number of notable individual exceptions) with the White House over the last eight months to downplay Libya, you might think that particular scandal would generate less interest than the IRS scandal — which the media have taken much more seriously. Surprisingly, though, the numbers aren’t all that different. When asked the same question about the IRS, 56% “strongly agree” and 18% “agree;” for a total of 74% — which is only 5 points higher than Libya. 
The numbers for Libya create a real dilemma for the White House and its lapdog media. The no there “there” Narrative they have spent eight months manufacturing obviously isn’t working. Moreover, the motive behind this Narrative is a sinister one: neither Obama nor his media want the truth to get out, and both know that the more the people learn about the administration’s handling of Libya, the worse it will be for the administration. 


For instance, with the release of the 94 emails earlier this week, we now know for a fact that the White House repeatedly lied with their claim that the administration played no role in shaping the CIA talking points. The media, though, refuse to hold the White House accountable for that lie and prefer to pretend the emails actually do back the administration’s claim.  
The main reason the media have smothered the damning revelations found in the emails, though, is to protect Hillary Clinton. It was the State Department that demanded what amounted to almost a total rewrite of the completed talking points, and won them. But the media see Hillary as the best chance they have for keeping the White House out of Republican hands in 2016, and so they are circling the wagons for her, just like they have for Obama for the last five years.  
Plus, even though the media isn’t demanding more, we still don’t have all the information regarding the shaping of the talking points. These information gaps are critical, and to say we should take the White House’s word for anything at this point is a joke. 

The media are also ignoring and smothering the effort to find out who gave the order to “stand down” when it came to sending help to Americans under attack that night. And when it comes to finding out what exactly the President was doing during those horrific hours during which the attack took place, the media is laughably uncurious.   
To protect the White House from having to reveal the truth, the President and his media have developed a strategy that smears as partisan witch-hunters anyone searching for the truth. This includes any Republican in Congress pushing for investigations and, naturally, Fox News. 
But from the looks of this poll, the witch-hunters have the will of the people on their side–a whopping 69% of them. That’s a huge number, but if you think about, not really a surprising one. When Americans die, decent people believe everything should be fully investigated and made public. 
The American people are, by and large, decent. 
This White House and its media, however, are not. 
Hopefully this poll will only further embolden the GOP and Fox News and the exceptions in the media to continue to do the decent thing: Find and tell the complete truth about what led to the deaths of an ambassador and three other Americans.

President Barack Obama will be visiting South Africa for the second time this year to attend Nelson Mandela’s memorial services. So, too will all other living past U.S. presidents–including Jimmy Carter, who worked with Mandela after the latter retired from politics, and George W. Bush, who did more for Africa than any other but is probably appreciated least. And then there is Bill Clinton, who remains South Africa’s favorite U.S. president–more so even than Obama, who is viewed as a disappointment. Politically, crudely, this is Hillary’s moment.
South Africans love Clinton partly because he happened to be in power when their country made its historic transition. He was there to welcome South Africa back into the international community, and he was there to welcome President Mandela as a fellow world leader. Clinton was also, back then, the “first black president,” and charmed the South African public with the same folksy manner he used to build his political coalition. He was different, too, from other Democrats, seeing potential in globalization, looking for friends rather than foes.


Clinton matched the Mandela mood. Obama, by contrast, has much more in common with Mandela’s successor, Thabo Mbeki, whose top-down leadership, aloof manner, and cronyism made him distinctly unpopular. Like Obama, Mbeki was thin-skinned and divisive, arrogant and jealous of sharing power with the other branches of government.A man who brooked no dissent within the ruling party, and who shunned the opposition, Mbeki left office before finishing his second term after being ousted as party leader by the populist Jacob Zuma. 

Zuma has been sour on Obama ever since the Libya war. The South African government had maintained close ties with Muammar Gadhafi, dating back to the anti-apartheid struggle, and saw him as one of the continent’s few unifying figures, comical though he often was. Gadhafi had backed one of South Africa’s most important diplomatic projects, the African Union. His ouster was seen by the South African government as more of the same interventionism it had decried when Bush invaded Iraq. Obama, then, was seen as something of a sellout.
South Africans still like Obama and his family. They vastly prefer him to any of his Republican opponents, the more so as American conservatives get extremely bad press in South Africa (as they do in much of the social democratic world). But they also know a failure when they see one, and Obama’s failure in nearly every aspect of his presidency has not failed to make an impression. Clinton, by contrast, is remembered, mostly correctly, as having been a success. His America was a confident one, buoyed by prosperity and a post-Cold War glow.
I was once in the audience at a speech by Bill Clinton at the University of the Western Cape. I wore an American flag in my baseball cap, attracting hostile stares from some in the academic audience, for whom skepticism of the U.S. is fundamental intellectual principle. And yet as soon as Clinton reached the stage–looking tired and haggard, thin from months of dieting–the same people leapt to their feet in rapt applause. In his flaws, South Africans see their own failures. In his successes, they somehow see their hopes. He is the America they love.
Obama is the America of the South African elites, envious of America’s success and eager to see it more humble on the world stage. He says the right things about the need for government. He comes bearing gifts. But most South Africans are tired of Obama’s exhortations about transformation. They have heard the same from their own leaders for years. Bill Clinton knows how to bypass the dogma and go straight to the heart. He won over Israelis at Yitzchak Rabin’s funeral with: “Shalom, chaver. Goodbye, friend.” Expect something of an encore.
And expect Hillary Clinton to make the most of the moment. This is her chance, finally, to eclipse the man who beat her to the top with the help of a fawning media and disloyal superdelegates. This is her chance to overcome the spurious but effective charges of racism that the Obama campaign used against her to undermine her among black voters. She will know how to place herself in the media spotlight without seeming to have done so, and will make the best use of her husband’s popularity, the better to cast herself as his true American successor.

According to a report from Eric Holder’s Department of Justice, nearly 1/3 of the immigrants making asylum claims last year who were released on bond or their own recognizance never even bothered to appear in immigration court. 
The Executive Office for Immigration Review’s Statisical Yearbook for 2012 says that number is up sharply, with 66% more no-shows than in 2008.
 The asylum system appears to be a magnet for abuse by those who make a claim to get into the country and then vanish. As Breitbart News reported, last week one border crossing near San Diego saw a sudden flood of asylum requests that resulted in the checkpoint being shut down. 


The numbers from the DoJ indicate a growing crisis in the system the United States uses to grant asylum to international refugees, as the immigration courts are overwhelmed by cases from Mexican immigrants that rarely result in asylum being granted.

In raw numbers, Mexican immigrants made 9,206 asylum claims in 2012 but were only found by the immigration courts to have 126 claims worthy of being granted. Compare those numbers to immigrants from a country like China–often accused of human rights violations–11,197 asylum claims were made, 4,705 of which were granted. 
There is no breakdown in the report by nationality for the people who make an asylum claim but don’t bother to show up in court, but in 2012, 29% of all asylum applicants released on bond or their own recognizance were “failure to appears.” 
The cost in court time for frivolous claims is also staggering. For the past five years, cases involving Mexican immigrants rank #1 in the amount of immigration court cases completed in terms of both normal decisions and appeals. However, in terms of the number of actual asylums that were granted, Mexico has never ranked higher than #17 and didn’t even make the list of the top 25 grantees from 2008-2010. 
Over 65% of the asylum cases completed in the immigration courts in 2012 involved nationals from Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala, with Mexicans being the vast majority of all cases completed at 42%. Additionally, 67% of all immigration court proceeding are completed in Spanish.
The Executive Office for Immigration Review is a division of the Department of Justic that oversees immigration courts. According to the EOIR’s website, their stated mission is: 

The primary mission of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) is to adjudicate immigration cases by fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly interpreting and administering the Nation’s immigration laws. Under delegated authority from the Attorney General, EOIR conducts immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative hearings.

Former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), who awaits a vote this week on his confirmation as Secretary of Defense, had failed to provide the Senate Armed Services Committee with more than a few speeches dating to January 2008. Since then, at least two missing speeches within that timeframe have been identified: one to the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, for which a video was eventually found, and the other to Georgetown University, of which no text or recording has been provided. 
Now a third speech has surfaced: an address by Hagel to the U.S. Middle East Project (USMEP), which advocates aggressive U.S. pressure in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.


Hagel delivered the keynote address to the Annual Meeting of the International Board of USMEP. Photographs of the event were published on the group’s website, including the one above (with Brent Scowcroft, former adviser to President George H.W. Bush, seated next to Hagel) but no video or text of Hagel’s speech was published.

In 2009, Hagel co-authored a USMEP report that called for U.S. troops to be deployed to Israel and Palestine in the future to patrol the boundaries of the new Palestinian state. The report also indicated that peace could be “imposed” from the outside, and that it should be pursued regardless of “certain domestic constituencies.” Hagel serves on the board of USMEP with a variety of individuals with a strong interest in Middle East diplomacy.
The president of USMEP, Henry Siegman, is known for making radical and inflammatory statements. He attacked Sen. Lindsey Graham for questioning Hagel about the former Senator’s comments on the “Jewish lobby” (Siegman sanitized Hagel’s remark as “Israel lobby”). In January 2010, Siegman wrote: “Israel has crossed the threshold from the Middle East’s only democracy to the only ‘apartheid regime’ in the Western world.

Just before Russian President Vladimir Putin opened the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, he blasted the Obama administration on Wednesday for what he termed its propaganda on military action against Syria. “We talk with these people,” he said about Secretary of State John Kerry, the administration’s chief political spokesperson making the case for war. “We assume that they are decent. But he lies. And he knows that he lies. That’s pathetic.”
 


Putin has always been a bare-knuckles political brawler with a penchant for saying politically incorrect things about enemies — he once said of Islamist terrorists in Chechnya, for example, “If you are willing to become a radical Islamist and be circumcised, I invite you to Moscow. I will recommend that they perform the operation so that nothing can sprout there again.” Now, however, he’s directly challenging the authority of the United States – and he’s winning. President Obama has always wanted to be perceived as a global leader. Instead, it’s his chief international rival, quasi-dictator Putin, who has seized the reins.

Obama has been left to complain. “Do I hold out hope that Mr. Putin may change his position on some of these issues?” Obama asked in Sweden on Wednesday. “I’m always hopeful, and I will continue to engage him.” Just a few weeks ago, Obama mocked Putin’s posture during their meetings, likening it to a “bored kid in the back of the classroom.”
But it is Obama being schooled. Putin has stated that he would be open to action against Syria if shown proof that Assad ordered the chemical attack there. But on Wednesday, he said of John Kerry, “Of course he lied. And that’s not pretty.” 
The G20 summit has been set not around national security issues, but on tax issues and economic recovery. Nonetheless, it will be Putin setting the agenda on his home turf, especially given that the visiting team is led by a floundering quarterback.

Protestors in South Africa, thought to be affiliated with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, dumped raw sewage at the Cape Town International Airport on Tuesday. President Barack Obama is due to arrive in South Africa on Friday and will speak in Cape Town on Sunday. The protest was linked to a series of ongoing demonstration in the so-called “toilet wars” over sanitation policy in the city. It was not aimed at Obama, but took place against a backdrop of demonstrations and internal battles surrounding Obama’s visit.
Local news sources report that the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), which is technically a governing partner with the ANC, plans to “disrupt” Obama’s visit to the country by staging demonstrations involving thousands of protestors. Cosatu specifically objects to Obama’s foreign policy, which it describes as imperialist and militaristic. Local Muslim groups are joining the protest, too, with the local Muslim Lawyers Association calling on the government to arrest President Obama on his arrival for war crimes.


Several left-wing academics are vowing to boycott Obama’s a ceremony at the University of Johannesburg in which Obama is to receive an honorary doctorate. The centrist Democratic Alliance, meanwhile, has come under fire for attempting to bestow an award on the President and First Lady Michelle Obama. 

Obama’s visit has also affected growing debates around the country’s ailing former president, Nelson Mandela, who is said to be on life support. Mandela’s relatives are engaged in a very public round of infighting over where he should be buried when he dies. There is some speculation that Mandela is being kept on life support until Obama’s visit, though the two are not scheduled to meet. NBC, citing one of Mandela’s daughters, reported Tuesday that Mandela had opened his eyes and smiled when being told of Obama’s imminent arrival in the country, but that report was not confirmed by other sources.

As the scheduled 2014 draw-down of U.S. troops in Afghanistan draws closer, a report of how Obama leaned on a select group of political operatives for foreign policy decisions–including decisions relating to Afghanistan–has been released.
This report seems to confirm fears that Obama has approached foreign policy in ways similar to those followed by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson during the Vietnam War. Like JFK, Obama had a brain trust through whom all decisions were “funneled.” And like LBJ, decisions were then made (or not made) based on how they would impact the political climate at home. 
According to the report, during Obama’s first term: 



The president had a truly disturbing habit of funneling major foreign policy decisions through a small cabal of relatively inexperienced White House advisors whose turf was strictly politics. Their primary concern was how any given action in Afghanistan or the Middle East would play on the nightly news, or which talking point it would give Republicans.

Because this tact was followed, promises of a 2014 troop draw-down have been promulgated to appease Americans who are tired of war. Yet the reality is that an undetermined number of troops, special forces, drones, and operators will remain in Afghanistan long after 2014. 

In saying one thing but doing another, the Obama administration has told the American people exactly what they want to hear, just as LBJ did from 1963 until the TET Offensive in January 1968. And because of this, the war in Afghanistan will still be there for the next administration to end, just as LBJ left Vietnam for Richard Nixon to deal with. 
As the report says, what is perceived as foreign policy prowess on Obama’s part is really not so much “about accomplishments in Afghanistan or the Middle East” as it is “with how U.S. actions in that region have been reshaped to accommodate partisan political concerns.”

I’d like to congratulate the voters of Australia for doing what the voters of America should have done in 2012:
Australia’s conservative leader Tony Abbott swept into office in national elections on Saturday as voters punished the outgoing Labor government for six years of turbulent rule and for failing to maximize the benefits of a now fading mining boom.


Abbott, a former boxer, Rhodes scholar and trainee priest, promised to restore political stability, cut taxes and crack down on asylum seekers arriving by boat.
“From today I declare that Australia is under new management and Australia is once more open for business,” Abbott told jubilant supporters in Sydney.
America, on the other hand, will not be open for business until 2017 at the earliest.

It’s always a mistake to overstate the similarities between different national political environments – the differences are profound in even the most similar countries.  But there are some sharp parallels to be drawn here, particularly on the need for pro-growth tax cuts, and the squandering of a natural resources revolution.  Obama’s War On Energy has some similarities to the way Australians seem to feel their mining boom was wasted:
The election was been pitched as a choice on who is best to lead the A$1.5 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy as it adjusts to an end to a prolonged mining investment boom, fuelled by China’s demand for its abundant natural resources.
Abbott, 55, built up a strong opinion poll lead on the back of promises to rein in government spending, scrap an unpopular tax on carbon emissions, and stop the flow of refugee boats arriving in Australia’s northwest.
His campaign had support from media magnate Rupert Murdoch and his Australian newspapers, which have urged voters to reject Rudd’s Labor government. Australia’s other major newspaper group Fairfax also called for a change of government, saying
Rudd had painted Abbott’s planned spending cuts as dangerous European-style austerity and said his government was best placed to manage an economy that is slowing but remains the envy of much of the developed world.

This is really a golden moment for any aspiring capitalist economy to eat America’s lunch.  We’re years away from being remotely competitive.  The Obama Democrats are hell-bent to double down on his failed policies, not just due to ideological rigidity, but because Obama’s ego will never allow him to admit he’s been fundamentally wrong about everything for five years.  
And the American ruling class has become quite obsessed with using socialist policies to build invulnerable voting coalitions of government dependents.  They take Obama’s re-election as a sign that the American electorate is reasonably comfortable with the New Normal of double-digit real unemployment, expensive gas, a declining standard of living, out-of-control government spending, and all the rest of it.  The bar of economic leadership was lowered to accommodate President Obama; the ruling class doesn’t think it will be raised any time soon.
Now is your moment, aspiring capitalist tigers of the world.  The American workforce is buried under food stamps and long-term disability checks; employers are wrapped in chains of regulation, held tightly shut with the padlocks of ObamaCare.  No corporation in its right mind would relocate into the American quagmire of soaring corporate taxes (with class-warfare battle cries signaling even worse to come), high labor costs, and crushing regulatory burdens.  Every CEO in the world watched Democrats march Apple Inc. executives into a show trial and berate them for daring to keep their offshore revenue offshore, instead of bringing it home so Uncle Sam could cut himself a thick slice.  They all watched Obama and his party present irresponsible government deficits as an argument for tax increases, rather than government reform.  
A weakened America has turned away from its bedrock principles of economic liberty.  A huge void is waiting to be filled.

Spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that the State Department has not decided if it will comply with a congressional subpoena demanding documents related to the crafting of Benghazi talking points for Susan Rice.
Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) sent a five-page letter on Tuesday explaining why he as chair of the Oversight Committee issued the subpoena and what documents he expects to be delivered by June 7th. 
Issa is requiring the release of more emails between top Administration officials regarding Benghazi talking points given to Ambassador Susan Rice before her appearance on Sunday talk shows the weekend after the Benghazi attack. The Congressman claims that the emails previously given to the House committee were “incomplete” and noted these documents were released to the press five days before they were given to Congress.


Asked about the State Department’s response to the letter, Psaki praised the “unprecedented degree of cooperation with Congress” on the issue of Benghazi. “But of course, we remain committed, as we have consistently been, to working with Congress,” Psaki added. The Spokeswoman said that the Department is “taking stock” and “determining the next appropriate steps.”

“You haven’t yet decided whether or not the State Department will be providing the documents that are in the subpoena?” a reporter asked Psaki. “That’s correct,” she responded.
Read the transcript and watch the video below:


QUESTION: New topic? Yesterday, Chairman Issa sent a letter to Secretary Kerry and issued a subpoena for documents relating to the development of the talking points used by Susan Rice and communications between 10 current and former State officials. Do you have a reaction? Has he responded? And does the Department intend on complying with the – I believe it’s June 7th deadline for supplying these documents?
MS. PSAKI: Well, let me just remind everyone since given the opportunity that we have demonstrated unprecedented – an unprecedented degree of cooperation with Congress on the issue of Benghazi, engaging now in nearly 40 hearings, briefing members of staff, and – members and staff – and sharing over 25,000 pages of documents with committees.
On this specific issue, you’ll recall that a hundred pages of documents on the talking points were released just weeks ago. They were inclusive of the emails around this issue, and from our perspective, the CIA-led interagency process, as we now know through which these talking points were developed, has been thoroughly addressed publicly.
But of course, we remain committed, as we have consistently been, to working with Congress, and we are taking stock of this recent subpoena and determining the next appropriate steps.
QUESTION: Since a hundred pages of emails were actually sent to them and everybody observed it, and in fact, there was a lot of backtracking on initial content and so on, what else – what is being subpoenaed?
MS. PSAKI: I encourage you to ask Chairman Issa that question.
QUESTION: Has the Secretary responded?
MS. PSAKI: No. I just said we’re determining the next appropriate steps.
QUESTION: So just a quick follow-up to that just for clarity. So when you say you’re determining the next appropriate steps, you haven’t yet decided whether or not the State Department will be providing the documents that are in the subpoena?
MS. PSAKI: That’s correct. But we have provided, just as a reminder, of course, a hundred pages of documents on the talking points that this is regarding.

            QUESTION: Secretary Kerry was speaking with reporters in Brussels, and he said Tamerlan went to Chechnya and, quote, “learned something” and, quote, “came back with a willingness to kill people.” What did he mean when he said that, and what did he mean he learned when he was in Chechnya?MR. VENTRELL: Well, again, first of all, as I’ve said repeatedly here, there’s an ongoing FBI investigation. The Secretary was simply expressing broad concern about radicalism and not necessarily offering any more specific information about this case. But the context of how that came up was really – radicalism broadly, I understand, is how the question came up. But this isn’t about any new information or conclusion about law enforcement details of this case.QUESTION: Let me just – because I want to be clear on this point. From reading the transcript – no U.S. press were present, so we are reading the transcript – it seems that Kerry is suggesting that Tamerlan was radicalized during his time in Russia. You’re saying that that is not what he meant to say and that he was speaking more broadly about radicalization.MR. VENTRELL: Right. I’m clarifying his remarks and saying that he was simply expressing broad concern about radicalism. This isn’t about new details about the ongoing investigation.QUESTION: So when he learned something, it was about radicalism, but he learned about radicalism; he wasn’t radicalized? That doesn’t make too much sense to me.MR. VENTRELL: Again, my understanding of this informal press availability is that there was a question broadly about terrorism and foreign fighters, and it was in that context that he was saying that people can be radicalized by extremism. But this isn’t about drawing any conclusions about the specific law enforcement investigation.QUESTION: So what did he learn? He learned something.MR. VENTRELL: Again, we’re not getting into any more details about the —QUESTION: Right. But you put out a statement and the clarification doesn’t clarify anything. So did he learn – was he radicalized in Russia?MR. VENTRELL: Again, I’m not in a position to say one way or another on that. I really refer you to the law enforcement authorities investigating this.

The New York Times had a reporter talking to attackers on the ground during the Benghazi attacks that killed four Americans in September of 2012, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, and that reporter may know the identity of some of the murderers and perpetrators.
David Kirkpatrick is the Times reporter who wrote the story that forced the paper’s Editorial page editor to defensively declare on Monday that it has not chosen to endorse Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. The editor said that the paper had a reporter on the ground who was witnessing the attacks. 


That admission is even in Kirpatrick’s story, which, as Breitbart News reported, has received considerable blowback for attempting to “whitewash the Benghazi tragedy.” The Times alleges that there was no al-Qaeda involvement in the attacks that killed four Americans (contradicting the paper’s own reporting), that murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens had “little understanding” of the region, and that the terrorists were motivated by an anti-Muhammed YouTube video:

Soon scores, if not hundreds, of others were racing to the scene. Some arrived with guns, some with cameras. The attackers had posted sentries at Venezia Road, adjacent to the compound, to guard their rear flank, but they let pass anyone trying to join the mayhem. Witnesses said young men rushing inside had left empty pickup trucks from Ansar al-Shariah, but also all the other big militias ostensibly allied with the government.
There is no doubt that anger over the video motivated many attackers. A Libyan journalist working for The New York Times was blocked from entering by the sentries outside, and he learned of the film from the fighters who stopped him. Other Libyan witnesses, too, said they received lectures from the attackers about the evil of the film and the virtue of defending the prophet.

Kirkpatrick tweeted Monday night that the Times had “a reporter on the scene talking to the attackers during the attack.” His tweet prompted those on Twitter, including a former U.N. spokesperson for George W. Bush, to wonder if the Times knew who the attackers were and whether the reporter who was on the ground witnessed the murder of a U.S. Ambassador without calling for help:

Former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE), who awaits a vote this week on his confirmation as Secretary of Defense, had failed to provide the Senate Armed Services Committee with more than a few speeches dating to January 2008. Since then, at least two missing speeches within that timeframe have been identified: one to the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, for which a video was eventually found, and the other to Georgetown University, of which no text or recording has been provided. 
Now a third speech has surfaced: an address by Hagel to the U.S. Middle East Project (USMEP), which advocates aggressive U.S. pressure in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.


Hagel delivered the keynote address to the Annual Meeting of the International Board of USMEP. Photographs of the event were published on the group’s website, including the one above (with Brent Scowcroft, former adviser to President George H.W. Bush, seated next to Hagel) but no video or text of Hagel’s speech was published.

In 2009, Hagel co-authored a USMEP report that called for U.S. troops to be deployed to Israel and Palestine in the future to patrol the boundaries of the new Palestinian state. The report also indicated that peace could be “imposed” from the outside, and that it should be pursued regardless of “certain domestic constituencies.” Hagel serves on the board of USMEP with a variety of individuals with a strong interest in Middle East diplomacy.
The president of USMEP, Henry Siegman, is known for making radical and inflammatory statements. He attacked Sen. Lindsey Graham for questioning Hagel about the former Senator’s comments on the “Jewish lobby” (Siegman sanitized Hagel’s remark as “Israel lobby”). In January 2010, Siegman wrote: “Israel has crossed the threshold from the Middle East’s only democracy to the only ‘apartheid regime’ in the Western world. Hagel has been alleged of using the same analogy to predict Israel’s future if a peace agreement is not reached.

President Barack Obama was once criticized for his “apology tour” around the globe, in which he bowed to Islamic leaders and admitted America’s faults. Now, he is making other western leaders apologize. In a surprise move before leaving Israel, President Obama encouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apologize to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for the death of nine Gaza flotilla activists in 2010.
The media hailed President Obama’s achievement, calling it a “diplomatic win” and a “diplomatic coup.” Netanyahu’s apology “resolved a bitter three-year dispute,” the New York Times reported, “handing the president a solid accomplishment.” According to the terms of the deal, Turkey and Israel were to restore normal diplomatic ties, and Turkey was to drop its sensational prosecutions of Israeli generals over the flotilla incident.


On Friday, the White House released a statement hailing “the restoration of positive relations” between Israel and Turkey as a result of Netanyahu’s apparently forced apology over the flotilla raid. A day later, however, Turkey appeared to renege on the deal, with Erdogan telling the Turkish press that it was too soon to send a new ambassador to Israel or to stop the show-trial prosecutions, despite President Obama’s assurances.
Turkey appears to have pocketed Israel’s apology and changed the terms of the deal–or else the deal was never what reporters were led to believe. Instead of a diplomatic “coup,” what President Obama appears to have achieved is the humiliation of an ally for the simple act of having defended itself from terrorism. The principle that the apology has established could have negative security implications for Israel and the U.S. as well.
The deaths occurred in 2010 aboard the Mavi Marmara, which was attempting to run a blockade that Israel has established around Gaza to prevent shipments of weapons and weapons-making material to Hamas and other terror groups. There were several other ships in the flotilla, which Israeli commandos stopped and boarded without incident. But passengers on the Mavi Marmara, who included radical Islamists, attacked the Israelis.

The flotilla was organized by a Turkish organization calling itself the Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH. The IHH calls itself a charity but operates as a front for jihadists and has a record of providing logistical support to terrorists as well as accepting money from terrorist financiers. It enjoys the protection and support of Erdogan and his ruling party, who supported the flotilla and its goal of breaking the blockade of Hamas in Gaza.
Similar flotillas and marches have been organized by international anti-Israel activists, including former Obama associates (and domestic terrorists) Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dorhn, who led a “Freedom March” to Gaza in late December 2009. Israel already lets humanitarian aid and some commercial goods into Gaza, but restricts specific materials that can be used to build the kind of deadly rockets fired during President Obama’s visit.
Relations with Turkey are important to Israel. The two once enjoyed close security ties, and both are concerned about the civil war in Syria and Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Yet the Erdogan government has been steering Turkey in an Islamist direction, which includes hostility to Israel. That policy was not appeased by Netanyahu’s apology. Instead, the apology appears to have indicated to Erdogan that he can press for more concessions.
It is possible that Netanyahu may have agreed to apologize in exchange for support by President Obama for a potential pre-emptive strike on Iran. Regardless, it is clear that he would not have apologized without Obama’s involvement. In September 2011, Netanyahu flatly refused to apologize to Turkey for actions taken in self-defense, saying: “We do not need to apologize for working to defend our children, our citizens and our cities.”
It is now becoming equally clear that the gesture now described as a “diplomatic coup” by President Obama was anything but. The apology was merely a capitulation that is being celebrated by Hamas as well as Turkey, with Hamas calling it the first step to “ending the political and economic blockade.” What the New York Times called “a win-win for all sides” now looks like a win for radical Islam and terror at Israel and the West’s expense.

For those who believe in human rights and liberty, the sight of our president bounding up some stairs to energetically shake hands with Raul Castro, dictator of Cuba, was more than a little unsettling — regardless of the circumstance. But that’s what President Obama seemed to go out of his way to do at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service Tuesday. Although Castro has imprisoned American Alan Gross for four years now, CNN alternately applauded and made excuses for the handshake.

Obviously worried that shaking hands with a dictator might hurt Obama politically, the media were quick to play goalie. CNN’s Chris Cuomo went so far as to read Obama’s mind and report on the president’s true intent:

And that handshake obviously was a huge moment. But not to be misunderstood, the handshake with Raul Castro, the president of Cuba, we believe was President Obama showing respect to Nelson Mandela and the occasion of today, the spirit of reconciliation. Of course, it will be dissected politically. … 
No matter the ongoing political disputes, on this day, it was about something bigger. It was about forgiveness and reconciliation, because it was about a man who was bigger: Nelson Mandela. And that is what the tribute has been all about today. 
Cuomo never bothered to mention that Castro is a dictator.  
UPDATE: Reporting during the 9am hour, CNN’s Jim Acosta said that  it “would have been sort of impolite” for Obama not to shake hands with Raul Castro. Carol Costello suggested that the handshake “surely helps” to thaw the Cold War mentality between Cuba and America. Acosta reminded Costello that Cuba is in its fourth year of holding American Alan Gross. At no time did Costello or Acosta correctly refer to Castro as what he is: a dictator. 
The Weekly Standard grabbed CNN video of an excited Chrstiane Amanpour: “Castro, he’s shaking hands with Raúl Castro! … This is a man, it is so true, who brought people together in life and he continues to bring people together today.”

Because everyone in the elite media either coordinates or thinks alike (it has to be one or the other), moments later the USA Today’s Susan Page tweeted out the exact same spin.

Several members of Congress joined representatives of the special forces military veterans and grassroots organizations on Tuesday to launch an effort to force the House to have a thorough, public investigation into the terrorist attack at Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012.
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) has introduced legislation to create a special select committee to investigate both the terrorist attack and subsequent actions by President Barack Obama’s administration and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department. Wolf’s bill has 161 co-sponsors. House GOP Leadership has not scheduled a vote on the bill. 
Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) plans to harness the support for Wolf’s bill into a “discharge petition” that would force a floor vote on the bill. The petition would need to be signed by 218 members of the House. 


“I’m going to describe what a discharge petition is because a lot of people have asked me questions exactly what it is,” Stockman said at the Tuesday press conference outside the U.S. Capitol building. “It’s to ask our leadership or actually demand from our leadership that we have a vote on Frank Wolf’s bill. [Wolf is] a congressman from Virginia who has a long history of being here and is articulate in demanding that we have an independent investigation.”
Stockman added, while gesturing to blown up photographs behind him of the four Americans murdered in Benghazi, “if Congress is silenced,” then “the blood of these folks behind us is on our hands.”
“We can’t be silent any more,” he said. “It’s been a year going by that we haven’t had justice. These folks demand justice. They cry out for justice. Silence is not an option any more. We’re going to challenge them. We’re going to have a discharge petition. I encourage you to contact your congressman to sign the discharge petition.”  

Stockman expects most or all of the 161 members on Wolf’s bill to support the discharge petition, and at the press conference specifically said House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) is supportive of circumventing House Leadership via the discharge petition.
Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Dick Brauer, the founder of Special Operations Speaks, said the combination of Wolf’s bill and Stockman’s discharge petition “would be done to fully investigate, something that has not been done to date, the national tragedy in Benghazi, where we lost four great citizens in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.”
“You will hear this from me and others today but we need your help and your friends’ help and everybody else’s to make this happen because it’s our one chance to do something before the anniversary of that tragedy which will occur about seven weeks from now,” Brauer said.
At the press conference, Brauer’s group unrolled an enormous scroll of a petition that includes the signatures of about a thousand special forces veterans joining the call for this investigation. “What you see on my left is a one of a kind. I don’t think it’s ever been done before: a four-foot-by-sixty-foot copy of the Special Operations Speaks petition that we sent to the House of Representatives on the Eighth of April asking for this select committee with subpoena power,” Brauer said. “The scroll is signed by nearly 1,000 special operations veterans, from the rank of Lieutenant General Three Stars down to every other rank you can imagine, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, all of them passionate about what we’re trying to do.”
Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), a congressman who supports the discharge petition, said at the press conference that he was asked by a reporter recently about Benghazi: “Gee, that was so long ago. Do we really want to pursue this now?”

“I told the reporter that when I was a judge handling felony cases, I had defendants ask me that question – ‘that was so long ago, do we really need to get into all this now?’ I can tell you when the blood of American patriots cries out, when the blood of individuals who were sent there into harm’s way, knowing how dangerous it was in Benghazi, and especially two former SEALs who were even told to ‘Stand Down’ but they wouldn’t have it,” Gohmert said. “They went to save lives and that’s exactly what they did. They even recruited another State Department man, a former army ranger, to go up there on the rooftop with them. What they knew from the first moment mortars were fired was that this was an organized, well-prepared attack on our people. We need to get to the bottom of it. Their blood cries out for that.”
Former Florida Republican Rep. Allen West concurred with the others there, adding: “If it’s more important to some people in Washington, D.C., to protect President Obama and to protect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I say shame on you. Every single member of the United States House of Representatives should have their name on this discharge petition. If their name is not on that discharge petition, you are complicit in this cover-up of what happened.”
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy said that if the truth is not uncovered in Benghazi, a terrorist attack like it is likely to happen again. “I believe that this is not likely to be an isolated incident,” Gaffney said at the press conference “If we don’t learn the lessons of what happened in Benghazi, how we got to there, what we did on the occasion and what has happened in the aftermath, you can be sure there will be other Americans who end with the same fate.”
Bob Adams, the president and founder of grassroots group Revive America which has been rallying members of Congress behind the calls for a real investigation into Benghazi, placed the blame for the lack of a real investigation at the feet of House GOP leadership.
“When Revive America first joined this fight back in March, only 48 House Republicans had mustered the courage to stand as cosponsors of this bill,” Adams said. “Frankly, the level of support at that time was an embarrassment. But over the next several weeks, after thousands of Americans had deluged Congress with a flood of phone calls, emails and personal visits, support for the House Select Committee soared to what is today 161 cosponsors. That’s over two thirds of all House Republicans.”
“But today only one person really stands in the way of a full and public investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attack in Benghazi. It’s not President Obama. It’s really not even Hillary Rodham Clinton, or Eric Holder. That one person is none other than House Speaker John Boehner.”

Hundreds of Egyptians – Christian and Muslim alike – gathered outside the White House Thursday afternoon to call attention to the plight of Coptic Christians and denounce what they see as the Obama administration’s tepid response to a recent spate of church burnings.
“Down, Down with Ikhwan!” they chanted in reference to the Muslim Brotherhood. Since Egypt’s army cracked down on Muslim Brotherhood protesters, the Islamist group and its supporters have torched dozens of churches and attacked Christians.


Muslim women in hijabs could be seen mingling among their Christian neighbors and joining in the chants.
Protesters later marched to the headquarters of the Washington Post and CNN to express anger at the lack of coverage given to the attacks on Egyptian Christians. Then they went to the Council on American Islamic Relations’ (CAIR) headquarters. Protest organizers consider CAIR to be the Muslim Brotherhood’s “embassy” in Washington.
The sight of hundreds of angry protesters outside its building prompted theWashington Post to lock down its lobby.

Protesters defended the Egyptian military’s decision to forcefully clear out the Muslim Brotherhood protesters staging sit-ins in Cairo, and they chided the Obama administration for condemning the military’s action.

“Egypt right now is dealing with terrorists,” said protester Sherif Mina. “I mean, he’s talking about peaceful demonstrations in Egypt by the Muslim Brotherhood. Is it peaceful when you carry machine guns, and artillery weapons – and all these kinds of torture that they’ve done to the Egyptian people, and the neighborhoods that they were sitting in?”
Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged the popular Egyptian belief that the military intervened at the request of the people. But talk of cutting off U.S. aid in the wake of the army’s crackdown – in which hundreds were killed – seems to have reinforced protesters’ perceptions that the Obama administration has sided with the Brotherhood.
Many Egyptians now consider the Muslim Brotherhood to be a terrorist organization that destroyed the fabric of Egyptian society during its year in power, protesters said. That belief was proven by street protests against President Mohamed Morsi – the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate – which drew an estimated 30 million Egyptians. American foreign policy should back the majority of Egyptians who do not want the Muslim Brotherhood back, protesters said.

They also called for a secular, free and democratic Egypt.
Basic necessities became scarce under Muslim Brotherhood rule, electricity became sporadic, gas lines were common, and poor Egyptians were being hurt by the declining value of the Egyptian Pound by the time 30 million Egyptians took to the streets to say they had enough.

As the army violently clamped down, Islamists turned to Egypt’s Christian minority as easy scapegoats or accused the military of promoting “Islamophobia.” But that didn’t fly with Muslims who joined Thursday’s protest in Washington.

“All of the Egyptians they are found the Muslim Brotherhood they are just failures and liars about everything they are told us they will do it in my country,” said Nessma Salem, an Egyptian Muslim woman who came from New York to attend the rally. “Unfortunately they make a lot of other things. They don’t want to even admit they are liars. So the problem is all the Muslims, and all the Christians, and all of the Egyptian people they are just go to all of the street again after two years. They told us they do not want the Muslim Brotherhood to control the whole country again because they are failures and unfortunately they are support definitely terrorists.”

Other protesters shared her angst about the damage done to Egypt’s economy under Muslim Brotherhood rule. Given the massive popular outcry, Morsi’s removal from office was not a coup.

“[30] million people came out in the street saying we don’t want this regime. It’s a terror regime – a terrorist regime killing everyone,” said protester Fred Soliman. “They tried to rule the country by themselves and not share it with anyone else, so the whole country, the whole country [30] million people all over Egypt. They say no to that regime.”
President Obama has not mentioned Coptic Christians by name since the violence began. The closest he came was a brief, veiled reference to churches being attacked by Islamists last week. “We call on those who are protesting to do so peacefully and condemn the attacks that we’ve seen by protesters, including on churches,” he said. The State Department has issued several statements condemning the attacks on the over 60 churches over the past week, but the Copts feel these statements have not been forceful enough.
These tepid statements, together with the perception that the Obama administration was excessively deferential to the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in power, fueled their resentment.

“We as the Coptic Christians of Egypt would like to live in peace, would like the Egyptians to decide their future. We don’t want anyone to interfere in our future, would like the American government as well to the media to listen to all of the parties and to decide it by themselves,” said Fr. Mikhail E. Mikhail of St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in Seven Hills, Ohio. “…We are here to say that what happened in Egypt is a revolution from the people, not a military rebellion.”
“The army is not going to rule in Egypt,” Mikhail said. “They chose a Supreme Court judge to be in the transition period, and at the same time they have a plan to give it to a civilian government. We want Egypt to be civilian and for Egypt to separate between religion and state like you do here in the United States of America.”

As the Egyptian military effectively declared a coup, overthrowing the elected government of repressive Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi, the Obama administration struggled to come up with a coherent strategy to deal with the situation. 
President Obama released a statement on Morsi’s ouster, suggesting that his administration “does not support particular individuals or political parties, but we are committed to the democratic process and respect for the law.” With those principles in mind, Obama declared himself “deeply concerned” and called for a transition to civilian rule. He refused to state whether the United States would withdraw aid to Egypt, saying only that he had directed a comprehensive review process.


Simultaneously, the State Department, which issued a mandatory evacuation order to non-essential personnel on Wednesday, said it would not take sides in the Egyptian situation. “We haven’t taken sides and don’t plan to take sides here,” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.
In an embarrassing signifier of the level of chaos plaguing the administration, Secretary of State John Kerry called into the top level meetings from a secure phone. According to CBS producer Mosheh Oinounou, Kerry was on the “Isabel” on Wednesday afternoon. Oinounou said that when another CBS producer yelled “Morsi!” to Kerry, she received no response. Oinounou tweeted this photo:


Later, Oinounou reported that the State Department denies his claim that CBS reporters saw Kerry aboard his yacht; the State Department maintains that Kerry has been working on Egypt “all day.”
Whether Kerry was working all day or not on the strategy, it’s clear that confusion reigns at the highest levels. President Obama in Cairo in 2009 decried the “overthrow of a democratically-elected Iranian government” in the 1950s; when Honduras’ military ousted a would-be dictator, the Obama administration originally kicked back before caving. Now, it seems that the administration can’t label the military coup a military coup, and won’t label it a democratic movement.
President Obama isn’t even leading from behind at this point, simply because he can’t tell which direction is behind.
NOTE: This post has been edited to reflect the State Department’s denial of the original CBS report regarding Kerry’s presence on his yacht.

For those who believe in human rights and liberty, the sight of our president bounding up some stairs to energetically shake hands with Raul Castro, dictator of Cuba, was more than a little unsettling — regardless of the circumstance. But that’s what President Obama seemed to go out of his way to do at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service Tuesday. Although Castro has imprisoned American Alan Gross for four years now, CNN alternately applauded and made excuses for the handshake.

Obviously worried that shaking hands with a dictator might hurt Obama politically, the media were quick to play goalie. CNN’s Chris Cuomo went so far as to read Obama’s mind and report on the president’s true intent:

And that handshake obviously was a huge moment. But not to be misunderstood, the handshake with Raul Castro, the president of Cuba, we believe was President Obama showing respect to Nelson Mandela and the occasion of today, the spirit of reconciliation. Of course, it will be dissected politically. … 
No matter the ongoing political disputes, on this day, it was about something bigger. It was about forgiveness and reconciliation, because it was about a man who was bigger: Nelson Mandela. And that is what the tribute has been all about today. 
Cuomo never bothered to mention that Castro is a dictator.  
UPDATE: Reporting during the 9am hour, CNN’s Jim Acosta said that  it “would have been sort of impolite” for Obama not to shake hands with Raul Castro. Carol Costello suggested that the handshake “surely helps” to thaw the Cold War mentality between Cuba and America. Acosta reminded Costello that Cuba is in its fourth year of holding American Alan Gross. At no time did Costello or Acosta correctly refer to Castro as what he is: a dictator. 
The Weekly Standard grabbed CNN video of an excited Chrstiane Amanpour: “Castro, he’s shaking hands with Raúl Castro! … This is a man, it is so true, who brought people together in life and he continues to bring people together today.”

Because everyone in the elite media either coordinates or thinks alike (it has to be one or the other), moments later the USA Today’s Susan Page tweeted out the exact same spin.

16132	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/11/26/Valerie-Jarrett-Chicago-and-the-Iran-Deal	Opinion	0	International News	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Last week, the Times of Israel reported that senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett had been leading talks with Iran in secret for a year before the formal negotiations in Geneva this month. While the White House denied the report “100 percent,” the existence of back-channel talks has been confirmed by other reporting. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that President Barack Obama had “personally overseen” the talks.
Almost anything “personally overseen” by the President Obama is likely to bear the heavy stamp of Ms. Jarrett, who is the president’s closest adviser, despite a shocking track record of failure. In foreign policy, her most important mistake was her effort to dissuade the president from proceeding with the raid on Osama bin Laden. It was one of the few times that President Obama overruled her counsel–and one of his few successes.


Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is cause for concern for three additional reasons–two minor and one major. One minor reason is that she was born there. That should not automatically disqualify anyone, of course, any more than being born in the Soviet Union would have disqualified an anti-Soviet dissident. But Jarrett was born in 1956 to American expatriates in the aftermath of the CIA-assisted coup that deposed Mohammad Mossadegh.

The Iranian regime remains obsessed with the Mossadegh coup as proof of America’s innate evil–and for decades, some Americans have felt a sense of post-colonial guilt about it. That feeling may be particularly acute for an American born in the shadow of that event. The temptation to show contrition by acceding to Iran’s goals, as a kind of restorative justice, could well shape Jarrett’s involvement, and Obama’s approach.
The second minor reason to worry about Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is her political background. Her entrée into the world of left-wing politics in Chicago was through her father-in-law, Vernon Jarrett, a journalist with somewhat radical views. Jarrett spoke out against antisemitism in the black community, for example, but also took anti-Israel stands, accusing pro-Israel Jews of “support of genocide” in the Lebanon War, for example.
These two reasons for concern are fairly minor, because they are based on mere speculation, and would have to be balanced out by other factors, such as Ms. Jarrett’s personal associations with leaders of the pro-Israel community in Chicago. But the major reason for concern about her role is simply that Jarrett has banished, and repulsed, most of the Obama administration’s most competent appointees from the White House.
One of the most important departures was that of Dennis Ross, who was brought into the White House early in the Obama presidency to advise the president on the Middle East. Ross, who advocated a tough approach to Iran, is widely thought to have been marginalized by the president’s inner circle. He left the White House in 2011, ostensibly because he had only promised to serve two years, but likely because he was not being utilized.
Finally, it is worth noting that Jarrett, despite her expatriate origins, has little experience in international affairs, and is said to manage Obama’s policies through a domestic political lens. If she was as involved in the talks as reports suggest, that could be a major reason for the president’s eagerness to sign almost any deal, even one the French rejected as too weak. In any other administration, she likely would have been ignored.

China’s Ministry of Defense on November 30th began enforcing an expanded Air Defense Identification Zone, which now covers a huge off-shore expanse that includes the disputed oil rich Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. 
Forced to rely on the Middle East for oil for electrical production, Asian energy costs are surging, and supply has become unstable due to the continuing Arab Spring turmoil. With American domestic energy costs falling as supplies surge due to the boom in fracking for shale oil and gas, Chinese manufacturers are becoming economically uncompetitive on a cost basis compared to the U.S. producers. With China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea equally desperate to save jobs by exploiting potentially cheap and abundant off-shore oil, energy economics will drive military confrontations in Asia. 
The Chinese claim the discovery and control of the Diaoyu islands from the 14th Century, but Japan took control of the islands from 1895 until its surrender to the U.S. at the end of World War II. During the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands after 1945, it was discovered that oil reserves might be found under the sea near the islands. In anticipation of the turnover of the Senkaku islands, Japan declared a 100 mile ADIZ around the islands in 1969. Since reverting back to Japanese control under the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement, sovereignty around the islands has been disputed by the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, and South Korea. 


The new Chinese rules require that aircraft must ask for permission to fly in the ADIZ; aircraft in the zone must identify and keep in communication with Chinese authorities; all aircraft must “follow the instructions of the administrative organ of the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone”; and warn “China’s armed forces will adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions.” In response to these new Chinese edits, the U.S. flew two unarmed B-52 bombers from Guam on November 25th without notification. Then on 29th, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force scrambled Su-30 and J-11 warplanes in response to 10 flights of Japanese F-15s, E-767s and P-3s; U.S. P-3s and EP-3s; and South Korean fighter jets flying through the ADIZ.
The 1919 Paris Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation recognized the principal of freedom of the skies as an extension of “freedom of the high seas” that limited territorial sea claims of coastal nations to 12 nautical miles off their shores. The Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944 updated air rights, but it was the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which created the framework for exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in waters previously regarded as high seas. The three basic obligations of the treaty: (1) the duty to refrain from the unlawful threat or use of force; (2) the duty to have “due regard” to the rights of others to use the sea; and (3) the duty to observe applicable obligations under other treaties or rules of international law. 
The United States extended what had been its 12 nautical mile territorial sea into a “high seas” Air Defense Identification Zone in response to heightened tensions with the Soviet Union caused by the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. America claims continental ADIZs extending 300 nautical miles in some Atlantic areas and more than 400 nautical miles in Southern California. The United States also maintains ADIZs off the coast of Alaska extending out at least 350 nautical miles into the Bering Sea, similar distance into the Arctic Sea off Alaska’s northern coast, 250 nautical miles around Guam, and up to 250 nautical miles north of the Hawaiian Islands.

The U.S. from 1870 to 1970 dominated manufacturing and won two wars on the back of oil and gas prices that averaged a third of the world’s price. But shrinking domestic production after 1972 destroyed America’s energy cost advantage by the 1980s. Once expanded Middle East oil production equalized energy costs for the world, American manufacturers began relocating jobs to Asia to stay competitive with lower labor costs. 
But U.S. natural gas prices have fallen from $15 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2000 to about $3.50 mcf today. This compares to rising natural gas prices that are $10 mcf in Europe, $12 mcf in China and $17 mcf in Japan. If this cost advantage holds or widens as America exploits its spectacular abundance of shale to frack for oil and gas, Asian employment will fall as huge amounts of manufacturing relocates to the United States. 
No country has more risk from high energy prices than China, which passed the U.S. in 2010 as the world’s largest manufacturer. China passed Russia to grab the number two spot behind the U.S. in defense spending.  Fearing the Peoples’ Liberation Army would become the dominant military power in East Asia, Japan has launched a crash rearmament drive that by next year will have ballooned defense outlays past France and the U.K. to the number four spot, just behind Russia. 
The width of China’s new ADIZ does not extend beyond the international EEZ standard, but according to Stratfor Reports: “Beijing is testing U.S. responses in the Western Pacific, as China attempts to shape a new maritime balance in the area. All sides will use the current standoff to recalibrate the balance of power over energy and maritime geopolitics that, much like during the Cold War.” 
Japan retaliated early this year to China’s growing military assertiveness by extending its ADIZ around the Senkaku Islands by another 15 miles. The current western border of the zone extends at its closest point to just 81 miles off the Chinese mainland. In this escalating tit for tat, between July and September the Japanese military was forced to scramble fighter jets 80 times in response to Chinese warplane and drone intrusions.
Beijing seems distressed enough about the potential loss of millions of manufacturing jobs that they are willing to threaten the use of military force to assert a sphere of influence that will capture most of the off-shore oil and gas drilling rights in the East and South China seas. Facing U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea security agreements, China is employing tools like the ADIZ to force regional competitors to readjust their behavior in light of China’s ambitions and naval heft. 
China’s confrontations may not be intended to lead to a clash, but when armed and dangerous nations play chicken with modern weapons, the risk of a military miscalculation and accidental war accelerates.

President Barack Obama will be visiting South Africa for the second time this year to attend Nelson Mandela’s memorial services. So, too will all other living past U.S. presidents–including Jimmy Carter, who worked with Mandela after the latter retired from politics, and George W. Bush, who did more for Africa than any other but is probably appreciated least. And then there is Bill Clinton, who remains South Africa’s favorite U.S. president–more so even than Obama, who is viewed as a disappointment. Politically, crudely, this is Hillary’s moment.
South Africans love Clinton partly because he happened to be in power when their country made its historic transition. He was there to welcome South Africa back into the international community, and he was there to welcome President Mandela as a fellow world leader. Clinton was also, back then, the “first black president,” and charmed the South African public with the same folksy manner he used to build his political coalition. He was different, too, from other Democrats, seeing potential in globalization, looking for friends rather than foes.


Clinton matched the Mandela mood. Obama, by contrast, has much more in common with Mandela’s successor, Thabo Mbeki, whose top-down leadership, aloof manner, and cronyism made him distinctly unpopular. Like Obama, Mbeki was thin-skinned and divisive, arrogant and jealous of sharing power with the other branches of government.A man who brooked no dissent within the ruling party, and who shunned the opposition, Mbeki left office before finishing his second term after being ousted as party leader by the populist Jacob Zuma. 

Zuma has been sour on Obama ever since the Libya war. The South African government had maintained close ties with Muammar Gadhafi, dating back to the anti-apartheid struggle, and saw him as one of the continent’s few unifying figures, comical though he often was. Gadhafi had backed one of South Africa’s most important diplomatic projects, the African Union. His ouster was seen by the South African government as more of the same interventionism it had decried when Bush invaded Iraq. Obama, then, was seen as something of a sellout.
South Africans still like Obama and his family. They vastly prefer him to any of his Republican opponents, the more so as American conservatives get extremely bad press in South Africa (as they do in much of the social democratic world). But they also know a failure when they see one, and Obama’s failure in nearly every aspect of his presidency has not failed to make an impression. Clinton, by contrast, is remembered, mostly correctly, as having been a success. His America was a confident one, buoyed by prosperity and a post-Cold War glow.
I was once in the audience at a speech by Bill Clinton at the University of the Western Cape. I wore an American flag in my baseball cap, attracting hostile stares from some in the academic audience, for whom skepticism of the U.S. is fundamental intellectual principle. And yet as soon as Clinton reached the stage–looking tired and haggard, thin from months of dieting–the same people leapt to their feet in rapt applause. In his flaws, South Africans see their own failures. In his successes, they somehow see their hopes. He is the America they love.
Obama is the America of the South African elites, envious of America’s success and eager to see it more humble on the world stage. He says the right things about the need for government. He comes bearing gifts. But most South Africans are tired of Obama’s exhortations about transformation. They have heard the same from their own leaders for years. Bill Clinton knows how to bypass the dogma and go straight to the heart. He won over Israelis at Yitzchak Rabin’s funeral with: “Shalom, chaver. Goodbye, friend.” Expect something of an encore.
And expect Hillary Clinton to make the most of the moment. This is her chance, finally, to eclipse the man who beat her to the top with the help of a fawning media and disloyal superdelegates. This is her chance to overcome the spurious but effective charges of racism that the Obama campaign used against her to undermine her among black voters. She will know how to place herself in the media spotlight without seeming to have done so, and will make the best use of her husband’s popularity, the better to cast herself as his true American successor.

16153	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/03/24/New-Apology-Tour-Same-Result-Turkey-Reneges-on-Israel-Deal	Opinion	0	International News	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
President Barack Obama was once criticized for his “apology tour” around the globe, in which he bowed to Islamic leaders and admitted America’s faults. Now, he is making other western leaders apologize. In a surprise move before leaving Israel, President Obama encouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apologize to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey for the death of nine Gaza flotilla activists in 2010.
The media hailed President Obama’s achievement, calling it a “diplomatic win” and a “diplomatic coup.” Netanyahu’s apology “resolved a bitter three-year dispute,” the New York Times reported, “handing the president a solid accomplishment.” According to the terms of the deal, Turkey and Israel were to restore normal diplomatic ties, and Turkey was to drop its sensational prosecutions of Israeli generals over the flotilla incident.


On Friday, the White House released a statement hailing “the restoration of positive relations” between Israel and Turkey as a result of Netanyahu’s apparently forced apology over the flotilla raid. A day later, however, Turkey appeared to renege on the deal, with Erdogan telling the Turkish press that it was too soon to send a new ambassador to Israel or to stop the show-trial prosecutions, despite President Obama’s assurances.
Turkey appears to have pocketed Israel’s apology and changed the terms of the deal–or else the deal was never what reporters were led to believe. Instead of a diplomatic “coup,” what President Obama appears to have achieved is the humiliation of an ally for the simple act of having defended itself from terrorism. The principle that the apology has established could have negative security implications for Israel and the U.S. as well.
The deaths occurred in 2010 aboard the Mavi Marmara, which was attempting to run a blockade that Israel has established around Gaza to prevent shipments of weapons and weapons-making material to Hamas and other terror groups. There were several other ships in the flotilla, which Israeli commandos stopped and boarded without incident. But passengers on the Mavi Marmara, who included radical Islamists, attacked the Israelis.

The flotilla was organized by a Turkish organization calling itself the Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH. The IHH calls itself a charity but operates as a front for jihadists and has a record of providing logistical support to terrorists as well as accepting money from terrorist financiers. It enjoys the protection and support of Erdogan and his ruling party, who supported the flotilla and its goal of breaking the blockade of Hamas in Gaza.
Similar flotillas and marches have been organized by international anti-Israel activists, including former Obama associates (and domestic terrorists) Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dorhn, who led a “Freedom March” to Gaza in late December 2009. Israel already lets humanitarian aid and some commercial goods into Gaza, but restricts specific materials that can be used to build the kind of deadly rockets fired during President Obama’s visit.
Relations with Turkey are important to Israel. The two once enjoyed close security ties, and both are concerned about the civil war in Syria and Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Yet the Erdogan government has been steering Turkey in an Islamist direction, which includes hostility to Israel. That policy was not appeased by Netanyahu’s apology. Instead, the apology appears to have indicated to Erdogan that he can press for more concessions.
It is possible that Netanyahu may have agreed to apologize in exchange for support by President Obama for a potential pre-emptive strike on Iran. Regardless, it is clear that he would not have apologized without Obama’s involvement. In September 2011, Netanyahu flatly refused to apologize to Turkey for actions taken in self-defense, saying: “We do not need to apologize for working to defend our children, our citizens and our cities.”
It is now becoming equally clear that the gesture now described as a “diplomatic coup” by President Obama was anything but. The apology was merely a capitulation that is being celebrated by Hamas as well as Turkey, with Hamas calling it the first step to “ending the political and economic blockade.” What the New York Times called “a win-win for all sides” now looks like a win for radical Islam and terror at Israel and the West’s expense.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said on Laura Ingraham’s radio program that House Speaker John Boehner’s speakership is in jeopardy if any form of amnesty, such as the Senate’s immigration reform bill, becomes law.  
“I’m worried about conference,” Paul said Friday, according to Roll Call. “The only way to avoid a problem with conference is for the speaker of the House to say we are not going to conference, and we will not allow a vote on anything coming out of conference that resembles the Senate bill, and if there were a much more limited bill that emphasizes border security first, that we would do that.”


“Conference” refers to a legislative process wherein after the House passes its own immigration bill, it will enter negotiations with Senate leaders and even the White House to reconcile the differences between the two chambers’ bills. Conservative lawmakers fear that in conference, Boehner would allow Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to include a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the final law submitted to President Barack Obama.

Paul asserted that if Boehner passes anything like the Senate bill, conservatives in the House will more than likely drive him out of office.
“If he allows something to pass out of conference that looks anything like the Senate bill and is passed with a majority of Democrats, I think that will be the final thing he does as speaker,” Paul said. “So, I think he knows that, and I think he’s going to be very cautious, and I hope he will defend us on this and not pass something that looks like the Senate bill.”
Boehner has agreed that any bill, or conference committee report, that would be voted on would need the support of the majority of House Republicans before receiving a vote in the House. But Boehner has not agreed to kill the Senate bill once and for all by saying no House immigration bill, or group of bills, would be allowed to go to conference with it.
According to The Hill, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the GOP’s most recent vice presidential candidate who with Mitt Romney lost to President Obama almost a year ago, is working with the Chamber of Commerce to finalize a deal on immigration legislation.

Reuters is still blaming the YouTube video, Innocence of Muslims,  for the attacks on the US consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. This is from an article they published on Sunday, August 18, 2013:

U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in Libya’s Benghazi in 2012 when Islamist gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate during a protest by a mob angry over a film they said insulted the Prophet Mohammad.

This claim, first made by then-US Ambassador Susan Rice on all Sunday morning shows, has been debunked many times. Here are a few examples:
October 9, 2012 – Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick F. Kennedy said the attacks in Benghazi were a coordinated terrorist attack. They were planned and organized.


October 27, 2012 – Libyan witnesses said it was an organized attack.

December 19, 2012 – Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Accountability Review Board released their report on Benghazi and never mentioned a protest or the YouTube video.
March 6, 2013 – Documents turned over by the administration show the Libyan officials knew an attack was going to happen and warned Washington, D.C.
May 8, 2013 – During the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Benghazi, Gregory Hicks testified the YouTube video was a non-issue in Libya. He said he was embarrassed and stunned when he saw Rice claim there was a protest over the video. 
August 6, 2013 – CNN airs a Benghazi special and it also destroys the YouTube/protest narrative. Erin Burnett reported US Ambassador Christopher Stevens had to change his running route because terrorists posted it on the internet. He knew and warned DC many times an attack was going to happen. He requested extra security many times.
The YouTube video had nothing to do with the Benghazi attack. There was not a protest in Benghazi.

CBS News is reporting that Benghazi witness Greg Hicks told congressional investigators that  “a team of Special Forces prepared to fly from Tripoli to Benghazi during the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks was forbidden from doing so by U.S. Special Operations Command South Africa.”
Hicks also reported that SOCAFRICA commander Lt. Col. Gibson and his team were prepared to board a C130 from Tripoli before the attack on the Benghazi annex. Gibson received a call saying “you can’t go now, you don’t have the authority to go now.’ And so they missed the flight … They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it.”


If a force had left Tripoli to head to Benghazi, Hicks said it might have saved the the lives of Ty Woods and Glen Doherty. Instead the attacks went unchallenged.  He went on to surmise that the Libyans “would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.” 
Below is an excerpt of the Hicks’ testimony released from the House Oversight Committee: 
Q: But do you think, you know, if an F-15, if the military had allowed a jet to go fly over, that it might have prevented [the second attack]?

A: Yeah, and if we had gotten clearance from the Libyan military for an American plane to fly over Libyan airspace. The Libyans that I talked to and the Libyans and other Americans who were involved in the war have told me also that Libyan revolutionaries were very cognizant of the impact that American and NATO airpower had with respect to their victory. They are under no illusions that American and NATO airpower won that war for them. And so, in my personal opinion, a fast-mover flying over Benghazi at some point, you know, as soon as possible might very well have prevented some of the bad things that happened that night.
Q : The theory being, the folks on the ground that are doing these — committing these terrorist attacks look up, see a heavy duty airplane above, and decide to hightail it?
A: I believe that if — I believe if we had been able to scramble a fighter or aircraft or two over Benghazi as quickly as possible after the attack commenced, I believe there would not have been a mortar attack on the annex in the morning because I believe the Libyans would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.
Q: I just wanted to ask, you mentioned permission from the Libyans. Why is that important? What did you mean by that?
A: Well, it’s their country. And for an American military aircraft to fly over their country, we have to have permission from them to do so.

Q: So what would have been the risk of — do you think it would have been risky for us to send someone, do you think it would have been counterproductive for us to send a fighter pilot plane over Benghazi without that permission?
A: We would have certainly wanted to obtain that permission. I believe we would have gotten it if we had asked. I believe that the Libyans were hoping that we were going to come bail them out of this mess. And, you know, they were as surprised as we were that American — the military forces that did arrive only arrived on the evening of September 12. Yeah.

Q: So, at this point [at approximately 10:00 pm in Tripoli], you are talking to Washington, you are talking to your RSO Martinec, you are talking to RAO. Are you talking to the Defense Attache?
A: The Defense Attache is there, and he is immediately on the phone to Ministry of Defense and to chief of staff of the Libyan Armed Forces. He also notifies Joint Staff and AFRICOM. Our SOCAFRICA lead, Lieutenant Colonel Gibson, connects with SOCAFRICA in Stuttgart, as well. And, obviously, RAO is also connected back home.
Q: Was there ever any thought at that time of the night to have an F-16, you know, fly over?

A: I called — when we knew that — I talked with the Defense Attache, Lt. Col. Keith Phillips, and I asked him, “Is there anything coming?” And he said that the nearest fighter planes were Aviano, that he had been told that it would take two to three hours to get them airborne, but that there were no tanker assets near enough to support a flight from Aviano.
A: And for the second time that night [Before 5:15 AM attack], I asked the Defense Attache, is there anything coming, is there anything out there to help our people from, you know, big military? And the answer, again, was the same as before.
Q: And what was that answer?
A: The answer was, it’s too far away, there are no tankers, there is nothing, there is nothing that could respond.
Q: So you had mentioned that the first team from Tripoli to Benghazi arrived at 1:15?
A: Right.
Q: And was there a second team that was organized? Could you tell us about the second team?
A: Right. The second team — the Defense Attache worked assiduously all night long to try to get the Libyan military to respond in some way. Early in the morning — sorry, after we were formally notified by the Prime Minister, who called me, that Chris had passed, the Libyan military agreed to fly their C-130 to Benghazi and carry additional personnel to Benghazi as reinforcements. Because we at that time — at that time, the third attack, the mortar attack at 5:15, had not yet occurred, if I remember correctly.
Q: So what time did the second rescue team ??
A: Well, again, they flew — I think that flight took off sometime between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m.
Q: At that point, you are the Chief of Mission?
A: Yeah, I’m Chief of Mission effective 3:00 a.m.
Q: Now, did any of the Special Forces folks, were they planning at any time to travel on that second aircraft?
A: On the second, on the C-130? Yes. We fully intended for those guys to go, because we had already essentially stripped ourselves of our security presence, or our security capability to the bare minimum …
A: So Lieutenant Colonel Gibson, who is the SOCAFRICA commander, his team, you know, they were on their way to the vehicles to go to the airport to get on the C-130 when he got a phone call from SOCAFRICA which said, you can’t go now, you don’t have authority to go now. And so they missed the flight. And, of course, this meant that one of the …Q : They didn’t miss the flight. They were told not to board the flight.
A: They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it. So, anyway, and yeah. I still remember Colonel Gibson, he said, “I have never been so embarrassed in my life that a State Department officer has bigger balls than somebody in the military.” A nice compliment.
Q: Now, at this point, are you having communications with Washington?
A: I was in communications with Washington all night long. I was reporting all night long what was happening to Washington by telephone.
Q: When these Special Forces folks were told essentially to stand down, what was your next move? Did you have a recourse? Were you able to call Washington? Were you able to call anyone at this point to get that decision reversed?
A: No, because the flight was — the flight was leaving. And, you know, if they missed — you know, if the vehicles didn’t leave when they leave, they would miss the flight time at the airport. And the airport — you know, we were going all the way to Mitiga. The C-130 is at Mitiga, which is all the way on the other side of Tripoli.
Q: What was the rationale that you were given that they couldn’t go, ultimately?
A: I guess they just didn’t have the right authority from the right.

Recent events in Egypt put President Barack Obama in a tough spot, even if not as difficult as that of deposed Egyptian President Morsi. At least the latter gentleman knows his own mind, even if paying a high price for it, whereas Obama is at wit’s end to articulate where he stands on the sanctity of democracy and its place in American foreign policy.
Mr. Obama is bound by his own words, international law and the expectations of allies, such as Great Britain, not to acknowledge or support coups that overthrow duly-elected governments. For the president, it is an inconvenient truth that Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, accomplished his office through the ballot box and was as constitutionally legitimate as Obama, but for one small fact.


Morsi pushed through constitutional changes that are rather favorable to the fundamentalist thinking of the Brotherhood. Of course, those views about the desired progress of society and place of religion in the equation are hardly simpatico with the left leaning ideas on Harvard Yard and other American temples of the “progressive” movement.
Like most Americans, I have no truck with the ideas of the Brotherhood, but the mob in the streets objecting to Morsi chose methods other than ballots to remove him. Sadly for him, the Egyptian military is neither under civilian control nor primarily financed by the Egyptian government. It gets its manna from the Obama Administration via more than $1 billion annually in U.S. foreign aid.
Now, the new government, in a fit of liberal tolerance is jailing Brotherhood leaders. And it would seem democracy is accomplishing more progress in U.S. sanctioned Iran than American supported Egypt.

During its recent perils, the Obama White House did not support the elected Egyptian government. It stated the Morsi government must respect the will of all the people, much as the U.S. president did pushing through Obama Care despite the disapproval of the majority of Americans, as expressed through town meetings, polls and a Massachusetts Senate election.
Instead, the U.S. president gave a wink and a nod to a military takeover in Egypt, which the State Department is now indicating may not be a coup, because the generals have not imposed a military leader. Instead, they have put in place as president Egypt’s highest judge, after he was in office but two days. Even if a figurehead, that makes the military removal of a duly-elected Egypt president not a coup, therefore legitimate?
That question has the legal minds at the State Department working overtime.
The upshot, in Egypt Obama’s principal representative, Ambassador Anne Paterson, is vilified by all sides, and the Muslim Brotherhood is likely permanently disabused of the notion that participating in democratic processes can lead to its views taking hold anywhere from Syria to Yemen.
This is a mighty grand mess that will result in untold bloodshed and further reinforce anti-American views across the Middle East.  Now, the Arab Spring could easily become pan-Arab anarchy, and much blood will be on American hands.  Only a fool would think this situation would not inspire new terrorists.
Those remarkable accomplishments notwithstanding, Americans are entitled to know: What is the U.S. policy toward overthrowing democratically elected governments? Is it unacceptable except when it gives rise to fundamentalist social and religious views the prelates within the American academy and mainstream media don’t like?
Who says America doesn’t have an insular aristocracy and Ayatollahs of its own?

A report on the Benghazi attack by five different House committees has made the following findings. [Note this is a report issued by House Republicans including Howard McKeon chairman of Committee on Armed Services, Ed Royce chairman of Committee on Foreign Affairs, Bob Goodlatte chairman of Committee on the Judiciary, Darrell Issa chairman of Committee on Oversight & Government Reform and Mike Rogers Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]:
Before the Attacks:



After the U.S.-backed Libyan revolution ended the Gadhafi regime, the U.S. government did not deploy sufficient U.S. security elements to protect U.S. interests and personnel that remained on the ground.
Senior State Department officials knew that the threat environment in Benghazi was high and that the Benghazi compound was vulnerable and unable to withstand an attack, yet the Department continued to systematically withdraw security personnel.
Repeated requests for additional security were denied at the highest levels of the State Department. For example, an April 2012 State Department cable bearing Secretary Hillary Clinton’s signature acknowledged then-Ambassador Cretz’s formal request for additional security assets but ordered the withdrawal of security elements to proceed as planned.
The attacks were not the result of a failure by the Intelligence Community (IC) to recognize or communicate the threat. The IC collected considerable information about the threats in the region, and disseminated regular assessments to senior U.S. officials warning of the deteriorating security environment in Benghazi, which included threats to American interests, facilities, and personnel.
The President, as Commander-in-Chief, failed to proactively anticipate the significance of September 11 and provide the Department of Defense with the authority to launch offensive operations beyond self-defense. Defense Department assets were correctly positioned for the general threat across the region, but the assets were not authorized at an alert posture to launch offensive operations beyond self-defense, and were provided no notice to defend diplomatic facilities.

During the Attacks:


On the evening of September 11, 2012, U.S. security teams on the ground in Benghazi exhibited extreme bravery responding the attacks by al-Qa’ida-affiliated groups against the U.S. mission.
Department of Defense officials and military personnel reacted quickly to the attacks in Benghazi. The effectiveness of their response was hindered on account of U.S. military forces not being properly postured to address the growing threats in northern Africa or to respond to a brief, high-intensity attack on U.S. personnel or interests across much of Africa.

After the Attacks:

The Administration willfully perpetuated a deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the attacks evolved from a political demonstration caused by a YouTube video. U.S. officials on the ground reported – and video evidence confirms – that demonstrations outside the Benghazi Mission did not occur and that the incident began with an armed attack on the facility. Senior Administration officials knowingly minimized the role played by al-Qa’ida-affiliated entities and other associated groups in the attacks, and decided to exclude from the discussion the previous attempts by extremists to attack U.S. persons or facilities in Libya.
Administration officials crafted and continued to rely on incomplete and misleading talking points. Specifically, after a White House Deputies Meeting on Saturday, September 15, 2012, the Administration altered the talking points to remove references to the likely participation of Islamic extremists in the attacks. The Administration also removed references to the threat of extremists linked to al-Qa’ida in Benghazi and eastern Libya, including information about at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi. Senior State Department officials requested – and the White House approved – that the details of the threats, specifics of the previous attacks, and previous warnings be removed to insulate the Department from criticism that it ignored the threat environment in Benghazi.
Evidence rebuts Administration claims that the talking points were modified to protect classified information or to protect an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Email exchanges during the interagency process do not reveal any concern with protecting classified information. Additionally, the Bureau itself approved a version of the talking points with significantly more information about the attacks and previous threats than the version that the State Department requested. Thus, the claim that the State Department’s edits were made solely to protect that investigation is not credible.
The Administration deflected responsibility by blaming the IC for the information it communicated to the public in both the talking points and the subsequent narrative it perpetuated. Had Administration spokesmen performed even limited due diligence inquiries into the intelligence behind the talking points or requested reports from personnel on the ground, they would have quickly understood that the situation was more complex than the narrative provided by Ambassador Susan Rice and others in the Administration. 
The Administration’s decision to respond to the Benghazi attacks with an FBI investigation, rather than military or other intelligence resources, contributed to the government’s lack of candor about the nature of the attack.
Responding to the attacks with an FBI investigation significantly delayed U.S. access to key witnesses and evidence and undermined the government’s ability to bring those responsible for the attacks to justice in a timely manner.

An employee of Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), together with a political ally of “Gang of Eight” member Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), will argue Friday that groups opposed to the immigration bill pending in the U.S. Senate are “nativists,” Breitbart News has learned.
ATR’s Josh Culling and Hispanic Leadership Fund (HLF) president Mario Lopez will make the argument on a conference call with mainstream media reporters on Friday at 11 AM EDT. Brad Bailey of an organization called Texas Immigration Studies will join them on the call.
“As the momentum behind immigration reform continues to build and strengthen, an anti-immigrant opposition is working to scuttle and kill immigration efforts in Congress,” those organizing the press call said in a release obtained by Breitbart News (emphasis added):



Many of these groups are deeply associated with John Tanton, the father of the modern anti-immigrant movement, and his network of nativist groups, including the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), NumbersUSA, and the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR).  Over the years, Tanton’s network has extended its reach beyond these groups and to some of the most vocal opponents of immigration reform in Congress. [emphasis added]

The authors of the press release added that Culling, Lopez and Bailey–described in the release as “conservative leaders”–will “dive deep into the inner-workings of John Tanton’s network–including its influence on legislators, its ties to radical population control activists, and its opposition to all immigration (including legal immigration)==and discuss the potential implications of the Tanton network and its involvement in the current immigration debate.”
Culling is ATR’s Government Affairs Manager and is working on Norquist’s behalf to lobby for the passage of the Gang of Eight legislation in the Senate. Lopez is working specifically with Rubio to do the same.
In February, Lopez distributed a paper with his byline around Capitol Hill promoting a similar message to this press release. According to the Washington Post‘s Peter Wallsten, in early February, Rubio and his staff brought Lopez into meetings to encourage him to discredit groups like the Center for Immigration Studies, NumbersUSA, and Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). 

“Rubio’s aides last week brought one of the organizers of the effort to undermine the groups, Mario H. Lopez, a party strategist on Hispanic politics, to a regular meeting of GOP Senate staffers, at which Lopez distributed literature about the groups’ backgrounds and connections,” Wallsten wrote on February 13. “Rubio also raised concerns about the groups’ leanings during a recent conference call on immigration with conservative activists.”
Wallsten noted at the time that Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said the Senator “has argued that some groups that oppose legal immigration should not be considered part of the conservative coalition,” and the “vast majority of Republicans strongly support legal immigration.” Conant has not responded to requests for comment from Breitbart News regarding these remarks, nor has Rubio’s outreach director, J.R. Sanchez, or his chief of staff, Cesar Conda.
Lopez’s ties to Rubio go back to the Florida junior Senator’s early days in national politics. Lopez touted his support for Rubio from the very beginning of his campaign for Senate. “From the moment that the establishment lined up behind Charlie Crist, the Hispanic Leadership Fund stood up to say that Marco Rubio was the type of leader who belonged in the Senate,” Lopez said in a statement the night Rubio was elected to the U.S. Senate.
Further, Lopez has given quotes to news outlets defending the Senate’s immigration bill and specifically Rubio. “People appreciate his kind of leadership and that he’s taking such a thoughtful approach to the immigration issue,” Lopez said of Rubio, according to the National Journal‘s Beth Reinhard. “People appreciate him stepping up.”  
When Lopez previously accused the bill’s opponents of “nativism” earlier this year, Rubio’s team did not publicly rebuke the attacks. According to the Daily Caller’s Neil Munro, Rubio spokesman Conant “downplayed the revelations” that the Senator worked with Lopez on the attack.
Lopez tried to organize a similar conference call on Tuesday but canceled it at the last minute due to what call organizers described as scheduling conflicts. Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn reported before they canceled that call that these figures’ research “draw[s] heavily on” information compiled by the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).
Flynn reported that the original Tuesday call “was scheduled to take place as the Senate was having its first floor vote on the Gang bill.”
The phone number at which they will present this argument on Friday morning at 11 AM EDT is 877-888-4319. The password for the conference call is “TANTON.”

One month ago the Pentagon assured the public it was not being advised by anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein. Yet two days ago Weinstein called the Pentagon demanding that a Christian painting be removed from a dining hall in an Idaho Air Force base, and the Pentagon complied with his demand–in less than one hour.
On Apr. 28, Breitbart News reported that Pentagon brass met with Weinstein and his Military Religious Freedom Foundation. That was shortly after Weinstein published an article in which he called observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek to impose “a rapacious reign of theocratic terror” in the military through their “putrid theology.”


While he opposes all religion in the military, Weinstein reserves his most caustic language for observant Christians. And the one thing he objects to above all things is proselytizing in the military, which Christians call evangelism. 
Regarding evangelism, Weinstein told the Washington Post that, “What is happening aside from sexual assault is spiritual rape. And what the Pentagon needs to understand is that it is sedition and treason. It should be punished.” (Emphases added and brackets omitted.)
Weinstein said service members who evangelize in the military should be court-martialed, and added, “You need a dozen court-martials real quick.” A court martial is a criminal prosecution in the military, which depending on the crime can carry punishments ranging from fines, to expulsion from the military, to imprisonment. In case anyone missed the point, he also said, “We would love to see hundreds of prosecutions.”

It must be noted that the Pentagon says it would not take this drastic step called for by Weinstein. It should also be noted, however, that the Pentagon continues to change its story on what its policy is on evangelism. 
Nevertheless, the latest example of Weinstein’s influence with the Obama-Hagel Pentagon came last week, as reported by Fox News’ Todd Starnes. In the dining hall of Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho there was a painting-style picture of a U.S. Airman with imagery of the cross, above the word “Integrity” and with a reference to Matthew 5:9. (That verse reads, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”)
Weinstein called the Pentagon directly to complain about the picture. Less than one hour later, the picture was permanently removed. 
Col. Christopher Short, the base commander, told Fox News the artwork was removed because, “We make reasonable accommodations for all religions and celebrate the religious diversity of our Airmen.” It’s an odd statement to say that accommodating religion and celebrating diversity means tearing down Christian artwork.  
Weinstein has previously boasted that he has special status with the leadership of the Air Force Academy similar to the “bat signal” from Batman. He explains that:


… he and Superintendent Lt. Gen. Mike Gould devised a code word only they know in case Weinstein needs to reach Gould with concerns about religious liberty on campus. “We have our own bat-signal,” Weinstein said Friday, referring to the beam of light used to summon Batman in the DC Comic series…. Having a means to reach Gould with any concerns is a positive step in the work to make the academy religiously neutral ground, he said. “We had a bad 96-hour period where I felt like we had fallen back to the bad old days,” he said. “Our relationship [now] is stronger than ever.”

Given Weinstein’s published anti-Christian statements, his relationship with top military officials should raise eyebrows. 
And it has done so on Capitol Hill. After Breitbart News’ reporting on this relationship, 59 congressmen sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel demanding to know who approved these meetings and what was discussed. A group of 72 congressmen then sent a second letter demanding to know what the Pentagon is doing to protect the First Amendment rights of service members. 
Also last week, one of Weinstein’s staff members published a column denigrating Congress’ efforts, and mocking Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) for coauthoring with Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) the letter signed by 59 Members of Congress. Taunting congressional leaders who are probing this situation may provoke lawmakers to amend federal law to clarify and reinforce service members rights regarding sharing their faith. 
The Obama-Hagel Pentagon insists that it would never court-martial a Christian for sharing his faith, but fails to explain why it would accept advice from someone aggressively demanding that action. The Pentagon also claims that Weinstein cannot be called a consultant because he’s not paid for his advice and holds no official position. Yet the dictionary defines a consultant as, “a person who gives professional or expert advice.” There is nothing about having an official status or getting a paycheck. 
Mikey Weinstein has been meeting with top Pentagon officials during the Obama administration since 2009. He continues to communicate with them at will, and they immediately respond to his demands. He is therefore an unpaid advisor to the Obama-Hagel Pentagon, with considerable influence. 
Not only that, but it’s been more than two weeks since roughly 100 congressmen demanded answers from Hagel, but have not heard a word in response. Yet this anti-Christian extremist brags about how the Pentagon leaps into action when he makes a demand, removing Christian artwork in less than an hour. 
Lawmakers are likely to intensify their efforts to find out what’s going on here, and what they can do to stop this assault on Christians in the military.

16271	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/27/McCain-and-Graham-Gangsters-in-Government	Opinion	1	National Security	None	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"
Yesterday, Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) attended a private meeting with President Barack Obama on the subject of immigration reform. They emerged all smiles: “It’s one of the best meetings I’ve ever had with the president,” Graham said. President Obama “understands the parameters of what we’re dealing with,” said McCain. Both senators are supporters of immigration reform efforts now under way in the Senate.
Those efforts themselves are the product of separate negotiations outside “regular order” in the Senate. A group called the “Gang of Eight,” which includes both McCain and Graham, has agreed to the broad principles of a bipartisan compromise on immigration that would include both border enforcement and a “path to citizenship”–though the question of whether, and for how long, the enforcement stage would come first remains unresolved.


It is not the first time a “gang” effort has been used to pressure the rest of the Republican caucus, but it is the first time such an effort has been coordinated with the president. McCain and Graham’s endorsement of the president’s efforts is particularly striking given their persistent push for answers on the Benghazi scandal, and their strong opposition to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (though they both refused to sustain a filibuster).

The Republicans’ “gang problem” has contributed to the growing frustration that conservative voters feel with the GOP. In McCain’s case, the frustration is compounded by the fact that he ran for re-election in 2010 while promising to crack down on illegal immigration. In the House of Representatives, Speaker John Boehner agreed to stop separate talks with Obama, and to commit to “regular order.” The Senate has added no such discipline.
Even in the House, Boehner has abandoned a promise to observe the “Hastert rule”–to ensure that any vote that comes to the floor is approved by the majority Republican caucus first. The result has been a string of capitulations that lead in turn to bad policy. The noble cause of bipartisanship first requires two parties. If Republicans cannot establish minimal policy discipline–even personal discipline–the country’s frustrations will grow.

The “Gang of” 8 grand immigration proposal, over 800 pages, is written by members of the same body that has failed to address the problem of meaningful immigration reform for over 30 years. 
Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) stated that he wanted the 92 other members to join in this important debate. In the House of Representatives in particular, the silence of the GOP leadership is deafening.
Look at what is missing in this process: transparency; experts on many aspects of immigration reform; and law enforcement agencies involved in dealing with the problems on the ground. The GOP-led House of Representatives has promised regular order. How much transparency we will see from the Senate is undetermined. Most of all, valuable input from relevant Governors are left out of the equation.


A transparent public discussion is required. In 1986 we had outright amnesty and the promised enforcement of a secure border. Lack of promised enforcement by Democrats got us to this point with a significantly larger problem. Are we creating de facto amnesty again with a rushed comprehensive bill over incremental and combined approaches to the problem?
With America’s burgeoning Hispanic population–the largest block of illegal immigrants–more emphasis seems to be placed on who will vote en masse for which party over necessary solutions for the long-term future of this country. It is a bitter pill to take, with the term “lawful presence” in its prescription.
The recent terror attacks in Boston renewed calls from both Republicans and Democrats in the “Gang of 8” for immediate immigration reform. Border security is key, as Arizona Governor Jan Brewer recently stated in my American Forum.


Governor Brewer made the case for working with residents that live along the border, state police, sheriffs and other local law enforcement agencies. There is also the issue of sending the National Guard for additional resources.

This is not a numbers issue; it is a human issue. We have citizens in constant danger along our southern border. There are areas where a fence is necessary and could prove to be effective. The Obama Administration restricts border patrol activity on federal lands, and the cartels, human traffickers, illegal aliens who break our law by crossing the southern border are not known for their obedience to the law. They cross onto federal land with impunity, and the proper authorities are not allowed to pursue.

The “Gang of 8” proposal so far leaves more questions to be answered than solutions offered. Solutions must include standards, methods to achieve those standards, and metrics to measure their effectiveness. Long-term concerns, such as those expressed by Governor Brewer, much less solutions, are largely cast aside.

As the scheduled 2014 draw-down of U.S. troops in Afghanistan draws closer, a report of how Obama leaned on a select group of political operatives for foreign policy decisions–including decisions relating to Afghanistan–has been released.
This report seems to confirm fears that Obama has approached foreign policy in ways similar to those followed by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson during the Vietnam War. Like JFK, Obama had a brain trust through whom all decisions were “funneled.” And like LBJ, decisions were then made (or not made) based on how they would impact the political climate at home. 
According to the report, during Obama’s first term: 



The president had a truly disturbing habit of funneling major foreign policy decisions through a small cabal of relatively inexperienced White House advisors whose turf was strictly politics. Their primary concern was how any given action in Afghanistan or the Middle East would play on the nightly news, or which talking point it would give Republicans.

Because this tact was followed, promises of a 2014 troop draw-down have been promulgated to appease Americans who are tired of war. Yet the reality is that an undetermined number of troops, special forces, drones, and operators will remain in Afghanistan long after 2014. 

In saying one thing but doing another, the Obama administration has told the American people exactly what they want to hear, just as LBJ did from 1963 until the TET Offensive in January 1968. And because of this, the war in Afghanistan will still be there for the next administration to end, just as LBJ left Vietnam for Richard Nixon to deal with. 
As the report says, what is perceived as foreign policy prowess on Obama’s part is really not so much “about accomplishments in Afghanistan or the Middle East” as it is “with how U.S. actions in that region have been reshaped to accommodate partisan political concerns.”

We now know the Boston Marathon terrorists were Muslims with roots in Chechnya, the Russian province in an ongoing conflict with Moscow, with a large Muslim population and a history of violent conflict with the Kremlin in a long struggle for independence. They were likely not right-wing Americans, as some on the left had predicted and hoped.
We do not yet know whether they are part of a larger cell or whether these attacks were directed from abroad versus being exclusively the idea of these two terrorist brothers. Experts note that on one hand terrorist groups have put information on the Internet on how to make the specific types of bombs used in the attack, but also say it is very possible these brothers also received terrorist training overseas. We may learn the answers to these questions in coming days. 
Either way, it’s disconcerting that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) was “sharing intel“ with authorities in the investigation of this bombing. SPLC is the ultra-left group that has a habit of demonizing conservative organizations as “domestic hate groups,” but has now been linked in federal court to a convicted terrorist. Even some outspoken liberals take issue with the SPLC’s outrageous bias, saying SPLC is “essentially a fraud.”


Recently, a U.S. army officer used SPLC’s material to say the military should watch out for soldiers thought to support various Christian organizations targeted by the SPLC, as well as immigration-reform groups (suggesting they’re “anti-Muslim”) and Tea Party groups. 

It’s critically important to recognize that there are countless peaceful and patriotic Muslim Americans, and they must not be lumped in with terrorists. But given our history, it’s not “anti-Muslim” to note when a terrorist is Muslim and motivated by fanatical religious beliefs. 
The Obama administration’s decision to prosecute the Ft. Hood shooter, Maj. Nadal Hasan, as a perpetrator of “workplace violence” instead of a terrorist attack–while refusing to give military honors, such as Purple Hearts to those shot by Hasan–showcases a profoundly disturbing political correctness that has no place in national security circles. 
As the recent sentencing of convicted terrorist Floyd Corkins, who confessed that he planned his terrorist attack based on information provided by SPLC, approaches on Apr. 29, it is increasingly important that no law enforcement agency lends any credibility to the SPLC. Its partisan agenda focuses so much energy going after conservatives and Christians instead of real terrorists.

UN Human Rights Council “expert” Richard Falk has published a statement saying Bostonians got what they deserved in last week’s terror attack.  He quotes W.H. Auden to make his point: “to whom evil is done/do evil in return.”  
Richard Falk is the UN’s “Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.” He has held the post since 2008, despite exposure as a 9/11 conspiracy theorist. 


In his latest rant, published online on April 21, 2013 by foreignpolicyjournal.com Falk repeats the libel that prior to 9/11 President George W. Bush was seeking a “pretext” for war, and that anything Israel is the opposite of “justice and peace.”
And then he attacks Bostonians head-on. The police action in Boston was a “hysterical dragnet.”  Boston’s dead were “canaries” that “have to die” because of America’s “fantasy of global domination.”  
Falk explains the attacks as justifiable “resistance.” In his words: “The American global domination project is bound to generate all kinds of resistance in the post-colonial world.”

He minimizes the crime and predicts worse if America doesn’t change its ways to better accommodate the demands of “the Islamic world.” As he puts it: “In some respects, the United States has been fortunate not to experience worse blowbacks, and these may yet happen…”.
For years, Falk has been espousing the worst forms of antisemitism from his UN perch, and for his efforts has been rewarded with repeated opportunities by the Council to lecture others on his world view. 
That world view is shared by the 56 member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), who only a week ago at UN Headquarters refused to define terrorism unless an exception clause was created for “legitimate struggle.”
The OIC controls the balance of power at the UN’s top human rights body, by holding majorities in both the African and Asian regional groups. Africa and Asia, in turn, control 26 of the 47 seats on the Council. With the backing of the OIC, therefore, Falk has been encouraged and protected.
The Obama administration has long championed the UN Human Rights Council, which it decided to join as one of its first foreign policy moves in 2009. Thanks to the Obama administration, U.S. began a second three-year term on the Council this past January. At the opening of the Council’s most recent session in March, Assistant Secretary of State Esther Brimmer traveled to Geneva to address what she called “this esteemed body.”
There is nothing about a “human rights” body that countenances the likes of Richard Falk that is “esteemed,” and the United States should resign–effective immediately.

Seven hundred retired Military Special Operations professionals from the organization “Special Operations Speaks” sent a letter to the House of Representatives urging members to support H.Res 36, which will create a House Select Committee to investigate last September’s deadly terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.  
Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA), a sub-committee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee, issued a resolution for a House Select Committee to investigate issues surrounding the Benghazi Attack last November in the 112th Congress. He re-issued his resolution for the select committee when the 113th Congress began. The resolution currently has over 60 co-sponsors.
Only Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) can appoint a Select Committee and Boehner appears to mainly rely on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate the Benghazi attack. However, any information that may be garnered from that committee will, as always, remain classified.


“As a retired Special Operations officer who spent most of my thirty-six years preparing for and executing rescue missions to save fellow Americans, I am deeply troubled by the events in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The men and women who I served with lived by an ethos that pledged to never leave a fallen comrade and to make every effort to respond when a fellow American was threatened. I have seen men take great risks to save a fellow warrior. I have even seen men die trying to do so,” wrote General William G. ‘Jerry’ Boykin in a statement to Breitbart News. 
Boykin added, “The lack of accountability regarding the Benghazi event disturbs me greatly and bears the earmarks of a cover up. America is entitled to a full accounting of this egregious attack on our people with some explanation as to why there was no effort to save the Americans in the US Embassy annex and the CIA station, or at least to recover their bodies before they fell into Libyan hands. Our Congress has yet to fulfill its responsibility to provide a complete analysis of the attack or to provide answers as to what exactly happened. A  bi-partisan Special Committee is needed to determine the truth about Benghazi.”
Last month, Rep. Wolf, along with Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA), a House Ways and Means Committee member, sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry demanding more information on State Department employees who survived the Benghazi attack. In his letter to Kerry, Wolf noted that sources say that as many as 30 survivors of the Benghazi attack were allegedly wounded. Seven of those thirty were said to be critical injuries.  Sec. Kerry confirmed he visited an injured Benghazi survivor at Walter Reed. 

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, pointed to Kerry’s admission as a reason why he expects to speak with Benghazi survivors. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a Senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees,” Issa told Breitbart News. 
Since Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) first told Breitbart News in December that the Obama administration had not been allowing him or any other member of Congress to see Benghazi survivors, more Republican members, including Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John McCain (R-AZ) are calling for survivors to be allowed to testify at hearings on Capitol Hill without fear of legal or career repercussions.
Signers of the letter believe the House Select Committee should look into a number of issues, including the lack of military response to the events in Benghazi, if any non-military assistance was provided during the attack; the number U.S. personnel who were injured in Benghazi; the current locations of survivors; the names of the individuals in the White House Situation Room (WHSR) during the entire 8-hour period of the attacks and was a senior US military officer present.
“As veterans from all aspects of Special Operations, we have no doubt that there’s a lot more to what happened in Benghazi than President Obama and his Administration are letting on. From the very beginning, he has attempted to mislead and outright lied to the American people about why the attack on September 11th, 2012 happened, how it happened, and what our government did or did not do to save the lives of our patriots abroad,” former Navy SEAL Captain Larry Bailey wrote in a statement to Breitbart News.
The representatives from the retired military community want “a full accounting of the events of September 11, 2012,” adding that the,  “American public be fully informed regarding this egregious terrorist attack on US diplomatic personnel and facilities. We owe that truth to the American people and the families of the fallen.”

Yet another Tea Party group has come out publicly against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill, as TheTeaParty.net has announced its opposition to the legislation and published online an alternative plan for immigration reform.
“The granting of citizenship is the most solemn honor this country can confer,” TheTeaParty.Net founder Todd Cefaratti said in a statement obtained by Breitbart News. “It is not something that ought to be used to score political points or to win the next election.” 
“Before the American people extend this gift they must be assured that verifiable border security has preeminent priority. The Senate bill currently does not have it,” he explained. “Americans will not be bullied, intimidated and steamrolled into accepting this legislation.” 


“We have proposed a conservative alternative at secureamericanow.us for which we will be rallying Congressional support in the coming days.”
The group said in its release it will be briefing members of Congress on the alternative immigration reform plan in the coming days and weeks.
TheTeaParty.Net’s chief strategist Niger Innis added that he thinks the “Senate amnesty bill is a non-starter.”

“But instead of just saying we’re against something, we have put forward eight principles that we believe are the necessary pillars of an America First Immigration alternative,” Innis said. “Over the coming days we will be meeting with conservative Senate and House members about getting them to support the plan.” 
“We will not be bullied by a Harry Reid-Chuck Schumer agenda that undermines the Constitution by ramming through a bill that the American people do not support,” Innis promised. “The only way to stop a bully is to confront them.”
Many other Tea Party organizations, like Tea Party Patriots, have already announced their opposition to the Gang of Eight bill. More than 150 of them banded together in recent months to sign a letter sent to members of Congress announcing their ardent opposition to the legislation. 
TheTeaParty.net did not sign that letter at the time and was fighting suggestions from the office of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) that it may support the legislation.
Politico previously erroneously claimed that TheTeaParty.net was among groups that had become an “ally” of the Gang of Eight. Politico later quietly edited the story after Breitbart News discovered the groups it claimed supported the bill had not expressed support for the legislation. Rather, the groups had me with Rubio’s team to get his take on the bill before they made a decision. 
“We are going to hear him out, rather than rely on the liberal media interpretation of his legislation,” Innis told Breitbart News at the time. “Reports that we have agreed to support the Gang of Eight bill are utter make-believe.”

House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) has doubled down on his move to cut pensions for military veterans in a USA Today op-ed published Sunday.
In the op-ed, Ryan opens up by highlighting the CBO estimate that the deal he cut with Senate Budget Committee chairwoman Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) would result in at least $20 billion in deficit reduction. “The Bipartisan Budget Act that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and I drafted will soon become law,” Ryan wrote. “We think it’s a small step toward fiscal discipline in Washington. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will reduce the deficit over the next ten years by over $20 billion. And unlike current law, it will provide much-needed relief to our already strained defense budget.”
As Breitbart News has reported, Ryan’s and Murray’s budget deal does not reduce the deficit. In fact, the deal raises the deficit by at least $15.5 billion because of a series of gimmicks that Ryan and Murray employed in the accounting of the deal — namely, double counting of savings like the tactic which was employed in Obamacare, and the failure to include an estimate of the interest on the borrowed money for the first couple of years of increased spending. These are only a few among a series of other misleading statements Ryan has made about the deal. 


The rest of Ryan’s op-ed is devoted to defending his decision to cut $6 billion worth of military pensions. “One part of the bill has become particularly controversial: the reduction in cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for working-age military retirees,” Ryan wrote. “The federal government has no greater obligation than to keep the American people safe and we must take care of the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line. For that reason, Congress is understandably hesitant to make changes to military compensation. But even hesitance has a cost.” Citing the rising cost per service member since 2001, he then claimed that the need for reform is “undeniable.”
Ryan cited and praised President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel for his stance on the issue as well. Ryan wrote, “Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a combat vet himself, has said ‘that we can no longer put off military compensation reform. DOD’s leadership, Chairman Dempsey, the service chiefs, the service secretaries, and myself, we all know that we need to slow cost growth in military compensation. Otherwise, we’ll have to make disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization.'”
Ryan then detailed what he says the changes to military veterans’ pensions would specifically do to veterans:


Here’s what the new law will do. We make no changes for those currently at or above age 62. This reform affects only younger military retirees. Right now, any person who has served 20 years can retire–regardless of age. That means a serviceman who enlists at 18 becomes eligible for retirement at 38. The late 30s and early 40s are prime working years, and most of these younger retirees go on to second careers.

Ryan characterized the change as a “small adjustment” in the next paragraph, even though he admitted it could affect veterans by as much as $100,000 or more over their lifetimes, depending on when they retire.
“All this reform does is make a small adjustment for those younger retirees,” Ryan wrote. “If they retire before age 62, the annual increase in their retired pay will be 1% less than the inflation rate. In other words, their benefits will grow every year–just at a slower rate. And when the retiree hits 62, DOD will recalculate the retired pay so that it will be where it would have been if he or she had received the full inflation adjustment every year since he or she retired.” Ryan then calculated that, for a hypothetical serviceman who enlisted at 18 and retired at 38, his benefits would change under the deal from about $1.8 million to $1.7 million. 
“This is a far more modest reform than other bipartisan proposals, some of which would have fully eliminated the adjustments for inflation for working-age retirees,” Ryan wrote.
Despite Ryan’s claims these cuts are a “small adjustment” for veterans, that approximately $100,000, in some parts of the country, could be a significant percentage of the entire size of a mortgage for a house. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, in October the average size of a home loan in America was $289,650. Ryan’s “small adjustment” cuts to veterans would be more than a third, then, of the average mortgage — and in many cases, more than half of these veterans’ lifetime expenses for homeownership.
The Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) estimates that the cuts could mean as much as $124,000 in lost retirement income for veterans, which would be even more significant losses of opportunity in the future for veterans.

Ryan argued that the approximately $6 billion in savings that cutting the pensions for America’s military veterans would garner for the federal treasury would “go right back to the military.”
“In 2012, Congress established the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to examine the entire military-compensation system from top to bottom,” Ryan wrote. “The commission’s recommendations are due in May, and the leaders of the armed-services committees in Congress have agreed to consider their recommendations and look for other ways to reform the system. That’s why this reform does not take effect until the end of 2015 — it gives Congress ample time to consider alternatives.”
Ryan said that for America to be able to afford the best equipment on the battlefield for active duty military, these pension cuts are necessary.
“For me, there’s simply no choice between responsible reforms of military compensation and making what our military leadership has called ‘disproportionate cuts to military readiness and modernization,'” Ryan wrote. “Every time we kick the can down the road, we put our troops’ combat readiness at risk. This agreement put forward one reform option, and I invite others to do the same. Our troops have been willing to sacrifice everything for this country. We owe it to them to give them the best equipment on the battlefield and a secure retirement when they come home.”
In his op-ed, Ryan did not address the proposal in the House of Representatives gaining significant attention already from Reps. Martha Roby (R-AL) and Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA). Roby’s and Fitzpatrick’s plan would restore pensions for all military veterans and offset the savings those cuts create with savings from closing a loophole allowing illegal aliens access to the Refundable Child Tax Credit. Closing that loophole would save $7 billion — more than enough to ensure that the Pentagon gets the money it needs to buy top-notch military equipment.
Since Ryan and Murray’s budget deal increases spending and increases the federal deficit, many conservatives and even mainstream Republicans wonder why veterans’ pensions should be cut when there is wasteful spending like leaving that tax credit loophole open, or many of the new details that Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) detailed in his “Wastebook,” among other examples of wasteful spending.
Last week, Ryan avoided discussing the proposal when asked by Breitbart News about it. Instead, his spokesman Kevin Seifert said Ryan supports closing that illegal alien tax credit loophole but also supports cutting military pensions. Seifert would not answer when pressed on whether Ryan would back the Roby-Fitzpatrick plan, which is a House version of a Senate amendment Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, attempted to attach to the deal but could not due to the procedural blocking of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
Now that he is backing up his decision to cut veterans’ pensions, Ryan has taken a stance that is directly averse to the the Roby-Fitzpatrick plan — something that could put Ryan at odds with a majority of the House GOP conference. Including Roby and Fitzpatrick, a total of 46 House Republicans have signed on to their bill as cosponsors. Powerful committee chairmen like House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and House Rules Committee chairman Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) have also cosponsored the Roby-Fitzpatrick deal. This could foreshadow a battle between House GOP power players for the future direction of the conference.

The Obama-Hagel Pentagon is trying to minimize Breitbart News’ blockbuster story last week of top brass meeting with anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein, whom we reported calls Christians “monsters” imposing a “rapacious reign of theocratic terror” and says sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in the military an act of “sedition and treason” that must be punished. 
The Pentagon sent out an email suggesting the Apr. 23 meeting with Weinstein in the Pentagon was a one-time event, saying only, “Weinstein requested, and was granted, a meeting at the Pentagon [on] April 23, with the Air Force Judge Advocate General and others, to include the Deputy Chief of Chaplains, to express his concerns of religious issues in the military.”  


However, this was not a single meeting. Instead it was part of a relationship that began one month after Barack Obama was sworn in as president. And it goes much higher up the military food chain than was reported last week: Weinstein met with a four-star general who was the highest-ranking officer in the United States Air Force. 
The New York Times reported on Mar. 1, 2009, in a story entitled, “Questions Raised Anew About Religion in Military,” that Weinstein met with the Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Norton Schwarz, on Feb. 24, 2009. The story noted this was the first time Weinstein and his Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) had “gotten an audience with a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.”
Weinstein had sued the Defense Department during the Bush administration as part of his anti-Christian crusade, so Pentagon top brass knew exactly who he was and what he was about when the new Obama administration met with him in 2009. This means he had been fully-vetted when the Obama-Hagel Defense Department decided to meet with him again on Apr. 23, 2013, to discuss how to stop evangelizing (that is, Christian proselytizing) within the military. 

The Bush administration had fought Weinstein, saying that any instances of senior officers pressuring subordinates on religious matters were “not systematic problems, but isolated instances.” And biblical Christians fully object to any coercion, since evangelism is about people embracing the Christian faith wholeheartedly and sincerely, which no person could ever force upon another. It’s a matter of the heart, between every human being and their creator. 
By contrast, while the Bush administration fought Weinstein, the Obama administration has embraced this anti-Christian activist. 
The NYT story gives a laundry list of Weinstein and MRFF’s grievances against the Defense Department during the Bush administration, including a, “ceremony that began and ended with a Christian prayer…the appearance of uniformed officers at religious events, [and] displays of crucifixes at military chapels…”.
The story indicates that “Christian prayers” are prayers offered “in Jesus’ name.” It goes without saying that whenever anyone prays, they pray according to their own religious faith. (For example, you’re not likely to find a Muslim imam offering a Jewish prayer.) It’s just as common to hear a Christian mention Jesus in a prayer as it is to find a Muslim invoking the name of Mohammed. 
It’s also no surprise that troops might be wearing their uniforms when they attend church services. Again, the Constitution does not forbid such things, since those troops have the right to peacefully practice and express their personal faith just like any other American. 
But the fact that Weinstein has become an unpaid advisor to the Obama-Hagel Pentagon is evidence of how hostile an environment parts of the Defense Department are becoming to Christian service members under this administration, and possibly devout adherents of other peaceful faiths as well. 
Article I of the Constitution empowers Congress to set the rules of conduct and discipline within the military, and Congress must do so now to protect the rights of our troops to live and share their faith.

The George Soros-funded National Immigration Forum (NIF) is organizing a “fly-in” of what it calls conservatives from across the country aimed at lobbying House Republicans for an amnesty bill. 
According to USA Today’s immigration beat writer Alan Gomez, NIF is planning to organize the fly in with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us, and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Partnership for a New American Economy. 
“The fly-in is being organized not by conservative groups, but organizations that have focused on legalizing millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally and changing the legal immigration system to bring in more foreign workers,” Gomez wrote on Monday. He noted that the 300 activists for an immigration grand bargain were looking to make what he described as a “conservative pitch” for amnesty. 


Gomez noted NIF’s Executive Director, Ali Noorani, who “has advocated for changes in immigration law to help legal and undocumented immigrants for three decades,” claimed “the broad collection coming to Washington represents ‘the conservative base of the Republican Party.'”

The event will take place on Oct. 28, coinciding with President Barack Obama’s and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s renewed push against House Speaker John Boehner for amnesty. Now that Obama, Reid, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are publicly pushing for amnesty after many mainstream media outlets declared it dead earlier this year, Soros’ groups are trying to make it appear as though conservatives support immigration legislation like the Senate-passed “Gang of Eight” bill. Ultimately, the left’s goal is to get the House to pass a series of piecemeal immigration bills and then combine them with the Senate bill in a conference committee.
Soros is heavily involved in funding the lobbying for amnesty. After Breitbart News exposed NIF for being Soros-funded while running a campaign to make it appear as though evangelicals support granting amnesty to illegal immigrants, Noorani admitted his group accepts funding from Soros. Noorani denies that the funding was being used for the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT), a project that his group runs the operations of, but admits that millions of NIF’s dollars come from Soros and that about 10 percent of its budget this year comes from the leftwing billionaire. 
Soros is also intimately connected to Facebook’s Zuckerberg’s FWD.us push for amnesty. Zuckerberg hired Soros’ former chief financial strategist Stanley Druckenmiller. Druckenmiller served as Soros’ chief strategist for more than a decade.
Mitt Romney’s top 2012 campaign donor, Wall Street hedge fund manager Paul Singer, also funds NIF, as Breitbart News has reported.

Reuters is still blaming the YouTube video, Innocence of Muslims,  for the attacks on the US consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. This is from an article they published on Sunday, August 18, 2013:

U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in Libya’s Benghazi in 2012 when Islamist gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate during a protest by a mob angry over a film they said insulted the Prophet Mohammad.

This claim, first made by then-US Ambassador Susan Rice on all Sunday morning shows, has been debunked many times. Here are a few examples:
October 9, 2012 – Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick F. Kennedy said the attacks in Benghazi were a coordinated terrorist attack. They were planned and organized.


October 27, 2012 – Libyan witnesses said it was an organized attack.

December 19, 2012 – Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Accountability Review Board released their report on Benghazi and never mentioned a protest or the YouTube video.
March 6, 2013 – Documents turned over by the administration show the Libyan officials knew an attack was going to happen and warned Washington, D.C.
May 8, 2013 – During the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Benghazi, Gregory Hicks testified the YouTube video was a non-issue in Libya. He said he was embarrassed and stunned when he saw Rice claim there was a protest over the video. 
August 6, 2013 – CNN airs a Benghazi special and it also destroys the YouTube/protest narrative. Erin Burnett reported US Ambassador Christopher Stevens had to change his running route because terrorists posted it on the internet. He knew and warned DC many times an attack was going to happen. He requested extra security many times.
The YouTube video had nothing to do with the Benghazi attack. There was not a protest in Benghazi.

Spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that the State Department has not decided if it will comply with a congressional subpoena demanding documents related to the crafting of Benghazi talking points for Susan Rice.
Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) sent a five-page letter on Tuesday explaining why he as chair of the Oversight Committee issued the subpoena and what documents he expects to be delivered by June 7th. 
Issa is requiring the release of more emails between top Administration officials regarding Benghazi talking points given to Ambassador Susan Rice before her appearance on Sunday talk shows the weekend after the Benghazi attack. The Congressman claims that the emails previously given to the House committee were “incomplete” and noted these documents were released to the press five days before they were given to Congress.


Asked about the State Department’s response to the letter, Psaki praised the “unprecedented degree of cooperation with Congress” on the issue of Benghazi. “But of course, we remain committed, as we have consistently been, to working with Congress,” Psaki added. The Spokeswoman said that the Department is “taking stock” and “determining the next appropriate steps.”

“You haven’t yet decided whether or not the State Department will be providing the documents that are in the subpoena?” a reporter asked Psaki. “That’s correct,” she responded.
Read the transcript and watch the video below:


QUESTION: New topic? Yesterday, Chairman Issa sent a letter to Secretary Kerry and issued a subpoena for documents relating to the development of the talking points used by Susan Rice and communications between 10 current and former State officials. Do you have a reaction? Has he responded? And does the Department intend on complying with the – I believe it’s June 7th deadline for supplying these documents?
MS. PSAKI: Well, let me just remind everyone since given the opportunity that we have demonstrated unprecedented – an unprecedented degree of cooperation with Congress on the issue of Benghazi, engaging now in nearly 40 hearings, briefing members of staff, and – members and staff – and sharing over 25,000 pages of documents with committees.
On this specific issue, you’ll recall that a hundred pages of documents on the talking points were released just weeks ago. They were inclusive of the emails around this issue, and from our perspective, the CIA-led interagency process, as we now know through which these talking points were developed, has been thoroughly addressed publicly.
But of course, we remain committed, as we have consistently been, to working with Congress, and we are taking stock of this recent subpoena and determining the next appropriate steps.
QUESTION: Since a hundred pages of emails were actually sent to them and everybody observed it, and in fact, there was a lot of backtracking on initial content and so on, what else – what is being subpoenaed?
MS. PSAKI: I encourage you to ask Chairman Issa that question.
QUESTION: Has the Secretary responded?
MS. PSAKI: No. I just said we’re determining the next appropriate steps.
QUESTION: So just a quick follow-up to that just for clarity. So when you say you’re determining the next appropriate steps, you haven’t yet decided whether or not the State Department will be providing the documents that are in the subpoena?
MS. PSAKI: That’s correct. But we have provided, just as a reminder, of course, a hundred pages of documents on the talking points that this is regarding.

Decrying yesterday’s filibuster of the confirmation of former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) as Secretary of Defense, the White House and the media have decided to target his critics, especially Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Yet they should welcome the extension of debate, which provides an opportunity for Senators who once expressed concerns, such as Chuck Schumer (D-NY), to revisit their conclusions in light of new information.
The case for Hagel remains exceedingly weak. Some Democrats claim that he has the necessary qualifications to lead the Pentagon, but not even the Obama-friendly Politico supports that argument, noting Jan. 31 that Hagel’s main qualification was “politician.” Hagel’s supporters keep citing his admirable military record, but it is not a qualification for a primarily civilian post which requires an intimate knowledge of defense policy.


Hagel, by his own admission, does not know much about the Department of Defense. During his two terms in in the Senate, he served on the Foreign Relations Committee, not the Armed Services Committee. He has some broad views about how the country’s defenses ought to change, but these are shifting, and vague. He has argued both for and against defense cuts, for example, and does not understand the defense sequester.
The case against Hagel, on the other hand, grows stronger every day. From a left-wing point of view, his weaknesses were obvious from the start. He had expressed hostile views toward gays and supported “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” He had led the fight to block climate change from moving through the Senate, and would now be stepping in to lead a Pentagon that has committed in recent years to the use of green fuels and technology.
Hagel also had subscribed to the slate of socially conservative views demonized by the Democrats as a “war on women,” such as opposition to abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother. The Armed Services Committee also quietly examined criticisms about how Hagel had dealt with allegations of sexual harassment among members of his staff–a bad sign when the military is trying to stamp out such abuse.

For Democrats, an additional irritation was that Hagel’s nomination sent a signal that the party still lacked the self-confidence to run the Pentagon. As Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos wrote in December: 

Hagel is a Republican who voted for all of George W. Bush’s pet wars….And yes, while he has reneged on his past support for our nation’s disastrous wars, there are plenty of good qualified Democrats who weren’t idiotic enough to support them in the first place.  
It’s time for Democrats to embrace the fact that yes, they know what the hell they’re doing on matters of national security.

The only case for Hagel, from a left-wing perspective, was that the “neoconservatives”–i.e. those who favored a dominant military, an assertive foreign policy, and a strong U.S.-Israel alliance–were opposed to him. Hagel’s nomination offered the anti-war movement, especially its anti-Israel elements, a chance to shift the debate in their favor.
The Obama administration worked hard to prevent Democrats from defecting, sending Hagel to consult with Schumer and to write regretful letters to the likes of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), expressing regret for having used such phrases such as “Jewish lobby” and reassuring her of his commitment to carry out President Barack Obama’s policies, with which his own previous views were in apparent conflict on a variety of subjects.
But the administration could not head off Republican queries, especially as more new information about Hagel’s past positions, much of it unearthed by the conservative new media, began to surface. Even the mainstream media began to take a skeptical view, with editorials opposing Hagel in both the Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune.
The principal worry was Hagel’s views on Iran. Not only had Hagel opposed the use of military force, if necessary, to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, but he had also opposed the use of sanctions. He had also advocated “engaging” the Tehran regime, which to this day shows no interest in direct talks. Hagel’s appointment was therefore a sign of weakness in opposing Iran–the worst possible signal at the worst possible time.

Hagel’s views on Israel were also troubling–not least because of their implications for the American military. He had opposed designating Iranian-backed Hezbollah as a terror group, and advocated U.S. talks with Hamas in Gaza. He also denounced Israel’s war of self-defense against Hezbollah in 2006, calling it “disproportionate” and equating it with terror against Israeli civilians, undermining the basis of the U.S. war against terror.
Much controversy centered around Hagel’s use of the term “Jewish lobby,” a misnomer that implies Jewish control over U.S. foreign policy, and which was in vogue among the extreme left at the time as a scapegoat for the war in Iraq. Hagel now says that he misspoke, but new allegations that he claimed in 2007 that Israel controlled the U.S. State Department reinforce worries that he may have entertained antisemitic bias.

Perhaps the most self-destructive position Hagel had previously adopted was support for global nuclear disarmament, including the specific idea that the U.S. should begin to disarm unilaterally if necessary. In his confirmation hearing, Hagel attempted to deny that he had endorsed that view, but patient cross-examination by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) demonstrated that Hagel had, in fact, affixed his name to that radical suggestion. 
The most recent nuclear test by North Korea, the ongoing atrocities by a Syrian regime that Hagel once suggested the U.S. should court, the continued belligerence of Iran and persistent terrorism by Hamas are all evidence that Hagel’s views on defense and foreign policy were naive at best, and dangerous at worst. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) also took Hagel to task for his strident opposition to the successful surge in Iraq.
In his confirmation hearing, Hagel not only failed to defend his views, but failed to show familiarity with the official policies of the administration he hoped to enter, mistakenly referring to a policy of “containment” with Iran and describing the Tehran regime as a “legitimate” government. Having failed to demonstrate that his recent shifts on several issues were sincere, he meekly asserted that his own views on policy would not matter.

The problem with Hagel’s performance at the hearing was not just that he stumbled, but that he dissembled, making a number of assertions that were shown to be untrue. Hagel also failed to provide more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given in previous years, and explained that he had “given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there, every video that I have that’s out there.”
Yet in the days that followed, several speeches emerged about which Hagel had not informed the committee, including some within the five-year timeframe that members of the committee had requested. Hagel and the Obama administration maintained that these speeches had been “informal,” but the fact that Hagel spoke extemporaneously did not make the speeches any less official, as video of one such speech confirmed.
Hagel also refused to provide complete information about possible sources of possible foreign income over the past five years, particularly indirect compensation he may have received through organizations or funds with which he has been affiliated. The Atlantic Council, which he chairs, is known to have accepted large donations from the Hariri family, which is active in Lebanese politics and supportive of the Hamas organization. 
After missing the deadline that Senators had imposed for disclosure, Hagel provided a list of foreign government and corporate donors to the Atlantic Council. He refused to provide additional information, saying he could not force other organizations to do the same. Democrats charged that Republicans were holding Hagel to an unprecedented standard; Republicans cited Democrats’ own demands that Henry Kissinger provide a list of his firm’s clients when he was nominated to the 9/11 commission, as well as the case of Hillary Clinton, who released a list of foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation.
It was Hagel’s refusal to come clean–and his evident attempts to evade transparency–that ultimately united the Republican caucus in the Senate behind a filibuster, including some members who had initially expressed strong reservations about using the tactic.
The resulting delay will provide the Senate with several more days in which to consider Hagel’s candidacy, and for the White House to consider other options. The very fact that Hagel’s nomination has proved so divisive, and has exposed so many weaknesses in the nominee, is itself an argument for withdrawal. In a time of rising threats and looming budget challenges, the Pentagon will not be served by a perception of weak leadership.
Any one of the many factors above should, by itself, have disqualified Hagel from even being considered for the post. But President Obama has thrown out the rules many times before in his quest to transform America. Hagel is, in a sense, the Obamacare of Cabinet nominations: a deeply problematic policy choice that may have the votes to pass but lacks broad public support and may ultimately cost far more than advertised.
The Republican filibuster may hold; it may not. But if even a few Democrats make the right choice–the kind of well-considered choice made by moderate Sen Susan Collins (R-ME), for example–then Hagel’s nomination will collapse on the merits. If they are honest with themselves, Democrats must admit that they would not even think about confirming Hagel except for the fact that Obama has staked his political capital on it.
The left’s attacks on Sen. Cruz, on conservative media, and on pro-Israel activists may serve the president’s political interests. He relishes opportunities to paint the opposition as intransigent. Yet the Hagel nomination is a good example of why the filibuster is necessary as a restraint on the majority, a way to help it correct its mistakes before they become irrevocable. Obama and his party have one last chance to do the right thing.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a member of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight,” urged his Senate colleagues and members of the media at the immigration bill hearing to not tie the bill to the Boston terror attack bombings. After he made the request, he proceeded to do exactly what he asked others to not do. 
“Before I get to the bill, I’d like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in Boston or try to conflate those events with this legislation,” Schumer said.
But, after Schumer made that plea, he commented on immigration reform, including the specific Gang of 8 bill, in the context of the Boston terror attacks.


“In general, we are a safer country when law enforcement knows who is here, has their fingerprints, photos, et cetera, background checks,” Schumer said.

“In addition, both the refugee program and asylum program have been strengthened in the past five years such that we are much more careful about screening people in terms of who should and should not be coming into the country,” Schumer added. “If there are any changes that our homeland security experts tell us need to be made, I’m committed to making them.”
Schumer’s comments came after the committee’s Ranking GOP Member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) mentioned the Boston bombing earlier in the hearing. Schumer’s chastisement of his colleagues about mentioning the Boston attack appeared to be a response to Grassley.
“We also appreciate the opportunity to talk about immigration, particularly in light of all that’s happening in Massachusetts right now and over the last week,” Grassley said to open the hearing. “We are here trying to understand why these events have occurred. It’s hard to understand that there are people in this world that want to do Americans harm, so this hearing is an opportunity to refocus on the issues at hand and the importance of remaining vigilant and secure in our homeland.”

Congrats to Sen. Rand Paul for highlighting an important issue by using his prerogative as a U.S. senator to launch a good, old-fashioned filibuster on John Brennan’s nomination for CIA director. 
As I’ve written previously, it seemed earlier that he might be off on a couple of points of constitutional law. In the rarest of circumstances, a President has power, under Article II of the Constitution, to launch a military strike on American soil–but only if that American citizen has taken up arms against his country and poses an imminent threat to American lives. He must be, legally, a military target. And it must be a situation so urgent–a Jack Bauer-type scene from 24–that there isn’t even time for federal agents to get into place to capture the terrorist. 
But his overall point is correct: We are witnessing repeated power grabs by an Imperial President. And he is correct that, when non-combatants are involved (American citizens who may sympathize with terrorists but are not involved in actual or imminent attacks on our fellow citizens or homeland) the Bill of Rights applies with full force, and no President can step outside the court system under those circumstances. 


But it’s different where combatants are concerned. A man who takes up arms against this country–not as a criminal but as a warrior–becomes a military target if, and only if, he is actually engaged in operations against America. 
Last night, Paul made follow-up comments suggesting that, if the U.S. citizen in question actually posed an imminent threat to American lives, a President could take whatever actions were necessary to stop him. If so, we’re all on the same side of this debate. 
It also must be noted that it’s hard to conceive of how such an imminent threat could happen on American soil. It happens in James Bond movies, but unless the traitor has a remote-controlled guided missile, he must approach some populated area before he can cause harm. If he’s close enough to set off a bomb, he’s probably close enough for police and federal agents to intercept him. 

But enough people are supporting Rand Paul that it’s important to pick out a couple points on the margins. Most of what Paul is saying is right, but it’s worth noting where he’s saying something that many of his supporters are not, or saying something that’s wrong. 
First, Paul acknowledged that the military can act in a war zone, and that we’re in war zones overseas. Some of Paul’s supporters are holding onto the idea that there has not been a legal war since World War II, and that both wars in the past quarter-century (in Iraq and Afghanistan) are unconstitutional. 
Evidently, Paul disagrees (and rightly so), since a war zone only exists in a war. Not only that, but Paul sponsored legislation to de-authorize the war overseas. To end a war means that there is one currently underway, and to attempt to rescind Congress’ authorization for war means that Congress had previously authorized war, pursuant to the Declare War Clause of the Constitution. 
Second, Paul said today, “I personally don’t think it would be very hard to try someone for treason.” Actually, it is extremely hard to convict someone of treason. The Constitution requires two eyewitness to the treasonous act. If you have an American-born terrorist in a foreign land, like Anwar Al-Awlaki who was hiding in Yemen and launching terrorist attacks, we could go for many years and never have eyewitnesses. 
Sometimes traitors cannot be successfully convicted of treason and, ironically, it’s for a reason Rand Paul supports. It’s so no President could even try to get his political opponents convicted of treason as a trumped up charge. You must have people who actually saw the traitor take up arms against this country or directly aid those who did. 

Third, Paul also referenced people who “denounced their citizenship” still deserving all the constitutional protections. Although many rights extend to all persons, whether citizens or foreigners, the United States can deal with enemies who are not citizens in a much deadlier fashion than citizens. 
If someone has denounced their citizenship, then they are no longer American. It’s unclear from his comments whether Paul realizes that, or perhaps merely mispoke. It’s likewise unclear whether he recognizes the distinction between military operations and law enforcement, and between domestic and foreign operations. We’ll probably learn those things in the coming days. 

But one of his points is so true it bears repeating: How do we end this war? Is this perpetual war, covering the entire globe? The Constitution gives Presidents broad powers to win a war. The idea of Presidents permanently claiming this power against an undefined enemy and then exerting those powers on our home soil is a profoundly disturbing thought — one that can endanger liberty itself for all Americans. 
I’m not sure any of us know the perfect way out of that situation, though I’m sure we’re going to debate our options. 
And that’s because Rand Paul was willing to actually follow through with a filibuster, and because many other senators committed to the Constitution–including other young and recent additions to the Senate, like Mike Lee and Ted Cruz–are backing that play as well. 

So the Senate might have moved a step back in the direction of deserving the title of the world’s greatest deliberative body.

Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) told Breitbart News he is confident House Republicans as a whole will stop the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill, and take up an alternative aimed at securing the border before handling anything else.
“I can’t say exactly what’s going to happen in the future, but based on what I know now and based on what I know about leadership, I would say that we’re not going to see this thing get watered down [to get a version of it passed],” Kelly said. “Our conference is a very strong and independent conference. 
“Sometimes folks get upset about that and I know why they do. But on the other hand, these folks I serve with are very principled and I don’t think they’re going to yield anything because they were promised a certain process was going to take place. I don’t think the Speaker was going to promise that if he wasn’t going to live up to it. I have a lot of respect for him, but he’s made commitments and I’ve never yet seen him break away on a commitment. I see him remain pretty strong.”  


Kelly said that members of Congress should have learned from the 1986 amnesty that border security needs to come before legalization. He added that Congress should have learned from Obamacare that massive pieces of legislation, like this 1,200-page immigration bill, should not be rushed through to passage.

“If we did not learn anything from 1986, if we didn’t learn anything from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, that big pieces of legislation shoved through in a hurry are dangerous, they are dangerous for people,” Kelly said. 
“I’m disappointed in the Senate. I’m disappointed in our colleagues in the Senate for doing what they did. I think they really made it look like they tried to put it in the House to position it as ‘these Republicans are going to try to hold it up.’ The Speaker has said that we will break this into smaller pieces. We will have a heavy debate, not a conversation–that’s ridiculous–there’s going to be a heavy debate and we’re going to look at it. And I still, I can’t imagine anybody looking at this piece that came out of the Senate and saying ‘you know, I feel pretty good about this.’ If I’m one of the four and a half million [legal immigrants] standing in line, waiting in line and who played by the rules, I’m not feeling very good about it. I’m not feeling very good about this at all.”
Kelly said he thinks much of the misconception about what may or may not happen in the House moving forward is contrived by pundits, especially the common theme that assumes House Republicans will cave and pass a bill like the Senate one. “The pundits say ‘oh no, they’ll cave, they’ll give in to pressure, they’ll do this, they’ll do that, because they know if they don’t they won’t win the next election,'” Kelly said. “I don’t buy that. We lost the last election because we didn’t have enough of our people come out and vote.”
Kelly added: “You and I both know a lot of this stuff comes from these people sitting around drinking brandy and smoking cigars and have never been a part of this but are actually trying to drive opinion and drive policy,” Kelly said. “They say ‘this is the way it’s got to be or it can’t float.'”
“‘Well, you’ve never been in a boat. How do you know what makes it float?'”
“These people are wrong as much as they’re right but they don’t get held accountable for the things that they do that are wrong,” Kelly said.

Top Republicans with classified information about the terrorist assault on the U.S. mission in Benghazi last September may not want to see a House Select Committee formed to investigate the attack that left four Americans dead, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens, although a number of Senate and House Republicans remain unsatisfied with information they have received from the Obama administration about the deadly attack.
Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA), a subcommittee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee, has re -filed a resolution to form such a select committee. Only Speaker John Boehner can allow the formation of a House Select Committee.


Other Republicans were unsure of their support for a select committee. “You know, I don’t think so. We’re still under the review of our committee right now, so we’re still conducting our investigation. We haven’t finished it yet. I’m not exactly sure where the foreign affairs committee is yet, but I know they are still doing their review,” said Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, when Breitbart News asked if he would support Wolf’s effort.
Wolf sent a “dear colleague letter” to Republican House members on Friday asking for their support for his resolution. Wolf expressed the necessity for the select committee so that Benghazi survivors could have a venue to put forth their accounts without risking their jobs or face prosecution from the Justice Department.

Boehner and Rogers are both part of Congress’ “super 8,” both parties’ top leadership in the upper and lower chambers. They, as well as chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, are all privy to classified information about the Benghazi attack. 
Rogers also disagreed with Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) regarding Paul’s assertion that the CIA annex in Benghazi was a site that Americans were running guns to “out of Libya into Turkish hands.”
“We have looked at all of that. I can find no information that substantiates that, but if it were there, I would want to find it,” Rogers said. 
On January 24, Speaker Boehner told conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, regarding Paul’s remarks, “I’m somewhat familiar with the chatter about this and the fact that these arms were moving towards Turkey, but most what I know about this came from a classified source and I really can’t elaborate on it.” 
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Ranking Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, both told Breitbart News they knew nothing about  the gunrunning from the CIA annex to which Paul was referring.
House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said in November that he did not find it necessary for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi attack after Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) had announced the need for one.
The three senators, who are all part of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released a statement on Monday threatening to place a hold on John Brennan, Barack Obama’s nominee for CIA director, if the administration did not release more information about the Benghazi attack. 
The statement included a litany of what remains known and unknown about the attacks, as well as contradictory statements made by administration officials in congressional testimony.
Senators are expected to vote on Brennan’s nomination in committee on Tuesday.

As a precondition for “peace” talks with the Palestinians that will produce nothing, President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry demanded that Israel’s government release over 100 long-term convicted terrorists and murderers, many imprisoned for vicious crimes committed long before either intifada.
The “Elder of Ziyon” blog has compiled a list of those to be released–and their victims. Here is a sample:



Atiyeh Salem Musa: killed Isaac (Aizek) Rotenberg, 67, Holocaust survivor, 1994

Isaac Rotenberg was born to Natan and Miriam Rotenberg in Poland on 15 March 1927. A selektzia was held in his city following the outbreak of the Second World War, and his family was sent to the Sobibór extermination camp. With the exception of him, his younger brother, and his sister, his entire family perished. He was taken with his brother to a labor camp. When a revolt broke out, the two succeeded in escaping the camp, but they lost track of each other in the ensuing commotion. Isaac then made his way to the forest and joined the partisans.
In April 1947, Isaac reached the Land of Israel. He joined the IDF the next year, and fought in the War of Liberation in the north, near Kibbutz Manara.
Isaac was married to Riva, and they had two children, Tzipora and Pinhas. He worked as a plasterer, and was a founder of the city of Holon. Upon reaching retirement age, he decided to continue working a few hours per day to keep himself busy.
On 29 March 1994, during the Passover holiday, as Isaac was hunched on his knees, fixing a floor in his workplace in Petah Tikva, two of the Arab laborers on site attacked him and struck the back of his neck with axes. He was critically wounded, and entered a coma. Two days later, on 31 March, he died.


Hosni Faregh Sawalha–murder of Baruch Heisler, 24, 1990

On 2 December 1990, Yaacov missed his ride to his yeshiva [religious seminary] and instead boarded bus 66 from Petah Tikva to Tel Aviv. Three Arab terrorists boarded at the Pardes Katz stop, and immediately thereafter, at the junction of Ben Gurion Road and Jabotinsky Road in Ramat Gan, began stabbing passengers. Baruch Yaacov was murdered; three others were injured. 


Esmat Omar Mansour–accessory to murder of Haim Mizrahi, 1993

Hayim Mizrahi was born to Mazal and Pinhas Mizrahi on 8 December 1963. He grew up in Bat Yam and Holon with his sisters, Margalit and Asnat, and his brother, Itzik. As a child, Hayim belonged to the junior league soccer team of Hapoel Tel Aviv. Following is army service, he became religious, moved to Beit El, and married Iris.
On Friday, 29 October 1993, Hayim went to buy eggs from an Arab-owned farm near his home, as he was wont to do. He was greeted by terrorists who attacked him and fled in his vehicle after wounding him and stuffing him into the trunk. The terrorists proceeded to murder Hayim, then burned and abandoned the vehicle north of Ramallah.
Hayim was 30 at the time of his death. He was put to rest in Holon Cemetery. Hayim was survived by his pregnant wife, his parents, his sisters, and his brother. Half-a-year after his murder, his daughter, Tehilla, was born.



Obama and Kerry insisted on the release of the terrorists and murderers, and Israel–fearful of losing U.S. support at the UN and against Iran–complied. That is the heavy price demanded by an administration that prides itself as tough on terrorists–while arming them and Syria and releasing them in Israel.

On Tuesday, William W. Taylor III, attorney for Lois Lerner, the IRS official at the center of the Tea Party targeting scandal who invoked her Fifth amendment rights before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on May 22, set forward his client’s hard line conditions to return and testify openly before the committee.
“They can obtain her testimony tomorrow by doing it the easy way … immunity. That’s the way to resolve all of this,” he told Politico.
Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH), a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was unimpressed. “We hope she comes in and gives us the truth and answers questions. If that doesn’t happen, then you cross the next bridge. … If she says, ‘No, I’m going to come in and assert my Fifth Amendment rights again and not going to speak,’ then you think about what the other options are.”


Legal experts have debated whether Ms. Lerner waived her fifth amendment rights when she delivered an opening statement declaring her innocence prior to invoking those rights. On June 28 in a 22-17 party line vote, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ruled that she did waive her Fifth amendment rights with that opening statement.

Should Ms. Lerner continue to insist that she will not testify without full immunity, the next step in this battle of wills and legal tactics could be a vote by the full House of Representatives to determine if Ms. Lerner is in contempt of Congress. If the full House determines she is in contempt, a criminal rather than civil charge, Ms. Lerner could face jail time.
Ms. Lerner’s attorney appears unphased by the possibility his client could face contempt charges. “[N]obody likes to be held in contempt of Congress, of course, but the real question is one that we’re fairly confident about, and I don’t think any district judge in the country would hold that she waived.”
Should the House hold Ms. Lerner in contempt, it would be the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, an employee of the Department of Justice, to prosecute the case. Since Attorney General Eric Holder, who runs the Department of Justice, has already experienced his own difficulties surrounding his testimony before the House of Representatives, it is unlikely, though not impossible, that the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia would pursue prosecution of any contempt charges coming out of the House.
The penalty for contempt of Congress is a fine of $1,000 and up to one year in jail.

Following up on Ace’s post here is Biden telling Chris Matthews back in 2007 that he is deadly serious about attempting to impeach Bush if he goes to war in Iran without congressional authorization:



Matthews: You said that if the President of the United States had launched an attack on Iran without congressional approval that would have been an impeachable offense. Do you want to review that comment you made? Well how do you stand on that now?
Biden:Yes I do. I want to stand by the comment I made. The reason I made the comment was as a warning. I don’t say those things lightly, Chris, you’ve known me for a long time. I was chairman of the judiciary committee for 17 years or its ranking member. I teach separation of powers and constitutional law. This is something I know. So I got together and brought a group of constitutional scholars together to write a piece that I’m going to deliver to the whole United State Senate pointing out the President has no constitutional authority…to take this nation to war against a county of 70 million people unless we’re attacked or unless there is proof we are about to be attacked. And if he does, if he does, I would move to impeach him. The House obviously has to do that but I would lead an effort to impeach him. The reason for my doing that, I don’t say it lightly, I don’t say it lightly. I say it because they should understand that what they were threatening, what they were saying, what it was adding up to be, what it looked like to the rest of the world we were about to do would be the most disastrous thing that could be done in this moment in our history that I could think of.

16830	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/12/Horowitz-blasts-left-Heritage	News	1	National Security	None	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
On Tuesday, former Marxist-turned-conservative icon David Horowitz spoke at the Heritage Foundation to mark the launch of what will be a ten-volume compendium of his writings on leftism, The Black Book of the American Left. In his wide-ranging speech, Horowitz described his transition from left to right, and discussed the shortcomings of a conservative movement unwilling to deal with the ugly realities of what the American left represents.

Horowitz began by distinguishing the David Horowitz Freedom Center from other think tanks, instead characterizing it as a “battle tank.” He labeled himself “monomaniacal” in his focus on the left and its relation to communism. “There are hedgehogs and foxes. The foxes know many things. And the hedgehogs know one thing. I am a hedgehog,” he joked.

“My parents called themselves progressives,” Horowitz explained with regard to his communist parents. “The agenda was a Soviet America…the slogan of the communist party in those days was peace, jobs, democracy. Sound familiar?”

That was the theme of Horowitz’s speech as he continued: how the communists had taken over the Democratic Party. “The communist party is the Democratic Party,” Horowitz stated. “In The Great Gatsby, [F. Scott] Fitzgerald describes the rich as people who break things and leave them for others to clean up. That is a wonderful description of the left.” Horowitz, who began as a radical Marxist, said that the modern left had learned stealth from their failures in the 1960s: “The left have learned from the 1960s…we in the 1960s didn’t want to pretend to be Jeffersonian democrats…That’s why we failed in the 1960s. That’s why they’ve succeeded now.”
But the right, Horowitz pointed out, has failed to acknowledge that reality. On Obamacare, for example, Horowitz railed against the language used by the left: “single-payer.” Instead, he said, “it is communism,” pointing out that it was state ownership of the means of production. He added, “The left hate the Constitution because Madison designed it to thwart them.”

Horowitz then analyzed what he claimed were the four features of the leftist mentality. First, he said, the left and right are on opposite sides of the “fundamental divide of the modern age”: the left believes that human beings are inherently good and infinitely malleable, and so can be shaped by proper state guidance. Conservatives, by contrast, believe that human beings are responsible for social problems, and concentrating power in the hands of humans is dangerous.
Second, Horowitz said, the left are characterized by the belief that “history is a forward march.” Obama, Horowitz claimed, is a deep believer in this concept, all the way down to his carpet in the Oval Office, which assures those who enter that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. “Leftism is a crypto-religion,” he explained. “They see themselves as a savior. People who believe that redemption will take place in this life and I will be a part of it, that’s Hitler. That’s Mao…That’s the American left.”
Third, Horowitz said that the left was characterized by “alienation from this country… What weakens America is actually good.” Horowitz cited the Obama administration’s eager withdrawal from Iraq as evidence of that proposition: “Obama betrayed every American who gave their life for the people of Iraq.” He also slammed the Obama administration with regard to Benghazi: “Benghazi is the most shameful act in the history of the American presidency.”

Finally, said Horowitz, the American left “lie. And it’s not like politicians spinning…you cannot be a leftist without lying about the most basic strategic facts about who you are.”
Horowitz summed up pessimistically: “We are within reach of a totalitarian state in this country…These are very very dark days for this country.” But, Horowitz held out hope: “there’s been an earthquake on the conservative side since I switched sides…the tea party is the earthquake. The best thing that Republicans can do is stop the fratricide.”

On August 26, President Obama will present Ty Carter with the Medal of Honor. Carter initially joined the Marines in 1998; he joined the Army a decade later in 2008 after being honorably discharged in 2003 and has attained the rank of Staff Sergeant.
Carter earned the Medal of Honor by running back and forth between Combat Outpost Keating and a disabled Humvee while serving in Afghanistan. Three American soldiers were stuck in the disabled humvee without any ammunition to defend themselves or strike back at the enemy.
Carter and his platoon were deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009. Once there, Carter found himself at Combat Outpost Keating, which he described as “a death trap” because it sat deep within a valley surrounded by mountains. The outpost was there to keep insurgents from slipping into Pakistan, and Carter was there to help man it until it could be shut down on October 4, 2009.


But as CNN reports, the Taliban struck the day before the outpost was to be closed. Carter and his fellow soldiers were forced to defend their lives in what is arguably one of the most intense firefights of the war in Afghanistan.

As the Taliban targeted mortars and large guns at Combat Outpost Keating in an attempt to render the location defenseless, they kept a constant barrage of small arms fire on the troops as well. By using this tactic, they were able to kill eight of the 53 American soldiers stationed there.
With the worst of the fire coming in, Carter realized three fellow soldiers–Sgt. Bradley Larson, Spc. Stephan Mace, and Sgt. Justin Gallegos–“[were] trapped in a Humvee and they needed more supplies to return fire.”
Carter ran “through that deadly gauntlet three times to get supplies to the men.”
By the time the attack on Combat Outpost Keating ended, two of the soldiers in the Humvee–Mace and Gallegos–were dead, and Carter says he is haunted by his belief that he could have done more. He says the faces of the dead soldiers pop into his head and he thinks, “I shoulda [sic] done this, I could of done that.”
Breitbart News salutes Staff Sgt. Ty Carter for his courage under fire. We are free because of men like him. God bless the families of the troops who were lost at Combat Outpost Keating. Breitbart News refuses to allow their sacrifice to be forgotten.

We now know the Boston Marathon terrorists were Muslims with roots in Chechnya, the Russian province in an ongoing conflict with Moscow, with a large Muslim population and a history of violent conflict with the Kremlin in a long struggle for independence. They were likely not right-wing Americans, as some on the left had predicted and hoped.
We do not yet know whether they are part of a larger cell or whether these attacks were directed from abroad versus being exclusively the idea of these two terrorist brothers. Experts note that on one hand terrorist groups have put information on the Internet on how to make the specific types of bombs used in the attack, but also say it is very possible these brothers also received terrorist training overseas. We may learn the answers to these questions in coming days. 
Either way, it’s disconcerting that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) was “sharing intel“ with authorities in the investigation of this bombing. SPLC is the ultra-left group that has a habit of demonizing conservative organizations as “domestic hate groups,” but has now been linked in federal court to a convicted terrorist. Even some outspoken liberals take issue with the SPLC’s outrageous bias, saying SPLC is “essentially a fraud.”


Recently, a U.S. army officer used SPLC’s material to say the military should watch out for soldiers thought to support various Christian organizations targeted by the SPLC, as well as immigration-reform groups (suggesting they’re “anti-Muslim”) and Tea Party groups. 

It’s critically important to recognize that there are countless peaceful and patriotic Muslim Americans, and they must not be lumped in with terrorists. But given our history, it’s not “anti-Muslim” to note when a terrorist is Muslim and motivated by fanatical religious beliefs. 
The Obama administration’s decision to prosecute the Ft. Hood shooter, Maj. Nadal Hasan, as a perpetrator of “workplace violence” instead of a terrorist attack–while refusing to give military honors, such as Purple Hearts to those shot by Hasan–showcases a profoundly disturbing political correctness that has no place in national security circles. 
As the recent sentencing of convicted terrorist Floyd Corkins, who confessed that he planned his terrorist attack based on information provided by SPLC, approaches on Apr. 29, it is increasingly important that no law enforcement agency lends any credibility to the SPLC. Its partisan agenda focuses so much energy going after conservatives and Christians instead of real terrorists.

The “Gang of” 8 grand immigration proposal, over 800 pages, is written by members of the same body that has failed to address the problem of meaningful immigration reform for over 30 years. 
Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) stated that he wanted the 92 other members to join in this important debate. In the House of Representatives in particular, the silence of the GOP leadership is deafening.
Look at what is missing in this process: transparency; experts on many aspects of immigration reform; and law enforcement agencies involved in dealing with the problems on the ground. The GOP-led House of Representatives has promised regular order. How much transparency we will see from the Senate is undetermined. Most of all, valuable input from relevant Governors are left out of the equation.


A transparent public discussion is required. In 1986 we had outright amnesty and the promised enforcement of a secure border. Lack of promised enforcement by Democrats got us to this point with a significantly larger problem. Are we creating de facto amnesty again with a rushed comprehensive bill over incremental and combined approaches to the problem?
With America’s burgeoning Hispanic population–the largest block of illegal immigrants–more emphasis seems to be placed on who will vote en masse for which party over necessary solutions for the long-term future of this country. It is a bitter pill to take, with the term “lawful presence” in its prescription.
The recent terror attacks in Boston renewed calls from both Republicans and Democrats in the “Gang of 8” for immediate immigration reform. Border security is key, as Arizona Governor Jan Brewer recently stated in my American Forum.


Governor Brewer made the case for working with residents that live along the border, state police, sheriffs and other local law enforcement agencies. There is also the issue of sending the National Guard for additional resources.

This is not a numbers issue; it is a human issue. We have citizens in constant danger along our southern border. There are areas where a fence is necessary and could prove to be effective. The Obama Administration restricts border patrol activity on federal lands, and the cartels, human traffickers, illegal aliens who break our law by crossing the southern border are not known for their obedience to the law. They cross onto federal land with impunity, and the proper authorities are not allowed to pursue.

The “Gang of 8” proposal so far leaves more questions to be answered than solutions offered. Solutions must include standards, methods to achieve those standards, and metrics to measure their effectiveness. Long-term concerns, such as those expressed by Governor Brewer, much less solutions, are largely cast aside.

What a wonderful character insight it is to discover that David Remnick, the same biographer capable of summoning all kinds of eloquence and empathy for Boston’s accused mass-murdering terrorists, is also the same David Remnick that publicly smeared the ridiculously peaceful Tea Party as something driven by wicked intentions.  
In a 2010 audience Q&A about his (then) new book on Barack Obama, Remnick confessed that what he saw among the everyday moms and dads and grandmothers and grandfathers who populate the Tea Party is an entity motivated mostly by fear and race:


When you hear people in the Tea Party movement saying, ‘I want my country back, I’ve lost my country,’ something is being said there, very often, that has to do with race. It has to do with otherness. It has to do with a nostalgia for an imagined America some time ago.
As I write this, Remnick is being celebrated all throughout the elite media for his morally illiterate New Yorker article that biographies Boston Marathon suspects, Tamerlan and Dzohokhar Tsarnaev. So impressed is the elite media, that George Stephanopoulos has invited Remnick to appear on “This Week” Sunday. 
If you are naively wondering why all this is happening, here is what I wrote earlier today:

Much of this is and will be motivated by the left’s bizarre desire to forever rationalize radical Islam. For some reason, Islamists are the only racist, sexist, homophobic theocrats the media can’t summon outrage against. I suspect it is also the result of industry-wide disappointment over the fact that the bad guys aren’t right-wingers. (Would Remnick have summoned such eloquence for the savage second coming of McVeigh? Would the media be gushing over it?) 
So what we have here is the media still looking for a way to blame the most inviting and inclusive country in the world for not being inviting and inclusive enough.
The same media that sees only evil in the peaceful Tea Party just can’t bring itself to see evil in the kind of terrorism they can’t exploit against the Tea Party or any of their enemies on the right. 
The media will  bend over backwards to shroud monstrous terrorism in lofty nuance. 
You and I, though, are just monsters.

Officials say that more than a dozen classified rulings have created a secret body of law that gives the NSA the power to gather massive information collections on Americans.  The data collection is not just restricted to terrorism suspects but “people possibly involved in nuclear proliferation, espionage and cyberattacks.”
According to officials who are familiar with these classified rulings, the court has expanded it’s role while assessing “broad constitutional questions” and establishing judicial precedents without any public scrutiny.  Some rulings are over 100 pages long. 


The role of the FISA court has changed over the years, originally approving case by case wiretaps.  In 2007, with greater judicial oversight of intelligence operations and other legislation, the FISA court “has quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court, serving as the ultimate arbiter on surveillance issues and delivering opinions that will most likely shape intelligence practices for years to come, the officials said.”
In particular the court has expanded the NSA’s surveillance authority under a legal principle called the “special needs” doctrine which allows, in cases of terrorism, “an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement of a warrant for searches and seizures.” This doctrine was originally established by the Supreme Court in 1989 when it found that a minimal invasion of privacy is acceptable in order for the government to combat an “overriding” public danger. FISA judges have used this more broadly to allow collecting communications data to track terrorism suspects that “does not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment.”
William C. Banks, a national security law expert said “It seems like a legal stretch.  It’s another way of tilting the scales toward the government in its access to all this data.”  

In one instance, intelligence officials were allowed to access an email attachment that was sent within in the United States  because there was suspicion that it contained the schematics of diagram that could have been connected to Iran’s nuclear program.
But this example of domestic surveillance is permissible because a 2008 law expanded the definition of “foreign intelligence” to include “weapons of mass destruction.”  And other secret findings have “eased access to data on espionage, cyberattacks and other possible threats connected to foreign intelligence.”

“The definition of ‘foreign intelligence’ is very broad,” another former intelligence official said in an interview. “An espionage target, a nuclear proliferation target, that all falls within FISA, and the court has signed off on that.”

In an interview with the New York Times, “current and former national security officials, discussed the court’s rulings and the general trends they have established on the condition of anonymity because they are classified. Judges on the FISA court refused to comment on the scope and volume of their decisions.”
The FISA Court only hears one side of the cases that come before it (the government’s side) and findings are almost never made public. There is a “Court of Review” in case of appeal, but that has only happened “a handful of times in the court’s history, and no case has ever been taken to the Supreme Court.”  
It may not even be possible for the communications companies who are turning over information to the government have a right to appear before the FISA court. 

The FISA court was created by Congress in 1978 in order to serve as a check on wiretap abuses by the government.  There are 11 judges who serve in 7 year shifts, ten were nominated by Chief Justice John Roberts.  Last year the courts heard nearly 1800 cases and according to sources no requests were denied.
FISA judges have had to “intervene repeatedly” when “Internet and phone companies…have raised concerns that the government is overreaching in its demands for records or when the government itself reports that it has inadvertently collected more data than was authorized, the officials said.”
The court has ordered the the NSA to destroy communications records when information has been collected improperly.  According to the New York Times’ sources, 

The judges have concluded that the mere collection of enormous volumes of “metadata” — facts like the time of phone calls and the numbers dialed, but not the content of conversations — does not violate the Fourth Amendment, as long as the government establishes a valid reason under national security regulations before taking the next step of actually examining the contents of an American’s communications.

In 2008, Congress passed new procedures in the FISA Amendment acts where “the collection of metadata must be considered “relevant” to a terrorism investigation or other intelligence activities.”  The courts hae indicated that while individual pieces of data may not appear relevant, “the total picture that the bits of data create may in fact be relevant.”
When pressed about informing the public about these issues, there has been push back. Reggie Walton, the FISA court’s presiding judge, said there could be a potential benefit but there are “serious obstacles.”  General Alexander, the NSA director responded in a public Senate hearing in June  “I don’t want to jeopardize the security of Americans by making a mistake in saying, ‘Yes, we’re going to do all that.’ ”  Alexander pledged to try and make decisions more public.

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a member of the Senate’s Gang of Eight, told CNN on Wednesday that he thinks the House GOP’s plan to approach immigration reform through piecemeal legislation is acceptable since the bills will simply be combined in conference.
“We would much prefer a big comprehensive bill but any way that the House can get there is okay by us,” Schumer said. “I actually am optimistic that we will get this done. I’ve had a lot of discussions with members of both parties in the House. Things are moving in the right direction.”
Schumer said House Republicans now appear more open than ever to granting amnesty to illegal aliens, and are going to use the strategy of passing a large group of bills addressing specific immigration issues to get to a conference with the Senate bill. “My initial reaction was the House wasn’t going to take up any bill,” Schumer said. “That would have been very bad, no bill. Now they’re doing it in pieces.”


Schumer added that he thinks “a couple of their pieces are very similar to ours.”

Schumer is the latest amnesty proponent to admit publicly the end game strategy is to get to a conference with the Senate bill by having the House pass a group of bills. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has all but promised the same thing, as have House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI).
Schumer’s fellow Gang of Eight member, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), publicly admitted the same goal a few weeks ago when he pleaded with leftwing activists at the Center for American Progress to help get them to conference.
Ultimately, former Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) claimed in an op-ed on Wednesday that this is all part of the “secret Republican strategy to secure amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.”
“The names may have changed, but the tactics remain the same,” Hayworth wrote. “After decades of promises to address illegal immigration, we are once again hearing the same old nonsense from Republican politicians.” 
“Lawmakers vowing to act tough on border security while looking to secure amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants has become infuriatingly all-too-familiar,” he said.

An assistant U.S. Attorney is Houston has withdrawn from a major prosecution against the Aryan Brotherhood. 
The prosecutor, Jay Hileman, sent an email to one of the Brotherhood’s defense attorneys, informing him that he was no longer on the case. It is widely believed that Hileman withdrew due to concerns and his and his family’s security. 


In the wake of the horrific murders of Kaufman County DA Mike McLelland and his wife, speculation, fueled by the media, has focused on the Aryan Brotherhood, a drug-trafficking crime syndicate with a significant presence in Texas. Police have not named a suspect in the murders and there is no known evidence tying the criminal gang to the murders, but the widespread media speculation of their involvement is having a dramatic ripple effect. 

Hileman was part of a team bringing a major racketeering case against 34 members of the Brotherhood. An important component of the government’s case is based on testimony from a former general of the Brotherhood, who is currently under very tight security. 
The Justice Department will replace Hileman with another prosecutor from Washington, DC. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston released the following statement:

The case currently pending in the Southern District of Texas has been and will continue to be worked by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas in partnership with the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division.

The Aryan Brotherhood has morphed over the years from a prison gang to a major middleman in the drug trade. Whether or not the gang was involved in the recent murders in Kaufman County, it is clear that the most violent elements of the drug trade are now active in Texas.

Kevin Kolbye, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Dallas, served as the on-scene commander for the Benghazi investigation but has not yet testified before Congress about what he knows.
Republican Congressman Frank Wolf wants to know why. 
Kolbye addressed the GovSec West Conference in Dallas in late November and discussed various aspects of the Benghazi investigation with attendees. During his presentation, Kolbye noted that, contrary to initial reports, FBI assets were on the scene in Benghazi within a few days after the attack. Breitbart News reported that story when it broke.


Kolbye explained, “We have people in a lot of other foreign countries who are [legal attachés]. We have investigative teams that are well equipped.” In response to claims that the FBI could not access the site because of security clearance issues, he affirmed, “We were there.”

Rep. Wolf was amazed that this information didn’t reach Congress sooner. He told Breitbart News last Thursday:

I’m shocked to find that someone said that they were there in several days and all the reports we’ve had both from the administration and from the news media was that it took several weeks before they got there. Secondly, I don’t understand why this guy, Kevin Kolbye, wasn’t called as a witness by several other committees in Congress.

The Benghazi attacks occurred on September 11, 2012. The Washington Post reported on September 18 that FBI agents had arrived in Libya, but later information indicated that they were delayed en route to Benghazi. On October 4, the Associated Press (AP) reported that a team of FBI agents arrived in Benghazi and stayed for only one day due to clearance issues. “Agents arrived in Benghazi before dawn on Thursday and departed after sunset, after weeks of waiting for access to the crime scene to investigate the Sept. 11 attack,” the report reads. 
Kolbye’s claim that FBI staff was on-site at Benghazi flies in the face of these reports.
Rep. Wolf is leading the charge to untangle the complicated web of circumstances surrounding Benghazi. Wolf has been the driving force behind the idea of forming a Benghazi Select Committee to investigate the 2012 attack. While House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) appears unmotivated to appoint members to one, a recent McLaughlin-Caddell poll showed that two thirds of Americans want a Select Committee; this number includes 83 percent of Republicans as well as 58 percent of independents who “believe it is important for a special committee to get the truth about Benghazi.”
Speaking with Breitbart News, Rep. Wolf expressed his outrage at Congress’s lack of critical information:

If [Kolbye] was the on-scene guy leading this investigation, you would think he would be one of the very first people [Congress] actually called, and I think that’s another reason why I think he should be called. Kevin Kolbye should be called publicly. If he can testify or give a speech at a paid event in Texas where people had to pay, I think we can let the American people know for free. Most members of Congress have no idea what happened. And if they don’t have any idea what happened — the American people, they don’t know what happened. This guy ought to be called, and we need to have a select committee to have all these guys called under oath. Here he was at a conference where people had to pay $400, not under oath. And yet nobody in Congress can even talk to him? That’s crazy.

According to a breaking report from the UK Guardian, Barack Obama’s National Security Agency has been collecting phone records of millions of domestic customers of Verizon under a court order obtained in April. The order requires Verizon to turn over phone records on an “ongoing, daily basis” to the NSA, both within the US and between the US and international sources. 
The Guardian reports: “The document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.” The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) handed over the order to the FBI on April 25, and gave them a three month blanket surveillance clearance. That means that numbers of both parties, location data, call duration, and time of all calls are subject to government surveillance. That makes the Obama administration’s oversight essentially unlimited.


The NSA, White House and Department of Justice all declined comment. The court order says that Verizon is forbidden to let customers know about the surveillance. Verizon also declined comment.

The order forces Verizon to turn over electronic versions of “all call detail records or ‘telephony metadata’ created by Verizon for communications between the United States and abroad” … or, more ominously, “wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls.” Every single day, Verizon must turn over that information.
The Guardian says that Verizon may not be the only cell-phone provider targeted with the order, and adds that “previous reporting has suggested the NSA has collected cell records from all major mobile networks.”
The law legalizing this sort of surveillance is 50 USC 1861, a provision of the Patriot Act allowing requests of business records. 

This sort of controversy arose in 2006 under President Bush under the auspices of the war on terror. President Obama essentially declared the war on terror over in April, at about the same point the administration received its blanket surveillance go-ahead from the FISA court.

After Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old suspected Boston Marathon bomber whose older brother was killed earlier in a shootout, was captured alive on Friday after a extensive manhunt, a dour President Barack Obama addressed the nation. While he was adamant that the American people do not hold these heinous acts against “entire groups of people,” he did not mention radical Islam at all.
In a stoic Friday evening address that was in contrast to the jubilant atmosphere on Boston’s streets, Obama spoke of the “resolve and determination” of those in Boston, sent his condolences to the family of the MIT police officer who was murdered on Friday by the suspects, and praised Boston’s police officers. 
He vowed to “determine what happened” and find “any associations these terrorists may have had.” Obama also said, “we’ve seen the character of this country” during this “tough week” and that the people of Boston refused to be intimidated and Americans “refuse to be terrorized.” 


He became most animated, though, when speaking about how Americans should not “latch on to any bit of information sometimes to jump to conclusions” before facts are “relentlessly” gathered. 
“That’s why we take care not to rush to judgement, not about the motivations of these individuals and certainly not about entire groups of people,” Obama said. 
Contrary to what Obama and the mainstream media may think, Americans do not “rush to judgment” without any evidence. In this case, there has already been plenty of pieces of evidence to suggest radical Islam may have influenced the suspected bombers, especially older brother Tamerlan.

In an interview with Russia Today, the mother of the suspects said the FBI “were scared of my oldest son” because “they always told me he’s a leader,” and they were “afraid of him because, you know, he is a leader, he talks about Islam a lot.”
She said her eldest son got involved in “religious politics” five years ago, and the FBI was scared of him because of the information he was getting from “extremist” websites. 
But the mother, perhaps like Obama, seemed to be in denial by claiming her sons could not be involved in Jihad and were “set up” by the FBI. The mother claimed the sons would have told her of the terrorist attacks if they really, in her mind, had intended to bomb the Boston Marathon.
On Monday evening, in his first address to the nation after the Boston Marathon bombings, Obama did not refer to the bombings as terrorism. Immediately after he spoke, the White House had to issue a statement that they considered the bombings an “act of terror.”
Obama had to clean up the mess on Tuesday and do damage control in what seemed like a press conference that was called just so Obama could say the words “act of terror” on camera. 
Robert Baer, a former CIA official, said on Friday that that there is a “cultural fight” between radical Islam and the West, and the older brother may have “identified with Jihadism” when “he found religion and wanted to defend Islam” because “it gave him meaning.” Even Piers Morgan, Even Piers Morgan, who is largely sympathetic to Obama and his agenda, discussed the suspected bomber’s potential ties to radical Islam on Friday evening. 
But the Obama administration consistently seems to be either oblivious to or dismissive of the threat of global Jihad. And while Obama has rightfully warned Americans not to make judgments without evidence, Obama has too often ignored evidence of radical Islam’s influence. 
For instance,  the Obama administration refused to call the Fort Hood massacre an act of terror, instead referring to it as “workplace violence.” He also took three days to address the nation after the attempted Christmas Day airplane bombing in 2009.

Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who was beaten while marching for voting rights on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on “Bloody Sunday” in 1965, compared National Security Agency (NSA) leaker Edward Snowden to Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
In an interview with the UK Guardian that was published on Wednesday, Lewis said Snowden was following in the footsteps of others who engaged in non-violent civil disobedience. 


“In keeping with the philosophy and the discipline of non-violence, in keeping with the teaching of Henry David Thoreau and people like Gandhi and others, if you believe something that is not right, something is unjust, and you are willing to defy customs, traditions, bad laws, then you have a conscience,” Lewis said. “You have a right to defy those laws and be willing to pay the price.”

Lewis noted that is what “we did” during the civil rights movement and mentioned he “got arrested 40 times during the sixties. Since I’ve been in Congress I’ve been arrested four times. Sometimes you have to act by the dictates of your conscience. You have to do it.”
Lewis also said the federal government similarly spied on and targeted Martin Luther King. 
“We had that problem during the height of the civil rights movement,” Lewis said. “People spied on, and got information on Martin Luther King Junior, and tried to use it against him, on the movement, tried to plant people within different organizations–that probably led to the destruction of some of those groups.
As The Hill noted, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) also likened Snowden to Thoreau and Martin Luther King in June. 
“On deciding when you decide to become a civil disobedient–we’ve had famous ones in our career, but some of them only had to serve, like [Henry David] Thoreau only had to serve one day in jail, Martin Luther King served 30 days in jail,” Paul said then.

The Senate Armed Services Committee has delayed a vote on the nomination of Chuck Hagel to serve as Defense Secretary after he failed to turn over requested financial information. Hagel had been asked to disclose details about foreign funding he had received, either through paid speeches or through entities with which he was involved. In a short statement yesterday, Hagel said he couldn’t comply with the request.  
This information is critical to determining Hagel’s fitness to head the Defense Department. As Secretary, he assumes a lead role in defining, and protecting, America’s national security interests. The Senate is absolutely right to demand details about compensation he received from foreign entities. The disclosure will help allay concerns about possible conflicts of interest. 
The stonewalling on the disclosure is just the latest stumble in Hagel’s path to confirmation. His performance at his confirmation hearing on January 31st was widely panned. Even Democrat supporters reported they were “shocked at how ill-prepared” Hagel was in the hearing. He didn’t seem ready to answer questions that were widely expected to be asked. On other questions he fumbled, having to later clarify his answers. 


The worst part, though, was probably when Hagel admitted “I don’t know enough about [military programs and technology]. There are a lot of things I don’t know about. I, if confirmed, intend to know a lot more than I do.”

Heading the Defense Department is not made for on-the-job training. It is the largest, most complex organization in the world. It is also vital to America’s safety. Hagel has not been nominated for Commerce or Labor, where the nation could easily withstand a failed Secretary. He will be managing America’ military, through a period of budget cuts and reassessment of strategic threats. 
Only a seasoned executive, with intimate knowledge of America’s military, could navigate the department and our country safely through those waters. Regardless of party, each Senator must carefully ask themselves whether they can support a nominee who seemed so ill-prepared and visibly incompetent in his hearing. If they do, then they are at least partly responsible for any calamities that may ensue.

Despite Americans’ concerns about the domestic use of drones, California local agencies are reportedly moving forward with an application to declare a broad swath of Southern California a “drone zone” – an area to be used to test pilotless aircraft. The purpose: government stimulus. 

In California, the San Diego Military Advisory Council (SDMAC) and the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation (EDC) have filed an application with the Federal Aviation Administration to create a drone zone. These groups want to stimulate state drone business, even as the state raises its taxes repeatedly, driving out other business. Northrup Grumman, a major drone producer, has relocated branches of its unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) program to Southern California. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which produces Predator drones, is located in Poway. The UAV industry in San Diego County clocks in at approximately $1.3 billion, and that number is growing fast.



And it’s not just California. The FAA is prepared to greenlight six test zones across the country, and over 40 applications have been filed or will be filed shortly, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Applicants include the State Department, the Ohio Department of Transportation, the National Institute of Standards and technologies, and the Grand Forks Sheriff’s Department. The winners of this drone zone sweepstakes will be able to claim a chunk of what may be a $10 billion industry. Senator Harry Reid‘s office says he pushed the FAA program that laid the groundwork for the drone zones. “We had Nevada in mind,” said Reid’s spokeswoman to the Las Vegas Sun. But the zones are bipartisan-approved: Gov. Brian Sandoval (R-NV) is apparently working with Reid and the FAA to try to grab one of the zones.
Ian Gregor, Public Affairs Manager for the FAA Pacific Division, directed Breitbart News to the FAA website’s page on Unmanned Aircraft Systems without further comment. The FAA website describes the goal of the test-site program: “The research done at the test sites will help the FAA develop regulatory standards to foster UAS technology and operational procedures. The effort also will add to the data we need to eventually permit routine UAS operations in the NAS.” The FAA’s press release asking for public input on UAS test-site selection makes no mention of civil liberties. When Gregor was asked via email for comment on whether test sites would rule out urban areas or other areas of population density, he did not respond. 
The American Civil Liberties Union is protesting the possibility of such zones, stating, “Unmanned aircraft carrying cameras raise the prospect of a significant new avenue for the surveillance of American life.”

According to reports, 63 drone sites have already been authorized across the country.

The Obama administration is considering resettling thousands of refugees who left Syria during the country’s ongoing civil war to multiple towns and cities across the United States, the L.A. Times reports.

A resettlement plan under discussion in Washington and other capitals is aimed at relieving pressure on Middle Eastern countries straining to support 1.6 million refugees, as well as assisting hard-hit Syrian families.
The State Department is “ready to consider the idea,” an official from the department said, if the administration receives a formal request from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which is the usual procedure.
The United States usually accepts about half the refugees that the U.N. agency proposes for resettlement. California has historically taken the largest share, but Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia are also popular destinations.

U.N. refugee officials, along with diplomats and non-governmental relief groups, are scheduled to meet in Geneva this week to discuss potential resettlement plans. Germany has already agreed to take 5,000 refugees. 
“It was probably inevitable that in this crisis, with these overwhelming numbers, governments would start moving in this direction,” Lavinia Limon, chief executive officer of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a Virginia-based advocacy and service group, told the L.A. Times. Limon added, “But there will be resistance.”


Congress is unlikely to warm up to the idea of agreeing to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees into the U.S. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who are currently pushing immigration reform bills, particularly aimed at Latinos who are in the country illegally, will need to explain why they may favor or oppose resettling thousands of Syrian refugees. 

It should be noted that Congress resisted accepting Iraqi refugees in 2003 following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Between 1983 and 2009, the U.S. resettled a total of 76,205 Iraqis. Meanwhile, seventy percent of total refugees in the U.S. were on food stamps in 2009. Within that number, 95 percent of Iraqi refugees were food stamp recipients. Additionally, the report shows an unemployment rate of 46 percent in 2009 among Iraqi refugees. A total of 219 Syrian refugees were resettled in the U.S. between 1983 and 2009.
More importantly, President Obama’s administration supports Syrians who are attempting to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad, but the emergence of Islamic extremist groups with ties to al Qaeda among the Syrian opposition presents a serious security concern. The L.A. Times alludes to the potential danger with such a resettlement: 

Homeland security officials require careful vetting of refugees, with multiple interviews and background checks before they are allowed to enter the country. Under normal circumstances, the screening process can take a year or longer.
U.S. officials are likely to be extra careful with Syrian refugees. As Islamic militants take a more prominent role in the rebel forces, officials worry about fighters with Al Qaeda ties trying to enter the country. Two resettled Iraqis were convicted of trying to send arms to Al Qaeda from their home in Bowling Green, Ky.

New National Security Advisor Susan Rice and President Obama’s nominee for U.N. ambassador Samantha Power are both refugee advocates and will likely push for the resettlement.

Pro-amnesty activists trying to co-opt the civil rights messages of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to push immigration reform through Congress seem to be directly contradicting the wishes of the late Dr. King and his wife, Coretta Scott King. Mrs. King carried on her husband’s civil rights activism after he was assassinated.
In a 1991 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Coretta Scott King and other black community leaders argued that illegal immigration would have a devastating impact on the black community. At the time, Hatch was working his U.S. Senate position to undo some enforcement measures laid out in Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty agreement, attempting to weaken interior enforcement and sanctions against employers who hired illegal aliens.  
We, the undersigned members of the Black Leadership Forum, write to urge you to postpone introduction of your employer sanctions repeal legislation until we have had an opportunity to report to you what we believe to be the devastating impact the repeal would have on the economic condition of un- and semi-skilled workers–a disproportionate number of whom are African-American and Hispanic; and until we have had the opportunity to propose to you and to our Hispanic brothers and sisters, what we believe could be a number of effective means of eliminating the discrimination occasioned by employer sanctions, without losing the protection sanctions provide for U.S. workers, especially minority workers.
While the members of the Black Leadership Forum wrote they had “divergent views” at the time on the employer sanctions regarding illegal immigration, they wrote they were “united in three respects.”


First, they wrote they were united in being “fully committed to the elimination of the root causes of national origin discrimination under the Immigration Reform & Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) [Reagan’s amnesty], as well as discriminatory impact.”
Second, they said they stood together in their belief that “there are a number of effective ways to remedy discrimination resulting from IRCA, without tampering with employer sanctions. Some measures we support are contained in the Report and Recommendations of the Taskforce on IRCA-Related Discimination and in the 1990 GAO Report on Immigration Reform: Employer Sanctions and Question of Discrimination.”
Third, the writers said they were unanimous in their request for a discussion with Hatch and other members of Congress on “the importance of employer sanctions to the economic security of African Americans and Hispanic workers.”

The black leaders wrote that they feared lack of interior immigration enforcement would lead to future illegal immigration, and the hiring of those illegal immigrants into jobs that could be occupied by black and Hispanic American citizens.
“We are concerned, Senator Hatch, that your proposed remedy to the employer sanctions-based discrimination, namely, the elimination of employer sanctions, will cause another problem–the revival of the pre-1986 discrimination against black and brown U.S. and documented workers, in favor of cheap labor–the undocumented workers,” they wrote. “This would undoubtedly exacerbate an already severe economic crisis in communities where there are large numbers of new immigrants.”
Coretta Scott King and the other black leaders added that they were “concerned that some who support the repeal of employer sanctions are using ‘discrimination’ as a guise for their desire to abuse undocumented workers and to introduce cheap labor into the U.S. workforce.”
America does not have a labor shortage. With roughly 7 million people unemployed, and double that number discouraged from seeking work, the removal of employer sanctions threatens to add additional U.S. workers to the rolls and drive down wages. Moreover, the repeal of employer sanctions will inevitably add to our social problems and place an unfair burden on the poor in the cities in which most new immigrants cluster–cities which are already suffering housing shortages and insufficient human needs services.
The black leaders then called for education reform to train American workers for jobs, rather than immigration reform to bring in foreigners to fill those jobs while American workers suffered. “Senator Hatch, we believe that what this country needs is not to prematurely scrap employer sanctions, but rather, we need education and training programs designed to prepare the unemployed, especially African Americans, Hispanics, and others at great risk, to meet the market demands of tomorrow,” they wrote. 
The authors added that while “not a panacea for the nation’s illegal immigration problems, employer sanctions are one necessary means of stopping the exploitation of vulnerable workers and the undercutting of American jobs and living standards.”

Congrats to Sen. Rand Paul for highlighting an important issue by using his prerogative as a U.S. senator to launch a good, old-fashioned filibuster on John Brennan’s nomination for CIA director. 
As I’ve written previously, it seemed earlier that he might be off on a couple of points of constitutional law. In the rarest of circumstances, a President has power, under Article II of the Constitution, to launch a military strike on American soil–but only if that American citizen has taken up arms against his country and poses an imminent threat to American lives. He must be, legally, a military target. And it must be a situation so urgent–a Jack Bauer-type scene from 24–that there isn’t even time for federal agents to get into place to capture the terrorist. 
But his overall point is correct: We are witnessing repeated power grabs by an Imperial President. And he is correct that, when non-combatants are involved (American citizens who may sympathize with terrorists but are not involved in actual or imminent attacks on our fellow citizens or homeland) the Bill of Rights applies with full force, and no President can step outside the court system under those circumstances. 


But it’s different where combatants are concerned. A man who takes up arms against this country–not as a criminal but as a warrior–becomes a military target if, and only if, he is actually engaged in operations against America. 
Last night, Paul made follow-up comments suggesting that, if the U.S. citizen in question actually posed an imminent threat to American lives, a President could take whatever actions were necessary to stop him. If so, we’re all on the same side of this debate. 
It also must be noted that it’s hard to conceive of how such an imminent threat could happen on American soil. It happens in James Bond movies, but unless the traitor has a remote-controlled guided missile, he must approach some populated area before he can cause harm. If he’s close enough to set off a bomb, he’s probably close enough for police and federal agents to intercept him. 

But enough people are supporting Rand Paul that it’s important to pick out a couple points on the margins. Most of what Paul is saying is right, but it’s worth noting where he’s saying something that many of his supporters are not, or saying something that’s wrong. 
First, Paul acknowledged that the military can act in a war zone, and that we’re in war zones overseas. Some of Paul’s supporters are holding onto the idea that there has not been a legal war since World War II, and that both wars in the past quarter-century (in Iraq and Afghanistan) are unconstitutional. 
Evidently, Paul disagrees (and rightly so), since a war zone only exists in a war. Not only that, but Paul sponsored legislation to de-authorize the war overseas. To end a war means that there is one currently underway, and to attempt to rescind Congress’ authorization for war means that Congress had previously authorized war, pursuant to the Declare War Clause of the Constitution. 
Second, Paul said today, “I personally don’t think it would be very hard to try someone for treason.” Actually, it is extremely hard to convict someone of treason. The Constitution requires two eyewitness to the treasonous act. If you have an American-born terrorist in a foreign land, like Anwar Al-Awlaki who was hiding in Yemen and launching terrorist attacks, we could go for many years and never have eyewitnesses. 
Sometimes traitors cannot be successfully convicted of treason and, ironically, it’s for a reason Rand Paul supports. It’s so no President could even try to get his political opponents convicted of treason as a trumped up charge. You must have people who actually saw the traitor take up arms against this country or directly aid those who did. 

Third, Paul also referenced people who “denounced their citizenship” still deserving all the constitutional protections. Although many rights extend to all persons, whether citizens or foreigners, the United States can deal with enemies who are not citizens in a much deadlier fashion than citizens. 
If someone has denounced their citizenship, then they are no longer American. It’s unclear from his comments whether Paul realizes that, or perhaps merely mispoke. It’s likewise unclear whether he recognizes the distinction between military operations and law enforcement, and between domestic and foreign operations. We’ll probably learn those things in the coming days. 

But one of his points is so true it bears repeating: How do we end this war? Is this perpetual war, covering the entire globe? The Constitution gives Presidents broad powers to win a war. The idea of Presidents permanently claiming this power against an undefined enemy and then exerting those powers on our home soil is a profoundly disturbing thought — one that can endanger liberty itself for all Americans. 
I’m not sure any of us know the perfect way out of that situation, though I’m sure we’re going to debate our options. 
And that’s because Rand Paul was willing to actually follow through with a filibuster, and because many other senators committed to the Constitution–including other young and recent additions to the Senate, like Mike Lee and Ted Cruz–are backing that play as well. 

So the Senate might have moved a step back in the direction of deserving the title of the world’s greatest deliberative body.

Senate Budget Committee ranking member Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) told Boston’s conservative radio host Howie Carr on Wednesday that the political momentum is starting to turn against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.
When Carr asked the senator if this process behind the push for this bill is the “same thing as Obamacare” where “we have to pass it so we can read it,” Sessions replied: “Absolutely, it really is.”
“That is exactly what it is,” Sessions said. “They’re selling the sizzle. They’re selling the smell. And it’s a shoe leather instead of a steak.”


Carr said that though everyone can agree that the immigration system is “broken,” Americans should not support the Gang of Eight bill because it would make the system “worse.” Instead, Carr argued people should support a yet-to-be-introduced solution that actually solves the problems at hand and this issue does not need to be an all-or-nothing deal with the Gang of Eight bill.
“That is exactly correct,” Sessions responded. “And Professor [George] Borjas at Harvard, the leading expert on immigration and labor, has made so clear in his work that basically what he concludes is any benefit to this economy is at the expense of lower income workers’ salaries going down.”
When Carr asked if Gang of Eight supporters had the votes to pass the bill in the House or Senate, Sessions said that they are claiming they have it in the Senate. “But I think the tide is beginning to turn,” Sessions said. “A lot of people, like myself, I thought the bill was better than it is based on what I hear the proponents say. But as we examine it, we realize that this is going to be a disaster. It’s going to be a disaster for enforcement, it’s going to be a disaster for our budget, it’s going to be a disaster for the wages of American workers, it’s going to add to our financial deficit, Social Security and Medicare are going to be impacted over the long term by trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities and these numbers are not going to be disputed if we go forward.”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a Gang of Eight member, recently said the bill could not pass the House as is, a sign it is in serious trouble. On Sean Hannity’s radio program on Wednesday, Rubio said the bill “quite frankly, may struggle to pass the Senate” because it does not effectively enforce border security as originally promised.
On the recently discovered loopholes in the Gang of Eight bill that would allow illegal immigrants access to welfare benefits for illegal immigrants, Sessions said “of the 11 million people here today illegally, over half do not have a high school diploma. And statistics and careful analysis shows a huge percentage will qualify for all kinds of these government programs. We’ve also discovered, Howie, that the people that are coming legally, about two-tenths of one percent, virtually nobody, is being rejected based on the requirement that you should not be a public charge. In other words, we’re not even enforcing that requirement and it’s certainly not going to be enforced with regard to those that will be given amnesty.”
“Any smart nation would say ‘we want immigrants, but if you’re not able to take care of yourself, if you’re going to come in and be dependent on welfare, you don’t get admitted,'” Sessions added.
The welfare loopholes allowing illegal immigrants access to public benefits is a major stumbling block for the Gang of Eight.
Rubio is even now joining his Gang of Eight colleague Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in acknowledging that their bill contains a massive loophole that will allow illegal immigrants access to state and local benefits. “I think what he’s talking about is state and local benefits, and I would just say that yeah, if a city or a county or a state legislature decides to give benefits to illegal immigrants or someone who was previously illegally in the country, you know, they have a constitutional right to do that,” Rubio told Hannity on Wednesday in response to Sessions’ criticisms. “I would disagree with that position, and people should take it up with their state legislator or their governor or their county commissioner or what have you.”

On Friday morning, President Barack Obama defended his administration’s massive telephone records surveillance programs by explaining that “every member of Congress has been briefed on this program.”

There’s only one problem: both Republican and Democrat Congresspeople say that isn’t true. On Friday afternoon, the press office for Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), one of the authors of the Patriot Act, tweeted, “Obama’s claim that ‘every Member of Congress’ was briefed is FALSE.”


It wasn’t just Sensenbrenner. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said that only certain members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees had been told about the program, and he only knew about it because he received “special permission” to be briefed after hearing about it through the grapevine. “I knew about the program,” he said on MSNBC, “because I specifically sought it out. It’s not something that’s briefed outside the Intelligence Committee.” Merkley added that the administration had ignored the law. “Clearly the administration has not followed what an ordinary person would consider to be the standard of the law here,” he said. 

Merkely summed up: “when the president says all members of Congress were briefed … well, I think a very small number of Senators in Congress had full details on these programs.”
Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) said he only knew about the program after asking for a briefing under “classified circumstances.” The “average member,” he said, had no access to this information. “They don’t receive this kind of briefing.”
Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said they had not been briefed on the phone surveillance program, either. “Not quite!” Rep. Billy Long (R-LA) tweeted after hearing about Obama’s claim.
Obama’s claim was not a slip of the tongue. On Friday, Obama’s White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, “In December of 2009 and in February of 2011, the Department of Justice and the intelligence community provided a document to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to be made available to all members of the House and Senate, describing the classified uses of Section 215 in detail.”

On Monday, Breitbart News editor-at-large Ben Shapiro, in conjunction with the David Horowitz Freedom Center, launched TruthRevolt.org, dedicated to destroying the media where they stand. “The goal of TruthRevolt is simple: unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public, and devastate their funding bases,” TruthRevolt.org states.
Shapiro says that TruthRevolt.org is launching by targeting Al Sharpton of MSNBC’s PoliticsNation. Their petition, which will be sent to stockholders and board members of Sharpton’s advertisers, states:


Al Sharpton is one of the greatest race hoaxers and divisive demagogues of the last half-century….Now it’s time to let his advertisers know that we won’t stand for our purchases backing his propaganda. TruthRevolt is leading the fight to inform Sharpton’s financial backers just who Sharpton is – and what the consequences will be for continuing to support his race-baiting.

TruthRevolt.org has launched a Twitter campaign to tweet @RitzCrackers with hashtag #SharptonsCrackers.
The Daily Beast reports:
The first Sharpton sponsor the group is targeting is Ritz Crackers, owned by Chicago-based Mondelez International. Shapiro said Truth Revolt chose Mondelez because it bills itself as a “family-friendly company” and because it was one of the few advertisers to respond to the group’s inquiries about why it supports the Sharpton show. 
As part of its response, Mondelez International said in a statement to Truth Revolt: “At Mondelez International we demonstrate our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship by participating in programs that best serve a wide range of local communities and their interests and needs. We extend our responsibility to the sponsorship of tasteful, believable television programming and we avoid sponsorship of programs that would be unacceptable in terms of generally accepted social or community standards.”
Shapiro says, “If anyone believes that Al Sharpton is tasteful and believable, they are delusional. The American people must wake Sharpton’s advertisers to their delusions. This is war – and for the left, the shock troops are those in the media who live off of advertiser and donor dollars. We must not be afraid to go after their funding sources. And we will.”

It only took five years for the American media to get tired of President Obama’s spoon-fed propaganda — well, at least one aspect of it. Earlier this month, 38 news organizations, including the Associated Press, ABC News, The Washington Post, and Reuters demanded more photojournalist access to the president. The White House responded with what one reporter described as a middle finger. Now some news organizations are responding by formalizing policies not to publish White House-distributed photographs. 
Last week the USA Today announced that it will not use “handout photos originating from the White House Press Office, except in very extraordinary circumstances.” The next day McClatchy joined the conditional boycott:


“The editors of McClatchy newspapers have agreed not to publish photography issued by the White House,” McClatchy Vice President for News/Washington Editor Anders Gyllenhaal told staffers in an email Tuesday night. The policy is not “a significant departure from current practices,” he says.
Both McClatchy and USA Today claim that these were their policies anyway, which makes one wonder what the point is. 
For those of us outside the DC-Manhattan bubble, it is really quite incredible to watch the elite media crybaby in this way. Our media has extraordinary power, when they choose to use it. The problem is that, when it comes to this president, they rarely choose to use it. 

No one respects their sycophants, which is why this White House is so comfortable ignoring, dismissing, and even ridiculing the mainstream media. 
This whole brouhaha surrounding photojournalist access is a perfect example. Nothing changes and what happens? The White House receives a strongly worded internal policy affirmation. 
If the media want some respect from this White House, they need to start doing something as simple as their jobs. But the White House knows that no matter how shabbily they treat the media, the media will still carry their water. For example, the ObamaCare cover ups continue to this day. Sure, the media is covering the smoking guns as they become too obvious to ignore, but they still refuse to warn the public that millions more insurance cancellations are coming. 
The media’s laughable and humiliating impotence will continue until they man up and stop running point for Obama’s agenda. 
Personally, I don’t believe the media’s protests about a lack of photojournalist access have anything to do with journalistic integrity. I think the media’s upset because they can’t get close to their sun king.

Yet another Tea Party group has come out publicly against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill, as TheTeaParty.net has announced its opposition to the legislation and published online an alternative plan for immigration reform.
“The granting of citizenship is the most solemn honor this country can confer,” TheTeaParty.Net founder Todd Cefaratti said in a statement obtained by Breitbart News. “It is not something that ought to be used to score political points or to win the next election.” 
“Before the American people extend this gift they must be assured that verifiable border security has preeminent priority. The Senate bill currently does not have it,” he explained. “Americans will not be bullied, intimidated and steamrolled into accepting this legislation.” 


“We have proposed a conservative alternative at secureamericanow.us for which we will be rallying Congressional support in the coming days.”
The group said in its release it will be briefing members of Congress on the alternative immigration reform plan in the coming days and weeks.
TheTeaParty.Net’s chief strategist Niger Innis added that he thinks the “Senate amnesty bill is a non-starter.”

“But instead of just saying we’re against something, we have put forward eight principles that we believe are the necessary pillars of an America First Immigration alternative,” Innis said. “Over the coming days we will be meeting with conservative Senate and House members about getting them to support the plan.” 
“We will not be bullied by a Harry Reid-Chuck Schumer agenda that undermines the Constitution by ramming through a bill that the American people do not support,” Innis promised. “The only way to stop a bully is to confront them.”
Many other Tea Party organizations, like Tea Party Patriots, have already announced their opposition to the Gang of Eight bill. More than 150 of them banded together in recent months to sign a letter sent to members of Congress announcing their ardent opposition to the legislation. 
TheTeaParty.net did not sign that letter at the time and was fighting suggestions from the office of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) that it may support the legislation.
Politico previously erroneously claimed that TheTeaParty.net was among groups that had become an “ally” of the Gang of Eight. Politico later quietly edited the story after Breitbart News discovered the groups it claimed supported the bill had not expressed support for the legislation. Rather, the groups had me with Rubio’s team to get his take on the bill before they made a decision. 
“We are going to hear him out, rather than rely on the liberal media interpretation of his legislation,” Innis told Breitbart News at the time. “Reports that we have agreed to support the Gang of Eight bill are utter make-believe.”

Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, now the president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Tuesday that his former colleagues’ largely secret negotiations about immigration reform are troubling. A bipartisan group, dubbed the “Gang of Eight,” has been spearheading immigration reform efforts for months, and no legislative text has been presented to date. When it is presented, Democratic leadership in the Senate and Republican leadership in the House are expected to try to rush the bill through to passage. 
In remarks to the Heritage Foundation’s Blogger’s Briefing on Tuesday, DeMint expressed concern over the behind-closed-doors formulation of legislation, which he knows from experience is actually being written by special interests and staffers. “And the members who are involved with this haven’t seen it or read it. They’re being told what’s going to be in it,” he said.  
“What we believe at Heritage is that this should be an open and transparent process, and it should be step-by-step so Americans can be brought along with what needs to be changed,” DeMint added. “In 1986 we had three million unlawful folks in our country, promises were made on the floor of the House and Senate that if we gave an amnesty this would never happen again. We would secure our borders, we would fix our system.” Neither of these promises were kept.


The Heritage Foundation is currently drafting a peer-reviewed research analysis aimed at discovering the true cost of immigration reform to taxpayers. Details of the Heritage analysis, being conducted by Robert Rector, have not been made public yet. But the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff estimates immigration reform will cost taxpayers trillions more in entitlement and welfare spending. “What Heritage is doing right now and we’re working with some of best guys in the business, scholars like Robert Rector who developed the groundbreaking welfare reform research and policy work and he developed the cost that a lot of us used back in 2007 that helped us realize that this was not free,” DeMint said, referring to Rector’s report “The Fiscal Cost of Low-Skill Immigrants to the U.S. Taxpayer.”

The former Senator drew a distinction between the average taxpayer and representatives of labor and business who are involved in drafting the legislation. “Amnesty is not a free proposition to taxpayers. So we’re going to quantify that cost. I can guarantee you Heritage will be the only organization in the country that is looking at the true cost of a blanket amnesty proposal.”
Americans for Tax Report and the Cato Institute have already attacked Heritage and Rector, claiming that Rector’s 2007 study was flawed. When asked about the preemptive strike, DeMint replied: “Criticism of a report they hadn’t seen yet? Sounds like Washington.”

            QUESTION: Secretary Kerry was speaking with reporters in Brussels, and he said Tamerlan went to Chechnya and, quote, “learned something” and, quote, “came back with a willingness to kill people.” What did he mean when he said that, and what did he mean he learned when he was in Chechnya?MR. VENTRELL: Well, again, first of all, as I’ve said repeatedly here, there’s an ongoing FBI investigation. The Secretary was simply expressing broad concern about radicalism and not necessarily offering any more specific information about this case. But the context of how that came up was really – radicalism broadly, I understand, is how the question came up. But this isn’t about any new information or conclusion about law enforcement details of this case.QUESTION: Let me just – because I want to be clear on this point. From reading the transcript – no U.S. press were present, so we are reading the transcript – it seems that Kerry is suggesting that Tamerlan was radicalized during his time in Russia.

I’m clarifying his remarks and saying that he was simply expressing broad concern about radicalism. This isn’t about new details about the ongoing investigation.QUESTION: So when he learned something, it was about radicalism, but he learned about radicalism; he wasn’t radicalized? That doesn’t make too much sense to me.MR. VENTRELL: Again, my understanding of this informal press availability is that there was a question broadly about terrorism and foreign fighters, and it was in that context that he was saying that people can be radicalized by extremism. But this isn’t about drawing any conclusions about the specific law enforcement investigation.QUESTION: So what did he learn? He learned something.MR. VENTRELL: Again, we’re not getting into any more details about the —QUESTION: Right. But you put out a statement and the clarification doesn’t clarify anything. So did he learn – was he radicalized in Russia?MR. VENTRELL: Again, I’m not in a position to say one way or another on that. I really refer you to the law enforcement authorities investigating this.

At the beginning of the year, President Barack Obama’s new 501(c)4 political nonprofit, Organizing For Action, was launched with all the usual bells and whistles. But the tech wizards at OFA forgot one important rule in today’s Internet world: Register all the iterations of your website address before someone else does. 
Now Obama’s team is filing complaints against the folks smart enough to get the addresses before he did.


As Obama’s OFA made its debut, no one in his purportedly Internet-savvy campaign had obtained the corresponding .com, .net, .org or .us sites, nor did OFA register other names that are close to its official one, as is the sensible practice. In the case of the .net address, a fellow named Derek Bovard had already registered the .net address by the time Obama’s team took notice.
Bovard has routed his new site to the homepage of the National Rifle Association.
So, whenever anyone goes to www.organizingforaction.net they end up seeing the homepage of the NRA.

Naturally, Obama and his fellow community organizers were furious. So furious, in fact, that they have replied by filing complaints against Bovard–and, apparently, a variety of other people who had registered domain names that OFA now wants. 
Obama’s group filed the complaints with the authority that governs website domain addresses, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The complaints were filed under Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) rules. Obama’s case number is 1483257 and was filed on Feb 6. UDRP cases are usually decided within one to two months after first filing.
Bovard told Breitbart that he feels he has a solid case that he owns the .net address fair, square, and legally.
“We have been granted ‘Service Mark’ #85838531 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the website as ‘Providing an on-line website featuring information on the United States Constitution and Conservative values’ and we were also the first to use it in ‘commerce.’ So I don’t believe they have any valid legal ground to stand on in regards to this website name. Before purchasing this site I had checked TESS (Trademark Electronic Search System) for any existing Trademarks or Service Marks and found none. I also searched for any existing companies called Organizing for Action and found none. So I bought it, legally.”
Bovard said he intends to use the site address to provide “information on the United States Constitution and Conservative values.”
“This site is going to be used strictly to discuss political views and ideas based on Conservative Values, the US Constitution, the Bill of Rights and Freedom of Speech in the USA which seems to be overlooked quite often. My partner and I are firm believers in not only the First and Second Amendment Rights, but in ALL Rights granted to us by our country, my country.”
Bovard also disputed several reports that he offered the address for sale to team Obama.
“I also want to make it perfectly clear that I have no intentions of selling this website name to Obama’s group nor did I purchase it with the intent of selling it to them or anyone else. It’s never been for sale, I’ve never solicited it for sale. I have indicated a personal opinion about it’s worth but that’s it.”
“We have taken what little action we could to contribute to the fight against anyone who attempts to defy or go against the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the rights contained within them. We are sickened by the mockery being made of our country and our government and then advertising this mess to our fellow citizens and the rest of the world,” Bovard said in an email.

Joseph Curl noted in his Sunday column in the Washington Times that many ordinary Americans around the country were upset with the extravagant lifestyles President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and their families are living while most Americans suffer from a still-disastrous economy.
“President Obama had another tough week in a second term filled with bad news and blunders — and he’s only 10 weeks in,” Curl wrote. “While the White House suddenly decided to drop its budget Friday in an effort to control the news, there was no covering up the disastrous jobless numbers: 90 million Americans out of the workforce, the highest level since 1979; another 663,000 joining the ranks of the long-term unemployed; a measly 88,000 jobs ‘created.'”
Curl points out though that, while those economic numbers are catastrophic for this administration, “what seems stuck in the craw of a lot of you readers out there” was his column from the week before “on the Obamas’ 1 percent lifestyle — the endless ski and beach vacations for the couple and their daughters, Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s nights in London and Paris that cost you more than $1 million, even the president’s 118th round of golf while in office.”


Most mainstream media outlets completely ignored the report, first broken by Breitbart News, that first daughters Sasha and Malia were vacationing in the Bahamas at the luxurious Atlantis resort for Spring Break. The story starkly exemplified that President Obama decided Secret Service should be used for that vacation and not for ordinary kids’ tours of the White House. To top matters off, for what Curl calls the Obama family’s “royal lifestyle,” Sasha and Malia sprung from the Bahamas to ritzy Sun Valley, Idaho mid-Spring Break week to get in some skiing before heading back to school.

Curl quoted many of his readers, who wrote to him expressing outrage at the way the first family handles themselves–and taxpayer resources–while most other Americans continue hurting economically.
Curl said, too, that Obama’s decision this past week “to forgo 5 percent of his salary” is not any “coincidence.”

On Sept. 12, religious-liberty leaders met with Pentagon officials to discuss the rapidly-escalating incidents of religious-liberty violations in the military under the Obama administration.  
On Apr. 28, Breitbart News broke the story of Pentagon brass meeting with anti-Christian activist Mikey Weinstein to discuss religious-liberty policies. Quoting Weinstein in his own printed words, this activist has a record of calling observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek impose “theocratic terror” on America, and that evangelizing (sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ) in the military is an act of “sedition and treason” against this country, making those who do it “enemies of the Constitution.” He says those who do so should be court-martialed (criminally prosecuted). 
As this story developed, the Obama-Hagel Pentagon defended its policy, and changed its story several times, as it was revealed that these meetings with Weinstein had been going on for years. In the following months there were additional incidents, such as removing Christian patriotic artwork at a military base, censoring a Christian chaplain, and a Christian service member reportedly being relieved of duty by his lesbian commander because he refused her order to say that it is wrong not to support gay marriage. 


Now leaders from Restore Military Religious Freedom–a coalition to protect service members of faith–met with Pentagon officials. Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin (ret.) of the Family Research Council, Col. Ron Crews (ret.) of the Chaplains Alliance for Religious Liberty, Kellie Fiedorek of the Alliance Defending Freedom, and nationally-known Christian talk radio host Sandy Rios took with them two petitions calling on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to protect religious liberty. One was a general petition with 170,000 signatures, and the other–with 50,000 signatures–was sparked by the last incident mentioned above, where Air Force Senior Master Sergeant Phillip Monk was relieved of duty by Maj. Elisa Valenzuela, allegedly because of Monk’s Christian beliefs on marriage. Monk now faces possible court martial. 

These Christian leaders met with Lt. Gen. Richard C. Harding, the three-star judge advocate general of the Air Force (the top lawyer in that branch of the military), and Maj. Gen. Howard D. Stendahl, the two-star Air Force chief of chaplains. 
Gen. Boykin said after the meeting:

The meeting included a productive discussion on the issue of religious freedom in the military as a whole and not just the U.S. Air Force. After delivering the petitions, we explained our concerns regarding the trend towards infringements on the constitutional liberties of service members in all uniformed services. 
We appreciate their offer to review decisions that do not reflect Air Force policy made by commanders at various bases.  At their request, we will report future events and concerns directly to Air Force leadership.  After reviewing a series of troubling incidents involving chaplains, the coalition members were assured in the meeting that chaplains would not be forced to do anything that violates the tenets of their faith.   
We also requested that the Department of Defense and the Air Force issue a definitive statement regarding the ability of service members to share their faith publicly.  Previous statements on the subject have been confusing and contradictory. 
Additionally, we asked that the Department of Defense move quickly to implement the religious freedom protections enacted in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Given new incidents of military personnel facing career reprisals for their religious beliefs, it is vital that regulations preventing discrimination be issued by the Secretary of Defense as demanded by law. We intend to remain in contact with the Air Force to ensure that the law’s implementation is consistent with the intent of Congress.

Congress is working on new statutory language to protect such religious speech in the military, which has passed the House and is pending in the Senate. President Obama threatens to veto this legislation.

On Wednesday, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) joined nearly two thousand trade unionists, open communists, socialists, anarchists and illegal aliens at Chicago’s May Day march and rally. 
Two large rally demonstrations that began at Union Park and Chicago’s Haymarket Riot monument converged into a giant march that shut down traffic for miles, and ended at Federal Plaza where they were joined by Senator Durbin.


Durbin made remarks to the red, yellow and black flag waving crowd about “immigration reform.” Opening with “My fellow immigrants,” Durbin told the crowd “this is a once in a lifetime chance” to get “immigration reform.”

Following his speech, I spoke to the senator about his participation:

(May Day is apparently also Law Day in America, but after covering the last three May Day marches in Chicago, I have never heard about Law Day, at any of the marches or elsewhere.) 
Durbin then mounted a rather bizarre defense of his participation in the rally–on free speech grounds:

Rebelpundit: There is a large contingent of Communist Party USA, anarchists, international socialist groups here today that you just spoke to…
Durbin: How do you know that?
Rebelpundit: Because I’ve filmed them all day, and you just spoke to them, so I’d like to ask about your participation, why you decided to come out today?
Durbin: Well let me just say something, because [pause] I believe in the Constitution. Do you believe in it?
Rebelpundit: Because you believe in the Constitution you decided to come out to a rally full of communists and socialists?
Durbin: And you know why?
Rebelpundit: Why?
Durbin: Because we have freedom of speech in America, and that’s why you can record this and not be arrested.
RebelPundit: You think I should be arrested?
Durbin: No, not at all, you have a right to your constitutional rights, and I do, too.

Of course, Durbin could go to a Nazi or KKK rally, too–but does that mean, as a United States Senator, he should?

Sen. John McCain spent the weekend negotiating with Majority Leader Harry Reid on a deal to avert Reid’s threatened use of the “nuclear option” to change Senate rules to eliminate filibusters on Presidential nominations. Through his efforts, McCain was able to secure a complete GOP capitulation on 7 pending nominations. Reid secured all the benefits of exercising the “nuclear option” without the political cost of actually using it.  
Under the McCain deal, the GOP will provide enough votes to secure the 60 votes needed for cloture and proceed to final consideration of the 7 nominees. In exchange, Reid agreed to replace two current union attorney nominees with two alternative union attorney nominees. McCain’s swift surrender ensures that the “nuclear option” is a permanent fixture of the nomination process.
GOP objections to many of the pending nominations were not minor. The first nomination to be approved under the McCain deal was Richard Cordray to be the first Director of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was enacted under the Dodd-Frank legislation and holds sweeping powers over all aspects of the financial and credit sector. 


When Cordray was first nominated two years ago, McCain and all but 2 GOP Senators signed a letter vowing to block any nomination unless reforms were made to the agency. A major concern was that Congress was specifically prohibited from exercising any oversight over the Agency’s budget. The promise to block that nomination wasn’t prompted by concerns about a specific nominee, but a fundamental political principle. McCain’s deal is further confirmation that principle are cheap in Washington. 

Theoretically, McCain’s surrender preserves the right of Republicans to filibuster future nominations. Practically speaking, however, that right has been permanently ceded. If the GOP is willing to fold when it has serious objections to pending nominations, it will easily surrender again in the future the next time Reid threatens the “nuclear option.” If the GOP isn’t willing to draw a line over flawed nominees like Cordray or Thomas Perez, it never will be. 
Reid believed that he could eliminate the filibuster for nominations with a simply majority vote. Democrat Sen. Carl Levin on Tuesday said he believed the change required 67 votes and stated he would vote against Reid’s rule change. It would have been better for the GOP to force Reid to vote on the change. Senators would have had to go on record whether they supported Reid or Levin’s interpretation of the rules. With a number of vulnerable Democrats up for reelection next year, a vote could have carried political consequences. 
McCain, however, helped the Democrats avoid a risky political vote. He also ensured that he is on Harry Reid’s speed-dial the next time the GOP raises objections to an Obama nomination.

“(Jenny) McCarthy’s views on vaccinations and autism aren’t just stupid, they are actually dangerous.” So says The Daily Beast in a hard-hitting analysis of the speculation that McCarthy, a former Playboy model, is set to replace Elisabeth Hasselbeck on ABC’s “The View.”
After wading through some gratuitous attacks on Hasselbeck for her conservative views, Tricia Romano then focuses squarely on McCarthy and her activism with regard to the scientifically dubious connections between autism and diet and vaccinations.  

Since 2007, McCarthy has been a vocal opponent of the chemicals in vaccinations,  credulously citing research (she’s neither a doctor nor a medical professional) and experiences with her autistic son as evidence. (It has also been reported that he may not even have autism, but Landau-Kleffner syndrome.)
She has promoted the idea that people are getting an outrageous number of vaccinations today compared with the 1970s or ’80s. According to the book, Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure, the amount has only doubled, from seven to 14, to include vaccinations for the flu, hepatitis, and chickenpox among others, in addition to the measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, and others that are standard.
McCarthy doesn’t let science and facts get in her way. She has written three books about the subject–Louder Than Words: A Mother’s Journey in Healing Autism, Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds, and Healing and Preventing Autism, which have all been New York Times bestsellers. She is the president of an autism organization, which is also averse to vaccination, called Generation Rescue.
When promoting one of her books, she told Oprah how she learned about autism: “The University of Google is where I got my degree from.”

McCarthy’s opinions on autism and suspected “causes” and “cures” have raised eyebrows in the past, including a legendary appearance on The Larry King Show in 2008.  “Give my son the measles! I’ll take that over autism any day,” she yelled at a pediatrician after calling America’s vaccination program “bulls**t.”


Many believe her stances on autism lead parents to have false hope for a “cure” rather than focusing parents on the path of accepting their child’s autism as a part of their unique personality, worthy of respect. They also say McCarthy’s pseudo-science distracts parents from seeking actual help in how to better communicate and interact with their autistic children. As Big Hollywood’s Dana Commandatore points out: 

Once again, we’ve learned that celebrities do not have the answers. Sure, they look good on camera and can deliver a line better than average folks, but they are missing out on something important in the case of autism. Parents don’t need pseudo science and anecdotes. They need real life experiences and tried and tested information. 

Others criticize the anti-vaccine rhetoric as being responsible for thousands of preventable illnesses and deaths. But, as the Daily Beast points out, McCarthy seems unfazed by the increase in diseases as a result of her efforts: 

To promote her book, she essentially suggested to Time magazine that it might be good for polio to reemerge so that people could ask for better, safer vaccines, passing the buck to the medical community, not the anti-vaccine community for the rise in previously suppressed diseases.
She told Time: “I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s s___. If you give us a safe vaccine, we’ll use it. It shouldn’t be polio versus autism.”

On Wednesday, the first female White House press secretary suggested that MSNBC should fire host Martin Bashir for suggesting that someone defecate and/or urinate in former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s mouth. 
Dee Dee Myers, who was Bill Clinton’s campaign spokeswoman and his first White House press secretary, said she could not imagine where “such thoughts even come from” and tweeted “#Gottago” while linking to an article in which MSNBC was mum about whether Bashir’s apology was enough. 

Honestly…where do such thoughts even come from? #Gottago. MSNBC not saying whether Martin Bashir apology is enough http://t.co/5ElIrTM1bn
— Dee Dee Myers (@deemyers) November 20, 2013
Myers, who has written a book about why women leaders should rule the world, spoke out after Breitbart News reported that feminist and women’s groups had been silent on Bashir’s remarks. Talk radio host Mark Levin suggested women’s groups were silent because Palin is not a left-wing politician. 


After Bashir apologized on his show on Monday for words that he admitted were “wholly inappropriate” and “offensive,” Breitbart News exclusively obtained a letter from Palin’s PAC, SarahPAC, that asked MSNBC President Phil Griffin and NBC News President Deborah Turness what action the network would take against Bashir for his “appalling” words. It also mentions that MSNBC has set a precedent of firing and disciplining other anchors for “offensive language.” 


“You fired Don Imus for offensive language in describing the Rutgers University Women’s Basketball team, you suspended Alec Baldwin, and yet nothing has happened to Mr. Bashir,” the letter reads. “Are we to assume then, that disciplinary procedures at your network take place based on the target of the remarks rather than the remarks themselves?”

The letter also mentions that MSNBC suspended Baldwin’s show for two weeks after he made anti-gay remarks on the streets of New York off the air, while “Mr. Bashir’s violent rhetoric” was displayed on the air. 
The letter concludes by saying, “Americans deserve to know that your network doesn’t condone violent and hateful rhetoric directed at anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or political persuasion.”

“You come in here, brandish your little book as if I don’t know what’s in there–” 
“My little book? That’s the Constitution of the United States. It’s our founding document, Piers.” 


“I know what’s in your Constitution.” 
“Do you really?” 
That was the climax of a heated debate between Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Ben Shapiro and CNN’s Piers Morgan on live television this evening–one in which Morgan came off much the worse for wear.

Shapiro began by pointing out that for weeks, Morgan had bullied guests who defend the right to bear arms by “standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook.” 
“How dare you,” said a rattled Morgan. 
“I have seen you do it repeatedly,” Shapiro replied. 
He challenged Morgan to explain whether he wanted to ban all guns, not just “assault rifles,” since the vast majority of gun deaths involve ordinary handguns. “Why don’t you care about banning the handguns in Chicago?” Shapiro asked him.
Morgan, who later stated that he supported Americans’ right “to defend themselves with a handgun or a pistol,” pointed out that the weapons used in recent sensational mass shootings had been “assault rifles,” and insisted that the debate was not one of “left and right,” because his position ought to be the consensus, as in Britain. Shapiro countered that the basis of the Second Amendment was not self-defense or hunting, but the ability to resist government tyranny–a point that Morgan attempted to mock, unsuccessfully.

Shapiro’s statement is worth quoting in full: 

Shapiro: I think the reason that it’s about left and right here is because fundamentally, the right believes that the basis for the Second amendment–and they believe in the Second Amendment–the basis for the Second Amendment is not really about self defense, and it’s not about hunting. It’s about resistance to government tyranny. That’s what the Founders said, and that’s what the right believes in this country.
Morgan: Which tyranny are you fearing, yourself? 
Shapiro: I fear the possibility of a tyranny rising in the country in the next fifty to a hundred years. Let me tell you something, Piers. The fact that my grandparents and great grandparents in Europe didn’t fear that is why they’re now ashes in Europe. So this kind of leftist revisionist history where there’s never any fear of democracy going usurpatious or tyrannical, is just that. It’s fictitious.


Subsequently, Morgan accused Shapiro of wanting to “do nothing” about mass shootings, to which Shapiro replied that his position was to improve background checks and screening for mental illness and criminal histories among potential gun owners and their households. Shapiro later pointed out the hypocrisy in attacking the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment without subjecting violent video games, the American Civil Liberties Union and the First Amendment to the same scrutiny.
Morgan then presented Shapiro with a letter co-signed by Ronald Reagan in 1994, urging support for the assault weapons ban (an ineffective policy, which lapsed after ten years). He challenged Shapiro to justify “why an American needs an assault weapon.”
Shapiro repeated his point on tyranny, to which Morgan said: “Do you know how absurd you sound?” 
In so doing, he proved Shapiro’s point: 

Here’s where you go into the bullying….For weeks now, you have been saying that anybody who disagrees with your position is absurd, idiotic, and doesn’t care about the dead kids in Sandy Hook. And then when I say that’s a bullying tactic, you turn around and say that I’m bullying you.

Later on the program, once Shapiro was safely off camera, Morgan admitted: “In an ideal world, I’d have all guns gone, as we have in Britain, but this is not my country and I respect the fact most Americans wouldn’t wear that kind of argument.” 
An epic win for Shapiro, and for our “little book.”

Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Pat Leahy (D-VT) is using the Republican National Committee (RNC) to bolster his attack on Republicans opposed to rushing through an unexamined comprehensive immigration reform package.
Leahy made the move in his letter berating Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions for joining all his Senate Judiciary Committee GOP colleagues except for the two who are members of the so-called “Gang of Eight” in calling for an open and transparent immigration reform process.
“I am encouraged by the recent recommendations in what is being called its ‘autopsy’ of the last election, in which the Republican National Committee wrote that your party ‘must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,'” Leahy wrote to Sessions.


The full quote from the RNC “autopsy” report reads: “We are not a policy committee, but among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.”

Now that the RNC, which admits it is not a vehicle from which policy should be drafted, has taken to advocating a specific policy proposal, such advocacy is being used by Senate Democrats to drive a wedge between Republican lawmakers.
“I hope that you and other Republican Senators on the Committee will do so [support immigration reform],” Leahy chided Sessions. “I am encouraged that after two resounding presidential defeats, some Republican politicians are concerned enough about the growing Hispanic voting population that they are abandoning their former demagoguery and coming to the table.”
“I welcome Republicans to this effort,” Leahy continued. “I am glad that Senator McCain is once again interested in supporting comprehensive immigration reform. I still worry that too many congressional Republicans continue to oppose a straightforward pathway to citizenship, but that is a discussion we need to have out in the open, in front of the American people.”

Scott Rasmussen, the prolific pollster, criticized the Washington Post’s characterization of Americans unhappy with both Republican and Democrat performances in government as “haters.” Rasmussen said, “Tens of millions of Americans disapprove of the way both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are doing their jobs. According to the hometown paper for America’s political class, this makes them ‘Haters.'”
In a recent poll conducted by the Washington Post, there are three teams in America: the Democrat team, the Republican team, and the Haters Team. Rasmussen says that “This wasn’t just a casual reference by a lazy journalist. Not only did the paper of the political elite produce tables and graphics with the ‘Haters’ label; they wrote an entire article about how ‘Haters Gonna Hate.'” Rasmussen added, “It truly boggles my mind to think that this is the label it intentionally and thoughtfully chose.” 


Rasmussen thinks there are much better labels for those who don’t feel an affinity for either of the first two teams, such as “the adults needed to supervise the behavior of Congress.” Rasmussen believes that many in Congress entered politics with good intentions but that they find themselves in a “corrupt and dysfunctional institution.” He maintains that, no matter what you call those that don’t approve of Republicans or Democrats, you need only to recognize the ineptitude of politicians of both parties to distance oneself from supporting them. 
In Rasmussen’s view, Congress can’t produce a budget, can’t produce a workable health care law, both parties prop up crony capitalism, and Republicans and Democrats alike supported the NSA’s domestic spying. But what disturbs Rasmussen more than Congress’ poor performance is that the Washington Post stigmatizes those who disagree with their elitist political class world view as “haters.” The Post is wrong, according to Rasmussen. “We don’t need to hate anybody to recognize that Congress is doing a lousy job,” he remarks. “Those of us who disapprove of both parties in Congress are simply waiting for Congress to do something worthy of our approval.”

The Obama administration will allow a massive rally for comprehensive immigration reform on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. on the National Mall, even though it is supposed to be closed due to the federal government shutdown.
Open-air spaces like the World War II Memorial have been barricaded since the federal government shut down last week, but an organizer for the rally told the Washington Examiner that the National Park Service will allow the rally and march.
As Breitbart News reported, immigration activists have called for volunteers to get themselves arrested at the rally in acts of civil disobedience.


The event will be a culmination of rallies across the country over the weekend in which immigration activists demonstrated in 41 states demanding amnesty. 

A variety of immigration activist organizations, along with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the AFL-CIO, are organizing the event, which they claim will attract 10,000 people.
Lawmakers in Congress like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R-CA) and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) are expected to be at the event. Members of the House are trying to pass immigration reform bills that will allow them to go to conference with the Senate, which passed its comprehensive immigration bill in June that provided a pathway to citizenship for all of the country’s illegal immigrants. 
The Congressional Budget Office determined that bill would reduce the wages of working class Americans while not solving the country’s illegal immigration problem. 
House Republicans have been reportedly working under the radar on immigration reform, and Pelosi has said Democrats are willing to do “whatever it takes” to get to conference with the Senate. House Republican leaders have also expressed support in moving immigration reform legislation forward. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is the chairwoman of the House Republican conference, told Univision’s Al Punto on Sunday that “there’s still time” for immigration reform and that it is a “priority” for Republicans.
“We must pass immigration reform,” McMorris Rodgers said. 
A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) indicated that immigration reform will be next on the House’s agenda after the shutdown and the debt ceiling debates are resolved.

The recent plunge in ratings, readership, revenue, and credibility doesn’t frighten the media — but the idea of diversity-of-thought sure does. With the  news breaking Monday that the Koch Brothers might be interested in purchasing the Tribune Co., the media campaign to stop that potential sale has already begun. 
Media writer Jim Romenesko is currently offering anonymity to Tribune Co. “journalists” willing to comment on the news. As expected, in-between a bunch of nonsense about  how important objectivity is in media, they’re obviously seething over the idea of working for the dreaded Brothers Koch:


To survive so much (and to have done some pretty damn amazing work in the process) it’s extremely disheartening to know serious bids are being entertained to sell to the Kochs. 
Murdoch, for all his flaws, is a newspaper man. The Kochs are not. I have no faith in their belief in the importance of a free and robust watchdog press. Frankly, such a press seems antithetical to their goals and harmful to their influence in the political process.
Another:

The news is a bit terrifying given the idea that the Koch bros. pitched “media” as the third prong of a strategy to push their political and social ideals onto a wider audience.
It is pretty obvious that this will be The Narrative the media-collective as a whole will start to spin (Politico’s Dylan Byers is already tweeting it out) in the hopes of quashing any potential sale. What we’re talking about is a campaign of peer pressure within the provincial media to pressure the Tribune Co. to reject the Kochs’ offer (if there is one). 
Naturally, this campaign will be disguised in the lofty ideal of “objective journalism,” which has been the media’s Big Lie for decades. But the real goal will be to bully one of their own into protecting the media’s ideological purity.
The most laughable concern is that of non-newspaper men purchasing newspapers. In today’s multi-national world, people without a background in media are going to end up as owners or part owners of media outlets. Furthermore, the Kochs probably own all kinds of  successful businesses they lack a personal background in. But they are billionaires because they have hired the right people to run them. 
This happens every day in business at this level. And shouldn’t “journalists” have at least a basic understanding of this reality?

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a member of the Senate’s Gang of Eight, told CNN on Wednesday that he thinks the House GOP’s plan to approach immigration reform through piecemeal legislation is acceptable since the bills will simply be combined in conference.
“We would much prefer a big comprehensive bill but any way that the House can get there is okay by us,” Schumer said. “I actually am optimistic that we will get this done. I’ve had a lot of discussions with members of both parties in the House. Things are moving in the right direction.”
Schumer said House Republicans now appear more open than ever to granting amnesty to illegal aliens, and are going to use the strategy of passing a large group of bills addressing specific immigration issues to get to a conference with the Senate bill. “My initial reaction was the House wasn’t going to take up any bill,” Schumer said. “That would have been very bad, no bill. Now they’re doing it in pieces.”


Schumer added that he thinks “a couple of their pieces are very similar to ours.”

Schumer is the latest amnesty proponent to admit publicly the end game strategy is to get to a conference with the Senate bill by having the House pass a group of bills. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has all but promised the same thing, as have House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI).
Schumer’s fellow Gang of Eight member, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), publicly admitted the same goal a few weeks ago when he pleaded with leftwing activists at the Center for American Progress to help get them to conference.
Ultimately, former Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) claimed in an op-ed on Wednesday that this is all part of the “secret Republican strategy to secure amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.”
“The names may have changed, but the tactics remain the same,” Hayworth wrote. “After decades of promises to address illegal immigration, we are once again hearing the same old nonsense from Republican politicians.” 
“Lawmakers vowing to act tough on border security while looking to secure amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants has become infuriatingly all-too-familiar,” he said.

The Supreme Court will take up the issue of the National Labor Relations Board (NRLB) appointments in the fall, but even the Union recognizes there is “no hope” for the Court to rule in favor of Obama’s unconstitutional appointments and transitively any actions the Board has taken with those appointments. “The Supreme Court won’t take that up until the fall and answer it until next year. There is no reason to believe — with this court — that recess appointments will be permitted,” [Communications Workers of America President Larry] Cohen said in a conference call.
A new microsite went live today to highlight the job-killing overreach into the private sector of the National Labor Relations Board. (NRLB) The NRLB is an anti-business, pro-union operation masquerading as a watchdog for “labor issues.”  The board is supposed to function fairly rather than as an advocate for union interests against private businesses.  In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. 


The NRLB caused quite a stir a few years ago, when they launched a job-killing complaint against Boeing as the company attempted to build a 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina. The Board asserted that opening a plant in non-union South Carolina was retaliation against union workers at their Washington state plant.  There was no regard for potential new jobs for South Carolina when the NRLB decided to insert itself into a private business’ decision. 

The NRLB has been in the news of late. Notably last week, Cablevision filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court to suspend actions against the company, as the board was continuing to function despite a court ruling declaring Obama’s appointments to the board unconstitutional.  
At this very moment, the NRLB is continuing to function despite the fact that two courts have ruled that members on the board were put there unconstitutionally by Obama.  There are no fewer than SIXTY lawsuits against the NRLB’s rulings with these unconstitutional appointments.

Look at this madness: article after article after article hitting Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes for agreeing with President Obama on the issue of his work ethic, or lack thereof. Last night, though, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer took the attacks a step further by taking Ailes completely out of context. This allowed 9/11 Truther and cop killer-defender Van Jones to claim Ailes had made a “racial charge” against Obama:
—



 
—
Van Jones being Van Jones is not news. 

But for Wolf Blitzer to take Ailes completely out of context and stand idly by as Jones dishonestly smears Ailes for making a “racial charge” only serves to further explain why this network is swirling the drain. In the age of the Internet, the media can no longer get away with this kind of stuff. Once the truth gets out, the damage to your brand’s credibility is forever. 
The background and the truth: 
Yesterday, Vanity Fair published an exclusive excerpt from an upcoming Ailes biography. Here’s the full context of the quote Blitzer wasn’t interested in sharing with his audience. I’ve bolded the portion not shared with CNN viewers:
‘Obama’s the one who never worked a day in his life. He never earned a penny that wasn’t public money. How many fund-raisers does he attend every week? How often does he play basketball and golf? I wish I had that kind of time. He’s lazy, but the media won’t report that.’ He noticed my arched eyebrows and added, ‘I didn’t come up with that. Obama said that, to Barbara Walters.’
Here’s what Obama told Barbara Walters in December of 2011:

BARBARA WALTERS: Okay. What’s the trait you most deplore in yourself and the trait you most deplore in others?
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Laziness.

WALTERS: You’re lazy?
OBAMA: You know, it’s interesting. There is a deep down, underneath all the work I do, I think there’s a laziness in me. I mean, it’s, it’s probably from, you know, growing up in Hawaii, and it’s sunny outside and sitting on the beach.
This morning, CNN’s Soledad O’Brien got caught on-the-air by her own panel doing the same thing.

Anyone sensing a pattern here? Horrible journalism? Agenda? My vote goes to “both.” 
It’s also worth mentioning that those who hear the word “lazy” and immediately think of black people are the ones who might want to do some soul-searching. 
ADDED: CNN Chief, Jeff Zucker (pictured), needs to have a sitdown with Blitzer to ensure the record is corrected on-the-air today. He might also want to throw in an apology

17608	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/18/Why-Obama-Fears-the-Gettysburg-Address	Opinion	1	None	None	Negative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
President Barack Obama has elected not to attend the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address on Tuesday, Nov. 19th. Instead, he will be meeting with Senators at the White House to persuade them not to impose new sanctions on Iran, and to convince them of the merits of an agreement that will allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium at low levels. No doubt, that is important–but it is also a revealing choice.
Lincoln’s speech is remembered because it expressed, simply and elegantly, why hundreds of thousands risked their lives for an idea: “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” When President Obama sought to rouse Americans to support a “targeted military strike” on Syria, he failed to move the nation. Now, he prefers to counsel the nation to accept a weak compromise with tyranny.


The contrast is striking. Obama has repeatedly likened himself to Lincoln, launching his presidential campaign from the Old State House in Springfield. He cast his candidacy as the fulfillment of the promise Lincoln made at Gettsyburg–“that all men are created equal.” Like Lincoln, Obama came up through the Illinois legislature. Like Lincoln, Obama became known for his oratory. But Lincoln’s speeches had something Obama’s never will.

Lincoln’s speeches are admired not just because they are well-constructed, but because they contain timeless principles to which he devoted his career and to which he committed the nation. The fate of Obama’s speeches is to serve a political purpose, then fade. His speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, an appeal to unity, launched his national career. Today, it is largely forgotten amidst the failures of his divisive presidency.
Obama’s address on race in Philadephia, in the midst of the 2008 presidential primary, was praised by Chris Matthews and mainstream media as “a speech worthy of Abraham Lincoln.” Yet just weeks after declaring he could “no more disown” his pastor, the race-baiting Jeremiah Wright, than he “could disown the black community,” Obama severed ties with Wright and his church, the platitudes of Philadelphia quickly cast aside.
Lincoln’s speeches were more than words–which is why his words are still cherished. The highlight of the commemoration at Gettsyburg in 1863 had been the 13,000-word speech by Edward Everett, a rousing, anti-Confederate diatribe. But Lincoln did not distinguish among Union and Confederate dead. All, he suggested, fought in their own way for the same cause. He was committing the nation, and himself, to reconciliation.
Obama has never shown the same inclination to put partisanship aside for the sake of the nation’s needs. He has coveted the aura of Lincoln’s charisma, but has never humbled himself to learn from Lincoln’s example the way Ronald Reagan humbled himself before “The Boys of Pointe du Hoc.” For Obama to speak at Gettysburg, to stand where Lincoln had once stood, would only sharpen the contrast. That is why he is staying away.

This week, the Daily Beast contacted and harassed private citizens who made contributions to Sarah Palin’s political action committee, SarahPAC. In doing so, the outlet attempted to also weaken her organization by smearing it in the eyes of those most responsible for ensuring Palin’s free-market populist message and conservatism is widely disseminated. 
During the first half of 2013, a political off-year in which there are few elections, Palin’s political action committee spent $35,000 more than it took in. The Daily Beast seized on that number and tried to convince donors to SarahPAC that Palin was defrauding them by spending money on expenses common to every political action committee.
As the Daily Beast conceded, Palin’s donors were not buying the Beast’s malarkey. 


Tim Crawford, the treasurer of SarahPAC, told Breitbart News that since 2013 is an off-year, the organization did not aggressively raise money, cognizant of the fact conservative donors were flooded with requests during the 2012 election cycle. 
“For the most part we gave our donors a break and didn’t fundraise aggressively at all. Very pleased with the results,” Crawford told Breitbart News. “It is an off year after a presidential election where every donor was bombarded with requests.”
As the Daily Beast mentioned, Palin’s PAC did make a $5,000 contribution to Jason Smith; the conservative Republican won a special election in Missouri’s Eighth Congressional District in June by a hefty margin, 67% to 27%. 

John Avlon, the co-founder of the anti-Tea Party “No Labels” group, was recently promoted to be the “Executive Editor” of the Daily Beast. Avlon oversees a publication that declared the Tea Party was dead earlier this year before conceding less than six months later that the movement has roared back to life. 
“No Labels” donors want to see the Tea Party destroyed, and Avlon’s group benefits financially and politically if the Tea Party and conservatives are weakened. Palin, coincidentally, is the political figure who former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint said had the most impact in Republican primaries. Furthermore, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) declared at this year’s CPAC that he would not be in the Senate were it not for Palin’s support in the Texas Republican Senate primary. 
Showing Palin’s strong grassroots support, the Daily Beast acknowledges that 75% of SarahPAC’s donations are from “small donors” who contribute less than $200. The Daily Beast admitted they reached out to a “number” of donors and got three on record, all of whom dismissed the outlet’s assertion that SarahPAC was wasting their money. 
One donor said, “I trust her judgment and her record.” Another said she has “done research” on Palin’s advisers and the ones that she uses are the “good” ones. Another donor mocked the Daily Beast for insinuating Palin was wasting their money, simply telling the reporter, “Come on, get real.”
The publication seems troubled that Palin, a figure whose star power is surpassed by few in American politics, paid North Star Strategies’s Jason Recher to organize and accompany Palin to events to ensure they went smoothly. To the Daily Beast’s surprise, Palin also has advisers, like Rebecca Mansour–who is mentioned in the piece–that are indispensable to any political figure, especially those like Palin whose time is in demanded like few others. 
Breitbart News has already systematically undercut Avlon’s assertion that Palin was being hypocritical for railing against Washington’s permanent political class while having political advisers who fight against it. Palin’s advisers are different, as Breitbart News reported:

They don’t hang “for sale” signs around their necks every election cycle to field a slate of candidates to butter their breads. They don’t go on television shows while not disclosing their business interests or allegiances when attacking other candidates. In fact, it is difficult to even think of the last time a Palin staff member actually went on a television program. Again, it is because these are people who work for Palin, are assembled for the long run, and put Palin’s interests ahead of their own. They don’t have a stable or roster of clients. 

In closing, the Daily Beast criticized Palin’s PAC for spending money on hotel rooms so that Palin could give a “commencement speech in the tiny town of Republic, Washington.” As Breitbart News reported, Palin gave that speech in a town elitist New York outlets like the Daily Beast so often dismiss, deride, and ignore.
The Daily Beast criticized Palin for paying her way–and not forgetting her roots–to speak at the high school graduation in Republic, Washington. Perhaps the outlet expected her to walk or drive to give that address. More disturbingly, though, the outlet harassed and pestered private citizens who donated to her political organization, trying to turn them off from supporting a political figure and organization that runs counter to the one co-founded by the Daily Beast’s Executive Editor. 
That is the type of permanent-political-class politics that Palin and her political action committee have always fought.

17620	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/10/Coulter-Addresses-USC-Republican-Tea-Party-Event	News	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
Conservative columnist Ann Coulter entertained an audience of 400 at the University of Southern California on Sunday night at an event co-sponsored by the USC College Republicans and the Hancock Park Patriots, a local Tea Party group. 
Fears of large and violent protests failed to materialize, as five peaceful demonstrators were the only presence outside the Ronald Tudor Campus Center.


Coulter spoke at length about crime, and the New York of the 1980s–to which, she joked, New Yorkers were about to return with leftist Bill de Blasio as mayor. (She is re-reading Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities to prepare, she joked.) 
Though she has written about race and crime, she is an equal-opportunity critic–arguing, for instance, that accused murderer Amanda Knox was protected by the U.S. media because she is a “pretty white girl.”
There were plenty of macabre jokes to follow–including an extended riff on how several MSNBC hosts would each commit suicide (“Chris Matthews would bungle it…Al Sharpton would do it in such a way as to blame some poor white guy”). On a more serious note, she slammed MSNBC for attacking what they called “pro-rape Republicans” over the Jamie Lee Jones rape case, in which the victim’s claims were dismissed and she was ordered to pay the attorneys’ costs of her former employer, an American military contractor.

Likewise, she noted that MSNBC had pushed the false allegation that a U.S. Census Bureau worker had been a victim of a right-wing attack, when in fact he had committed suicide in apparent insurance fraud scheme.
In her remarks, conducted in an interview format, Coulter fielded questions about her new book, Never Trust a Liberal Over 3–Especially a Republican. She criticized New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for his support for immigration reform (“amnesty”) and for playing into sudden enthusiasm in the mainstream media for his political prospects. 
She also had a few choice words for those who she said were not true Tea Partiers–evidently including Liz Cheney in that category for challenging Republican Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming: “If only she’d moved to South Carolina to run against Lindsey Graham.” 
Coulter described the Senate Conservatives Fund as a “fake group”: “On their ‘About’ page, they won’t tell me who runs it–George Soros, George Soros, George Soros.” Her message was that Republicans had to unite to unseat Senate Democrats rather than following new, would-be leaders into internecine party strife.
“Look, unless they get a good candidate to run against Lindsey Graham, I don’t think they should primary him either, and he’s my favorite candidate to primary.” She criticized the nomination of Christine O’Donnell in 2010, saying that the Delaware seat in the U.S. Senate she contested was now lost to the GOP “forever.”

She joked that Republicans needed to do a better job of removing primary candidates who could not win a general election. “We need a Luca Brasi,” she said, referring to the assassin in The Godfather, offering herself as a volunteer.
In the question-and-answer session that followed, Coulter defended her support for the Iraq War–a “magnificent war,” she said, whose gains President Barack Obama had been “pissing away.” She noted that Iraq had been relatively stable during the Arab Spring, and that the case for war in 2003 remained strong, including suspected links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.
Asked about GOP strategy in 2014 and 2016, Coulter said: “Why do we keep using the same strategists? Because we don’t know their names.” She said that her book was the beginning of an effort to expose failed consultants who had misled candidates into believing they could win in places where they could not. “I think a lot of these Tea Party groups are George Soros fronts,” she warned. She lamented that Republicans had lost the Virginia gubernatorial race, saying that Ken Cuccinelli had suffered from a “fake libertarian” spoiler and was dragged down by “a black Christian minister [E.W. Jackson] who could not win a statewide election” because of his social views.
On a more encouraging note, she said that Democrats would struggle without Obama in the presidential race: “They have a suck-ass ‘B team.'”
At the close, a liberal student asked politely “what kind of world” Coulter was looking for, citing some of her more offensive Google quotes. 
“My ideal world is a world without liberals,” she said, to laughter and applause.

The 844-page immigration reform bill the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” dropped in the dead of night contains a lucrative handout that would give taxpayer-funded free cell phones to some people who live or work near the U.S. border with Mexico.
Pages 43 and 44 of the bill detail what one conservative blogger, Javier Manjarres of Shark Tank, has already described as the “ObamaPhone” from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). That section reads:



SEC. 1107. ACCESS TO EMERGENCY PERSONNEL.(a) SOUTHWEST BORDER REGION EMERGENCY COM- MUNICATIONS GRANTS.–(1) IN GENERAL.–The Secretary, in consultation with the governors of the States in the South- west Border region, shall establish a 2-year grant program, to be administered by the Secretary, to im- prove emergency communications in the Southwest Border region.(2) ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS.–An individual is eligible to receive a grant under this subsection if the individual demonstrates that he or she–(A) regularly resides or works in the Southwest Border region;
(B) is at greater risk of border violence due to the lack of cellular service at his or her residence or business and his or her proximity to the Southern border. (3) USE OF GRANTS.–Grants awarded underthis subsection may be used to purchase satellite telephone communications systems and service that–(A) can provide access to 9-1-1 service;and(B) are equipped with global positioning systems.(4) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.– There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the grant program established under this subsection.

Manjarres first found the immigration bill’s free cell phone goodies and dubbed the handout the “MarcoPhone.”

“Move over ‘Obama phone,’ we present the new ‘Hola, Como Estas?!’ MarcoPhone,” Manjarres wrote on Wednesday morning. 
Rubio spokesman Alex Conant did not return a request for comment from Breitbart News.
Interestingly, TracFone, a company that will likely benefit from this type of government program, is based in Rubio’s Miami, Florida.
Correction: Breitbart News initially misspelled the name of the company TracFone. We regret the error.

According to an ABC News report, senators from the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” pushing immigration reform are expected to drop their bill, estimated at around 1,500 pages, on Tuesday, mere hours before the only scheduled Senate hearing on the topic.
“A bipartisan group of senators plans to introduce its long-awaited immigration bill on Tuesday, Senate sources confirmed to ABC News,” Jim Avila and Jordan Fabian wrote on Friday. “Four Democrats and four Republicans, known as the ‘Gang of Eight,’ wrapped up months of hard-fought negotiations this week and will put forth a bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.”  
If the Senators actually do wait until Tuesday to roll out their lengthy proposed overhaul of the U.S. immigration system, that will give members of the Senate Judiciary Committee less than a full day to read it before the only Senate hearing on the topic. Despite ardent pleas from Senate conservatives, including ranking Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee’s chairman, Sen. Pat Leahy, has only agreed to one hearing on the legislation.


Leahy scheduled that single hearing for Wednesday at 2:30 PM, and the hearing’s sole scheduled witness is Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. Napolitano would have less than a full day to read the bill she is scheduled to testify about.

“Gang of Eight” member Marco Rubio (R-FL) has said he supports multiple hearings and an open and transparent immigration reform process, but his actions do not necessarily back his words. He has not pushed Leahy to force multiple hearings; he appears content with the single hearing Leahy has scheduled on the issue and now appears to be backing down from his demand for multiple hearings. 
In a Friday morning report, Politico’s Manu Raju notes that after Rubio was “rebuffed” in his request for multiple hearings, “the senator wants to launch his own public hearing process of sorts to allow Republican senators to question expert witnesses about the plan, a move aimed at alleviating conservative fears that the plan will be jammed through Congress with little public airing.”
Rubio is clearly worried about the perception that this bill will be rushed through, just like Obamacare was a few years ago. On Saturday morning, Rubio’s office issued a press release containing a single quote from Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace: 
The one thing that’s clear is that this isn’t going to be health care reform. It’s not going to be rushed through. It’s going to go through the committee process. There’s going to be hearings. There will be lots of amendments. And I think the only way to get buy in from some of those other 92 senators is going to be regular order, that is a very gradual slow way.
Despite Wallace’s claim, there is only one hearing that is scheduled to happen. At the same time, there are multiple reports that keep surfacing indicating that the Gang of Eight will band together to block amendments to their bill.

During her testimony on the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano declared that she, President Barack Obama and other political officials at the top of this administration have the authority to decide which laws to enforce, and which ones to ignore. 
Napolitano made the declaration in an exchange with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) when he was questioning her on how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have alleged that political officials in the Obama administration, including her, have blocked them from enforcing the law.
Sessions noted that ICE agents’ union president Chris Crane had testified on Monday “that agents are prohibited from enforcing the law and, indeed, the ICE officers have filed a lawsuit [to that effect].”


“I started out as a federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice in 1975,” Sessions said. “I have never heard of a situation in which a group of law officers sued their supervisor and you for blocking them from following the law. They weren’t complaining about pay, benefits, working conditions. They were saying their very oath they took, to enforce the law, is being blocked by rules and regulations and policies established from on high and that this is undermining their ability to do what they’re sworn to do.”
In her response to those remarks from Sessions, Napolitano said she believes she and other political officials have the authority to tell law enforcement agents which laws to enforce and which ones to ignore. 
“There are tensions with union leadership, unfortunately, but here’s what I expect as a former federal prosecutor and attorney general, and that is that law enforcement agents will enforce the law in accord with the guidance they’re given from their superiors,” Napolitano said. “That’s what we ask of ICE, that’s what we ask of Border Patrol, that’s what we ask throughout the Department and I believe that would be consistent with all law enforcement. Agents don’t set the enforcement priorities. Those are set by their superiors and they are asked then to obey that guidance in accord with the law.”

Sessions was not pleased with Napolitano’s response, so he followed up by asking: “”Well, what Mr. Crane testified to was that there are law provisions that say an agent shall do this, that and the other, and that the policies set by their political supervisors refuse to allow them to do what the law plainly requires. You are not entitled to set policies, are you, that violate the mandates of congressional law?”
Napolitano answered that question by saying she “disagree[s] with almost everything” Sessions has said, “but we’ll just have to respectfully disagree with each other.”
“But, I think it does point to why this bill needs to be passed, because what we want our officers doing is focusing on narco-traffickers and human smugglers and money launderers and others who misuse our border and our immigration system,” Napolitano said. “By having a process by which those in the country illegally can pay a fine, pay fees, register so we know who they are, by dealing with the employer demand for illegal labor, by opening up the visa system, that will have the effect, basically, of confirming the focus of resources where they need to be.”
Despite Napolitano’s and the administration’s belief that they can tell law enforcement agents which laws to enforce and which ones to ignore, the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill cedes even more authority away from Congress and gives it to the administration.
In their lines of questioning with Napolitano during Tuesday’s hearing, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) focused on how the bill cedes authority. In a statement he issued after the hearing indicating he is not satisfied with the bill’s so-called “border security triggers” that are supposedly meant to ensure the border actually gets secured, Cruz said he does not trust the bill will actually secure the border. 
“As it stands, the border security component – which numbers only 58 pages of the 844-page bill – largely cedes authority to the Department of Homeland Security to determine when and how the border would be secure,” Cruz said. “However, today’s hearing revealed that the last clear metric for border security – ‘operational control’ – reflected that in 2010, DHS had secured 873 miles of the more than 2,000 mile border. When that metric did not demonstrate success, DHS decided to simply abandon the metric. In order for a metric to be real, it must be meaningful. Currently, there are no objective metrics in place to ensure any triggers in this bill will be meaningful, all while the pathway to citizenship component remains contingent on this undefined border security.”
Lee similarly questioned why the Gang of Eight bill gives Napolitano and the administration so much authority. “Some of the questions that I have as I’ve read through this bill over the last few days relate to the amount of discretion you are given, you and your successors will be given over time, should this become law,” Lee opened his line of questioning with Napolitano on Tuesday.
Even Gang of Eight member Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) admits the amount of authority the bill would cede to the administration is controversial. “Biggest challenge on #immigrationreform has been well founded lack of trust that Obama administration will enforce the law,” Rubio Tweeted on Tuesday. “Its [sic] a big problem”

17691	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/13/Powell-vein-of-intolerance	Opinion	0	None	None	Neutral	Negative	breitbart.com	"
This morning, former Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press to discuss the nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to Secretary of Defense. During the discussion, David Gregory asked the liberal Powell, nominally a Republican but a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama, about the Republican Party. “I’m struck when you talk about Republicans as they. I know you insist despite voting for President Obama twice now that you’re still a Republican. But as– as I go through your record on some social issues and even foreign policy issues, I challenge you a little bit to say on what basis are you still a Republican? Do you feel like this Republican Party has left you or have you left it?”

Now, this is a half-decent question, given that Powell has been quite liberal on the issues for years now. But Powell’s answer wasn’t that he differed from Republicans on the issues. Instead, he went directly to the most common liberal meme these days in defending a radical left president: Republicans are racist. It’s a bully tactic that has become all the rage these days – Republicans don’t oppose Obama on policy, and they don’t have a good rationale for standing against liberalism. It’s just that they secretly hate black people.

Here’s what he said:

I think the Republican Party right now is having an identity problem. And I’m still a Republican. I’m a Republican who grew up along with George Bush XLI. I grew up with Ronald Reagan, Cap Weinberger, Frank Carlucci, that Republican Party, the Republican Party of Dick Lugar and John Tower. But in recent years, there’s been a significant shift to the right and we have seen what that shift has produced, two losing presidential campaigns. 
So far, this is a typical leftist talking point. The Republican Party has not moved to the right. In fact, it has moved in rather extreme ways to the left, given its spending record and establishment opposition to the Tea Party. Ronald Reagan was significantly more conservative than George W. Bush. But this was prelude to Powell’s real agenda: labeling Republicans closet bigots.

I think what the Republican Party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country has changed. The country is changing demographically. And if the Republican Party does not change along with that demographic, they’re going to be in trouble. And so, when we see that in one more generation, the minorities of America, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans will be the majority of the country, you can’t go around saying we don’t want to have a solid immigration policy. We’re going to dismiss the 47 percent. We are going to make it hard for these minorities to vote as they did in the last election. What did that produce? The court struck most of that down and most importantly, it caused people to turn out and stand in line because these Republicans were trying to keep us from voting. There’s also a dark– a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the Party. What I do mean by that? I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor say that the president is shuckin’ and jivin’, that’s a racial era slave term. When I see another former governor after the president’s first debate where he didn’t do very well, says that the president was lazy. He didn’t say he was slow, he was tired, he didn’t do well, he said he was lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans but to those of us who are African-Americans, the second word is shiftless and then there’s a third word that goes along with it. Birther, the whole Birther Movement. Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the Party? I think the Party has to take a look at itself. It has to take a look at its responsibilities for health care. It has to take a look at immigration. It has to take a look at those less fortunate than us. The Party has gathered unto itself a reputation that it is the party of the rich. It is the party of lower taxes. But there are a lot of people who are lower down the food chain, the economic chain, who are also paying lots of taxes relative to their income and they need help. We need more education work being done in this country. We need a solid immigration policy. We have to look at climate change. There are a lot of things that the American people are expecting and the Republican Party, as they get ready for the next election, really has to focus on some of these issues and not ignore them. Everybody wants to talk about who’s going to be the candidate. You better think first about what’s the party they’re actually going to represent. If it’s just going to represent the far right-wing of the political spectrum, I think the Party is in difficulty. I’m a moderate but I’m still a Republican, that’s how I was raised. And until I voted for Mister Obama twice, I had voted for seven straight Republican presidents.
Notice the subtle linkage there: Republicans oppose global warming, immigration reform of the type leftists want, redistribution of income, not out of principle, but out of hatred of those with a different skin color. This is despicable. And it is a lie. Powell’s statements are outrageous. His statements about “shuckin’ and jivin'”? He’s referring to former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AL), who wrote this about President Obama’s feckless foreign policy on Benghazi:
Why the lies? Why the cover up? Why the dissembling about the cause of the murder of our ambassador on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil? We deserve answers to this. President Obama’s shuck and jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end.

Is that racist? Of course not. But Powell labels it racist because it serves his political ends. 
Is the word “lazy” racist? If so, half the media hates white folks, because presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower have routinely been labeled lazy. 
As for the birthers, nobody in the mainstream of the Republican Party has ever given credibility to them. Only in Colin Powell’s opportunistic mind is the GOP linked with birtherism.
What’s more, Powell is the last person on earth who should be making this claim. He says that he voted for President Obama twice because he’s a moderate Republican whose party has left him. That’s nonsense. In 2008, Republicans ran the most moderate Republican in history in Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). And Powell voted against him. Why? Let Powell, circa 2009, explain:

And I spoke at length with John McCain about his campaign and I watched Mr. Obama and his campaign. And at the end, I cannot say I was totally colorblind. But at the end, I convinced myself, based on the facts as I saw it, that he was the better choice for this time in our nation’s history.
It is Colin Powell and his perspective that are underlaced with a vein of intolerance. Powell should know better than anyone that the GOP has no such vein – after all, the GOP discussed the possibility of him running for president on its ticket for years. No, this is about liberal bullying and thuggery – claiming that anyone who opposes leftist policies does so out of racism rather than political differences. And it’s vile.

On Wednesday, House Republicans each received a pamphlet described as an “Immigration Resource Kit” for members as they head home to face constituents on the issue of immigration reform throughout the August recess.
The last page of the pamphlet, which was distributed via the Wednesday morning GOP conference meeting, included a collage of what it described as “What Conservative Groups Are Saying.” Under that header, the pamphlet includes statements from Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) president Grover Norquist, Southern Baptist Convention ethics and religious liberty commission president Dr. Russell Moore, the American Conservative Union (ACU), and the American Action Forum (AAF).
Each of these groups supports amnesty, and each has endorsed the Senate immigration bill. 


Norquist, who was cited twice on the last page of the pamphlet, helped champion the “Gang of Eight” bill through the Senate. He even testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of it, for which he received glowing praise from Democrat senators like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The ACU, which is chaired by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) ally Al Cardenas, also backed the Senate bill. 
AAF and its sister group American Action Network are actually part of an aggressive public pressure campaign to get the House to take up the Senate bill. Finally, Moore is a member of the George Soros front group Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) that has been advocating in favor of the Senate bill as well.
That page also quoted a months-old article from Roll Call that pointed out the Club For Growth and FreedomWorks were not going to get involved in the immigration battle, suggesting a tacit endorsement from those two conservative watchdog groups by not fighting this battle.

The page included nothing from Tea Party Patriots or the Heritage Foundation, which are both adamantly opposed to the Senate bill, nor any of the statements from the litany of conservative groups that have come out against the Gang of Eight. 
When asked about whether she specifically approved the distribution of this material to all GOP members via conference on Wednesday, GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers told Breitbart News’ Kerry Picket that she had approved it because she thought it was being done on behalf of the Judiciary Committee. “Well we did distribute it at conference,” McMorris Rodgers said in an interview with Picket on Capitol Hill. “But it’s a product of the Judiciary Committee. We allowed for it to be handed out at conference.”
Breitbart News then reached out to several of the House Republican members on the committee to see if they personally endorsed the literature. Almost a full day later, not one member has returned a request for comment. 
The full packet opens with a “Dear Colleague” letter from House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). “This recess packet has been put together to help you communicate to your constituents the importance of immigration reform and the House Republican plan to produce solutions that actually fix the problems that plague our immigration system,” Goodlatte wrote. “The Committee welcomes your insight and input as we move forward together on this important issue.”
The pamphlet lays out several pieces of legislation individually supported by most immigration hawks, like the SAFE Act from Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and the Legal Workforce Act from Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX). But it also touts legislative proposals that do not have broad support like the Border Security Results Act from House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX). 
The packet confirms the suspicions of many critics of comprehensive immigration reform by saying the House is working on an amnesty provision: “House Republicans are currently discussing a way forward on how to provide legal status to unlawful immigrants living in our country. However, the current unlawful immigrant population is diverse, so the solutions may vary.” 
“For example, while some knowingly broke our immigration laws, others were brought illegally to the U.S. as children by their parents,” the writing claims. “These children came here through no fault of their own and many of them know no other home than the United States.”
The packet does, however, say that any amnesty would need to come after border security and interior enforcement are strengthened, but does not say whether any forthcoming specific proposals would actually do that. Proponents of the Senate bill had similarly originally said legalization, or amnesty, would come after border security and interior enforcement were improved. When the Senate bill was finally introduced, that talking point changed.

Senate Budget Committee ranking member Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) told Boston’s conservative radio host Howie Carr on Wednesday that the political momentum is starting to turn against the “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.
When Carr asked the senator if this process behind the push for this bill is the “same thing as Obamacare” where “we have to pass it so we can read it,” Sessions replied: “Absolutely, it really is.”
“That is exactly what it is,” Sessions said. “They’re selling the sizzle. They’re selling the smell. And it’s a shoe leather instead of a steak.”


Carr said that though everyone can agree that the immigration system is “broken,” Americans should not support the Gang of Eight bill because it would make the system “worse.” Instead, Carr argued people should support a yet-to-be-introduced solution that actually solves the problems at hand and this issue does not need to be an all-or-nothing deal with the Gang of Eight bill.
“That is exactly correct,” Sessions responded. “And Professor [George] Borjas at Harvard, the leading expert on immigration and labor, has made so clear in his work that basically what he concludes is any benefit to this economy is at the expense of lower income workers’ salaries going down.”
When Carr asked if Gang of Eight supporters had the votes to pass the bill in the House or Senate, Sessions said that they are claiming they have it in the Senate. “But I think the tide is beginning to turn,” Sessions said. “A lot of people, like myself, I thought the bill was better than it is based on what I hear the proponents say. But as we examine it, we realize that this is going to be a disaster. It’s going to be a disaster for enforcement, it’s going to be a disaster for our budget, it’s going to be a disaster for the wages of American workers, it’s going to add to our financial deficit, Social Security and Medicare are going to be impacted over the long term by trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities and these numbers are not going to be disputed if we go forward.”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a Gang of Eight member, recently said the bill could not pass the House as is, a sign it is in serious trouble. On Sean Hannity’s radio program on Wednesday, Rubio said the bill “quite frankly, may struggle to pass the Senate” because it does not effectively enforce border security as originally promised.
On the recently discovered loopholes in the Gang of Eight bill that would allow illegal immigrants access to welfare benefits for illegal immigrants, Sessions said “of the 11 million people here today illegally, over half do not have a high school diploma. And statistics and careful analysis shows a huge percentage will qualify for all kinds of these government programs. We’ve also discovered, Howie, that the people that are coming legally, about two-tenths of one percent, virtually nobody, is being rejected based on the requirement that you should not be a public charge. In other words, we’re not even enforcing that requirement and it’s certainly not going to be enforced with regard to those that will be given amnesty.”
“Any smart nation would say ‘we want immigrants, but if you’re not able to take care of yourself, if you’re going to come in and be dependent on welfare, you don’t get admitted,'” Sessions added.
The welfare loopholes allowing illegal immigrants access to public benefits is a major stumbling block for the Gang of Eight.
Rubio is even now joining his Gang of Eight colleague Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in acknowledging that their bill contains a massive loophole that will allow illegal immigrants access to state and local benefits. “I think what he’s talking about is state and local benefits, and I would just say that yeah, if a city or a county or a state legislature decides to give benefits to illegal immigrants or someone who was previously illegally in the country, you know, they have a constitutional right to do that,” Rubio told Hannity on Wednesday in response to Sessions’ criticisms. “I would disagree with that position, and people should take it up with their state legislator or their governor or their county commissioner or what have you.”

On Wednesday, the first female White House press secretary suggested that MSNBC should fire host Martin Bashir for suggesting that someone defecate and/or urinate in former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s mouth. 
Dee Dee Myers, who was Bill Clinton’s campaign spokeswoman and his first White House press secretary, said she could not imagine where “such thoughts even come from” and tweeted “#Gottago” while linking to an article in which MSNBC was mum about whether Bashir’s apology was enough. 

Honestly…where do such thoughts even come from? #Gottago. MSNBC not saying whether Martin Bashir apology is enough http://t.co/5ElIrTM1bn
— Dee Dee Myers (@deemyers) November 20, 2013
Myers, who has written a book about why women leaders should rule the world, spoke out after Breitbart News reported that feminist and women’s groups had been silent on Bashir’s remarks. Talk radio host Mark Levin suggested women’s groups were silent because Palin is not a left-wing politician. 


After Bashir apologized on his show on Monday for words that he admitted were “wholly inappropriate” and “offensive,” Breitbart News exclusively obtained a letter from Palin’s PAC, SarahPAC, that asked MSNBC President Phil Griffin and NBC News President Deborah Turness what action the network would take against Bashir for his “appalling” words. It also mentions that MSNBC has set a precedent of firing and disciplining other anchors for “offensive language.” 


“You fired Don Imus for offensive language in describing the Rutgers University Women’s Basketball team, you suspended Alec Baldwin, and yet nothing has happened to Mr. Bashir,” the letter reads. “Are we to assume then, that disciplinary procedures at your network take place based on the target of the remarks rather than the remarks themselves?”

The letter also mentions that MSNBC suspended Baldwin’s show for two weeks after he made anti-gay remarks on the streets of New York off the air, while “Mr. Bashir’s violent rhetoric” was displayed on the air. 
The letter concludes by saying, “Americans deserve to know that your network doesn’t condone violent and hateful rhetoric directed at anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or political persuasion.”

Yesterday was a red letter day–or perhaps it should be called an Islamic green letter one–for U.S. intelligence. For the first time I can recall, the top legislator on a congressional oversight committee actually made clear what motivates our enemies in what used to be called euphemistically the “War on Terror,” and what Team Obama now dubs even more opaquely as the effort to “counter violent extremism.” 
This breakthrough came in the course of a joint appearance on CNN’s State of the Union by the chairpersons of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), respectively. The media seized on the ostensibly big news from their remarks: bipartisan agreement that the United States is at greater risk of terrorist attack today than two years ago.  


But important, ominous, and accurate as that assessment is, it was not the most important point made by these two respected lawmakers. Instead, it was Sen. Feinstein’s observation in response to a question about what causes the “hatred” that makes our situation more perilous: 

There is a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist jihadist Islamic community, and that is that the West is responsible for everything that goes wrong and that the only thing that’s going to solve this is Islamic shariah law.
What makes this incontrovertible statement so noteworthy? It is the fact that the intelligence community is not allowed to say it. Under Obama administration guidelines, for intelligence officers-and for that matter, law enforcement, Homeland Security and military personnel-to talk about Islamic jihadism and shariah as the motivation for terrorism can be a career-ending offense.  
For example, on May 10, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, used a press conference to denounce a highly decorated and up-and-coming Army officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Dooley, for teaching an elective course at the Joint Forces Staff College using approved curriculum. According to Gen. Dempsey, what prompted this extraordinary action was that a student–who it turns out, had not actually been enrolled in Col. Dooley’s class–“was concerned that the course was objectionable and that it was counter to our values …our appreciation for religious freedom and cultural awareness. And the young man who brought it to my attention was absolutely right. It’s totally objectionable.”
At the core of what was so “totally objectionable” is the fact that students were exposed to information that made plain the gravity of the threat of which Sen. Feinstein warned: the supremacist, totalitarian Islamic doctrine of shariah and the jihad or holy war it obliges adherents to perform. Col. Dooley’s promising career was cut short and the files of his institution and that of the rest of the national security community have been purged of all such information deemed by unidentified “experts” engaged for the purpose to be “counter to our values.”
Sen. Feinstein’s forthright declaration is particularly gratifying as I had an opportunity to discuss the danger posed by shariah with her in the course of testimony I provided the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 24, 2013 at the invitation of her colleague, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). In the course of making the case for keeping the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open, I observed:
We have been obliged to go to war because it was thrust upon us. And, if we are to prevail in this conflict, we must understand the nature of the enemies with whom we are at war. They are shariah-adherent jihadists who believe, in accordance with that doctrine, that it is God’s will that they destroy our way of life and subjugate us to theirs.
At the time, Sen. Feinstein strongly disagreed with my view that shariah’s dictates make it impossible to safely release its adherents from Gitmo or, alternatively, to incarcerate them in this country instead–where they might exploit rights foolishly conferred upon them to secure their freedom and wage jihad here. I hope that the clarity she expressed Sunday about the inexorable nature of the shariah doctrine and the supremacist hatred it impels will cause the senior senator from California to insist that such insights are once again inculcated in those responsible for our security and to reconsider her support for closing Guantanamo Bay.

Saturday morning, Big Journalism ran the story of John Dickerson, a CBS News political director, who took to the online pages of Slate to suggest it was time for Obama to “destroy” and “pulverize” the Republican Party. 
Today, Dickerson took to the online pages of Slate again, this time to insist we all misunderstood him. His new headline and subtitle say it all:

They Hate Me, They Really Hate Me
Conservatives despise my analysis of Obama’s second-term options. But it was analysis–not advice.

He then writes:



Some people thought I was giving the president my personal advice. No. My goal was to make a compelling argument based on the facts. I used words like “war” and “pulverize,” and some have responded with threats to me and my family. (“Go for his throat!” some have counseled, echoing the headline.) These words have also liberated some correspondents (USUALLY THE ONES THAT TYPE IN ALL CAPS!!!!) from reading the piece or reading it in the spirit in which it was written.

All the left-wing bases are pretty much covered there: Oh, poor me; I’m the misunderstood victim who’s hated and receiving death threats from the wingers. 
I honestly believe that one of the Lefts’ primary tactics is to endlessly exhaust us with this kind of relentless tactical nonsense. 
If Dickerson was indeed writing analysis, he did an awfully good job ofdisguising it as naked advocacy. Here are the opening paragraphs of Dickerson’s original piece. Please tell me at which point this Obama cheer-leading distinguishes itself as anything nearing objective analysis: [emphasis added]


Go for the Throat!
Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party.
On Monday, President Obama will preside over the grand reopening of his administration. It would be altogether fitting if he stepped to the microphone, looked down the mall, and let out a sigh: so many people expecting so much from a government that appears capable of so little. A second inaugural suggests new beginnings, but this one is being bookended by dead-end debates. Gridlock over the fiscal cliff preceded it and gridlock over the debt limit, sequester, and budget will follow. After the election, the same people are in power in all the branches of government and they don’t get along. There’s no indication that the president’s clashes with House Republicans will end soon.
Inaugural speeches are supposed to be huge and stirring. Presidents haul our heroes onstage, from George Washington to Martin Luther King Jr. George W. Bush brought the Liberty Bell. They use history to make greatness and achievements seem like something you can just take down from the shelf. Americans are not stuck in the rut of the day.
But this might be too much for Obama’s second inaugural address: After the last four years, how do you call the nation and its elected representatives to common action while standing on the steps of a building where collective action goes to die? That bipartisan bag of tricks has been tried and it didn’t work. People don’t believe it. Congress’ approval rating is 14 percent, the lowest in history. In a December Gallup poll, 77 percent of those asked said the way Washington works is doing “serious harm” to the country.
The challenge for President Obama’s speech is the challenge of his second term: how to be great when the environment stinks. Enhancing the president’s legacy requires something more than simply the clever application of predictable stratagems. Washington’s partisan rancor, the size of the problems facing government, and the limited amount of time before Obama is a lame duck all point to a single conclusion: The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat.

As you can see, any claim that this is analysis, and not opinion, is complete nonsense. 
As the portions I’ve highlighted make clear, Dickerson’s entire piece was predicated on his obvious belief that Republicans are the problem, not Obama. All four of those paragraphs are loaded with criticism of the GOP, while Obama is presented as a reasonable man who tried his best to make things work only to find his noble intentions thwarted at every turn. 
The love for Obama starts in the next paragraph, as the GOP bashing continues:

President Obama could, of course, resign himself to tending to the achievements of his first term. He’d make sure health care reform is implemented, nurse the economy back to health, and put the military on a new footing after two wars. But he’s more ambitious than that. He ran for president as a one-term senator with no executive experience. In his first term, he pushed for the biggest overhaul of health care possible because, as he told his aides, he wanted to make history. He may already have made it. There’s no question that he is already a president of consequence. But there’s no sign he’s content to ride out the second half of the game in the Barcalounger. He is approaching gun control, climate change, and immigration with wide and excited eyes. He’s not going for caretaker.

How should the president proceed then, if he wants to be bold? The Barack Obama of the first administration might have approached the task by finding some Republicans to deal with and then start agreeing to some of their demands in hope that he would win some of their votes. It’s the traditional approach. Perhaps he could add a good deal more schmoozing with lawmakers, too. 


That’s the old way. He has abandoned that. He doesn’t think it will work and he doesn’t have the time. As Obama explained in his last press conference, he thinks the Republicans are dead set on opposing him. They cannot be unchained by schmoozing. Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence, other constraints will limit the chance for cooperation. Republican lawmakers worried about primary challenges in 2014 are not going to be willing partners. He probably has at most 18 months before people start dropping the lame-duck label in close proximity to his name. 


“Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence…”
Whatevs. 

A look at Dickerson’s previous Slate columns only bolsters the case that he has no business presenting himself on CBS News, or anywhere, as an unbiased political analyst. 
But even if Dickerson’s DESTROY THEM! column is analysis, it’s ridiculously biased analysis, and biased only in favor of every premise Obama’s manufactured in his ongoing media/political war with the GOP. 
Maybe that’s the problem… Maybe what the corrupt media now considers “objective analysis” is so comfortable in the tank with Obama, that those of us who live in the real world can no longer distinguish between the rantings of the politically bloodthirsty Left and the mainstream media’s idea of analysis. 
Because there is no difference.

A second staffer for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) disparaged American workers during an interview with Ryan Lizza, a partial transcript of the interview the New Yorker reporter released Monday afternoon shows. 
Originally, it appeared as though only one anonymous Rubio “aide” disparaged American workers and only did so in the context of speaking about low-skilled jobs in the U.S. However, the Lizza interview transcript shows two aides referenced low-skilled and high-skilled American workers.
Lizza asked the two staffers to respond to this statement: “Well their argument is, what, that they have American workers for these jobs, they don’t need this program.”


The thus-far unidentified “Rubio Aide 1” said that some workers either can’t or won’t make it in the work force anyway: 

Yeah. I mean one of the problems you have with this, “Oh, there’s American workers who are unemployed.” There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it. There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you obviously can’t discuss that publicly because–

At that point, “Rubio Aide 2” interjected, “But the same is true for high-skilled workers.”
“Aide 1” then said, “Yes, and the same is true across every sector, in government, in everything.”

Lizza’s story had originally not specified that two Rubio aides made the argument, leaving a little room for Rubio’s staff to try to discredit the reporting.
As excerpted by Politico’s Mike Allen Sunday morning, Lizza’s story reported the exchange as follows: 

Rubio sided with the Chamber against the construction workers. “There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it,” a Rubio aide told me. “There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you can’t obviously discuss that publicly.” In the end, the wage issue was settled to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s satisfaction, and the Building and Construction Trades union won a cap on the number of visas for foreign construction workers.

After National Review editor Rich Lowry picked up on how Rubio’s anonymous “aide” disparaged American workers, and published a piece on it, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant tried to argue Lizza’s reporting was inaccurate. 
“We strongly objected to the magazine including that background quote in the piece because it’s not what Sen. Rubio believes or has ever argued,” Conant told Lowry. “In truth, Sen. Rubio has always said the reason we need a robust temporary worker program is to create legal avenues for US businesses to meet labor needs when not enough Americans apply for jobs… Sen. Rubio believes that American workers can compete against anyone in the world.”
Sen. Rubio himself gave a quote to The Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis publicly rejecting the comments. “The quote attributed to a member of my staff was a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program,” Rubio told Lewis. “It is not my view in any way. I could not disagree with it more.”
The transcript Lizza released casts doubt on whether the quote was simply “a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program.” Rather, it indicates the quotes were two Rubio staffers making the argument on their own, not in an abstract context. The transcript also shows that the two Rubio aides were talking about high-skilled and low-skilled American workers, not just those who would be part of a guest worker program.
After Lewis’s piece was published, Breitbart News reported that several immigration organization leaders and hill staffers have called on Sen. Rubio to publicly identify the aide who made those comments. NumbersUSA director of government relations Rosemary Jenks and Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian, as well as various hill staffers, called on Rubio to publicly identify the aide and terminate him or her.
On Twitter, National Review‘s Lowry asked Lizza, “i have no reason to doubt you but can you share any more of the context of that quote? rubio staff pushing bk hard.” He added that Rubio’s office’s pushback included Conant saying “the aide was describing some industries’ response to unions’ opposition to temp workers.”
When Lizza sent out the partial transcript of the interview, Lowry responded, “great, thank you. looks like you were exactly right unless im missing something.”

President Barack Obama’s former national field director Jeremy Bird has launched an organization with a plan to turn Texas blue for the first time in decades, Politico reports.
Bird’s new organization, “Battleground Texas,” will target Hispanic voters in the state to try to swing the Lone Star state in the direction of Democrats. Texas has for a long time been a Republican Party stronghold, and its 38 electoral college votes are crucial to any GOP presidential candidate’s run for office. If Texas becomes a battleground or Democratic Party state, Republican presidential candidates may be in dire danger. They’d have to spend time and money campaigning in the state, taking their focus off states that are already hotly contested.
Bird appears to understand this, and that’s why he’s targeting the state. “With its diversity and size, Texas should always be a battleground state where local elections are vigorously contested and anyone who wants to be our commander in chief has to compete and show they reflect Texas values. Yet for far too long, the state’s political leaders, both in Austin and in Washington, D.C., have failed to stand for Texans,” Bird told Politico. “Over the next several years, Battleground Texas will focus on expanding the electorate by registering more voters — and as importantly, by mobilizing Texans who are already registered voters but who have not been engaged in the democratic process.”


Politico quoted several anonymous Democratic consultants who said Bird plans to bring in top campaign talent and make a serious effort at competing in the state.

Republicans, on the other hand, are still regaining their footing after the beat down they endured in the last election cycle – and didn’t have a specific plan when Breitbart News asked for one.
Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told Breitbart News though that the GOP is “in the midst of the party’s winter meeting down here in Charlotte” where GOP leaders are crafting “the vision and role of the party going forward” including “specifically the ways that we can grow it and win more elections.”

Breitbart News has learned there is a provision included in the immigration bill that could be used to give free cars, motorcycles, scooters or other vehicles to young people around the country over a period of 15 months after the bill passes.  The new provision is a result of the latest addition to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which is essentially an entirely new version of the bill.
  
The Washington Examiner‘s Byron York uncovered the new Obama stimulus program that Gang of Eight members and other Senate Republicans inserted into the bill as a sweetheart deal for liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). The left leaning Senator was previously critical of the legislation. 


“The original Gang bill ended with a section designated Title IV, which was headlined REFORMS TO NON-IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAMS,” York wrote on Sunday. “The Hoeven-Corker version of the bill added a Title V, with the headline JOBS FOR YOUTH. The measure would provide $1.5 billion in the next two years to provide jobs for Americans between the ages of 16 and 24. It was originally pushed by Democratic Sen. Bernard Sanders, who wanted to come to the aid of young workers who were ‘hard hit by the Wall Street-caused recession.’ Now, Sanders says immigration reform will further damage youth job prospects.”

A provision under that new stimulus program title allows for the use of spending the taxpayer money on the program to provide transportation for youth to and from their jobs.
“(f) USE OF FUNDS.– (1) IN GENERAL.–The funds made available under this section shall be used– (A) to provide summer employment opportunities for low-income youth, with direct linkages to academic and occupational learning, and may be used to provide supportive services, such as transportation or child care, that is necessary to enable the participation of such youth in the opportunities;”
The total appropriation for this new stimulus program would be $1.5 billion that would be divvied up among states that applied for the money. According to the proposed statute as written, all the money would need to be spent in a year-and-three-months period. 
“The amounts appropriated under this title shall be available for obligation by the Secretary of Labor until December 31, 2014, and shall be available for expenditure by grantees (including subgrantees) until September 30, 2015,” the part of the provision detailing how long the money would be available for reads.
A GOP senate aide told Breitbart News that for the country to be able to spend $1.5 billion on such a program so fast, it would need to buy, lease or rent motor vehicles  for beneficiaries of the new government handout. The provision that outlines how the money can be legally used for providing “supportive services” like “transportation,” the aide said, could easily be interpreted to mean the money could be spent buying or leasing or renting vehicles for the beneficiaries.
“This appears to give states authority to buy, lease or rent motorcycles, cars and scooters or anything kids want to buy to get to and from a job,” the GOP aide said.

According to new national polling data from Pew Research, the American people have revolted against President Barack Obama’s and the GOP establishment’s efforts to grant amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants through comprehensive immigration reform.
“Only about a third of the public (32%) approves of the job Obama is doing on immigration policy; 60% disapprove,” Pew wrote. “Obama’s ratings for this issue among Democrats are mixed: About half (53%) approve of his handling of the issue while 42% disapprove.”
Obama’s 60 percent disapproval rating on immigration from the American people is an all-time high for him on the issue and puts him on par with former President George W. Bush’s immigration polling numbers. Obama’s immigration disapproval rating has skyrocketed as he has ramped up his efforts to lobby Congress for the passage of an amnesty–particularly the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.


As the American people have learned more and more about the Gang of Eight bill and the effects which amnesty and a drastic influx of millions of new workers would have on the hurting economy, they have grown more and more outraged with what Washington, D.C., is doing regarding immigration reform. In February–before Obama and lawmakers like Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and DIck Durbin (D-IL) began their push for immigration reform–the President’s immigration policy approval rating among the American people, according to Pew, was higher than his disapproval rating. His approval rating on immigration then was 44 percent, whereas his disapproval rating was 43 percent.
Over the next several months, the Obama administration worked with the Senate Democrats and a handful of Senate Republicans to develop the more-than-thousand-page-long Gang of Eight bill. The administration helped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rush the bill to the floor with hardly any substantive review from members, staffers, the media, and the American people.
In mid-June, before the Senate bill passed and as its ultimate passage became questionable, Obama’s Pew Research disapproval rating on immigration spiked up to 47 percent, and his approval rating on the issue dropped to 43 percent. With the public beginning to turn against amnesty, the Senators pushing for it cobbled together a series of amendments designed to win over extra votes in the Senate–like the Corker-Hoeven plan for their votes, casino kickbacks for Sen. Dean Heller’s vote, “Lobster Bait” for Susan Collins’ vote, and a seafood processing deal for Lisa Murkowski’s vote, among others–and rammed the bill through to final passage in the Senate.

Since then, Obama’s immigration disapproval rating, according to Pew, has skyrocketed to 60 percent. That disapproval rating is higher than George W. Bush’s ever was, according to a Pew chart on page 12 of the report, save one exception: in April 2006, Bush’s immigration disapproval rating reached 62 percent.
As Obama’s disapproval ratings reach all-time highs because of his support for amnesty, Republicans keep the issue alive. While House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) says the issue will not receive any votes in the House in 2013, which is probably true, the effort to grant amnesty from House GOP leadership is alive and well–and likely to continue in early 2014. 
Officials like Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) keep offering Obama cover by continuing to push for some kind of immigration package. In an interview this week with Bloomberg’s Al Hunt, Priebus continued pushing for amnesty.
“I think it can happen, and I think people like Paul Ryan and others still want something like that to happen,” Priebus said this week. “It could happen next year, I don’t think there’s any sort of midnight hour here.”
Ryan is in the process of drafting a bill that would grant America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants legal status. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said this summer at a town hall event in Racine, Wisconsin. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”

Priebus and Ryan, if they keep pushing down this road, face the fate of what happened to Senator Rubio after he pushed for amnesty. Rubio has since backed off the push and publicly undercut the efforts of House GOP leadership to pass any group of piecemeal bills with the goal of getting to a conference committee negotiation with the Democratic Senate–from which a comprehensive immigration reform conference report like the Senate bill would arise. Rubio’s backtracking on the issue, and complete reversal of support for his own bill, came after the American people turned on him for supporting such a plan. Polling data over the past several months showed the once-promising presidential candidate tanking among Republican voters. 
House GOP leadership could technically kill this once and for all by promising publicly what Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) has advocated: that there will never be a conference committee with the Senate bill. However, they have left the door open, as pressure from lobbyists and groups funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to pass an amnesty.
If such legislation as the Gang of Eight bill were ever to become law, it would be considered President Obama’s signature second-term legislative achievement, much like Obamacare is his first term’s signature achievement. The difference from Obamacare is that Republicans like Priebus and Ryan are helping him achieve it, at least for now–largely because the donor community on Wall Street wants this policy.
Despite all the pressure from donors and special interests to do what Ryan and Priebus are doing, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, offers a different pathway forward for the GOP: flip this whole debate on its head, undercut amnesty, and make the Democrats wear the blame for having fought against the interests of American workers. 
“In changing the terms of the immigration debate we will not only prevent the implementation of a disastrous policy, but begin a larger effort to broaden our appeal to working Americans of all backgrounds,” Sessions wrote in a memo to his GOP colleagues this summer. 

Now is the time to speak directly to the real and legitimate concerns of millions of hurting Americans whose wages have declined and whose job prospects have grown only bleaker. This humble and honest populism–in contrast to the Administration’s cheap demagoguery–would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party. Of course, such a clear and honest message would require saying “no” to certain business demands and powerful interests who shaped the immigration bill in the Senate.

The United States Postal Service, along with the U. S. Government and the communist government of Cuba, resumed talks this week to negotiate USPS supplying direct mail service between the countries. The State Department hinted the move might help the failing government agency with its money problems.
The Associated Press reported Monday morning that a “U.S. Official” confirmed the United States is looking to resume the mail service which has been out of commission since 1963:

U.S. and Cuban diplomats and postal representatives will meet in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday for technical talks aimed at ending a 50-year suspension in direct mail between the United States and the communist island. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the matter publicly before Congress is notified. Lawmakers were to be notified of the meetings starting Monday morning, the official said.
The resumption in talks does not signify any change in the Obama administration’s Cuba policy, the official said, stressing that the discussions are taking place in the context of the Cuba Democracy Act of 1992 and are consistent with the U.S. interest “in promoting the free flow of information to, from and within Cuba.”

The State Department confirmed the talks will take place this week. “This is something we feel is good for us,” Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, “But it’s not meant to be a signal of anything or indicate a change in policy.”


When asked if the bankrupt Postal Service is in any position to provide these kind of services, Psaki said she “assumed” that “more revenue” would be generated because more stamps would be used.

USPS lost $16 Billion in 2012 and announced at the beginning of this year a change of services that are set to begin this summer.
Read the transcript from the State Department below:

QUESTION: All right. And then if there’s nothing else on North Korea, I just want to nail down the postal talks with Cuba.
MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.
QUESTION: Do you expect anything out of this round or is this really not – is this just – in other words, if these two days of talks are a success, there won’t be direct mail service immediately, I presume, but maybe I’m wrong, so could you —
MS. PSAKI: That’s a good question on the timeline. Just to give you a little bit of history here, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 states that, quote, “The United States Postal Service shall take such actions as are necessary to provide direct mail service to and from Cuba.” So this is – as you mentioned, on June 18th and 19th – well, you didn’t mention the dates, but so everybody knows, representatives from the Department of State and the United States Postal Service will meet with representatives from the Government of Cuba for a technical discussion on reestablishing direct transportation of mail. The reason we’re doing this is because it’s, of course, good for the Cuban people. This is something we feel is good for us. But it’s not meant to be a signal of anything or indicate a change in policy.
QUESTION: Syria?
QUESTION: Are those talks here or in —
MS. PSAKI: In terms of the exact location, I’m not sure if they’re at the Department of State or if they’re just somewhere else in the —
QUESTION: Could we go to Syria?
QUESTION: Well, can we —
MS. PSAKI: Well, let’s finish Cuba.
QUESTION: Are those talks exclusively on the mail service?
MS. PSAKI: That is with the United States Postal Service. That’s their purview.
QUESTION: But I’m saying is it mainly about the – is there anything going to come up about Mr. Gross?
MS. PSAKI: I don’t want to predict. There are issues that are, of course, raised on both sides. As you know, this is an issue that has been raised at the highest levels from the United States, but given these are talks with the Postal Service, I would expect that will be the focus.
QUESTION: You don’t consider that the highest level?
MS. PSAKI: Well – Brad, having fun on your last day? (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Just one more. I mean, is the U.S. Postal Service in any kind of position to make any kind of deals or agreements with Cuba? I mean, this is an organization that is essentially going broke, and I’m just curious. Is —
MS. PSAKI: Well, I think that’s combining two different things, in my opinion. This has been – we have had – I read off the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992.
QUESTION: Right.
MS. PSAKI: So they’re simply allowing mail to travel, which is – I would assume provides them with more revenue, with more stamps used.
QUESTION: Considering that – well, all right, exactly. So in other words, this could actually help the Postal Union’s budget if they are able to —
MS. PSAKI: I don’t want to go too far on it, but – I don’t want to go too far, Matt, but it’s more people using their services.
Jill.
QUESTION: Jen, a clarification on that too. What is the genesis of this? I mean, how did these talks actually come about? Who asked for them?
MS. PSAKI: Well, this is something that the U.S. has felt would be a positive step for the Cuban people. We felt it was in our interests. In terms of who specifically asked for it, I don’t have that level of detail, but it’s just something that we felt it was – it would be positive moving forward.
QUESTION: But basically, the U.S. asked for it?
MS. PSAKI: I would have to check on that for you, but it’s something, again, that we are very supportive of and we are, of course, helping direct here.
QUESTION: Isn’t it a continuation of the talks from 2009 that were on the same subject?
MS. PSAKI: Well, I don’t know if I’d call it a continuation because it’s been a number of years, but yes, it’s on the same subject, and we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to move things forward.

While House Speaker John Boehner is keeping a tight lid on his personal position on immigration reform, conservative activists and lawmakers fear the Republican leader may rubber-stamp Democrats’ controversial legislation in a backroom deal with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
Boehner declined to answer whether he supports what many on the left have come to term a “pathway to citizenship” for illegal immigrants during his appearance on CBS News’ Face The Nation on Sunday morning. For conservative lawmakers, that does not assuage fears that he and his deputies House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Whip Kevin McCarthy, and Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan could be working behind the scenes cut a deal with Reid and President Barack Obama to achieve amnesty for illegal immigrants in America.
“We are scared to death of what we figure is already Boehner’s end game,” a senior congressional GOP aide told Breitbart News. “There are so many forces within the GOP establishment pushing for their interests that it’s hard to conceive that Boehner will not cave to them.”


Boehner could “conference” any bill or group of bills the House passes related to immigration with the Senate’s controversial immigration bill. In conference, representatives for House GOP leadership would negotiate with Senate Democratic leadership, and potentially the White House, on what they would call a “compromise” on immigration reform. 
Conservatives do not trust Boehner and his team to stand up to Senate Democrats in conference, so they are advocating the House refuse to pass any legislation for fear it could be molded into a “compromise” that looks just like or is identical language to the Senate bill. 
Many conservatives fear that such a compromise would only get a short amount of time for actual review, and votes would be whipped up and sold using talking points just like how the Senate bill passed. They point to comments from Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), whose amendment with Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) made a series of massive changes to the bill, where he argued that it is acceptable for senators to work with because they “will have more than 72 hours to read and review the proposal before any votes.”

“The worry among Capitol Hill conservatives was that Boehner would take any House-passed bill with the word ‘immigration’ in it and set up a conference that would produce a bill with the trappings of compromise that would be politically difficult to oppose,” conservative journalist Neil McCabe, a former senior reporter for Human Events, wrote in a recent column for Town Hall magazine.
McCabe’s column, titled “Stockman calls out Boehner gambit to save amnesty agenda,” focuses on efforts Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) has led to uncover how the Senate immigration bill is unconstitutional on the grounds that it raises revenue. As Breitbart News reported last week, House Ways and Means Committee chairman Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), the House authority on tax and revenue issues, agreed with Stockman’s analysis and similarly labeled the bill unconstitutional.
However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid can protect the bill, and a future deal with House GOP leaders, by using a procedural trick in which he holds on to the bill in his chamber of Congress and does not send it over to the House. Though the bill passed the Senate several weeks ago now, Reid has not yet delivered it to the House.
Boehner has not agreed to refuse to salvage the Senate bill, as conservatives like Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) have requested. All indications are that such a conference would not happen until sometime after the August recess, as the opposition to amnesty has slowed proponents of the effort.
Conservative columnist and best-selling author Ann Coulter, who has been warning for months about such a conference strategy by amnesty advocates, believes the House should not pass any immigration bills, regardless of their individual merit. She argues that pro-amnesty lawmakers may use a conference as a vehicle to get the Senate bill or something like it to President Barack Obama’s desk, where he can sign it into law.
“Right now, people who don’t want amnesty have to call the House and say they don’t want any immigration bill until we have a Republican Senate,” Coulter said in a late-June appearance on Fox News Channel’s Hannity. “If they pass a bill that does nothing but enforce e-verify, does nothing but enforce the fence, it will go into conference with the Senate and it will come out an amnesty bill.”
Coulter added that she suspects Boehner “secretly wants” amnesty for illegal immigrants: 


Nothing will happen with a vote to enforce E-verify, which by the way is a one-page simple bill; they could do that right away if they were serious about enforcing the border. But I don’t trust and perhaps I’m wrong, I hope he will prove me wrong. I think John Boehner secretly wants the amnesty and he want as fig leaf to make it took like, “Oh, no we just voted on the fence.” No, a vote on the fence in the House is a vote for amnesty.

“Ann Coulter got it exactly right,” added that senior GOP congressional aide who warned that Republicans are “scared to death” about what Boehner could do.

Border security is the only basis for Republican unity. Republicans are divided on all other particulars–path to citizenship, guest worker program, deportation, anchor babies, etc. As I’ve argued before, Republican strategy in the House should be to say “no” on issues where there is consensus, and “no, unless” on issues where there is not. In this case, the House should reject any reform unless it puts border security first.
Law enforcement is the only true bipartisan policy. Conservative Republicans have something in common with unions: a common enthusiasm for enforcing immigration law against employers, particularly through the use of e-verify databases for new hires. In addition, working-class voters are less than enthusiastic about legalizing immigrants who would create instant competition in non-farm sectors of the low-skills labor market.


We have tried amnesty before, and it failed. The reason we have some 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States is that a 1986 amnesty enacted by the Reagan administration failed to improve law enforcement (thanks in part to liberal interest groups) and merely created new incentives for illegal immigration. Enforcement is to amnesty as spending cuts are to tax hikes; unless they come first, they do not happen.
Democrats do not want to “resolve” illegal immigration. If they did, it would have been done already. They do want to pass big legislation: back in 2006-7, Democrat strategist (and ex-con) Robert Creamer prescribed immigration reform as the second step in a series of radical changes (after health care). Yet as Daniel Horowitz writes at RedState, Democrats need new immigration-related grievances to fuel their outrage.
Barack Obama began his community organizing career with a radical immigrants’ group. One of Obama’s first organizing assignments in Chicago was with an Alinkyite group called UNO, the “Mexican-American ACORN.” As Stanley Kurtz has exposed, “Obama personally helped plan” some of the group’s most thuggish activities. He has used this issue his entire career to divide Americans and intimidate political opponents.

Regardless of what passes, Obama will take–and receive–credit. Voters will not remember that Obama blocked immigration reform in the Senate, or that he failed to introduce new legislation in his first term, breaking a solemn campaign promise. They will simply remember that they voted for him in 2012 and he signed immigration reform afterwards. Republicans will continue to average 30% of the Hispanic vote regardless.
Regardless of what passes, Republicans will still be labeled bigots. The president has already attempted to delegitimize opposition to immigration reform as motivated by racism; he will likely do so again. He will do so more often, not less, if Republicans give up their insistence on border security first, because then there will seem to be no other basis for opposition to immigration reform. The media will support him enthusiastically.
Immigration is neither the sole Hispanic issue, nor solely a Hispanic issue. Issues such as education and economic opportunity also top the agenda for Hispanic voters. In addition, as Tony Lee has pointed out, Asian immigrants are the fastest-growing group, even outpacing Hispanics in California. Republicans perform equally poorly among Asian-American voters–not because of immigration but likely because of other issues.
The Obama administration has little interest in law enforcement. Last year, the president used executive action to create a “Dream Act” by fiat, circumventing Congress and creating new incentives for illegal immigration. The administration has also done little over the past four years to patrol the borders beyond perfunctory gestures, and strenuously opposed efforts by the state of Arizona to take matters into its own hands. 
Immigration does need to be reformed–for skilled immigrants. The area in which U.S. immigration policy is most lacking concerns skilled immigrants, who are choosing other destinations. The Obama administration has not made it easier for skilled students to stay in the country when finished their degree, nor has it removed the cap on H1-B visas. The Democrats’ primary concern is not the economy, nor justice, but new votes.

As President Obama has halted funding for White House tours and Blue Angels performances, citing the budget sequester, he and First Wife Michelle geared up Tuesday for a star-studded, soul music concert in the White House that featured such celebs as Justin Timberlake, Queen Latifah, and the Reverend Al Green.
Only a few days before the big gala concert, the Obama Administration claimed sequestration caused January’s anemic jobs numbers by cutting vital government services. However, the purportedly severe cutbacks of government spending didn’t stop the President from enjoying a night of stirring soul music during Tuesday’s program, titled In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul.
First Lady Michelle Obama kicked off the April 9 tribute to Soul with an hour-long, morning program held in the White House State Dining Room billed as a “guidance” on the night’s Memphis Soul performance. The event was held for students and music lovers and featured soul greats Sam Moore, Mavis Staples, Charlie Musselwhite, Ben Harper, and pop star Justin Timberlake as panel members taking questions from the audience.


Mrs. Obama opened the morning’s introductory program by discussing the importance of music in America today and urged the children in the audience to faithfully practice playing music.
“The only way for you to become the best musician you can be is to keep pushing through those moments when something doesn’t seem fun by spending hours in the practice room repeating those scales and drilling into that theory,” she said. “And if you do all that… you might become a better performer than you ever imagined.”
The First Lady went on to note that even if one doesn’t become a musician for a career choice, all that effort is still a worthy exercise.

“When I was young I played the piano, now as I try to remind my kids I regret the fact that I didn’t keep it up. I try to tell them that every single day,” she claimed.
The full concert was recorded later that evening and included performances by Alabama Shakes, William Bell, Steve Cropper, Al Green, Ben Harper, Queen Latifah, Cyndi Lauper, Joshua Ledet, Sam Moore, Charlie Musselwhite, Mavis Staples, and Justin Timberlake, with Booker T. Jones as music director and band leader.
During the night’s finale, the artists tried to get President Obama to join in the singing on stage, but the President rebuffed the offer.
Despite declining to sing, Barack and Michelle stayed on the stage during the finale, shaking hands, dancing, and clapping.
The concert was recorded for television, and In Performance at the White House: Memphis Soul was broadcast Tuesday on PBS stations nationwide.

In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) attended a fundraiser where he blasted President Bush, telling the crowd, “I was a constitutional law professor, which means unlike the current president I actually respect the Constitution.” President Obama, however, has been far less respectful of the Constitution that Senator Obama purportedly was. In fact, Obama has steadily violated a bevy of Constitutional provisions ranging from separation of powers to specific elements of the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments.

This week, Obama unilaterally decided to tell insurance companies that they could now allow sale of plans in the individual insurance market that Obamacare had prevented, forcing five million Americans off the health plans they liked. As Ken Klukowski of Breitbart News has written, this is a violation of the Constitutional separation of powers: 

Obama’s announcement is a flagrant and undeniable violation of his constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause. The provisions of Obamacare causing enormous trouble for insurance plans are mandatory, and only Congress can change those parts of the Affordable Care Act.

But President Obama has a history of violating the Constitutional balance of powers. As Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal has noted, he has unilaterally suspended enforcement of immigration law; he has refused to prosecute drug law violators; he simply stopped defending federal laws he didn’t like, like the Defense of Marriage Act, in court; he issues waivers on Obamacare and the No Child Left Behind Act; Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency has attempted to regulate carbon emissions when Congress didn’t push through a global warming bill; he appointed members of the National Labor Relations Board in violation of law; his administration rammed through an auto bailout that screwed bondholders, as well as a slush fund from British Petroleum. Strassel writes, “Mr. Obama came to office promising to deliver a new kind of politics. He did–his own, unilateral governance.”
President Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not extend to freedom of religion – his administration has forced religious businessowners to pay for insurance plans that cover activities in violation of religious precepts. It does not extend to freedom of speech – Obama has condemned exercises of speech he doesn’t like as violative of American principles (see, for example, the infamous YouTube video Obama said caused violence in the Middle East). It does not extend to equal protection under the laws – Obama has personally intervened in criminal cases like that of George Zimmerman. 

Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not apply to protections against unreasonable search and seizure, as Obama’s deeply intrusive National Security Agency programs prove. It does not apply to Fifth Amendment protections against taking of private property. It does not apply to the Second Amendment, as Obama’s executive orders on guns show. And it most certainly does not extend to the Tenth Amendment, which protects states’ rights. 
Obama has never respected the Constitution. In fact, he sees it as a barrier to his ambitions. That’s why, as a senior law lecturer at the University of Chicago, he lamented the fact that the Warren Court “never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth, and of more basic issues such as political and economic justice in society.” That’s why Obama repeatedly emphasizes that the Constitution stops him from doing things he wants to do — it’s an obstacle to be overcome, not the greatest governmental structure ever created.

The story of John A. Logan, the founder of Decoration Day, later to be known as Memorial Day, is the fascinating tale of a man who was once a racist Democrat and later became one of the favorite generals of Ulysses S. Grant, an ardent Republican. 
General Logan, who later became a senator from Illinois and was the Republican vice-presidential nominee on the ticket with James Blaine in 1884, was a member of the House of Representatives in the Legislature of Illinois in 1853. 


Logan originally introduced a bill prohibiting “the immigration of free persons of color to the State of Illinois, or the setting free of slaves within the limits thereof.” It was passed in 1855, and the bill, with its supplementary enactments, became known as “The Black Laws.” 
Elected as a Democratic Congressman in 1858 and 1860, during his second term Logan denounced “Black Republicans and Know-Nothings.” He later blamed radical abolitionists for John Brown’s attack on Harper’s Ferry in front of Congress: 
Every fugitive slave that has been arrested in Illinois, or in any of the western States – and I call Illinois a western State, for I [am] ashamed longer to call it a northern State – has been made by Democrats. In Illinois the Democrats have all that work to do. You call it the dirty work of the Democratic Party to catch fugitive slaves for the southern people. We are willing to perform that dirty work. I do not consider it disgraceful to perform any work, dirty or not dirty, which is in accordance with the laws of the land and the Constitution of the country.
Yet this same man respected the Union and despised extremists on both sides. He said to those Southerners wanting to secede, “The election of Mr. Lincoln, deplorable as it may be, affords no justification or excuse for overthrowing the republic… We cannot stand silently by while the joint action of extremists are dragging us to ruin.”

At the start of the Civil War, Logan fought at Bull Run in a Michigan regiment, then resigned his congressional seat to become colonel of the 31st Illinois Volunteers. He would later serving under General Grant at the Battle of Belmont (where his horse was killed under him), was wounded at Fort Donelson, and then promoted to brigadier-general in March, 1862. 
When Grant attacked Vicksburg, Logan was the commander of XVII Corps, the first to enter the city; when Vicksburg fell, he became the military governor. 
Logan took over from General Sherman when Sherman left XV Corps and initially commanded the Army of the Tennessee at the battle of Atlanta in 1864. By the end of the war, Logan had become a radical Republican and was elected as a GOP congressman 1867. He would serve in the House until 1871, and then served as a Senator from 1871 until 1877 and again from 1879 to 1886.  
While General Logan, who was known as Black Jack, was in Congress in 1868, he was still the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1868, (a position he held until 1871); on May 5, 1868, he sponsored General Order #11, which designated May 30, 1868, as a day of remembrance:

The 30th day of May, 1868, is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet church-yard in the land. In this observance no form of ceremony is prescribed, but posts and comrades will in their own way arrange such fitting services and testimonials of respect as circumstances may permit.
We are organized, comrades, as our regulations tell us, for the purpose among other things, “of preserving and strengthening those kind and fraternal feelings which have bound together the soldiers, sailors, and marines who united to suppress the late rebellion.” What can aid more to assure this result than cherishing tenderly the memory of our heroic dead, who made their breasts a barricade between our country and its foes? Their soldier lives were the reveille of freedom to a race in chains, and their deaths the tattoo of rebellious tyranny in arms. We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance. All that the consecrated wealth and taste of the nation can add to their adornment and security is but a fitting tribute to the memory of her slain defenders. Let no wanton foot tread rudely on such hallowed grounds. Let pleasant paths invite the coming and going of reverent visitors and fond mourners. Let no vandalism of avarice or neglect, no ravages of time testify to the present or to the coming generations that we have forgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided republic.
If our eyes grow dull, other hands slack, and other hearts cold in the solemn trust, ours shall keep it well as long as the light and warmth of life remain to us.
Let us, then, at the time appointed gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above them with the choicest flowers of spring-time; let us raise above them the dear old flag they saved from dishonor; let us in this solemn presence renew our pledges to aid and assist those whom they have left among us a sacred charge upon a nation’s gratitude, the soldier’s and sailor’s widow and orphan.
It is the purpose of the Commander-in-Chief to inaugurate this observance with the hope that it will be kept up from year to year, while a survivor of the war remains to honor the memory of his departed comrades. He earnestly desires the public press to lend its friendly aid in bringing to the notice of comrades in all parts of the country in time for simultaneous compliance therewith.
Department commanders will use efforts to make this order effective.
By order of
JOHN A. LOGAN, Commander-in-Chief
N.P. CHIPMAN, Adjutant General
Official: WM. T. COLLINS, A.A.G.

Logan is one of three men mentioned in the Illinois State Song, along with Grant and Abraham Lincoln.

U.S. Immigration Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agents have expressed strong concerns over House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and other Representatives pushing for immigration legislation that would legalize the status of America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants. 
In a public statement that will be released Thursday morning but has been provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release, USCIS Council president Kenneth Palinkas warned that Goodlatte (pictured), House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-VA), House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) seem to be following the same pathway that Senate “Gang of Eight” members did, regarding how they are working on immigration legislation. 
“At every step, this administration places obstacles and roadblocks in front of our adjudication officers in their attempts to protect our nation’s security and the American taxpayer,” Palinkas said. “I documented these abuses on more than one occasion with the authors of Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven [S. 744] only to have them ignored. 


“I worry the House may be following a similar path. Media reports reveal that Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman Paul Ryan, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are working to advance proposals to open citizenship benefits to the majority of those here illegally, in combination with proposals to expand visa programs.”
Palinkas warned, too, that any group of “step-by-step” House immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee, at which point they would be combined with the Senate bill and sent to the president for his signature, and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty. That is exactly what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Gang of Eight members Sens. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republicans have said they want to do. 
“These plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency – USCIS – that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card, temporary visa and citizenship applications,” Palinkas said. “Advancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at USCIS would be to invite disaster.”

In his statement, Palinkas cited a recent MSNBC report where Gutierrez said he, Goodlatte, and others have worked on a “compromise” position. That MSNBC report also noted that Goodlatte and other Republicans are working with Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), another Democrat, on a plan to get to conference with the Senate bill. Palinkas stated that USCIS agents have been, like they were from the Senate conversations, excluded from all discussions among House leaders. “Why aren’t USCIS officers being consulted on this ‘compromise’ offer?” Palinkas asked. 
He further expressed concern over Cantor’s GOP DREAM Act, tentatively called the KIDS act. “I am also worried about the arguments being used to support the KIDS Act, one piece of the wider citizenship plan being drafted,” Palinkas said. “Legislators, including Mr. Cantor and Mr. Goodlatte, have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens. But if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?” 
He warned that the KIDS Act may lead down a slippery slope. “This seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries,” Palinkas asserted. “Should we just expect that the next Secretary at DHS will use the arguments we are hearing in the House to enact the next Deferred Action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty?”
Palinkas alleged that, under the Obama administration, USCIS has been riddled with nefarious activities. “At USCIS, our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics, and I hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the House,” he said. 
He finished off his statement by listing several immigration issues he hoped House Republicans would address but have thus far not been willing to: “USCIS adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits. This includes the inability to conduct in-person interviews, the failure of our software system, the lack of training and office space, and pressure to rubber-stamp applications. We have become an approval machine,” “Failure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits,” “Administrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who, under law, are not properly eligible,” “Approval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them,” “A management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals, not US citizens and taxpayers, as the customer. We believe in treating all with respect and always will, but our agency’s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the American people.”

Goodlatte, Ryan, and Cantor are not the only Republicans still pushing to pass an immigration bill in the House of Representatives. According to the Miami Herald, Rep. Steve Southerland (R-FL) said about immigration: “We have to address it. It’s a moral issue.”
In addition, according to Politico, House GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said she thinks immigration should be a top priority for House Republicans this year. 
This coming weekend on Univision, McMorris Rodgers will say that House Speaker John Boehner “over the last few weeks has continued to talk about the importance of the House moving forward on immigration reform. I believe that we have a window here between now and the end of the year and that this is a priority.”
McMorris Rodgers is the fourth highest-ranking member in the House GOP conference.

At the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library, President Obama and former President Clinton took to the podium to praise Bush – and in the process, stump for their version of immigration reform. Trying to leverage Republicans into handing over their principles by suddenly singing odes to the president he labeled the root of all evil, President Obama gushed over Bush “reaching across the aisle to unlikely allies like Ted Kennedy” with regard to his immigration reform effort. 

He continued: “Seven years ago, President Bush restarted an important conversation by speaking with the American people about our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And even though comprehensive immigration reform has taken a little longer than any of us expected, I am hopeful that this year, with the help of Speaker Boehner and some of the Senators and members of Congress who are here today, that we bring it home.”

By using President Bush as a model of executive policy leadership, Obama betrayed what conservatives have known all along: on a vast variety of issues, Bush was closer to Obama’s position than to the conservative position. 

But Obama wasn’t the only occupant of the Oval Office to spontaneously rediscover the greatness of a president so detested by the left that professional Bush-hater Michael Moore once sat in the presidential box with another former President Jimmy Carter. President Clinton used his opportunity at the lectern to praise Bush for his push for immigration reform. “I want to thank you for your efforts, when president, to reform our immigration system, and keep America a nation of immigrants, and I hope that Congress will follow President Obama’s efforts to follow the example you’ve set,” he drawled.

Liberals have accused Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia of being the court’s resident bully, but when two liberal female Suprem Court Justices–Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan–this week tried to browbeat Scalia and lawyers arguing against the Voting Rights Act’s Section 5 pre-clearance requirement, the mainstream media hailed their efforts.  
In oral arguments in Shelby County v. Holder on Wednesday, Scalia made the point that members of Congress have no reason whatsoever to vote against the extension of the Voting Rights Act and that he was “fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless–unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution.”
“I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement,” Scalia said


Scalia’s point was that once a bill has the effect of ensuring that minority candidates get elected from “minority” districts, it is almost impossible, in the political system, to vote against extending the act. 
“Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes,” Scalia said. “I don’t think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act.”
Scalia said there were “certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now” and even the Virginia Senators “have no interest in voting against this” because they would lose votes “if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act.” 

“Even the name of it is wonderful: The Voting Rights Act,” Scalia said. “Who is going to vote against that in the future?”
Sotomayor was not having any of it. 
Sotomayor, as a liberal Washington Post columnist noted, “allowed the lawyer for the Alabama county seeking to overturn the law to get just four sentences into his argument before interrupting him. “
When Sotomayor would not relent, Justice Anthony Kennedy had to say, in remarks directed at her, “I would like to hear the answer to the question.”
When the lawyer started talking, Kagan then interrupted him. And in what was described as a “breach of decorum,” Kagan interrupted Scalia’s questioning to argue with Scalia directly on the bench.

Sotomayor would not let Justice Samuel Alito get a word in as well, and Chief Justice John Roberts had to says, “Justice Alito,” to signal that he had the floor. 
And when the lawyer for Alabama was about to make his concluding arguments, Sotomayor allowed him four words–“Thank you, Chief Justice”–before aggressively interrupting him. 
“Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5?,” Sotomayor asked. 
Before he could explain, she interrupted by saying she had “asked a different question.”
“Do you think Section 5 was voted for because it was a racial entitlement?” Sotomayor asked.
And so it went, and the mainstream media that always describe Scalia as “acerbic” for his aggressive questioning did not judge Sotomayor and Kagan by the same standards. Instead, mainstream media outlets like the Washington Post said Sotomayor’s and Kagan’s performances proved they were “ready for battle.”

Beginning next month, Breitbart News Editor-At-Large Ben Shapiro will be leading the launch of a new project of the David Horowitz Freedom Center: TruthRevolt.org, an activism program designed to “unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public, and devastate their funding bases.” 
The program is being described as a conservative counterpunch to Media Matters, the Obama-linked organization that focuses on silencing conservatives in the media. “For too long, we’ve played by the Marquess of Queensberry rules, allowing the left to stifle the truth and silence truth tellers in the name of their politically correct narrative. Now we’re taking the battle to their home turf — and we will do so aggressively and unwaveringly, every single day. This is just another avenue for applying Breitbart’s fighting spirit to the battle against those who would destroy what America stands for,” Shapiro said. Shapiro will maintain his position and all of his duties at Breitbart News as well.


One of the founders of the New Left in the 1960s, David Horowitz has become an icon in the conservative movement, famed for his deep understanding of the ideology and strategy of the modern left in America. He has led the Freedom Center since its inception as the Center for the Study of Popular Culture in 1988. 
“We could not be more excited to be working with Ben on this project,” Horowitz told Breitbart News. “Andrew Breitbart was a fantastic friend to the Freedom Center and an indispensable warrior in the battle against the anti-America, socialist left and its allies in the universities, the unions and the Democratic Party, and Breitbart News carries on his legacy. We look forward to working with our friends at Breitbart in continuing the fight for America’s future.” 

Horowitz and Breitbart worked together on the film Occupy Unmasked, which looked behind the scenes at the institutional left’s control of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Horowitz’s life’s work in exposing the mendacity of the left was a key part of the film. “Occupy Unmasked shows how closely David and Andrew were on their work of exposing and defeating the forces of the institutional left in America. We consider Ben Shapiro’s leading role at ‘Truth Revolt’ to be nothing more than a continuation of that work,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News.
“Ben Shapiro is a charter member of the Breitbart News ‘Fight Club’ and has been instrumental in the explosive growth the site has experienced over the past 18 months,” said Bannon. “Ben’s ‘voice’ and fighting spirit will also be central in our building out both the site and the company in the years ahead.”

“As was so often the case, Andrew spotted and mentored important conservative voices long before they percolated up to a national level,” said Breitbart News President and CEO Larry Solov. “Ben, who when Andrew met him was a college student at UCLA, is one such voice. Ben has the fight and the intellectual heft to land devastating body blows to the institutional Left and the biased media, which is such a crucial part of what we do here at Breitbart News. We have encouraged Ben to take a leading role with David Horowitz in TruthRevolt to complement his ongoing work at Breitbart News where he will continue to help the grow the company and carry on the fighting spirit and legacy of Andrew Breitbart.”
Shapiro, a mentee and friend of Andrew Breitbart since age 17, became Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News in February 2012. Shapiro, 29, is the New York Times bestselling author of Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America (2013), as well as Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV (2011), Project President: Bad Hair and Botox on the Road to the White House (2008), Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future (2005), and Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America’s Youth (2004). Shapiro began his career as the youngest syndicated columnist in the nation with Creators Syndicate, graduated Harvard Law School at 23, and hosts The Morning Answer on KRLA 870 in Los Angeles. 
Shapiro has been widely praised across the conservative movement. Sarah Palin says that Americans should “consider Ben’s advice about how we must stand up and push back twice as hard against this bullying.” Sean Hannity says to join Ben Shapiro and “fight back!” against liberal bullying. Glenn Beck calls Shapiro a “warrior for conservatism, against those who use fear and intimidation to stifle honest debate. I’ve never known him to back down from a fight.” And Michelle Malkin says Shapiro is “infused with the indomitable spirit of his friend and mentor Andrew Breitbart.” Even the liberal Washington Post, in the aftermath of Shapiro’s devastating destruction of Piers Morgan on national television, conceded that Shapiro is a “foe of extraordinary polemical agility.”

A new poll of Republican voters in Tennessee shows Sen. Lamar Alexander trailing a generic “conservative” challenger by 5 points. The poll, obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, shows a “credible conservative candidate” leading Alexander 49.5-44.9%. While a serious opponent hasn’t yet emerged to challenge Alexander, the poll shows how vulnerable he is in next year’s August primary.
The poll, from Triton Polling, interviewed over 680 Republican voters in the Volunteer State last week. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.7%. 
Around 64% of Republican voters, at least somewhat, approve of the job Alexander is doing, an unsurprising result for a Republican incumbent. Only 27% view Alexander as “conservative,” however. 65% of Republican voters view him as “moderate” or “liberal.” These are the views of Republican voters, 51% of whom identify themselves as “very conservative.” In total, over 85% of Republican voters consider themselves at least somewhat conservative. 


Any incumbent polling in the 40s is in a weak position. Alexander’s position is particularly vulnerable, however, because the base voters view his ideological orientation as distinct from their own. Just over 30% of Republican voters say they will “definitely” vote to renominate Alexander next year. 

After the head-to-head match-up question, which, again Alexander lost, the poll then has several “push” questions, testing possible messages against Alexander. Ranging from “voting with Obama 62% of the time” to “supporting amnesty” for 11 million illegals, each finds around 70% of Republican voters “less likely” to support Alexander. 
Of course, Alexander can’t lose the primary if he doesn’t have a challenger. BEAT LAMAR, a grass roots effort opposed to Alexander’s reelection is holding a candidate forum on August 31st, to begin the vetting process of selecting a conservative opponent for the primary. 
“Everybody has agreed that we need to get behind a single candidate and put our efforts behind someone who can challenge Lamar, debate his public record and basically just push back against the Republican establishment that is trying to bully and intimidate anyone who wants to run against him,” Nashville Tea Party President Ben Cunningham told The Tennessean.  
This latest poll may tempt more seasoned candidates into the race. Ralph Bristol, a popular talk radio host in Tennessee, told Breitbart News, “If a strong, articulate, conservative who has been vetted and tested in lower office were to mount a challenge, and attracted Tea Party support, I’m convinced Lamar is at least as vulnerable as Lindsey Graham or Mitch McConnell, probably more so.”

According to the press release, this coming June the Washinghton Examiner will cease all local coverage to focus instead on “investigative reporting and commentary on issues affecting national legislation and policy.” 
Other than a weekly magazine focusing on “political thought leadership,” the outlet will also end publication (which is now daily) in June and move all its resources online. 


The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple is reporting that as many as 87 layoffs are expected. 

From the press release:
Clarity Media Group today announced that daily newspaperThe Washington Examiner will shift its business model in June, becoming a digital platform and weekly print magazine focused on political thought leadership

The new product, set to launch June 17, will offer news, analysis, investigative reporting and commentary on issues affecting national legislation and policy across a number of key areas. The website will continue to engage millions of visitors nationwide with web-only reporting and commentary throughout the day, complemented by WEX-branded digital and social media. The target readership for the print weekly will be 45,000 government, public affairs, advocacy, academia and political professionals in Washington, DC and state capitals.

Layoffs have also been announced:

Many of the business and editorial positions needed to publish a local daily newspaper are not required as we move to focus on national and political coverage,” said Mr. McKibben. “The employees being laid off should be proud of their achievements in creating The Washington Examiner, and Clarity is grateful for the role they have played in giving the Examiner the strong presence it has in Washington.” 
Among the employees staying to launch and run the new website and publication are editor Stephen G. Smith, executive editor Mark Tapscott, and managing editor of digital Jennifer Peebles. Several other executives on the business side will remain to lead the effort. In addition, 20 positions will be created for the new digital platform and weekly publication.

Two days after President Barack Obama signed a budget compromise that slashed pension benefits for military veterans, retired Marine Jessie Jane Duff blasted Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) for his “outrageous attitude” toward the sacrifices those in the armed forces have made. 
Appearing on Fox & Friends on Saturday, Jessie Jane Duff, who is at the E7 level, said Ryan, who brokered the deal with Sen. Patty Murray (D-WI), does not realize that many active duty military personnel go back to civilian life “broke” and “without a job” and have difficulty getting on equal footing with their “civilian counterparts.” She noted that many veterans have had to leave the armed forces early due to injuries or are suffering from things like PTSD. 
The deal Obama signed includes a provision that would “pare down annual cost of living increases in benefits for military retirees under age 62, saving the government an estimated $6.3 billion over a decade.” What that means is a sergeant first class at the E7 level like Duff who retires at age 42 would lose $72,000 in benefits over a lifetime, according to a Fox News analysis. 


She said that Ryan was “misleading” Americans into believing that veterans were getting a pay increase by using accounting tricks and lingo when in fact they are not. 

Duff, of Concerned Veterans for America, said Ryan was screwing over the types of  veterans who were deployed three times to Afghanistan and Iraq and said it was “outrageous” for Ryan to claim that the benefits were “extremely generous.” She emphasized that not enough people in Congress have served in the military, and they are out of touch with Americans who have served or have family members in the armed forces.
Multiple bills have been introduced in the House to undo the cuts.

Monday, President Barack Obama picked top counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan to become the next head of the CIA. Brennan’s views on radical Islam may concern hawkish Senators who will scrutinize Obama’s choice for CIA chief.

In May of 2010, Fox News reported Brennan defended Jihad as a “legitimate tenet of Islam.”:



The president’s top counterterrorism adviser on Wednesday called jihad a “legitimate tenet of Islam,” arguing that the term “jihadists” should not be used to describe America’s enemies. During a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, John Brennan described violent extremists as victims of “political, economic and social forces,” but said that those plotting attacks on the United States should not be described in “religious terms.” 
He repeated the administration argument that the enemy is not “terrorism,” because terrorism is a “tactic,” and not terror, because terror is a “state of mind” — though Brennan’s title, deputy national security adviser for counterterrorism and homeland security, includes the word “terrorism” in it. But then Brennan said that the word “jihad” should not be applied either. 
“Nor do we describe our enemy as ‘jihadists’ or ‘Islamists’ because jihad is a holy struggle, a legitimate tenet of Islam, meaning to purify oneself or one’s community, and there is nothing holy or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men, women and children,” Brennan said. 

The Washington Times Opinion Page met with Brennan three months later at an editorial board meeting and asked him about his remarks. Brennan asked for the meeting because he objected to an editorial the opinion page had written previously. 

Brennan lost his temper relatively quickly during the question and answer time between him and then-TWT deputy editorial page editor (now with USA Today) David Mastio:

Then TWT Senior Editorial Writer Jim Robbins questioned Brennan about the issue of jihad. Brennan lost his patience at one point and decided to leave the TWT offices without answering any more questions:


TWT: You mentioned jihad, for example, and would you agree with the lesser and greater and lesser jihad framework? I mean, that’s pretty standard.
BRENNAN: Sure, it is…absolutely.
TWT: Can you give me an example of a jihad in history? Like, has there ever been a jihad…an armed jihad anywhere in history? Has it ever existed for real, or is it just a concept?
BRENNAN: Absolutely it has.
TWT: Example?
BRENNAN: I’m not going to go into this sort of history discussion here.
TWT: But it’s important to frame the concept, because we want to say that what al-Qaeda is doing is not jihad. They say it is, and Abdul Azzam has said, in fact, ‘there’s not even a greater jihad.’ That that’s  just a myth–that hadith didn’t  even really happen. That there’s only armed jihad. Ayatollah Khomeini said ‘there is only armed jihad, and it would be useful to be able to characterize or to contrast what they’re doing and what they claim against a legitimate armed jihad in the past.
BRENNAN: I think we’ve finished. I have to get going.

A one-time Democrat Minneapolis mayoral candidate was beaten up by two teen girls at the Mall of America after his iPhone was stolen by a third accomplice, reports say.
Mark Andrew, a former Minnesota Democrat Party chairman and recent losing candidate for  mayor of Minneapolis, was in a Starbucks at the gigantic mall when the incident occurred.
Andrew told the media that he had just finished a call and placed his iPhone 4S on the table when a young man came up to the table, grabbed the phone, and ran. Andrew gave chase immediately but was quickly confronted by two teenaged girls just outside the coffee shop.


One of the girls was armed with a billy club and began to smack Andrew over the head with the stick.
The former politician said he grabbed one of the girls who then gouged her fingernails into his face screaming, “I’m going to kill you! Let me go or I’m going to kill you.”
Andrew says that dozens of shoppers were standing around watching but no one moved to help.

Police arrived soon enough to catch the two girls who initially tried to claim that Andrew attacked them first. Witness told police another story and the two were taken into custody.
The male thief dropped the cell phone in an attempt to get away and Andrew got his phone back.
Police arrested Letaija Shapree Cutler-Cain, 18, and a 17-year-old accomplice whose name was not released because she is a minor.

“In my estimation, these kids are damaged,” Andrew told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. “They have to be held accountable. The juvenile may be too far gone. She was extremely violent. I believe she was trying to kill me, and her actions supported her statement. She was swinging as hard as she could.”
Andrew, who currently owns an environmental marketing firm called GreenMark, received nine stitches for a gash on his head. He also sustained several cuts and abrasions on his face.
“I was targeted because the phone was out and I’m 63 years old, and I’m sure they thought that I was easy pickins,” Andrew said.

An employee of Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), together with a political ally of “Gang of Eight” member Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), will argue Friday that groups opposed to the immigration bill pending in the U.S. Senate are “nativists,” Breitbart News has learned.
ATR’s Josh Culling and Hispanic Leadership Fund (HLF) president Mario Lopez will make the argument on a conference call with mainstream media reporters on Friday at 11 AM EDT. Brad Bailey of an organization called Texas Immigration Studies will join them on the call.
“As the momentum behind immigration reform continues to build and strengthen, an anti-immigrant opposition is working to scuttle and kill immigration efforts in Congress,” those organizing the press call said in a release obtained by Breitbart News (emphasis added):



Many of these groups are deeply associated with John Tanton, the father of the modern anti-immigrant movement, and his network of nativist groups, including the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), NumbersUSA, and the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR).  Over the years, Tanton’s network has extended its reach beyond these groups and to some of the most vocal opponents of immigration reform in Congress. [emphasis added]

The authors of the press release added that Culling, Lopez and Bailey–described in the release as “conservative leaders”–will “dive deep into the inner-workings of John Tanton’s network–including its influence on legislators, its ties to radical population control activists, and its opposition to all immigration (including legal immigration)==and discuss the potential implications of the Tanton network and its involvement in the current immigration debate.”
Culling is ATR’s Government Affairs Manager and is working on Norquist’s behalf to lobby for the passage of the Gang of Eight legislation in the Senate. Lopez is working specifically with Rubio to do the same.
In February, Lopez distributed a paper with his byline around Capitol Hill promoting a similar message to this press release. According to the Washington Post‘s Peter Wallsten, in early February, Rubio and his staff brought Lopez into meetings to encourage him to discredit groups like the Center for Immigration Studies, NumbersUSA, and Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). 

“Rubio’s aides last week brought one of the organizers of the effort to undermine the groups, Mario H. Lopez, a party strategist on Hispanic politics, to a regular meeting of GOP Senate staffers, at which Lopez distributed literature about the groups’ backgrounds and connections,” Wallsten wrote on February 13. “Rubio also raised concerns about the groups’ leanings during a recent conference call on immigration with conservative activists.”
Wallsten noted at the time that Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said the Senator “has argued that some groups that oppose legal immigration should not be considered part of the conservative coalition,” and the “vast majority of Republicans strongly support legal immigration.” Conant has not responded to requests for comment from Breitbart News regarding these remarks, nor has Rubio’s outreach director, J.R. Sanchez, or his chief of staff, Cesar Conda.
Lopez’s ties to Rubio go back to the Florida junior Senator’s early days in national politics. Lopez touted his support for Rubio from the very beginning of his campaign for Senate. “From the moment that the establishment lined up behind Charlie Crist, the Hispanic Leadership Fund stood up to say that Marco Rubio was the type of leader who belonged in the Senate,” Lopez said in a statement the night Rubio was elected to the U.S. Senate.
Further, Lopez has given quotes to news outlets defending the Senate’s immigration bill and specifically Rubio. “People appreciate his kind of leadership and that he’s taking such a thoughtful approach to the immigration issue,” Lopez said of Rubio, according to the National Journal‘s Beth Reinhard. “People appreciate him stepping up.”  
When Lopez previously accused the bill’s opponents of “nativism” earlier this year, Rubio’s team did not publicly rebuke the attacks. According to the Daily Caller’s Neil Munro, Rubio spokesman Conant “downplayed the revelations” that the Senator worked with Lopez on the attack.
Lopez tried to organize a similar conference call on Tuesday but canceled it at the last minute due to what call organizers described as scheduling conflicts. Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn reported before they canceled that call that these figures’ research “draw[s] heavily on” information compiled by the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).
Flynn reported that the original Tuesday call “was scheduled to take place as the Senate was having its first floor vote on the Gang bill.”
The phone number at which they will present this argument on Friday morning at 11 AM EDT is 877-888-4319. The password for the conference call is “TANTON.”

In the wake of Sandy Hook, to justify openly pressuring Congress to restrict our Second Amendment gun rights, the national media frequently pointed to polls showing majority public support for laws that would broaden the scope of background checks. When this law failed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, the media bellyached for weeks about the filibuster and the GOP “obstructionism” that thwarts the will of the people. 
This is not a new kind of media attack against the political right. Ever since Obama assumed the presidency, under the guise of reporting, the media have attacked our “do nothing” congress as dysfunctional and incapable of accomplishing anything. According to the media, a legislative body  “doing nothing” is a huge problem. As the media push to see millions of Democrats legalized through immigration reform, look for this media narrative to explode at the GOP Congress. 


But in reality, we all know that this is wild hypocrisy and that our media see some obstructionists who thwart the will of the people as a lot more equal than others. 
Take for instance, State Senator Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who is now a full-fledged national Media Dahling after her 11-hour filibuster managed to block the Texas Senate from passing laws that would have outlawed abortion after 20 weeks and made abortion clinics safer. 
As I write this, Davis is being hailed all across the national news as a courageous, principled, instant superstar. ABC News, CBS News, The Washington Post… all hailed her obstructionism. Left-wing cable news outlets — CNN and MSNBC — were  just as gushing; as were the morning news shows. 

Anyone familiar with our media knows what the Media Narrative is here — all about gender politics, “reproductive rights,” and any other buzzword that can be utilized to place Wendy Davis astride a white horse, and her political opponents grunting away in that Neanderthal cave known as Texas. 
Naturally, though, most of the national media are ignoring any pertinent facts inconvenient to their agenda. Here are five of them:
1. The Texas Bill will Make Abortion Safer: After the horrors discovered at the clinic of abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell (which the media all-but ignored), many of which were only possible due to the local government’s politically motivated lack of oversight towards abortion clinics, Texas decided to act to make abortion safer. One of the primary objectives of the bill Davis filibustered is to ensure that women who seek a legal abortion are properly cared for. 
This is what is in the bill Davis obstructed, and what some in media are cynically and dishonestly portraying as a move to force abortion clinics to close:
In truth, clinics would close only if they failed to meet new safety standards that have been drawn in response to the horror stories in Philadelphia and Houston. The new rules, as summarized by the Texas Alliance for Life, would have “increase[d] abortion facility safety standards to the level of ambulatory surgical centers to shut down Gosnell-like abortion providers in Texas,” “require[d] the 18,000 RU-486 abortions performed each year be done according to FDA safety standards,” and “require[d] physicians who perform abortions to be qualified to treat life-threatening complications after botched abortions and have privileges at a local hospital.”

2. The American People Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of the American people who, by 48% to 44%, favor what’s in the Texas bill: a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. A full 80% want abortion banned after the second trimester. 
3. A Majority of American Women Back the Ban: Davis also obstructed the will of American women, who support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks at a higher percentage than men, 50% to 44%. 

4. A Huge Majority of Texans Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of Texans; almost two-thirds (62%)  of whom  favor this ban on abortion after 20 weeks. 
5.  Late-term Abortion Ban Is More Popular with Women than ObamaCare: Yep.

We could add a number 6. Abortion is especially horrific after just a few weeks. Here is a fact the media never-ever report on, what the act of abortion really is:
At six weeks, the baby’s brain, spinal cord, and central nervous system are all pretty well formed — in outline at least. By the two-month mark, sensory organs begin to develop and bone replaces cartilage. …
At each of these stages, had the bill been passed, it would have remained legal in Texas to kill the child. The law that Wendy Davis and her fellow “pro-science” acolytes so bravely stood against would have rendered it illegal to kill the child after this point. And when I say kill, I mean kill. I mean break bones, rip apart limbs, crush skulls, drain fluids, still a beating heart, annihilate a brain that is capable of dreaming, and crush a nervous system. I mean: Kill.
Other than winning Barack Obama elections, nothing brings out our media’s bias, dishonesty, and hypocrisy like the issue of abortion. 
My thanks to Charles W. Cooke over at National Review whose superb Tuesday editorial both inspired this post and made it possible.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) will lead a tour of House leaders next week aimed at educating Americans, and each other, about the history and importance of immigration to the United States. The tour, dubbed the “Become America” tour, will feature events and speeches aimed at overcoming opposition to the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, which has stumbled amidst opposition from conservatives.
“The lawmakers will attend events on Ellis Island and at the Museum of Jewish Heritage and the African Burial Ground National Monument, according to an itinerary of the trip,” Politico reported late Wednesday evening. “Leaders will speak at a naturalization ceremony, and the group will also have a breakfast meeting at Gracie Mansion with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a key advocate of immigration reform.”


In 2009, Cantor led a “listening tour” across the nation, bringing Republican leaders to meet with voters to discuss how the party could improve its policies and its political fortunes. The “Become America” tour, by contrast, will be less about listening to voters and more about educating them, since Republican leaders are convinced that the “nativist” faction within their party is the reason they cannot pass immigration reform.

The trip is being coordinated by the non-profit Faith & Politics Institute, and will include members of both parties, such as Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), a persistent advocate of amnesty for illegal immigrants. In April, Guiterrez told a wealthy audience in Chicago that they owed it to the people who “wash the dishes” and “take care of your kids and mow your lawn” to support a path to U.S. citizenship for illegal aliens.
Officially, the “Become America” tour is meant to improve relations among the members of Congress who attend. But given the backdrop of pending immigration legislation, it is also clearly aimed at enabling those members to campaign for passage of a bill–any bill–that satisfies President Barack Obama’s demands. The president has said he will not sign immigration legislation that does not include a path to citizenship.
In June, only 6% of Americans said that immigration was the most important issue facing the country, up from 4% in April, according to Gallup polls. The economy, unemployment, dissatisfaction with government, health care, the federal debt/deficit, and family/moral decline were all listed as more important to Americans than immigration reform. No congressional tours have been planned to address those issues.

Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, now the president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Tuesday that his former colleagues’ largely secret negotiations about immigration reform are troubling. A bipartisan group, dubbed the “Gang of Eight,” has been spearheading immigration reform efforts for months, and no legislative text has been presented to date. When it is presented, Democratic leadership in the Senate and Republican leadership in the House are expected to try to rush the bill through to passage. 
In remarks to the Heritage Foundation’s Blogger’s Briefing on Tuesday, DeMint expressed concern over the behind-closed-doors formulation of legislation, which he knows from experience is actually being written by special interests and staffers. “And the members who are involved with this haven’t seen it or read it. They’re being told what’s going to be in it,” he said.  
“What we believe at Heritage is that this should be an open and transparent process, and it should be step-by-step so Americans can be brought along with what needs to be changed,” DeMint added. “In 1986 we had three million unlawful folks in our country, promises were made on the floor of the House and Senate that if we gave an amnesty this would never happen again. We would secure our borders, we would fix our system.” Neither of these promises were kept.


The Heritage Foundation is currently drafting a peer-reviewed research analysis aimed at discovering the true cost of immigration reform to taxpayers. Details of the Heritage analysis, being conducted by Robert Rector, have not been made public yet. But the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff estimates immigration reform will cost taxpayers trillions more in entitlement and welfare spending. “What Heritage is doing right now and we’re working with some of best guys in the business, scholars like Robert Rector who developed the groundbreaking welfare reform research and policy work and he developed the cost that a lot of us used back in 2007 that helped us realize that this was not free,” DeMint said, referring to Rector’s report “The Fiscal Cost of Low-Skill Immigrants to the U.S. Taxpayer.”

The former Senator drew a distinction between the average taxpayer and representatives of labor and business who are involved in drafting the legislation. “Amnesty is not a free proposition to taxpayers. So we’re going to quantify that cost. I can guarantee you Heritage will be the only organization in the country that is looking at the true cost of a blanket amnesty proposal.”
Americans for Tax Report and the Cato Institute have already attacked Heritage and Rector, claiming that Rector’s 2007 study was flawed. When asked about the preemptive strike, DeMint replied: “Criticism of a report they hadn’t seen yet? Sounds like Washington.”

Senate Budget Committee Republican staff on Thursday released a description of what they claim is a “major flaw” in the immigration reform plan being pushed by the bipartisan “Gang of Eight”–a loophole that will end up being a multi-trillion dollar entitlement spending increase, with the burden falling on American taxpayers. 
“According to what has been publicly reported about the Gang of Eight’s forthcoming immigration bill, there appears to be a major flaw that could allow millions of illegal immigrants to access federal welfare benefits and poverty programs,” the GOP Budget Committee staff wrote in a statement to media. 




“Specifically, there is nothing in the framework to apply federal public charge law to those in the country illegally before they are granted legal status. What this means is that the bill would create an end-run around federal law: individuals in the country illegally could receive legal status without having to demonstrate financial self-sufficiency.”
The statement adds that the Senators in the Gang of Eight “have suggested that cost will not be an issue because amnestied illegal immigrants will not be eligible for certain public aid and welfare programs during a temporary period of probationary legal status (although even this is in growing doubt given the outcome of the relevant vote during the recent consideration of the Senate budget).”

“But, crucially, once this status ends and they become eligible for green cards, those who illegally immigrated will have access to a wide array of public assistance programs,” they wrote. 
“Green card holders are currently eligible for Medicaid, TANF, Supplemental Security Income, child care assistance, food stamps, and a variety of other welfare benefits and public aid programs. The Budget Committee Republican staff estimates that costs could be upwards of $40 billion in 2022 alone, just for Medicaid and Obamacare. The long-term unfunded liability for Obamacare would grow another $2 trillion.”
The statement notes that existing federal law is being overlooked in the rush to pass comprehensive immigration reform: “The net costs would be enormous and only increase once citizenship is granted (and would extend to our nation’s retirement programs as well). Additionally, during their probationary status, there are still a number of ways previously illegal immigrants could draw means-tested public aid for their households–which is the reason why federal law deems all immigrants likely to be a public charge inadmissible to the country regardless of whether they are applying for temporary, permanent, or any other form of legal status.”
Read the whole statement here. 
Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s spokesman Alex Conant responded to that analysis by saying: “Since we don’t yet have a legislative proposal, it’s not possible to come up with anything resembling an accurate calculation about the potential fiscal impact of bipartisan immigration reform. Obviously we share concerns about the potential fiscal impact of changes to our immigration system, which is why we will ask for an in-depth CBO analysis to inform debate around the bipartisan proposal. Senator Rubio has been clear that he will only support legislation that prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving any Federal benefits, and in our negotiations, the Democrats have gone along with that demand – even agreeing to a partial repeal of Obamacare to bar undocumented immigrants benefits. In the long-term, there’s no question that modernizing our broken legal immigration will be very good for our nation’s economy.”

Historian Allen Guelzo, author of the New York Times bestselling book Gettysburg: The Last Invasion, rhetorically asked, “Where is the president? Where is the vice president? They aren’t here,” in an interview with Stephen K. Bannon on the Breitbart News live broadcast of Commemoration of Pickett’s charge on July 3.
During the three days of Gettysburg events, President Obama has been on a tour through Africa, traveling to Senegal, Tanzania, and South Africa.

Guelzo noted that it was mostly just ordinary people who showed up to the Gettysburg memorial, not just Americans but people from around the world who wanted to pay tribute to perhaps the most significant event and moment of sacrifice in our nation’s history. He also noted that the three-day commemoration of the event, July 1-3, was not covered by any of the major networks.


“Where is the Today Show? Where is Good Morning America?” said Guelzo.
Attendees have mostly shown great reverence to the honor and sacrifice of the men who fought on both sides of the battle, according to Guelzo. Most have honored Abraham Lincoln’s dictate in the famous Gettysburg Address: “never forget what they did here.” The “they” that Lincoln referred to were the soldiers in uniform on the battlefield 150 years ago who bled and died for the cause and the country that they believed in. 
Visitors endured torrential rainfall to see the battlefield as tens of thousands came to pay tribute to this special moment in American and world history. 

“One thing I tell people to do is just look around them here. This is a lot of people from all over the world. They are not here like they are at a theme park or a rock concert,” said Guelzo.
Presidents have frequently commemorated the great battles in American history with orations and memorials about the sacrifice of the men involved and the meaning of “American exceptionalism.” For instance, Ronald Reagan made a tribute to the “Boys of Pointe Du Hoc” on the 40th anniversary of D-Day and the beginning of the liberation of Europe.

Guelzo spoke about why he decided to write a book about Gettysburg, even though there have been so many written accounts of it in the past. He said that besides living in Gettysburg and being in close proximity, there were many stories about the battle that have been overlooked. “There were angles of this battle that I haven’t heard told before,” Guelzo explained.
One angle of the battle that Guelzo focused on was the role politics played in the Union Army. Though all were fighting for the Union, the soldiers and generals were divided on how to carry out the war. Peace Democrats, sometimes known as “Copperheads,” believed that the war was being fought for the wrong reasons–that Lincoln and the Republican Party were to blame for the war and secession. Guelzo said that Union General George McClellan, who ran against Lincoln in the 1864 presidential election, “often said he was divided on marching on Richmond or marching on Washington.”
Host Bannon called Guelzo’s book the “definitive” work on the subject, as it details both the minutia of the battle and the politics surrounding it, and it tells an interesting, gripping story about the individuals involved.
Bannon compared the narrative to those of the famous late Civil War historian, Shelby Foote, an incredible storyteller who wrote the three-part The Civil War: A Narrative and became famous to the general public after a performance on Ken Burn’s Civil War documentary.

Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, the new president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, ripped the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” U.S. Senators who are pushing immigration reform during the debut of Breitbart News Sunday with Stephen K. Bannon on Sirius/XM Patriot on Sunday night.
“That’s not the way it should be done, where people go behind closed doors and come up with something that we still haven’t seen,” DeMint said. 
They’re out there selling it. We don’t know what the legislation is but we’re supposed to have an open, democratic process where people can hear the debate, they can see amendments, they can find out what’s in the bill before it’s voted on. So, it’s very frustrating. Obviously, this isn’t the first time this has happened–on the fiscal cliff, and on all these other things they do backroom deals. But I’m tired of it. Frankly, it’s one of the reasons I left the Senate: to try to change things from the outside in. But I know some of these folks involved [in the Gang of Eight] are actually trying to solve a problem, but this is not the way to do it.
DeMint said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) is one of those he thinks is actually trying to solve the problem of illegal immigration but is going about it the wrong way–mainly because the way Washington has evolved is antithetical to transparent and open government.


“Well this is hard because Marco is one of my best friends in the Senate and he’s a great guy, very genuine, and I know he got into this process trying to solve a problem,” DeMint said when asked for his reaction to Rubio’s whirlwind media tour this weekend, in which the Florida Republican appeared on a record seven Sunday shows. 
“He’s just dealing with some folks who have a political objective and it’s very difficult,” DeMint explained. “So, I don’t blame him for trying to sell what’s in it, I’ve just encouraged him from the very beginning to make sure he knows what’s in the legislation and make sure we get what we need out of a new immigration system before we agree to make citizens out of 11 million people.”
The eight senators–Republicans Rubio, Jeff Flake, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham and Democrats Bob Menendez, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, and Michael Bennet–have been meeting in secret since January trying to craft a plan for comprehensive immigration reform. 

White House officials have been involved in the drafting of the legislation, as have representatives from special interest groups like the powerful AFL-CIO  labor union and the big business lobby the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from groups in favor of law enforcement reform, like the president of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents’ union Chris Crane, have been kept out of the discussion, as has anyone opposed to granting amnesty to illegal aliens.
DeMint claimed that the reason those senators keep the deal-making happening in secret is because their plan cannot stand up to public scrutiny. “One of the reasons you do all this behind closed doors is because you don’t want any critics at the party,” DeMint said. 
You want to bring this out and surprise people and do your pre-selling. But, Robert Rector, just about five years ago, when I was helping to fight a similar bill, provided information that was not only credible but it was very provable that there is a high cost to have amnesty. There is a high cost to have unregulated immigration and we need to go ahead. Americans are going to look at this very differently if they know it’s likely to mean they’re going to cut their Social Security and Medicare and raise their taxes which the president seems to be talking about every week.
Heritage Foundation analyst Robert Rector is in the final stages of wrapping up what is expected to be a bombshell analysis breaking down the entire cost of the Gang of Eight’s immigration reform proposal. Preliminary estimates from Rector’s and Senate Budget Committee Republican staff analyses put the Gang of Eight plan at just under $3 trillion in entitlement spending increases, but the final analysis may put the number much higher. 
As the Heritage Foundation continues its work on this, the conservative hallmark has taken heat from several groups around Washington for the forthcoming report–largely because the Heritage report could very well be the poison pill that kills immigration reform.
The libertarian Cato Institute and the GOP establishment-minded Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist’s group, have become unlikely allies, banding together to attack the still-unpublished Heritage analysis from Rector. 

During his media tour this weekend, Rubio himself stabbed at Heritage, saying on Fox News Sunday that Rector’s forthcoming analysis was not accurate. DeMint said he trusts Rector, and added that this report coming out “shouldn’t be controversial.”
“Those who don’t think this has been done correctly should show us their analysis,” DeMint said. “The fact is, there is not any other analysis. Robert Rector has been a scholar for years. He was the one who did the data that actually ended up pushing through welfare reform back in the 1990s,” he explained. “He came out with data that was irrefutable five years ago [on immigration costs], although some are saying it needs to be combined with other types of research.” 
DeMint argued that the report should be a point of open analysis of the plan: “Let’s talk about it. But let’s at least consider the cost. We hope we’ll have our report out within the next week. We’ll be writing and speaking about it a lot but Americans need to understand there’s nothing free about the proposal that’s being talked about.”
As the bill is set to be released on Tuesday, DeMint urged Americans and those in the media to “keep in mind that even if it’s in legislation that does not mean the administration will do it.”
“Over five years we passed into law that there had to be 700 miles of double layer fencing along the volatile areas of our southern border,” DeMint said. “But President Obama has ignored the law.” 
There are only 30 something miles of double layer fencing that have actually been built. The law says that the federal government should support states in the enforcement of federal immigration policy, this administration has decided not to do it. So my point is this: if they promise legal status or citizenship in return for the future fixing of the immigration system, no one can count on that. That’s why this needs to be a step-by-step process where we fix the system first and earn the trust of the American people, then we consider what we’re going to do with those who are already here.
But as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) noted in a Sunday afternoon press release, the Gang of Eight senators admitted throughout their Sunday show blitzkrieg that they want to do amnesty first, then reform the immigration system later.

Left-wing media critic Jeff Cohen has been all over cable news as a contributor, but for a time he worked as a senior producer for MSNBC. Monday, in the wake of the NSA spying scandal, Cohen lashed out at his former employer as the “official network of the Obama White House.” 
This isn’t exactly news to the most of us, but MSNBC’s water carrying for Obama’s massive surveillance state apparently woke Mr. Cohen up:


When it comes to issues of U.S. militarism and spying, the allegedly “progressive” MSNBC often seems closer to the “official network of the Obama White House” than anything resembling an independent channel. With a few exceptions (especially Chris Hayes [10]), MSNBC has usually reacted to expanded militarism and surveillance by downplaying the abuses or defending them.
Had McCain or Romney defeated Obama and implemented the exact same policies, treating whistleblowers like Manning and Snowden as foreign espionage agents, one would expect MSNBC hosts to be loudly denouncing the Republican abuses of authority.
Cohen then names names:

As Snowden arrived in Russia from Hong Kong, MSNBC host Ed Schultz blustered on [12] about Snowden as a “punk” and “coward.” …
MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry has been condemning Snowden [14] by contrasting him with civil disobedients who “love their country” and submit to arrest – while Snowden just wants to “save his own skin [11].” …
MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow has also disappointed. After doing a typically thorough presentation on the force-down of President’s Morales’ plane, she ended her report [17] by expressing displeasure only that Washington had apparently gotten allies to go out on the limb “for nothing.”
For the most part, the left is perfectly okay with MSNBC being a branch of the Obama White House on every other issue. It is only on issues the left disagree with, like this spying business, that brings out the complaints. 
MSNBC is at least being consistent.

The performance of the White House Press Corps during President Obama’s Tuesday afternoon briefing resulted in not a single question that seriously challenged the president or even made him uncomfortable. The hour-long affair was more like a conversation between the like-minded on issues such as the ongoing budget battles and going around Congress by raising the debt ceiling by executive fiat. Anyone who remembers the non-stop confrontation directed at President Bush just a few years ago, by this same group of reporters, would not recognize them today.  
Not a single reporter confronted Obama over the violent rhetoric he and his administration have been using to describe Republicans, or even the fact that as a Senator, Obama voted against raising the debt ceiling — a position he is now describing as dangerous, irresponsible and akin to hostage-taking. 


In fact, in this briefing, Obama used the words “hostage, insane, ransom, nuclear bomb, chaos, disaster.”
Mark Knoller of CBS News is the only reporter that asked the president about the individual compromise spending bills the GOP have passed to fund the parks, veterans, and National Institutes of Health, among other items. Obama swatted away the question with talking points without being challenged on the fact that this veto threat means children suffering from cancer will not get treatment from the NIH.
No reporter even asked about the ObamaCare launch debacle. 

Here are some of the questions that were asked:
— 

Julie Pace of AP
 Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Obviously if Congress does pass a clean CR and a clean debt ceiling bill, those may just be short-term measures. If that happens, does your offer to negotiate with them on issues like health care and spending and deficit reduction still stand in the intervening weeks if they pass measures that are just perhaps six weeks or two months long? 
—
Julianna Goldman.

Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You laid out the economic consequences of default, but if we were to get to that point, would you prioritize and pay bondholders first to maintain the semblance of credit or — rather than Social Security recipients or military servicemen and women? And how would you go ahead and make that determination?
— 
Sam Stein, Huffington Post.

Q: Thank you, Mr. President. With Speaker Boehner so far unwilling to hold a vote on a clean CR, what assurances can you give to those affected by a shutdown who are concerned about an even longer impasse? And how worried are you personally that your preferred solution to this clean CR and sequestration levels may do harm to the nation’s economy and your second-term agenda?
— 
Roberta Rampton.

Q: Thanks. You talked a bit about the hit to credibility around the world that this impasse has caused. I’m wondering what you and your administration are telling worried foreign creditors, China and Japan, who are calling and then asking about whether the United States is going to avoid defaulting on its debts?
—
Ari Shapiro.

Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the Supreme Court, and the term started today with a campaign finance case that sort of picks up where Citizens United left off. You called Citizens United devastating to the public interest, so I wonder if you could weigh in on this latest case.

—
Respected members of the media also described the performance of their colleagues in the press corps as “pathetic.”

18358	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/09/Whip-Team-s-Schock-Majority-of-House-Republicans-support-Cantor-s-DREAM-Act	News	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

In response to a question at a town hall event this week, Rep. Aaron Schock (R-IL) suggested that a majority of House Republicans support granting amnesty through a GOP version of the DREAM Act to young illegal aliens who were brought to America as minors by their parents.
Schock, a member of the whip team led by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, was laying out for constituents his stances on immigration and the House GOP leadership’s plan to deal with the issue later this year. 
“They’re going to move one bill after another dealing with all the various issues that were contained in the Senate bill,” Schock said to the town hall, as seen in video posted on YouTube. “So first, the border security bill should be the first bill that moves in the House. I think that’s going to be an easy bill to pass. It passed out of the Homeland Security Committee with almost unanimous support. Almost every Republican and Democrat on Homeland Security voted for the House border security bill. I think that will pass the House and I think that’s a done deal and that’s done with. Then, you’re going to deal with your high-tech visas and your ag visa worker programs. I think, again, you’re going to get overwhelming bipartisan support on those provisions. I don’t know what the final language is going to look like.”


Schock’s outline of the preliminary plan matches what other member of GOP leadership have said. When he got to the third part of the plan, a DREAM Act which is currently being drafted by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and will eventually be introduced as the KIDS Act, Schock promised there would be a vote on the DREAM Act in the House and promised it would pass with bipartisan support.
“Then you’re going to have a third bill which is going to deal with your DREAM Act kids, those who were brought here illegally by their parents,” Schock said. “I think, again, you’re going to get a bipartisan vote on a House version of the DREAM Act.”  
For any immigration bill to be brought to the floor for a vote in the House, Speaker John Boehner has mandated that it must have the support of the majority of House Republicans–known as abiding by the “Hastert Rule,” meaning no bill will come to the floor for a vote without the support of the majority of the majority. For Schock to not only promise it would pass, but that there would even be a vote on the bill, says that, he–a member of the House GOP leadership’s whip team–knows or believes that a majority of House Republicans support the DREAM Act.

Schock’s office has not responded to Breitbart News’ request for comment in response to this declaration and has not publicly provided a whip list of which Republicans he and the rest of McCarthy’s whip team expect to support the amnesty for young illegal aliens. 
At the town hall this week, Schock also said he supports a comprehensive immigration bill of the sort opposed by House conservatives. He also promised some kind of amnesty, although not necessarily citizenship, for all illegal aliens would come up for a vote in the House.
“The final bill, which will be the most difficult bill, will be dealing with people who are here currently illegally and the path – what is the solution for that,” Schock said. “There are people in the House who think we should find a way to grant them legal status, but not a path to citizenship. There are other people who say no, it has to be a path to citizenship. My mindset is people should come forward, have to pay a penalty and a fine, there should be a probationary period. I am not in the camp that believes people should have to leave the country in order to get in line. I just happen to believe that’s an unrealistic expectation that 11 million people are going to leave. I think it would be destructive to our economy, number one, and number two, many of them do not have a place to go back to even if they wanted to. And number three, I think it adversely affects the self-identification – if self-identifies and knows now they have to leave. I want whatever we pass to work. I want it to be a real reform bill. And I want it to be constructive to the overall process of having more legal immigration down the road.”
In response to a follow-up question from the town hall audience member who prompted Schock’s immigration remarks, Schock added that he thinks “there should be a pathway to citizenship for anybody who wants to come to America.”
“I think they ought to self-identify, I think they should pay back taxes and I think they should be on a legal probationary program,” Schock said. “So, if you break a law, if you break a law, if you do something wrong, you’re thrown out. But, I don’t think there should be anything stopping anyone who self-identifies, pays their back taxes and continues to pay taxes in our country to get in the back of the line with everyone else who wants to become an American citizen. What I don’t support is giving any kind of preferential treatment to people who are here illegally above those people who are outside our borders currently that are waiting in line.”

An assistant U.S. Attorney is Houston has withdrawn from a major prosecution against the Aryan Brotherhood. 
The prosecutor, Jay Hileman, sent an email to one of the Brotherhood’s defense attorneys, informing him that he was no longer on the case. It is widely believed that Hileman withdrew due to concerns and his and his family’s security. 


In the wake of the horrific murders of Kaufman County DA Mike McLelland and his wife, speculation, fueled by the media, has focused on the Aryan Brotherhood, a drug-trafficking crime syndicate with a significant presence in Texas. Police have not named a suspect in the murders and there is no known evidence tying the criminal gang to the murders, but the widespread media speculation of their involvement is having a dramatic ripple effect. 

Hileman was part of a team bringing a major racketeering case against 34 members of the Brotherhood. An important component of the government’s case is based on testimony from a former general of the Brotherhood, who is currently under very tight security. 
The Justice Department will replace Hileman with another prosecutor from Washington, DC. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston released the following statement:

The case currently pending in the Southern District of Texas has been and will continue to be worked by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas in partnership with the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division.

The Aryan Brotherhood has morphed over the years from a prison gang to a major middleman in the drug trade. Whether or not the gang was involved in the recent murders in Kaufman County, it is clear that the most violent elements of the drug trade are now active in Texas.

In a Sunday Washington Times column, Drudge Report editor Joseph Curl takes a look at the difference between how the last two White House occupants, President Bush and President Obama, approached vacationing as president. Curl reveals that unlike Obama, Bush was concerned with public perception (especially during the war in Iraq) and made an effort  to schedule holiday vacations in a way that wouldn’t take others away from their families — even a media that despised him: 
 “I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal,” [President George W. Bush] said years later. “I don’t want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf. I feel I owe it to the families to be in solidarity as best as I can with them.” 


That’s also why Mr. Bush did two other things, without fanfare or praise. First, he never headed home to his Texas ranch until after Christmas, instead going to Camp David for a few days. That way, the hundreds of people revolving around him at all times — White House staff, Secret Service agents, reporters, photographers, all the others — could spend the holiday with their families in and around Washington, D.C. No one ever reported that — until this column.
Second, he rarely attended sporting events, although he once owned a baseball team and was a self-confessed stats junkie. His thinking there was the same: If he went to a baseball game (right down the street from the White House), his mere presence would mean hours and hours of extra security for fans.
Conversely, Obama, who never has to worry  about the media turning against him (including lying for weeks about a terror attack in Libya), doesn’t give a damn about public perception — not during a recession; not even during a time when sequester cuts are being blamed for the closing of White House tours and airport control towers:

How else to explain the nonstop vacations the pair keep taking during what Mr. Obama calls the “worst financial crisis since the Great Depression”? In 2013, the First Family has already enjoyed three vacations — that’s one a month. (Sorry, Joe America, you might have to forget your week at the beach again this year, but make sure you get those taxes in on time!)
Curl closes the piece (which you will want to read in full) by making the point about how much this juxtaposition tells you about Obama. And indeed it does. But I would add that it also reveals just as much about our media.

18386	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/12/05/Softball-Obama-Matthews	News	1	None	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
With President Obama’s approval ratings sinking thanks to the failing Obamacare rollout and the unpopular nuclear deal with Iran, Obama broke the media emergency glass to access the MSNBC host Chris Matthews. Matthews, who has compared Obama to Jesus and Henry V, and said that he was “the perfect American,” tossed Obama softball after softball, to which Obama gave stock answer after stock answer.

Matthews began by asking Obama about young people not signing up for health insurance. Obama said they should. Obama then made this stunning statement: “Sometimes on your station, MSNBC, I’ve been blasted for being too willing to compromise.” This nonsense passed without question from Matthews, who obviously was not in the mood to blast the president with anything but waves of hot love.

Matthews asked a question about National Security Agency surveillance. President Obama defended NSA activities, stating, “The NSA actually does a very good job about not engaging in domestic surveillance, not reading people’s emails.” He then added, wrongly, that outside of American borders, the NSA was “not constrained by laws.”

But that did not prompt a follow-on from Matthews. Instead, Matthews played a clip of John F. Kennedy speaking at American University, obviously attempting to link Obama with JFK. “”How do we get back to that confidence that we can solve our man-made problems and other problems?” Matthews drooled. Obama responded, “I have that confidence,” explaining that America was “on the brink of energy independence,” and stating that America is “still the envy of the world.” 
Then Obama turned to the attack, stating that “Congress” is the big problem, since it “spends too much time worrying about the next election and not enough time worrying about the next generation.” Which part of the Congress? Obama explained: “The challenge we’ve got is we’ve got a faction of the Republican Party that sees compromise as a dirty word, that has moved so far to the right that it would be difficult for a Ronald Reagan to win the nomination of the Republican Party at this point.”

Matthews never uttered a word of disagreement. Instead, with all the subtly of a sledgehammer, Matthews goaded Obama on: “You’ve got three and a half more years to deal with this situation.”
And Obama took the bait, stating that in order for big things to happen, he had to have a Congressional majority. “The only thing that’s stopping [progress on issues like immigration] at this point is…a faction in the House Republican Party that is resistant,” Obama stated. He added that he believes that Republicans have “got to be embarrassed.”
Matthews, in full-on history professor mode, then turned to a 1964 poll showing that Americans believed that the federal government did the right thing most of the time. With forlorn hope in his eyes, he asked Obama, “What’s going to arrest that decline in that faith in you doing the right thing?” Obama solemnly intoned, “the cynicism and the skepticism is deep.” 

Which brought the interview to the Bash Bush segment. Talking about the glories of the federal government, Obama praised the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Craig Fugate. “He’s really doing a good job, unlike his predecessor,” Matthews agreed, apparently referring to former FEMA head Michael Brown. Obama, picking up on the Bush-bashing, referred back to President Bush’s infamous statement that Brown had done a “heckuva job” in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina: Fugate, Obama said, was “doing a heckuva job.” That meant, Obama continued, that the federal government was great at doing things, but that the media never covered those wonderful accomplishments – an odd contention given the media’s nonstop coverage of the Obama administration’s handling of Hurricane Sandy just before Election 2012.
But that wasn’t Obama’s point. He wanted to argue that the media wasn’t paying attention to FEMA but was paying attention to the IRS scandal, in which the IRS targeted Tea Party 501(c)(4) organizations. The IRS had targeted those organizations, Obama explained, for “bureaucratic reasons,” and “suddenly everybody is outraged.” Matthews nodded, “501(c)4 law is tricky to begin with.” 
Obama continued, “There are a couple million people working for the federal government…Someone at this very moment is screwing something up.” But Obama said that he’d try to rein in all of these nefarious actors: “I have to consistently push…how can we do things better?” He then called for “reorganiziation” of the government, saying that it was designed in 1934-35. 
In completing his longwinded answer about why Americans had lost confidence in government, Obama blamed Ronald Reagan, who said government was the problem. That notion, Obama said, was damaging to the country: “Government’s not somebody else. Government’s us.”

Smiling warmly, Matthews then asked, “Let’s talk about the chief executive, you.” He continued, “There’s all kinds of theories about how to be president…There should have been a CEO assigned by you…to oversee the rollout of healthcare.” He finished, “It seemed like there wasn’t a strong, top-down authority structure from you…What is your system?”
Obama said that the failure of Obamacare’s rollout was an outlier. The government, he insisted, had worked beautifully in all of its other aspects under his administration.:”It is important to distinguish between this particular project, where it is obvious that we needed additional controls in place because it didn’t deliver on time the way we wanted, and how we’ve managed incredibly complex problems over the past five years.” Obama then said he’d hold “every cabinet member accountable” – although apparently not Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – and then laughably added, “I have an open door policy where I want people to be bringing me bad news on time so we can fix things. The challenge I think we have going forward is not so much my personal management style…it actually has to do with what I referred to earlier. We have these big agencies.” That open door policy has meant that according to the White House, Obama was out of the loop on the IRS scandal, the DOJ’s targeting of journalists, the security situation in Libya, and every other scandal undergone by the administration.
Then the interview got truly bad. Matthews read a Twitter question: “What can we do to stop #GOP rigging the vote state by state to disenfranchise our voters & destroy our democracy?” 
Without challenging the premise of the question, Matthews then stated, “Everybody knows the game, Republicans often admit the game.” Obama answered by blasting voter ID laws. 
Just before the commercial break, Obama wrapped up in typical Obama style: he blamed everyone else. “You may agree with me or disagree with me, but don’t make the mistake of thinking it all ends with me,” he said. 
MSNBC then cut to break by playing a segment from Obama’s 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention in a blatant effort to breathe some magic into the wilting commander-in-chief.
Back from break, the awkward date continued. MSNBC played a clip of Obama saying he would run for president in 2007, followed by a clip of a slightly-less-frazzled Matthews, who proclaimed, “This is going to be remembered as a great day in American politics.”
Fast forward six years. Matthews hadn’t changed. He proceeded to ask Obama about his newfound focus on income inequality – and then he said that as a Roman Catholic, he found Obama’s redistributionism “So resonant with what the Holy Father…would say.” 
Obama then blessed the Pope, stating, “I think Pope Francis is showing himself to be an extraordinarily thoughtful and soulful messenger of peace and justice.”
Finally, Obama turned to the role of government. As it turns out, Obama thinks the government can do virtually everything. Whether “creating the internet” or “curing diseases,” Obama stated, “there are some things we do better together, and we should take pride as a nation in our ability to work in concert.” He said that all of America’s future rested on American buying into the notion of government handling all of our big problems: “In fact the big challenges we have…those are not things that Chris Matthews or Barack Obama can solve for ourselves. By necessity we’re going to have to do those together. If we can at least agree on that…then we can figure out the specific policies and that’s where we can compromise or negotiate.” He then added, as an afterthought, “I won’t compromise” regarding the implementation of Obamacare. 
Matthews, thoroughly pleased with how the interview was going, asked President Obama to answer “a little question you might not like to answer”: Hillary or Biden? Obama demurred, but stated that Biden would “go down in history as one of the best vice presidents ever.”
With the interview winding down, Matthews asked Obama the truly substantive question Americans were dying to hear answered: what’s the most important quality in being president? Obama gave his stock answer: “A sense of connection with the American people.” He then compared himself to Lincoln, FDR, Truman, and Kennedy, and added, “The interesting thing about now having been president for five years is it makes you humble as opposed to cockier about what you as an individual can do. You recognize that you’re part of a sweep of history, and your job is to push the boulder up the hill a little bit.”
Matthews finally asked Obama about running for office, praising him to the skies for sticking to politics after losing a Congressional race in 2000. “How many kids here want to go into politics. Are they right?” Matthews asked.
That essay question allowed Obama to wax poetic: “It continues to be a way to serve that I think can be noble. It’s hard. It can be frustrating, you have to have a thick skin.” He then said that he understood why Americans would join a nonprofit or start a business, noting, “We’re not completely government centered.” Then he said that he found it rewarding when people came up to him and said, “My kid’s alive because you passed that healthcare bill.” Really. “It’s pretty hard to get greater satisfaction than that,” he concluded.
The panel of Joy Reid, Howard Fineman, and David Corn then attempted to spin Obama back to the halcyon days of 2007, before he was president, with all three labeling Obama warm, open, and idealistic. Perhaps the only honest moment came from Fineman, who observed that Obama had now moved “from Superman to Sisyphus.”

The New York Times was quick to report on the edited Mother Jones “secret” video of Mitt Romney speaking at a fundraiser back in May, and they were quick to do so in a straightforward way. Their original story has been wiped from their website and replaced with one dripping with left-wing spin to the point you’d think it was a press release from the Obama campaign. 
Unfortunately for the Times, there are a lot of websites that republish their work the minute it’s posted. That means it lives forever, even after they’ve killed it.


It’s unfortunate for them, but very fortunate for those of us who like to expose how media bias works. 
The original piece contains this paragraph:
Romney told reporters Monday night that his remarks were “not elegantly stated” and were “spoken off the cuff.” But he says Obama’s approach is “attractive to people who are not paying taxes.”

In the new piece that paragraph reads like this:
Mr. Romney addressed the video, somewhat awkwardly, at a fund-raiser Monday night in Costa Mesa, Calif., summoning reporters with a few moments’ notice to walk through the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, which was filled with guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.
The first one simply conveys facts, the second one adds commentary designed to paint a picture of bumbling with “somewhat awkwardly” and of elitism with “guests sipping drinks at tables elegantly draped in blue cloths.” 
But it doesn’t end there.  
The original reads:

Jim Messina, Obama’s campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was “shocking” that Romney would “go behind closed doors” to describe nearly half of the country in such terms.
Again, straightforward reporting. But the new version reads quite differently:
Mr. Romney, who has been under fire for releasing only two years of his tax returns, was quickly attacked by the Obama campaign. Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, said in a statement Monday evening that it was “shocking” that Mr. Romney would “go behind closed doors” to describe nearly half of the country in such terms. 
Weird how, in a story that has absolutely nothing to do with tax returns, the Times feels the need to editorialize about Romney’s tax returns. The only people “firing” at Romney for his tax returns are on the payroll of the Obama campaign and “journalists” who write things like this that read as if they’re padding their resume for a position in a second term. 
The new version of the story has nearly double the words as the original and is full of editorializing of the sort listed above. The original reads like a news story. 
In a tale of two stories, the former “new” version is committed to attacking Mitt Romney and reelected the President, the latter is simply committed to conveying facts. That’s probably why the former has been scrubbed from the Times‘ website and latter exists.

One of the most important undercurrents of the Civil War was the role the strong Democratic minority played in criticizing Lincoln’s Republican administration, the Radical Republican Congress, and the war effort in general. But Democrats did not provide a united front or bulwark of opposition to the government and the Union cause, rather far from it. 
In fact, it was in large part the contentious, but ultimately loyal, Democratic opposition that put pressure on Republican President Abraham Lincoln and his administration to succeed and make wise military and political decisions. Dissent was an important factor, but ultimate loyalty to the broken nation and the Union cause was the highest form of patriotism.


While some Democrats focused on the perceived civil rights abuses of the administration, others became the most militant flag-wavers, joining the military en masse. These “Jacksonian” Democrats saw the confrontation between the Union and the Confederacy as a battle between “patriots and traitors,” as Illinois Democrat and famous Lincoln debate partner Stephen A. Douglas said just before the war. Staunch and enduring patriotism was at the heart of the 19th century Jacksonian creed. 
Gods and Generals director Ron Maxwell explores some of the Northern Democrat opposition in his new movie, Copperheads. Copperheads were generally the “peace” democrats during the war who were highly suspicious of the cause, but the movie’s lead character, an upstate New Yorker named Abner Beech, is not among their number. He is more closely aligned with the Jacksonians, as were many of the country-dwelling folks of that period.
The film explores how the war was a battle for the American soul, a soul that remained very much divided during and after the war.

Notable antebellum America historian Eric McKitrick explained in Political Parties in American History: 1828-1890 how this energetic opposition, instead of weakening the Union, gave it an edge over the one-party rule of the Confederacy. McKitrick said, “…the presence of an organized party of opposition, performed a variety of functions in mobilizing and managing the energies needed for sustaining the Union war effort.”
McKitrick continued, “The absence of such a system in the Confederacy seems to have more than a casual bearing on the process whereby Southern energies, over and beyond the course of military events, became diffused and dissipated.”
The collapse of the Whig Party in the 1850s, initiated by the Compromise of 1850 and made complete by the ruinous Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, is well-known, but the disintegration of the Democratic Party had equally profound consequences for the Union.
In the period just before the war, there was a massive upheaval in party politics, devastating the old battle lines between the Democrats and the Whigs. Former free-state Whigs and Democrats started to band together under the “Republican” banner in general opposition to the slave states, or the “Slave Power” as some called it. Early Republican Party formation started in the West where party ties were weakest and spread to the more calcified East.
Old fights over economics and the size and scope of government moved to the sidelines as the Union neared complete dissolution.

For instance, the famous editor of the New York Tribune and former Whig turned staunch anti-slavery Republican, Horace Greeley, actually tried to enlist Abraham Lincoln’s future rival, Stephen A. Douglas, in the Republican cause to run for Illinois senator in 1858.
Douglas declined, but like many of the other Jacksonian Democrats, when he realized that pro-slavery forces had been unleashed and that America was rapidly becoming a slave republic, he responded with brutal, militant ferocity. As pro-slavery radicals like George Fitzhugh of Virginia were advocating slavery for 19 out of 20 people, black and white, and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision essentially made slavery legal everywhere, many like Douglas began to realize that the free-states were utterly surrounded and the foundations of the country were being upended. 

Other Jacksonians took a similar track. Francis Preston Blair, one of the most prominent members of President Andrew Jackson’s “Kitchen Cabinet” and editor of the famous Jacksonian organ, the Washington Globe, left Democrats to form the Republican Party.
Though he was aging and sickly, and opposed many of the old Whig economic ideas of industrial development and tariffs that Lincoln supported, Blair became a chief Lincoln adviser when the administration needed him most. 
When Blair’s son informed him that Lincoln might pull his troops out and withdraw from Fort Sumter, he marched over to the White House. He told Lincoln that “It would be treason to surrender Sumter,” and that recognition of secession’s constitutionality would lead to his “impeachment.”

Contrary to popular belief, it was Blair and not Lincoln that contacted General Robert E. Lee to head the Union Army. He, like many Democrats at that time, felt a deep connection to the South but felt so strongly about the preservation of the Union that he was willing to wage terrible war against it once backed into a corner.
In contrast, Greeley, who absolutely believed slavery was abhorrent and wished to end it forever, said of the South, “Let them go in peace.”
Not so with Jacksonian Democrats. 
Once Fort Sumter had been attacked in April of 1861, most Northern Democrats rallied to the cause. Historian Jean H. Baker said in Affairs of Party: The Political Culture of Northern Democrats in the Mid-Nineteenth Century, “Overnight a singular change occurred. Antiwar in April, thousands of Northern Democrats were volunteering by May. If supporting the South had been a badge of nationalism in 1860, fighting the Confederacy became one by late 1861.”
Baker continued, “…like revivalists in evangelical assembly, young men converted from civilian to soldier, from Democrat to first Infantry, by signing the muster rolls while neighbors cheered and the band played ‘America.'”
One Democratic newspaper stated, “Now none but traitors deserving the gibbet will be found sustaining the Southern rebels. Those who are not for the Stars and Stripes are against them.”
This ethic has continued to resonate with Americans long after the Civil War.
Ronald Reagan displayed this Jacksonian attitude during the Cold War when he ditched the policy of détente and drew a firm line of opposition to the Soviet Union.
Reagan called the USSR an “Evil Empire,” pointing to the depravities of life under Communism. Americans, notably the “Reagan Democrats,” not only drew a line in the sand, but took aggressive action to build up the military and wage numerous small-scale wars as a part of the “Reagan Doctrine.”
Most recently, the atrocities committed on September 11, 2001, in which thousands of Americans were brutally killed by those who held a radical, anti-American Islamist ideology, prompted Americans to go on the warpath. Attacking the symbols of American power, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, were clear examples that the enemy was attempting to upend the foundations of American civilization. 
Though this clash is clear to Americans with a Jacksonian outlook, it has been muddled by those with a different philosophy.
It must be noted that even though many Jacksonian Democrats initially opposed the conflict with the slave states in the lead up to the Civil War, were at best ambivalent and sometimes outwardly hostile to abolition, and deeply disliked President Lincoln, it was ultimately the swelling of Union ranks with these rough men of iron-will that preserved the United States as one nation and put an end to the institution of slavery. 
Jacksonians turn to war when they believe that vital American interests are at stake and against enemies that they believe threaten American liberties and the foundations of the country. Once set off, Jacksonians see conflict ending in total victory or defeat with little in the middle. A simple, but important set of principles to understand whenever American leaders decide to let slip the dogs of war.

18513	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/30/Rand-Paul-If-Boehner-passes-amnesty-it-will-be-the-final-thing-he-does-as-Speaker	News	1	None	None	Neutral	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said on Laura Ingraham’s radio program that House Speaker John Boehner’s speakership is in jeopardy if any form of amnesty, such as the Senate’s immigration reform bill, becomes law.  
“I’m worried about conference,” Paul said Friday, according to Roll Call. “The only way to avoid a problem with conference is for the speaker of the House to say we are not going to conference, and we will not allow a vote on anything coming out of conference that resembles the Senate bill, and if there were a much more limited bill that emphasizes border security first, that we would do that.”


“Conference” refers to a legislative process wherein after the House passes its own immigration bill, it will enter negotiations with Senate leaders and even the White House to reconcile the differences between the two chambers’ bills. Conservative lawmakers fear that in conference, Boehner would allow Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to include a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the final law submitted to President Barack Obama.

Paul asserted that if Boehner passes anything like the Senate bill, conservatives in the House will more than likely drive him out of office.
“If he allows something to pass out of conference that looks anything like the Senate bill and is passed with a majority of Democrats, I think that will be the final thing he does as speaker,” Paul said. “So, I think he knows that, and I think he’s going to be very cautious, and I hope he will defend us on this and not pass something that looks like the Senate bill.”
Boehner has agreed that any bill, or conference committee report, that would be voted on would need the support of the majority of House Republicans before receiving a vote in the House. But Boehner has not agreed to kill the Senate bill once and for all by saying no House immigration bill, or group of bills, would be allowed to go to conference with it.
According to The Hill, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), the GOP’s most recent vice presidential candidate who with Mitt Romney lost to President Obama almost a year ago, is working with the Chamber of Commerce to finalize a deal on immigration legislation.
"
18514	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/17/Paul-Ryan-makes-pitch-for-minority-voters-for-GOP-after-failing-to-turn-out-base-in-2012	News	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
After failing to turn out the base as Mitt Romney’s Vice Presidential pick in the 2012 elections, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) told the Des Moines Register in Iowa that he thinks the GOP should focus on going into minority communities to seek votes.
“Go into inner cities, go into minority communities,” Ryan said in an interview with the state paper. “Go into communities that have not seen or heard from Republicans in a long time.” Ryan was in Iowa on Saturday for a fundraiser and birthday event for the state’s GOP Gov. Terry Branstad.


Ryan and Romney lost the presidential election last year by failing to turn out the GOP base. As Byron York pointed out in the Washington Examiner in May of this year, six months after the election, the GOP duo would have needed to get 73 percent of the Hispanic vote to have won the election by solely focusing on Hispanics–when Republicans have not, at any point in history, been able to even break 45 percent of the Hispanic vote. George W. Bush got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004, the highest a Republican has ever gotten in a nationwide election.
“In 2012, President Obama famously won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote to Mitt Romney’s 27 percent,” York wrote. “If all other factors remained the same, how large a percentage of the Hispanic vote would Romney have had to win to capture the White House? What if Romney had won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, the high-water mark for Republicans achieved by George W. Bush in 2004? As it turns out, if Romney had hit that Bush mark, he still would have lost, with 240 electoral votes to 298 for Obama.”
York presented several other “unrealistic” scenarios, such as Romney and Ryan winning 50 percent or 70 percent of the Hispanic vote–only to show that the numbers prove if they were somehow miraculously able to pull off such a feat, they still would have lost the election. York noted that Romney and Ryan would have needed 73 percent of the Hispanic vote to beat Obama–if all the other numbers, such as the low GOP base turnout, stayed the same.

“The most serious of those problems was that Romney was not able to connect with white voters who were so turned off by the campaign that they abandoned the GOP and in many cases stayed away from the polls altogether,” York wrote. “Recent reports suggest as many as 5 million white voters simply stayed home on Election Day. If they had voted at the same rate they did in 2004, even with the demographic changes since then, Romney would have won. Likewise, the white vote is so large that an improvement of 4 points — going from 60 percent to 64 percent of those whites who did vote — would have won the race for Romney.”
Nonetheless, Ryan still believes somehow that pushing certain policies like amnesty that pander to the left will somehow win the GOP minority votes. Ryan is currently in the process of writing a bill that would legalize the status of America’s at least 11 million illegal aliens.
As part of his interview with the Des Moines Register, Ryan praised New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie’s re-election as evidence that the GOP can win minority communities in blue states. 
“Absolutely,” Ryan answered when asked by the local paper if lessons can be learned from Christie’s re-election in New Jersey. “It shows that we have to go and campaign in non-traditional areas, non-traditional neighborhoods, and by showing up not just a few months before the election, but by being in these communities all year round, that will make a difference.”
“What Chris’s victory shows is that conservatives can win blue states if we focus on being inclusive and campaigning in every facet of this country, we can open up the electoral map, far more than where it has been,” Ryan added.
As part of the interview, Ryan pushed harder than he has in a long time in public for amnesty as well. Ryan said, in the words of the Des Moines paper, that pushing for amnesty for illegal aliens is “crucial.”
“When we get to it [amnesty], it’s not extremely clear,” Ryan said. “But there are many of us who still would like to see it happen in a step-by-step process before the end of the year. But if that doesn’t occur, we’ll still keep moving for it because, again, the status quo is unacceptable.”
Ryan is at odds with the entire rest of the House GOP leadership–and the GOP base–when it comes to immigration legislation. House Minority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has publicly promised there will be no immigration legislation voted on in the House of Representatives for the rest of 2013, something Ryan does not agree with as evidenced by this interview he did with the Des Moines paper. McCarthy, House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), House Speaker John Boehner, House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and scores of other Republicans and conservatives have publicly come out in opposition to ever going to a conference committee with the Senate “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Ryan is on record as being supportive of a conference committee, and refused to join the rest of House Republicans save for a few outliers who also support amnesty in denouncing any effort to save the Senate bill via conference after Speaker Boehner publicly promised last week there would never be a conference.
Ryan has taken a beating in polls for his support for amnesty. Ryan and Senate Gang of Eight GOP frontman Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)–who has since expressed regret for supporting the Senate bill and publicly opposed conference committee in a Breitbart News exclusive—combined for less than 10 percent of the total support from GOP base voters in the straw poll at the recent Values Voter Summit. Those GOP base voters are the same people who York noted did not show up to vote for Romney and Ryan at the polls last November–the real reason the GOP lost its shot to unseat incumbent President Barack Obama in November 2012.

Earlier this year, Phil Mickelson suggested that he may have to move out of California because of the state’s confiscatory tax rate. He later was pressured to walk back some of his remarks, but after winning the Open Championship on Sunday–and earning $1.43 million–Mickelson may have to reassess his options. 
Mickelson backed off after complaining about the California state tax rate being raised to 13.3 percent for those earning over $1 million, which occurred when voters approved of Proposition 30 in November of 2012. ESPN reported regularly that Texas’s zero percent state income tax rate, for example, may have had a role in pushing Dwight Howard to ultimately sign with the Houston Rockets (see Breitbart Sports’ table of state taxes before California’s hike). Forbes Magazine is now reminding Mickelson that California will benefit greatly from Mickelson’s British Open win Sunday. Tiger Woods is another athlete who has publicly said he moved out of California, where he was born and raised, because of the state’s high tax rate. 
One report suggests Mickelson may pay over 60 percent of his $1.43 million out in taxes to the UK, IRS and California. As Breitbart Sports reported, athletes are taxed based on where they earn the money (away games go to the state in which a game was played, etc.), but whether California collects their 13.3 percent of the $1.43 million since Mickelson decided not to leave the state is small change compared to what California may get from him after the win in Scotland.


Forbes points out the that the bigger impact of Mickelson’s win will be in extending and potentially even expanding the $36 million a year he gets from endorsements from companies such as KPMG, Barclays, and Callaway. If the British Open win increases his sponsorship by just $2 million, California would receive $5 million in state taxes from him.
The $5 million tax payoff the state of California could receive from Mickelson almost matches the $5.8 million the state could continue to keep after Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson was able to stop the Kings from moving to Washington, where the players would have kept the $5.8 million a year even under their relatively low $44 million team salary.

One of the most important undercurrents of the Civil War was the role the strong Democratic minority played in criticizing Lincoln’s Republican administration, the Radical Republican Congress, and the war effort in general. But Democrats did not provide a united front or bulwark of opposition to the government and the Union cause, rather far from it. 
In fact, it was in large part the contentious, but ultimately loyal, Democratic opposition that put pressure on Republican President Abraham Lincoln and his administration to succeed and make wise military and political decisions. Dissent was an important factor, but ultimate loyalty to the broken nation and the Union cause was the highest form of patriotism.


While some Democrats focused on the perceived civil rights abuses of the administration, others became the most militant flag-wavers, joining the military en masse. These “Jacksonian” Democrats saw the confrontation between the Union and the Confederacy as a battle between “patriots and traitors,” as Illinois Democrat and famous Lincoln debate partner Stephen A. Douglas said just before the war. Staunch and enduring patriotism was at the heart of the 19th century Jacksonian creed. 
Gods and Generals director Ron Maxwell explores some of the Northern Democrat opposition in his new movie, Copperheads. Copperheads were generally the “peace” democrats during the war who were highly suspicious of the cause, but the movie’s lead character, an upstate New Yorker named Abner Beech, is not among their number. He is more closely aligned with the Jacksonians, as were many of the country-dwelling folks of that period.
The film explores how the war was a battle for the American soul, a soul that remained very much divided during and after the war.

Notable antebellum America historian Eric McKitrick explained in Political Parties in American History: 1828-1890 how this energetic opposition, instead of weakening the Union, gave it an edge over the one-party rule of the Confederacy. McKitrick said, “…the presence of an organized party of opposition, performed a variety of functions in mobilizing and managing the energies needed for sustaining the Union war effort.”
McKitrick continued, “The absence of such a system in the Confederacy seems to have more than a casual bearing on the process whereby Southern energies, over and beyond the course of military events, became diffused and dissipated.”
The collapse of the Whig Party in the 1850s, initiated by the Compromise of 1850 and made complete by the ruinous Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, is well-known, but the disintegration of the Democratic Party had equally profound consequences for the Union.
In the period just before the war, there was a massive upheaval in party politics, devastating the old battle lines between the Democrats and the Whigs. Former free-state Whigs and Democrats started to band together under the “Republican” banner in general opposition to the slave states, or the “Slave Power” as some called it. Early Republican Party formation started in the West where party ties were weakest and spread to the more calcified East.
Old fights over economics and the size and scope of government moved to the sidelines as the Union neared complete dissolution.

For instance, the famous editor of the New York Tribune and former Whig turned staunch anti-slavery Republican, Horace Greeley, actually tried to enlist Abraham Lincoln’s future rival, Stephen A. Douglas, in the Republican cause to run for Illinois senator in 1858.
Douglas declined, but like many of the other Jacksonian Democrats, when he realized that pro-slavery forces had been unleashed and that America was rapidly becoming a slave republic, he responded with brutal, militant ferocity. As pro-slavery radicals like George Fitzhugh of Virginia were advocating slavery for 19 out of 20 people, black and white, and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision essentially made slavery legal everywhere, many like Douglas began to realize that the free-states were utterly surrounded and the foundations of the country were being upended. 

Other Jacksonians took a similar track. Francis Preston Blair, one of the most prominent members of President Andrew Jackson’s “Kitchen Cabinet” and editor of the famous Jacksonian organ, the Washington Globe, left Democrats to form the Republican Party.
Though he was aging and sickly, and opposed many of the old Whig economic ideas of industrial development and tariffs that Lincoln supported, Blair became a chief Lincoln adviser when the administration needed him most. 
When Blair’s son informed him that Lincoln might pull his troops out and withdraw from Fort Sumter, he marched over to the White House. He told Lincoln that “It would be treason to surrender Sumter,” and that recognition of secession’s constitutionality would lead to his “impeachment.”

Contrary to popular belief, it was Blair and not Lincoln that contacted General Robert E. Lee to head the Union Army. He, like many Democrats at that time, felt a deep connection to the South but felt so strongly about the preservation of the Union that he was willing to wage terrible war against it once backed into a corner.
In contrast, Greeley, who absolutely believed slavery was abhorrent and wished to end it forever, said of the South, “Let them go in peace.”
Not so with Jacksonian Democrats. 
Once Fort Sumter had been attacked in April of 1861, most Northern Democrats rallied to the cause. Historian Jean H. Baker said in Affairs of Party: The Political Culture of Northern Democrats in the Mid-Nineteenth Century, “Overnight a singular change occurred. Antiwar in April, thousands of Northern Democrats were volunteering by May. If supporting the South had been a badge of nationalism in 1860, fighting the Confederacy became one by late 1861.”
Baker continued, “…like revivalists in evangelical assembly, young men converted from civilian to soldier, from Democrat to first Infantry, by signing the muster rolls while neighbors cheered and the band played ‘America.'”
One Democratic newspaper stated, “Now none but traitors deserving the gibbet will be found sustaining the Southern rebels. Those who are not for the Stars and Stripes are against them.”
This ethic has continued to resonate with Americans long after the Civil War.
Ronald Reagan displayed this Jacksonian attitude during the Cold War when he ditched the policy of détente and drew a firm line of opposition to the Soviet Union.
Reagan called the USSR an “Evil Empire,” pointing to the depravities of life under Communism. Americans, notably the “Reagan Democrats,” not only drew a line in the sand, but took aggressive action to build up the military and wage numerous small-scale wars as a part of the “Reagan Doctrine.”
Most recently, the atrocities committed on September 11, 2001, in which thousands of Americans were brutally killed by those who held a radical, anti-American Islamist ideology, prompted Americans to go on the warpath. Attacking the symbols of American power, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, were clear examples that the enemy was attempting to upend the foundations of American civilization. 
Though this clash is clear to Americans with a Jacksonian outlook, it has been muddled by those with a different philosophy.
It must be noted that even though many Jacksonian Democrats initially opposed the conflict with the slave states in the lead up to the Civil War, were at best ambivalent and sometimes outwardly hostile to abolition, and deeply disliked President Lincoln, it was ultimately the swelling of Union ranks with these rough men of iron-will that preserved the United States as one nation and put an end to the institution of slavery. 
Jacksonians turn to war when they believe that vital American interests are at stake and against enemies that they believe threaten American liberties and the foundations of the country. Once set off, Jacksonians see conflict ending in total victory or defeat with little in the middle. A simple, but important set of principles to understand whenever American leaders decide to let slip the dogs of war.

After the Senate Conservative Fund (SCF) endorsed Matt Bevin, the Tea Party challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), McConnell has reportedly gone on a rampage against SCF allies and the conservative candidates it has endorsed. 
Most recently, McConnell reportedly directed his anger at Nebraska conservative Senate candidate Ben Sasse, whom the SCF has endorsed in the open primary.
According to National Review, on November 12, “Sasse walked into Mitch McConnell’s office to clear the air” and let him know he never intended to oppose McConnell’s leadership, but McConnell was having none of it. The outlet notes that McConnell’s incident with Sasse in his war with SCF is “notable” because “it involves an attractive, promising candidate in an open primary as collateral damage in the intramural fight.”


Josh Holmes, McConnell’s top adviser, “privately told friends afterward it was the most uncomfortable meeting he’d been in”; Sasse reportedly turned to Holmes when he walked out of meeting and said, “That didn’t go well!”
McConnell reportedly “lit into” and grilled Sasse about “exactly when Sasse had first interacted with Matt Hoskins, the hard-charging executive director of SCF” who is “working to elect McConnell’s primary challenger.” The SCF was started by former South Carolina Senator and current Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, who feuded with McConnell because he backed candidates–like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul–that went up against McConnell’s handpicked candidates in Republican primaries.
McConnell reportedly asked Sasse about the YouTube video (embedded below) that was highlighted on the Drudge Report in September in which Sasse said it was time for “every Republican in Washington, starting with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, to show some actual leadership.”

In that video, Sasse also ripped Washington’s permanent political class, saying that elected officials are not kings and the American people are not “peasants.” He said there is not “one set of rules for the Washington elite and another for the masses” and called on McConnell to show leadership and give up his Obamacare subsidies. The outlet also reported that “the bad blood between Sasse and McConnell escalated” when Sasse met with National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) political director Ward Baker. 
McConnell, along with the Republican establishment like the NRSC, is mounting an organized effort against conservatives and Tea Partiers. For instance, McConnell, as Breitbart News reported, said he would like to punch the SCF “in the nose” on a conference call with donors of Karl Rove’s political group on October 30. McConnell has taken steps to put his words into action; National Review reported that “pressure from McConnell allies convinced SCF’s bookkeeper, Lisa Lisker, to part ways with the group,” even though “Lisker has previously worked for Republican candidates locked in tense primary elections without incident.” McConnell has been accused of “bullying” the bookkeeper. 
Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, in response to McConnell’s hostile words, told Breitbart News, “Why would Senator Mitch McConnell want to ‘punch in the nose’ the millions of patriotic moms, grandmoms and veterans who stand up for America through the Tea Party and groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund?”
“The people supporting SCF are the same people going to Tea Party meetings and rallies across the country. We elect our representatives to represent us, not to threaten us with physical violence during secret meetings with Karl Rove’s friends,” she told Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle. She added that “everything” the Tea Party said “about Obamacare turned out to be true.”
She continued, “If they’ve got so much fight in them, then where were they when we needed them to stand up and fight against Obamacare?” Martin also emphasized that the “Tea Party Patriots shares Senate Conservatives Fund’s goal of holding establishment Republicans accountable, and specifically, we shared the goal of defunding Obamacare.”
McConnell has not endorsed Sasse’s primary opponent in the race, but Sasse is being considered “collateral damage” in a fight he never wanted in McConnell’s and the Republican establishment’s broader war on conservative Tea Partiers and specifically against SCF.

President Barack Obama is supposed to lead the country, but barely participated in the “fiscal cliff” negotiations except to berate Republicans in the media. As Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid is meant to move legislation through the upper chamber, but gave up and was sidelined by the Vice President. House Speaker John Boehner is meant to lead his caucus, but they rejected his proposals, and he barely held onto his job.
Welcome to post-“fiscal cliff” Washington, a leaderless chasm in which no one is bold enough to offer an agenda, nor confident enough to compromise. Even the Tea Party refuses to step up: it was ironic that Michele Bachmann cast the 218th vote that gave Boehner the bare majority he needed to retain the Speaker’s gavel. This is an age without a Reagan, without a Thatcher–without even a Ted Kennedy, on the other side.


President Obama marked the conclusion of the “fiscal cliff” deal by promising he would not negotiate with Congress on the debt ceiling. Likewise, Speaker Boehner promised he would no longer negotiate directly with the President. These are absurd promises that mock the spirit of the Constitution’s separation of powers, bold statements that are meant to convey strength but in reality betray the weaknesses of both party’s leaders. 

The branches must co-govern, even as they check each other’s power. Yet the separation of powers is something President Obama has never accepted, as he ignores Congress and writes regulations or makes appointments as he pleases. He resents the fact that Congress controls the debt ceiling, and there is now serious talk that he might simply ignore Congress by minting a $1 trillion coin and depositing it in the Treasury.
Meanwhile, in Congress, the Senate has treated the Republican-controlled House as if it were an illegitimate body, ignoring dozens of economic bills passed through the lower chamber even as it refuses to pass a budget. The “extremist” House compromised on the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff, much to the annoyance of the GOP base, because Republicans accepted the reality of divided government. Not so the Democrats.
The new Republican temptation, as expressed by Boehner’s promise not to deal one-on-one with the President, is to withdraw from a political process in which good faith is punished by mockery and demands for more concessions. That is understandable, but mistaken. President Obama is actually weaker than ever, because there is no political will to enact further tax hikes, and because fiscal circumstances demand spending cuts. 
These are precisely the conditions under which Republican leaders should want to engage President Obama directly. The President does not want to negotiate because he knows he will have to make concessions–just as, during the campaign, he took little interest in debating Gov. Mitt Romney because he did not want to have to defend his record. The House has the opportunity, finally, to hold the President accountable for his debts.
But instead of inviting direct talks, Speaker Boehner had to reject them to retain his position. And so Republicans have re-elected a leader on a promise not to lead. It is almost as bad as watching Democrats re-elect Nancy Pelosi as Minority Leader after guiding her party to two successive defeats. 
Because there are few consequences for bad leadership, there is little good leadership. And so we stagger into the next crisis.

President Barack Obama’s “most persistent distraction” when he launched his re-election campaign in April 2011 was not the economy, the Tea Party movement, the GOP presidential primary field, the unpopularity of Obamacare, or even the soon-to-be-launched mission to take out Osama bin laden. 
No, the most pressing issue for the president was the fact that real estate mogul Donald Trump had been challenging him over his birth certificate, according to the new book Double Down: Game Change 2012.
“[T]he most persistent distraction Obama was facing personified by Donald Trump, the real estate billionaire and reality show ringmaster who was flirting with making a presidential run under the banner of birtherism–the crackpot conspiracy theory claiming that Obama was born in Kenya and thus was constitutionally ineligible to preside as commander in chief,” authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann note in the opening chapter of the book.


While Obama–who was born in Hawaii–thought of the theory as “lunacy” and “simply mental,” in 2008 his campaign posted his short-form birth certificate online. But as 2011 rolled around, the theory, the authors note, “wouldn’t go away.”
“A recent New York Times poll had found that 45 percent of Republicans and 25 percent of voters overall believed he was foreign born,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote. “And with Trump serving as a human bullhorn, the faux controversy had escaped the confines of Fox News and conservative talk radio, reverberating in the mainstream media.”
George Stephanopoulos asked Obama about Trump’s crusade for his birth certificate twice in an interview the morning of April 14, 2011. “We’re not really worrying about conspiracy theories,” Obama said in response.

But that is not what this new book found; Halperin and Heilemann claim Obama literally spent that night in his Chicago home digging through old records to try to find some kind of proof he was born in Hawaii amid the belongings of his late mother, Ann Dunham.
After Obama made the fundraising rounds throughout Chicago, “he avoided mentioning Trump,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote, “yet the issue remained much on his mind.”
“What confounded him about the problem, beyond its absurdity, was that there was no ready solution,” they wrote. “Although Trump was braying for his original long-form birth certificate, officials in Obama’s home state were legally prohibited from releasing it on their own, and the president had no earthly idea where his family’s copy was.”
What Obama did try to do was “joke about the topic,” as he did during his final fundraiser that night at Chicago’s Navy Pier. “I grew up here in Chicago,” he said. “I wasn’t born here–I just want to be clear. I was born in Hawaii.”  
Halperin and Heilemann note that Obama spent the night in the Chicago home that he, Michelle, Sasha, and Malia left behind for the White House in early 2009. When Obama walked through the door after 10 PM, he “stayed up even later” the authors noted, “intrigued by some old boxes that had belonged to his late mother, Ann Dunham.”

While Obama’s mother died seven years earlier, Obama still had not dug through and “sorted” all of her things. “Now, alone in his old house for just the third night since he’d become president, he started rummaging through the boxes, digging, digging, until suddenly he found it: a small, four-paneled paper booklet the world had never seen before,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote. “On the front was an ink drawing of Kapi’olani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital, in Honolulu. On the back was a picture of a Hawaiian queen. On one inside were his name, his mother’s name, and his date of birth; on the other were his infant footprints.”
Obama was so pleased that he found it, he bragged about the discovery to his friend Marty Nesbitt who visited him the next day. Nesbitt, one of Obama’s best friends who bonded with the president over sports over the years, came over for breakfast the next morning. “After chatting for a while at the kitchen table, Obama went upstairs and came back down, wearing a cat-who-ate-a-whole-flock-of-canaries grin, waving the booklet in the air, and then placing it in front of Nesbitt,” the authors wrote. 
“Now that’s some funny shit,” Nesbitt said before he “burst out laughing.”
Obama was so proud he found the booklet that on the way to a scheduled interview with the Associated Press, he “pulled aside” adviser David Plouffe and press secretary Jay Carney “and eagerly showed them his discovery.”
Both Plouffe and Carney were unsure if that was, in fact, Obama’s long form birth certificate, but were hopeful that it could help them in fighting the birther conspiracy theories. As for Obama, Halperin and Heilemann noted, he “didn’t know what to think, but he flew back to Washington hoping that maybe, just maybe, he now had a stake to drive through the heart of birtherism, killing it once and for all–and slaying Trump in the bargain.”
Obama hoped this was his saving grace, as Trump’s charges had gotten so far under his skin it started consuming him. “Striding into a meeting with his senior advisers in the Oval Office the next Monday morning, he reached into his suit pocket and whipped out the booklet, infinitely pleased with himself,” Halperin and Heilemann wrote.

The Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted for promoting their faith: “Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense…Court martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis…”. 
The statement, released to Fox News, follows a Breitbart News report on Obama administration Pentagon appointees meeting with anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein to develop court-martial procedures to punish Christians in the military who express or share their faith. 


(From our earlier report: Weinstein is the head of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, and says Christians–including chaplains–sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in the military are guilty of “treason,” and of committing an act of “spiritual rape” as serious a crime as “sexual assault.” He also asserted that Christians sharing their faith in the military are “enemies of the Constitution.”)
Being convicted in a court martial means that a soldier has committed a crime under federal military law. Punishment for a court martial can include imprisonment and being dishonorably discharged from the military. 
So President Barack Obama’s civilian appointees who lead the Pentagon are confirming that the military will make it a crime–possibly resulting in imprisonment–for those in uniform to share their faith. This would include chaplains–military officers who are ordained clergymen of their faith (mostly Christian pastors or priests, or Jewish rabbis)–whose duty since the founding of the U.S. military under George Washington is to teach their faith and minister to the spiritual needs of troops who come to them for counsel, instruction, or comfort.

This regulation would severely limit expressions of faith in the military, even on a one-to-one basis between close friends. It could also effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military, as it would not allow chaplains (or any service members, for that matter), to say anything about their faith that others say led them to think they were being encouraged to make faith part of their life. It’s difficult to imagine how a member of the clergy could give spiritual counseling without saying anything that might be perceived in that fashion. 
In response to the Pentagon’s plans, retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin, who is now executive vice president of the Family Research Council (FRC), said on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning: 
It’s a matter of what do they mean by “proselytizing.” …I think they’ve got their defintions a little confused. If you’re talking about coercion that’s one thing, but if you’re talking about the free exercise of our faith as individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, especially for the chaplains, they I think the worst thing we can do is stop the ability for a soldier to be able to exercise his faith.”
FRC has launched a petition here which has already collected over 60,000 signatures, calling on Secretary Hagel is stop working with Weinstein and his anti-Christian organization to develop military policy regarding religious faith. 
**UPDATE**
The FRC petition has now exceeded more than 40,000 signatures at the time of this update.
Breitbart News legal columnist Ken Klukowski is senior fellow for religious liberty with the Family Research Council and on faculty at Liberty University School of Law.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Nearly half of the crowd at Saturday’s Elite 8 game between Syracuse and Marquette at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. booed President Barack Obama when he was shown on the big screen with just over ten minutes to play in the first half. After the boos erupted, a contingent of Obama supporters countered with cheers.
Obama also golfed on Saturday for the first time since the sequester cuts went into effect at the beginning of March and then took some of his foursome–and his Secret Service detail–to watch Syracuse oust Marquette and secure a trip to the Final Four. 


One would have expected a friendlier crowd for the President, but there are still several possible explanations for the boos. Obama and his White House team had supported Georgetown (Syracuse’s rival) in the past, and the President had forecast Indiana (who was eliminated by Syracuse) to win the East Regional and go on to win the national title, for example.  Or, perhaps they booed because POTUS had gone to the game with Secret Service agents while the White House remains closed to tours. 
The Obama administration canceled the popular White House tours citing Secret Service costs. Throughout the week, Obama has been scrutinized because of Secret Service expenditures for the First Daughters’ vacations to the Bahamas and Sun Valley, Idaho.

In a blistering CPAC speech on Saturday in which she sipped a Big Gulp soda to mock Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s soda cup ban–and the liberal nanny state, in general–former Alaska Gov. and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin reserved her harshest words for President Barack Obama regarding gun control, the budget, and leadership. 
Palin said Obama promised the most transparent administration ever but has been mired in crony capitalism and has not even passed a budget. She said refusing to pass a budget is not “just bureaucratic bungling,” it is “refusing to declare what” Obama intends to do with the people’s money. 
“Barack Obama, you lie!” Palin said of Obama’s transparency claims. 


On background checks for guns, Palin said, “Dandy idea, Mr. President. Should have started with yours.”
She said “bad guys who ignore the laws” will not follow new laws when it comes to gun control legislation Democrats want enacted. She blistered liberals for over-simplifying the causes of gun-related crimes.
“Saying a chunk of metal did the crime is like saying the fork made me fat,” Palin said. 

She mocked the mainstream media for gathering again to write their “conservatives in crisis” stories. 
Palin had some harsh words Obama’s lack of leadership and the lack of leaders in Washington. 
She said there is a “direct correlation between the Senate’s stubbornly refusing to pass a budget and selfishly agreeing to spend our children’s and our grandchildren’s money.”
“No budget is no leadership,” Palin said. “It’s time for America to be more outraged about this.”
She said America faces challenges “so big” while its leaders are so small. 

Palin called Obama a campaigner who makes promises he can’t keep and seeks to divide and conquer while orchestrating crisis after crisis to exploit for political gain. 
“We don’t have leadership coming out of Washington, we have reality television,” Palin said. 
Palin said everything coming out of Washington, D.C. feels put-on and every event feels calculated to fool Americans. 
She blistered the permanent political class for focusing too much on the process of politics instead of the purpose of politics, which is to lead and serve. She resoundingly mocked Obama as a permanent campaigner even though he is not up for reelection anymore. 
“Now step away from the Teleprompter, and do your job,” Palin said to Obama.

Two politicians involved in Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign have contradicted GOP strategist Karl Rove’s boast of directing the conservative icon’s Texas operation that year.
Both Ernie Angelo, Ronald Reagan’s Texas campaign manager in 1980, and Rick Shelby, the 1980 Reagan campaign’s regional political director responsible for Texas, told the Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis on Friday that Karl Rove was not the “director of the Texas campaign for Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980” as he claimed Thursday on The O’Reilly Factor:

I finally caught up with Rick Shelby, who helped me get to the bottom of it. Today, Shelby’s with the American Gas Association, but in 1979, he was one of the original Regional Political Directors for the Reagan for President Committee. This involved coordinating nine states — including Texas.
Since Texas was important, Shelby tells me he spent an “inordinate” amount of time in the Lone Star State in 1980. And though Rove never technically worked on the Reagan campaign, Shelby says he served as executive director for the state’s Victory Committee.
In that capacity, Shelby recalls that Rove “played a vital role in helping raise the funds necessary” for an effective voter ID and turnout program in the state. 

Here’s what 1980 Reagan Texas campaign manager Ernest Angelo said about Rove’s role in the 1980 Reagan campaign in an email Friday:



In 1980 I was Gov Reagan’s Texas chairman in the primary and Campaign Manager for the general election. Gov Clements endorsed Reagan after the Texas primary and was the campaign Chairman. I was a full time volunteer on site for most of the Fall campaign in Austin. I worked closely with Rick Shelby who was a Reagan Regional Political Director and was in Austin nearly full time. We had a large staff of volunteers and paid individuals. I’m not much for titles but I can assure you Karl Rove was materially involved since he was working for me and Gov Clements in the campaign.

Reagan biographer Craig Shirley said he was “delighted” to see Angelo and Shelby confirm his own research, he said in an exclusive email to Breitbart News Friday evening.

“This confirms earlier documentation by Tom Pauken and Gary Hoitsma, both deeply involved in the Texas Reagan campaign of 1980,” Shirley wrote. He stated that his own interviews for the book Rendezvous With Destiny, none of his sources linked Rove to Reagan’s campaign.

In the course of interviewing President Carter, Vice President Mondale, John Anderson, Jim Baker, Jody Powell, President George H.W. Bush, Tom Brokaw, Lou Cannon, Dave Keene, Vic Gold, Frank Donatelli, Roger Stone, Ed Rollins and over 150 people all told including Ernie Angelo and Rick Shelby, Mr. Rove’s name never came up except sparingly in relation to the Bush 1980 campaign. But never the Reagan campaign.

Shirley says that he never found Rove’s name in his personal search of the Reagan Library’s files on the 1980 campaign. He claims that of the 200 books used in the bibliography for Rendezvous, “Mr. Rove’s name never came up in connection to the Reagan campaign of 1980 in any of these publications.”
“Just to be sure,” he continued, “we ran a search today of Texas newspapers from March to November of 1980 and Mr. Rove’s name never appeared. Period.”
Earlier this month, Rove’s announcement that he had established a new SuperPAC, the Conservative Victory Project, drew the ire of Tea Party activists, who saw this new organization as yet another attempt to force moderate candidates through the Republican primary process.

Supporters of religious liberty clearly had the upper hand today at the U.S. Supreme Court, as the lawyers representing those offering invocation prayers at town board meetings overpowered those who tried to have the Court declare those prayers unconstitutional. 
On Wednesday, the Court heard arguments in Town of Greece v. Galloway, which Breitbart News explained in detail yesterday. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does not allow government to establish a national religion, and the plaintiffs in this case argued that allowing opening prayers does just that. 
As Breitbart News explained in our previous report, the Supreme Court upheld this practice–called legislative prayer–in the 1983 case Marsh v. Chambers. Today, the plaintiffs sought to have the Court say that Marsh only permits prayers that have no faith-specific content (such as mentioning the name of Jesus Christ), or that only Congress and state legislatures are permitted to have such prayers, not local government. 


The plaintiffs here evidently knew they did not have five votes on the Court to overrule Marsh, so they sought instead for the Court to rule that all governmental bodies need to adopt a policy forbidding prayer-givers from making faith-specific references. 

Justice Antonin Scalia spent considerable time discussing the problem with that argument that there are no statements with which all people agree because some are atheists. Justice Samuel Alito proved this point even among those who believe something, by challenging the plaintiffs’ lawyers to specify some prayer with which followers of every religion would agree. Their lawyer could not find one. 
The critical swing vote in this case is Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has previously spoken favorably of public prayers but was the decisive vote in 1992 in declaring prayers unconstitutional at public school graduation ceremonies when children are likely present. 
Justice Kennedy possibly tipped his hand today when he said the plaintiffs’ proposed rule “involves the state very heavily in the editing and censorship of prayer.” As a rule of thumb, when Justice Kennedy says that your proposal involves “censorship,” that means you lost. 
Breitbart News will publish a full report on the argument later today.

The immigration bill introduced to the Senate a week and a half ago would, if passed, allow illegal immigrants to access state and local welfare benefits immediately, Breitbart News has learned. The financial impact of allowing potentially millions of immigrants onto state and local public assistance could overwhelm these programs’ budgets.
Senate Budget Committee ranking member Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) uncovered this loophole in the bill and many others, and he will circulate a memo detailing the gaps in the bill on Tuesday. Breitbart News exclusively obtained a copy of the memo before its public release.
“The Gang of Eight made a promise that illegal immigrants will not be able to access public benefits,” Sessions said in a statement to Breitbart News. “We already know that, once granted green cards and ultimately citizenship, illegal immigrants will be able to access all public benefit programs at a great cost to taxpayers. We have, however, identified a number of loopholes that would allow illegal immigrants to draw public benefits even sooner than advertised.”


If the bill were signed into law, America’s 11 million illegal immigrants would be legalized within six months, when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano submits her border security plan to Congress. Illegal immigrants would immediately be eligible for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, making them legal to live and work in the country.

As Sessions’ staff points out in the memo, “state laws frequently extend benefits to anyone ‘lawfully present’ in the U.S.” The Sessions team points to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) brief that details how the only requirement many state and local governments have with regard to immigrant access to public benefits is that they are “lawfully present.” The term “lawfully present” is a legal definition.

According to page 91 of the bill, all illegal immigrants granted legalized RPI status would legally be considered “lawfully present.” That section reads as follows:

”(4) TREATMENT OF REGISTERED PROVISIONAL IMMIGRANTS.–A noncitizen granted registered provisional immigrant status under this section shall be considered lawfully present in the United States for all purposes while such noncitizen remains in such status, except that the noncitizen–
”(A) is not entitled to the premium assistance tax credit authorized under section 36B of            the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
”(B) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in subsection (e) of such section; and           
”(C) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in section 1402(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18071).”


In evaluating whether an illegal immigrant qualifies for RPI status, Sessions’ staff points out, the legislation “explicitly forbids” the Department of Homeland Security from using current law, which blocks entry to those who could become “public charges,” i.e. dependent on government welfare programs.  

“Therefore, when those here illegally who are unable to support themselves are legalized, much of the immediate fiscal burden will fall on state and local governments,” Sessions’ staff wrote in the memo.

In addition to that loophole, Sessions and his staff found several more loopholes that allow current illegal immigrants access to public benefits even on the federal level before the promised wait time of 13 years from the bill’s passage.
In the memo, Sessions’ staff notes that current illegal immigrants who are “granted RPI status will immediately become eligible for federal benefits through citizen and permanent resident dependents, with no requirement that they support their household as a condition of receiving or maintaining legal status.” That means any current illegal immigrant who subsequently has dependent children, who are, by right of birth, U.S. citizens would qualify for federal welfare benefits through them.

On Tuesday, former Marxist-turned-conservative icon David Horowitz spoke at the Heritage Foundation to mark the launch of what will be a ten-volume compendium of his writings on leftism, The Black Book of the American Left. In his wide-ranging speech, Horowitz described his transition from left to right, and discussed the shortcomings of a conservative movement unwilling to deal with the ugly realities of what the American left represents.

Horowitz began by distinguishing the David Horowitz Freedom Center from other think tanks, instead characterizing it as a “battle tank.” He labeled himself “monomaniacal” in his focus on the left and its relation to communism. “There are hedgehogs and foxes. The foxes know many things. And the hedgehogs know one thing. I am a hedgehog,” he joked.

“My parents called themselves progressives,” Horowitz explained with regard to his communist parents. “The agenda was a Soviet America…the slogan of the communist party in those days was peace, jobs, democracy. Sound familiar?”

That was the theme of Horowitz’s speech as he continued: how the communists had taken over the Democratic Party. “The communist party is the Democratic Party,” Horowitz stated. “In The Great Gatsby, [F. Scott] Fitzgerald describes the rich as people who break things and leave them for others to clean up. That is a wonderful description of the left.” Horowitz, who began as a radical Marxist, said that the modern left had learned stealth from their failures in the 1960s: “The left have learned from the 1960s…we in the 1960s didn’t want to pretend to be Jeffersonian democrats…That’s why we failed in the 1960s. That’s why they’ve succeeded now.”
But the right, Horowitz pointed out, has failed to acknowledge that reality. On Obamacare, for example, Horowitz railed against the language used by the left: “single-payer.” Instead, he said, “it is communism,” pointing out that it was state ownership of the means of production. He added, “The left hate the Constitution because Madison designed it to thwart them.”

Horowitz then analyzed what he claimed were the four features of the leftist mentality. First, he said, the left and right are on opposite sides of the “fundamental divide of the modern age”: the left believes that human beings are inherently good and infinitely malleable, and so can be shaped by proper state guidance. Conservatives, by contrast, believe that human beings are responsible for social problems, and concentrating power in the hands of humans is dangerous.
Second, Horowitz said, the left are characterized by the belief that “history is a forward march.” Obama, Horowitz claimed, is a deep believer in this concept, all the way down to his carpet in the Oval Office, which assures those who enter that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. “Leftism is a crypto-religion,” he explained. “They see themselves as a savior. People who believe that redemption will take place in this life and I will be a part of it, that’s Hitler. That’s Mao…That’s the American left.”
Third, Horowitz said that the left was characterized by “alienation from this country… What weakens America is actually good.” Horowitz cited the Obama administration’s eager withdrawal from Iraq as evidence of that proposition: “Obama betrayed every American who gave their life for the people of Iraq.” He also slammed the Obama administration with regard to Benghazi: “Benghazi is the most shameful act in the history of the American presidency.”

Finally, said Horowitz, the American left “lie. And it’s not like politicians spinning…you cannot be a leftist without lying about the most basic strategic facts about who you are.”
Horowitz summed up pessimistically: “We are within reach of a totalitarian state in this country…These are very very dark days for this country.” But, Horowitz held out hope: “there’s been an earthquake on the conservative side since I switched sides…the tea party is the earthquake. The best thing that Republicans can do is stop the fratricide.”

Last week, GOP pundit Karl Rove wrote in The Wall Street Journal in support of the current Senate immigration bill, arguing it was much tougher on illegal immigrants than the 1986 law that granted amnesty to the three million illegals. Rove wrote that the ’86 law “essentially told those here illegally that if they had arrived in the U.S. prior to 1982 and wanted to become citizens, simply raise your right hand.” Ed Meese responded Friday that Rove’s description of the law was “way off the mark.”
In a letter published by the WSJ, Meese recalled that he was present in 1986 when the legislation was under consideration. He had examined the bill carefully at the time. He was, after all, US Attorney General then.  
“The 1986 act didn’t turn illegal immigrants into citizens on the spot. It granted temporary resident status only to those who could prove they had resided continuously in America for five years,” Meese writes. “Advancement to citizenship was not automatic. Immigrants had to satisfy various requirements along the way. They had to pay application fees, learn to speak English, understand American civics, pass a medical exam and register for military selective service. Those with convictions for a felony or three misdemeanors were ineligible.”


Meese goes on to note another similar, and troubling comparison between the current Senate bill and the 1986 Amnesty law. “The ’86 reform bill also had supposedly ‘rigorous’ border security and immigration law enforcement provisions. So how did that pan out?”

The 1986 law is a troubling parallel to today’s debate. That law was also intended to permanently “solve” the problem of illegal immigration. In granting three million illegals immigrants permanent legal status, the government also promised the public that it would secure the border and increase internal enforcement. 
That, of course, didn’t happen. Instead, within two decades, the number of illegal immigrants in the country had more than tripled to 11 million. Without hard triggers for border security, is there any rational reason to think our experience will be any different today?
Meese writes, “Amnesty “bends” the rule of law. And bending the rule of law to reach a “comprehensive” deal winds up provoking wholesale breaking of the law. Ultimately, it encourages millions more to risk entering the country illegally in the hope that one day they, too, might receive amnesty.”
Rove is spearheading an effort to get the GOP behind the Senate immigration plan. Not really because of any particular provisions in the legislation, but rather a simple political ploy to allow the GOP to merely say they supported reform. It is a misguided pandering that will sow the seeds for another illegal immigration problem in the future.

On Thursday, a former U.S. Secret Service agent who is running for a House seat and has written a book about his life in the Service cancelled his prescheduled appearance on MSNBC’s Bashir Live because of Martin Bashir’s suggestion that someone should defecate and urinate in former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s mouth. 



Dan Bongino, who was a Secret Service agent under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told Breitbart News that his appearance to speak on Bashir’s program about his book, Life Inside the Bubble, “was booked in advance of his unfortunate comments,” and he could not in good faith appear on the program.

“In light of these comments I felt it only appropriate to cancel my appearance on the show. Governor Palin took a principled chance on me during my U.S. Senate campaign when few would,” Bongino told Breitbart News. “She put herself out there for me, risking her political capital, and chose to endorse me because she believed in me.

“In a political arena filled with bad actors it was refreshing to know that Governor Palin was willing to fight for the underdog. She deserves better than the treatment she received by Mr. Bashir and I cannot, in good faith, appear on the show, regardless of the number of books it may or may not sell.”
Bongino is the author of Life Inside the Bubble, which is getting bipartisan interest thanks to recent scandals and the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s assassination. As of this writing, it is No. 39 on Amazon.com’s bestsellers list. Bongino, a candidate for Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District who has said he would go to Washington and not let the city change him, turned down a chance to promote himself and his book on Bashir’s show during a week in more people may be watching due to the controversy surrounding Bashir’s comments. 
Bashir apologized on Monday for his remarks, saying they were “offensive” and wholly inappropriate,” but MSNBC has not taken any action against him despite the network’s past history of disciplining its on-air talent for “offensive remarks.” Palin’s political action committee SarahPAC sent a letter to MSNBC President Phil Griffin and NBC News President Deborah Turness, which Breitbart News exclusively obtained, that asked the network what action it would take against Bashir, especially given that the network suspended Alec Baldwin for anti-gay comments he made off of the air.
“You fired Don Imus for offensive language in describing the Rutgers University Women’s Basketball team, you suspended Alec Baldwin, and yet nothing has happened to Mr. Bashir,” the letter reads. “Are we to assume then, that disciplinary procedures at your network take place based on the target of the remarks rather than the remarks themselves?”
The letter concludes, “Americans deserve to know that your network doesn’t condone violent and hateful rhetoric directed at anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or political persuasion.”

Conservatives on Twitter cried foul last January when the governor of New Jersey lashed out at Republicans for rightly scrapping the pork-laden Sandy Relief bill. Now Christie’s at it again – blaming the House GOP for not moving quickly enough to approve funds.
Joel Pollak and other conservatives on Twitter, today, remember the history, and were having none of Christie’s revisionism:



@govchristie Do you not understand legitimate objections to wasteful pork, opportunistically inserted into the bill? Or just not concerned?

@joelpollak All the pork was stripped out of bill prior to passage at the insistence of Republicans, myself included. Pls learn the facts.

The recent plunge in ratings, readership, revenue, and credibility doesn’t frighten the media — but the idea of diversity-of-thought sure does. With the  news breaking Monday that the Koch Brothers might be interested in purchasing the Tribune Co., the media campaign to stop that potential sale has already begun. 
Media writer Jim Romenesko is currently offering anonymity to Tribune Co. “journalists” willing to comment on the news. As expected, in-between a bunch of nonsense about  how important objectivity is in media, they’re obviously seething over the idea of working for the dreaded Brothers Koch:


To survive so much (and to have done some pretty damn amazing work in the process) it’s extremely disheartening to know serious bids are being entertained to sell to the Kochs. 
Murdoch, for all his flaws, is a newspaper man. The Kochs are not. I have no faith in their belief in the importance of a free and robust watchdog press. Frankly, such a press seems antithetical to their goals and harmful to their influence in the political process.
Another:

The news is a bit terrifying given the idea that the Koch bros. pitched “media” as the third prong of a strategy to push their political and social ideals onto a wider audience.
It is pretty obvious that this will be The Narrative the media-collective as a whole will start to spin (Politico’s Dylan Byers is already tweeting it out) in the hopes of quashing any potential sale. What we’re talking about is a campaign of peer pressure within the provincial media to pressure the Tribune Co. to reject the Kochs’ offer (if there is one). 
Naturally, this campaign will be disguised in the lofty ideal of “objective journalism,” which has been the media’s Big Lie for decades. But the real goal will be to bully one of their own into protecting the media’s ideological purity.
The most laughable concern is that of non-newspaper men purchasing newspapers. In today’s multi-national world, people without a background in media are going to end up as owners or part owners of media outlets. Furthermore, the Kochs probably own all kinds of  successful businesses they lack a personal background in. But they are billionaires because they have hired the right people to run them. 
This happens every day in business at this level. And shouldn’t “journalists” have at least a basic understanding of this reality?

Tuesday’s remarks by new Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Mike Shields seen as critical of conservative grassroots activists have not been well received by either the icons of the conservative movement or local grassroots leaders.
Despite efforts by RNC spokesperson Sean Spicer to walk those comments back, local conservative grassroots leaders–almost all of whom have been working hard for over four years with no compensation–remain unimpressed.
Ben Cunningham, founder of the Nashville Tea Party and one of the leaders of the decade earlier Tennessee Tax Revolt, told Breitbart News that “we are not about to be led by a bunch of timid Washington, D.C. Brahmins who are interested in making a buck off of people they see as naive. Either join us in the fight or get the hell out of the way.”


Cunningham added that “the problem for Washington, D.C.-based Republican consultants is they have become almost completely detached from the passion and purpose of the grassroots. To the grassroots Tea Party activist,” Cunningham continued,  “the future of the country is at stake and they immediately distrust ‘consultants’ who feel uneasy about manifesting their passion and fighting for the cause. Tea Party activists have been demonized and vilified and called every name in the book by liberals for four years and it has only made us stronger and more determined than ever.”

Zan Green, founder of the Rainy Day Patriots, a local tea party in Birmingham, Alabama organized in February 2009, echoed Cunningham’s sentiments. “The RNC is welcome to join ‘We The People’ in our self funded, personal-time-spent efforts to restore our republic. We could use some team players and there is always room for more boots on the ground.” 
Eric Olsen, co-founder of the 5,000 member Montana Shrugged Teaparty Patriots of Billings, Montana, told Breitbart News that “I take exception to all the reports coming from the Republican old guard.  They do not realize it, but they are losing their base with such remarks.”  
According to Olsen “the GOP should totally embrace the teaparty/grassroots followers as it is to their best interest.  But they lack the political will to do so.  Instead they demean the success of the movement.  They purposely went out of their way last election cycle to disenfranchise the tea party, libertarian and Ron Paul supporters.  We all know what happened then.  They lost crucial elections across the nation while successful teaparty backed candidates like Ted Cruz won handily.”
Olsen called the RNC Autopsy report “a joke,” and added that “it shows the willingness of the old guard GOP to throw their platform under the bus giving in to the pressure from the extreme left.”  
“Passion for America,” Olsen concluded,  “is the only force that will resurrect real hope and change for the United States.”

On Wednesday, House Republicans each received a pamphlet described as an “Immigration Resource Kit” for members as they head home to face constituents on the issue of immigration reform throughout the August recess.
The last page of the pamphlet, which was distributed via the Wednesday morning GOP conference meeting, included a collage of what it described as “What Conservative Groups Are Saying.” Under that header, the pamphlet includes statements from Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) president Grover Norquist, Southern Baptist Convention ethics and religious liberty commission president Dr. Russell Moore, the American Conservative Union (ACU), and the American Action Forum (AAF).
Each of these groups supports amnesty, and each has endorsed the Senate immigration bill. 


Norquist, who was cited twice on the last page of the pamphlet, helped champion the “Gang of Eight” bill through the Senate. He even testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of it, for which he received glowing praise from Democrat senators like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The ACU, which is chaired by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) ally Al Cardenas, also backed the Senate bill. 
AAF and its sister group American Action Network are actually part of an aggressive public pressure campaign to get the House to take up the Senate bill. Finally, Moore is a member of the George Soros front group Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) that has been advocating in favor of the Senate bill as well.
That page also quoted a months-old article from Roll Call that pointed out the Club For Growth and FreedomWorks were not going to get involved in the immigration battle, suggesting a tacit endorsement from those two conservative watchdog groups by not fighting this battle.

The page included nothing from Tea Party Patriots or the Heritage Foundation, which are both adamantly opposed to the Senate bill, nor any of the statements from the litany of conservative groups that have come out against the Gang of Eight. 
When asked about whether she specifically approved the distribution of this material to all GOP members via conference on Wednesday, GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers told Breitbart News’ Kerry Picket that she had approved it because she thought it was being done on behalf of the Judiciary Committee. “Well we did distribute it at conference,” McMorris Rodgers said in an interview with Picket on Capitol Hill. “But it’s a product of the Judiciary Committee. We allowed for it to be handed out at conference.”
Breitbart News then reached out to several of the House Republican members on the committee to see if they personally endorsed the literature. Almost a full day later, not one member has returned a request for comment. 
The full packet opens with a “Dear Colleague” letter from House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). “This recess packet has been put together to help you communicate to your constituents the importance of immigration reform and the House Republican plan to produce solutions that actually fix the problems that plague our immigration system,” Goodlatte wrote. “The Committee welcomes your insight and input as we move forward together on this important issue.”
The pamphlet lays out several pieces of legislation individually supported by most immigration hawks, like the SAFE Act from Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and the Legal Workforce Act from Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX). But it also touts legislative proposals that do not have broad support like the Border Security Results Act from House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX). 
The packet confirms the suspicions of many critics of comprehensive immigration reform by saying the House is working on an amnesty provision: “House Republicans are currently discussing a way forward on how to provide legal status to unlawful immigrants living in our country. However, the current unlawful immigrant population is diverse, so the solutions may vary.” 
“For example, while some knowingly broke our immigration laws, others were brought illegally to the U.S. as children by their parents,” the writing claims. “These children came here through no fault of their own and many of them know no other home than the United States.”
The packet does, however, say that any amnesty would need to come after border security and interior enforcement are strengthened, but does not say whether any forthcoming specific proposals would actually do that. Proponents of the Senate bill had similarly originally said legalization, or amnesty, would come after border security and interior enforcement were improved. When the Senate bill was finally introduced, that talking point changed.

Scott Rasmussen, the prolific pollster, criticized the Washington Post’s characterization of Americans unhappy with both Republican and Democrat performances in government as “haters.” Rasmussen said, “Tens of millions of Americans disapprove of the way both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are doing their jobs. According to the hometown paper for America’s political class, this makes them ‘Haters.'”
In a recent poll conducted by the Washington Post, there are three teams in America: the Democrat team, the Republican team, and the Haters Team. Rasmussen says that “This wasn’t just a casual reference by a lazy journalist. Not only did the paper of the political elite produce tables and graphics with the ‘Haters’ label; they wrote an entire article about how ‘Haters Gonna Hate.'” Rasmussen added, “It truly boggles my mind to think that this is the label it intentionally and thoughtfully chose.” 


Rasmussen thinks there are much better labels for those who don’t feel an affinity for either of the first two teams, such as “the adults needed to supervise the behavior of Congress.” Rasmussen believes that many in Congress entered politics with good intentions but that they find themselves in a “corrupt and dysfunctional institution.” He maintains that, no matter what you call those that don’t approve of Republicans or Democrats, you need only to recognize the ineptitude of politicians of both parties to distance oneself from supporting them. 
In Rasmussen’s view, Congress can’t produce a budget, can’t produce a workable health care law, both parties prop up crony capitalism, and Republicans and Democrats alike supported the NSA’s domestic spying. But what disturbs Rasmussen more than Congress’ poor performance is that the Washington Post stigmatizes those who disagree with their elitist political class world view as “haters.” The Post is wrong, according to Rasmussen. “We don’t need to hate anybody to recognize that Congress is doing a lousy job,” he remarks. “Those of us who disapprove of both parties in Congress are simply waiting for Congress to do something worthy of our approval.”

While House Speaker John Boehner is keeping a tight lid on his personal position on immigration reform, conservative activists and lawmakers fear the Republican leader may rubber-stamp Democrats’ controversial legislation in a backroom deal with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
Boehner declined to answer whether he supports what many on the left have come to term a “pathway to citizenship” for illegal immigrants during his appearance on CBS News’ Face The Nation on Sunday morning. For conservative lawmakers, that does not assuage fears that he and his deputies House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Whip Kevin McCarthy, and Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan could be working behind the scenes cut a deal with Reid and President Barack Obama to achieve amnesty for illegal immigrants in America.
“We are scared to death of what we figure is already Boehner’s end game,” a senior congressional GOP aide told Breitbart News. “There are so many forces within the GOP establishment pushing for their interests that it’s hard to conceive that Boehner will not cave to them.”


Boehner could “conference” any bill or group of bills the House passes related to immigration with the Senate’s controversial immigration bill. In conference, representatives for House GOP leadership would negotiate with Senate Democratic leadership, and potentially the White House, on what they would call a “compromise” on immigration reform. 
Conservatives do not trust Boehner and his team to stand up to Senate Democrats in conference, so they are advocating the House refuse to pass any legislation for fear it could be molded into a “compromise” that looks just like or is identical language to the Senate bill. 
Many conservatives fear that such a compromise would only get a short amount of time for actual review, and votes would be whipped up and sold using talking points just like how the Senate bill passed. They point to comments from Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), whose amendment with Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) made a series of massive changes to the bill, where he argued that it is acceptable for senators to work with because they “will have more than 72 hours to read and review the proposal before any votes.”

“The worry among Capitol Hill conservatives was that Boehner would take any House-passed bill with the word ‘immigration’ in it and set up a conference that would produce a bill with the trappings of compromise that would be politically difficult to oppose,” conservative journalist Neil McCabe, a former senior reporter for Human Events, wrote in a recent column for Town Hall magazine.
McCabe’s column, titled “Stockman calls out Boehner gambit to save amnesty agenda,” focuses on efforts Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) has led to uncover how the Senate immigration bill is unconstitutional on the grounds that it raises revenue. As Breitbart News reported last week, House Ways and Means Committee chairman Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), the House authority on tax and revenue issues, agreed with Stockman’s analysis and similarly labeled the bill unconstitutional.
However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid can protect the bill, and a future deal with House GOP leaders, by using a procedural trick in which he holds on to the bill in his chamber of Congress and does not send it over to the House. Though the bill passed the Senate several weeks ago now, Reid has not yet delivered it to the House.
Boehner has not agreed to refuse to salvage the Senate bill, as conservatives like Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) have requested. All indications are that such a conference would not happen until sometime after the August recess, as the opposition to amnesty has slowed proponents of the effort.
Conservative columnist and best-selling author Ann Coulter, who has been warning for months about such a conference strategy by amnesty advocates, believes the House should not pass any immigration bills, regardless of their individual merit. She argues that pro-amnesty lawmakers may use a conference as a vehicle to get the Senate bill or something like it to President Barack Obama’s desk, where he can sign it into law.
“Right now, people who don’t want amnesty have to call the House and say they don’t want any immigration bill until we have a Republican Senate,” Coulter said in a late-June appearance on Fox News Channel’s Hannity. “If they pass a bill that does nothing but enforce e-verify, does nothing but enforce the fence, it will go into conference with the Senate and it will come out an amnesty bill.”
Coulter added that she suspects Boehner “secretly wants” amnesty for illegal immigrants: 


Nothing will happen with a vote to enforce E-verify, which by the way is a one-page simple bill; they could do that right away if they were serious about enforcing the border. But I don’t trust and perhaps I’m wrong, I hope he will prove me wrong. I think John Boehner secretly wants the amnesty and he want as fig leaf to make it took like, “Oh, no we just voted on the fence.” No, a vote on the fence in the House is a vote for amnesty.

“Ann Coulter got it exactly right,” added that senior GOP congressional aide who warned that Republicans are “scared to death” about what Boehner could do.

An investigation by Cincinnati Fox 19 reporter Ben Swann finds that Obama Administration claims that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting of conservative groups was the work of two “rogue” low-level employees in Cincinnati, Ohio, strain credulity and are “falling apart.”
Swann reports that so far six IRS agents working out of the Cincinnati office–which is the central hub for processing tax-exempt applications–have been identified as sending scrutinizing letters to conservative groups. These include: 

Mitchel Steele-IRS Agent
Carly Young-IRS Agent
Joseph Herr-IRS Agent
Stephen Seok-IRS Supervisor
Liz Hofacre-IRS Agent
Ms. Richards (full name unknown)-IRS Agent

These agents report to different managers, with a territory manager overseeing those managers.


Swann explains how the process works:


When an application for tax exempt status comes into the IRS, agents have 270 days to work through that application. If the application is not processed within those 270 days it automatically triggers flags in the system. When that happens, individual agents are required to input a status update on that individual case once a month, every month until the case is resolved.
Keep in mind, at least 300 groups were targeted out of Cincinnati alone. Those applications spent anywhere from 18 months to nearly 3 years in the system and some still don’t have their non-profit status. 300 groups multiplied by at least 18 months for each group, means thousands of red flags would have been generated in the system. 
So who in the chain of command would have received all these flags? The answer, according to the IRS directory, one woman in Cincinnati, Cindy Thomas, the Program Manager of the Tax Exempt Division. Because all six of our IRS workers have different individual and territory managers, Cindy Thomas is one manager they all have common. 
It turns out Cindy Thomas’ name is one we have heard before. The independent journalism group ProPublica says in November of 2012 they had requested information on conservatives groups that had received non-profit status. 

Cindy Thomas, says Swann, is the highest-ranking employee in the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Department in Cincinnati. 
Democrats unleashed a barrage of pointed questions to IRS officials on Wednesday in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) said if witnesses today are not more forthcoming and continue to stonewall the committee, “it will lead to a special prosecutor” in order “to get to the bottom of this.” He warned that “there will be hell to pay if that’s the route we go down.”
“It is possible that criminal activity may have occurred,” said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George.

U.S. District Judge David Campbell handed both sides a partial victory at the first stage in a case challenging Arizona Governor Jan Brewer’s executive order that her state will not issue driver’s licenses to illegal aliens allowed to stay in this country temporarily under President Barack Obama’s amnesty program of not pursuing deportation for many illegal aliens. But the judge also signaled that Brewer was likely to lose this case in the end, and these illegal aliens will end up with Arizona licenses. 
In 2012 Obama issued an executive order creating his temporary amnesty program. After Congress refused to pass Obama’s proposed DREAM Act on enact an immigration bill granting amnesty to millions of foreigners who entered this country illegally, the president violated his constitutional duty to take care to faithfully execute the law by announcing that he would not deport large groups of illegals that he thinks should receive amnesty. A federal judge is Texas recently held the administration’s actions illegal, but that issue has not yet been resolved on appeal.
In response to Obama’s executive order and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano’s subsequent halting of deportations, Brewer issued an order to the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles ordering them to stop accepting federal documents from those illegal aliens granted temporary amnesty for purposes of issuing driver’s licenses. An advocacy group for illegal aliens filed a lawsuit challenging Brewer’s actions in Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer. 


Brewer filed a motion to dismiss the suit, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Brewer’s actions while the lawsuit proceeds. On May 16, Judge Campbell denied both motions. 
Campbell rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Brewer’s order violates the Supremacy Clause by conflicting with federal law. He correctly reasoned that Obama’s order and Napolitano’s follow-up actions carry no force of law under the Constitution, and therefore do not amount to a federal law that would trump state law.
However, Campbell held it was very likely that the plaintiffs’ alternative argument that Brewer’s order violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will ultimately succeed. Although he correctly held that the lowest form of judicial scrutiny–called rational-basis review–is the legal standard for a case like this, he then reasoned that Brewer’s order was likely to fail under even that deferential standard when he issues a final ruling on the merits of this case.

Campbell writes:

 “The Governor’s disagreement with the DACA [amnesty] program may be a rational political or policy view in a broad sense–reasonable people certainly can disagree on an issue as complex and difficult as immigration–but it provides no justification for saying that an Arizona’s driver’s license may be issued to one person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status–say for an individual humanitarian reason–while another person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status under the DACA program is denied a license.”

The court noted that both groups of aliens have their deportation actions deferred through prosecutorial discretion, both have temporary status, both are federally eligible to work, and both have documents that have always been accepted by Arizona for driver’s licenses. Campbell noted that Arizona asserts four bases for why Brewer’s law is rational, but concluded that Brewer’s order blocking one group of illegal aliens from getting licenses, but not the other group, undermined the argument of why her order was reasonably related to advancing the public interests she asserted in court.
Campbell has the pedigree of a conservative judge. A Utah native, he clerked for Justice William Rehnquist (before he became chief justice) on the Supreme Court. The opinion is well-written and gives Brewer her due. It seems unlikely that he will change his mind later in this case, or that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will reverse his decision.
And so the latest fight between Obama and Arizona over immigration continues.

With President Obama’s approval ratings sinking thanks to the failing Obamacare rollout and the unpopular nuclear deal with Iran, Obama broke the media emergency glass to access the MSNBC host Chris Matthews. Matthews, who has compared Obama to Jesus and Henry V, and said that he was “the perfect American,” tossed Obama softball after softball, to which Obama gave stock answer after stock answer.

Matthews began by asking Obama about young people not signing up for health insurance. Obama said they should. Obama then made this stunning statement: “Sometimes on your station, MSNBC, I’ve been blasted for being too willing to compromise.” This nonsense passed without question from Matthews, who obviously was not in the mood to blast the president with anything but waves of hot love.

Matthews asked a question about National Security Agency surveillance. President Obama defended NSA activities, stating, “The NSA actually does a very good job about not engaging in domestic surveillance, not reading people’s emails.” He then added, wrongly, that outside of American borders, the NSA was “not constrained by laws.”

But that did not prompt a follow-on from Matthews. Instead, Matthews played a clip of John F. Kennedy speaking at American University, obviously attempting to link Obama with JFK. “”How do we get back to that confidence that we can solve our man-made problems and other problems?” Matthews drooled. Obama responded, “I have that confidence,” explaining that America was “on the brink of energy independence,” and stating that America is “still the envy of the world.” 
Then Obama turned to the attack, stating that “Congress” is the big problem, since it “spends too much time worrying about the next election and not enough time worrying about the next generation.” Which part of the Congress? Obama explained: “The challenge we’ve got is we’ve got a faction of the Republican Party that sees compromise as a dirty word, that has moved so far to the right that it would be difficult for a Ronald Reagan to win the nomination of the Republican Party at this point.”

Matthews never uttered a word of disagreement. Instead, with all the subtly of a sledgehammer, Matthews goaded Obama on: “You’ve got three and a half more years to deal with this situation.”
And Obama took the bait, stating that in order for big things to happen, he had to have a Congressional majority. “The only thing that’s stopping [progress on issues like immigration] at this point is…a faction in the House Republican Party that is resistant,” Obama stated. He added that he believes that Republicans have “got to be embarrassed.”
Matthews, in full-on history professor mode, then turned to a 1964 poll showing that Americans believed that the federal government did the right thing most of the time. With forlorn hope in his eyes, he asked Obama, “What’s going to arrest that decline in that faith in you doing the right thing?” Obama solemnly intoned, “the cynicism and the skepticism is deep.” 

Which brought the interview to the Bash Bush segment. Talking about the glories of the federal government, Obama praised the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Craig Fugate. “He’s really doing a good job, unlike his predecessor,” Matthews agreed, apparently referring to former FEMA head Michael Brown. Obama, picking up on the Bush-bashing, referred back to President Bush’s infamous statement that Brown had done a “heckuva job” in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina: Fugate, Obama said, was “doing a heckuva job.” That meant, Obama continued, that the federal government was great at doing things, but that the media never covered those wonderful accomplishments – an odd contention given the media’s nonstop coverage of the Obama administration’s handling of Hurricane Sandy just before Election 2012.
But that wasn’t Obama’s point. He wanted to argue that the media wasn’t paying attention to FEMA but was paying attention to the IRS scandal, in which the IRS targeted Tea Party 501(c)(4) organizations. The IRS had targeted those organizations, Obama explained, for “bureaucratic reasons,” and “suddenly everybody is outraged.” Matthews nodded, “501(c)4 law is tricky to begin with.” 
Obama continued, “There are a couple million people working for the federal government…Someone at this very moment is screwing something up.” But Obama said that he’d try to rein in all of these nefarious actors: “I have to consistently push…how can we do things better?” He then called for “reorganiziation” of the government, saying that it was designed in 1934-35. 
In completing his longwinded answer about why Americans had lost confidence in government, Obama blamed Ronald Reagan, who said government was the problem. That notion, Obama said, was damaging to the country: “Government’s not somebody else. Government’s us.”

Smiling warmly, Matthews then asked, “Let’s talk about the chief executive, you.” He continued, “There’s all kinds of theories about how to be president…There should have been a CEO assigned by you…to oversee the rollout of healthcare.” He finished, “It seemed like there wasn’t a strong, top-down authority structure from you…What is your system?”
Obama said that the failure of Obamacare’s rollout was an outlier. The government, he insisted, had worked beautifully in all of its other aspects under his administration.:”It is important to distinguish between this particular project, where it is obvious that we needed additional controls in place because it didn’t deliver on time the way we wanted, and how we’ve managed incredibly complex problems over the past five years.” Obama then said he’d hold “every cabinet member accountable” – although apparently not Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – and then laughably added, “I have an open door policy where I want people to be bringing me bad news on time so we can fix things. The challenge I think we have going forward is not so much my personal management style…it actually has to do with what I referred to earlier. We have these big agencies.” That open door policy has meant that according to the White House, Obama was out of the loop on the IRS scandal, the DOJ’s targeting of journalists, the security situation in Libya, and every other scandal undergone by the administration.
Then the interview got truly bad. Matthews read a Twitter question: “What can we do to stop #GOP rigging the vote state by state to disenfranchise our voters & destroy our democracy?” 
Without challenging the premise of the question, Matthews then stated, “Everybody knows the game, Republicans often admit the game.” Obama answered by blasting voter ID laws. 
Just before the commercial break, Obama wrapped up in typical Obama style: he blamed everyone else. “You may agree with me or disagree with me, but don’t make the mistake of thinking it all ends with me,” he said. 
MSNBC then cut to break by playing a segment from Obama’s 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention in a blatant effort to breathe some magic into the wilting commander-in-chief.
Back from break, the awkward date continued. MSNBC played a clip of Obama saying he would run for president in 2007, followed by a clip of a slightly-less-frazzled Matthews, who proclaimed, “This is going to be remembered as a great day in American politics.”
Fast forward six years. Matthews hadn’t changed. He proceeded to ask Obama about his newfound focus on income inequality – and then he said that as a Roman Catholic, he found Obama’s redistributionism “So resonant with what the Holy Father…would say.” 
Obama then blessed the Pope, stating, “I think Pope Francis is showing himself to be an extraordinarily thoughtful and soulful messenger of peace and justice.”
Finally, Obama turned to the role of government. As it turns out, Obama thinks the government can do virtually everything. Whether “creating the internet” or “curing diseases,” Obama stated, “there are some things we do better together, and we should take pride as a nation in our ability to work in concert.” He said that all of America’s future rested on American buying into the notion of government handling all of our big problems: “In fact the big challenges we have…those are not things that Chris Matthews or Barack Obama can solve for ourselves. By necessity we’re going to have to do those together. If we can at least agree on that…then we can figure out the specific policies and that’s where we can compromise or negotiate.” He then added, as an afterthought, “I won’t compromise” regarding the implementation of Obamacare. 
Matthews, thoroughly pleased with how the interview was going, asked President Obama to answer “a little question you might not like to answer”: Hillary or Biden? Obama demurred, but stated that Biden would “go down in history as one of the best vice presidents ever.”
With the interview winding down, Matthews asked Obama the truly substantive question Americans were dying to hear answered: what’s the most important quality in being president? Obama gave his stock answer: “A sense of connection with the American people.” He then compared himself to Lincoln, FDR, Truman, and Kennedy, and added, “The interesting thing about now having been president for five years is it makes you humble as opposed to cockier about what you as an individual can do. You recognize that you’re part of a sweep of history, and your job is to push the boulder up the hill a little bit.”
Matthews finally asked Obama about running for office, praising him to the skies for sticking to politics after losing a Congressional race in 2000. “How many kids here want to go into politics. Are they right?” Matthews asked.
That essay question allowed Obama to wax poetic: “It continues to be a way to serve that I think can be noble. It’s hard. It can be frustrating, you have to have a thick skin.” He then said that he understood why Americans would join a nonprofit or start a business, noting, “We’re not completely government centered.” Then he said that he found it rewarding when people came up to him and said, “My kid’s alive because you passed that healthcare bill.” Really. “It’s pretty hard to get greater satisfaction than that,” he concluded.
The panel of Joy Reid, Howard Fineman, and David Corn then attempted to spin Obama back to the halcyon days of 2007, before he was president, with all three labeling Obama warm, open, and idealistic. Perhaps the only honest moment came from Fineman, who observed that Obama had now moved “from Superman to Sisyphus.”

National radio host Rush Limbaugh praised former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for taking TODAY show host Matt Lauer “to the cleaners” Monday by refusing to buy progressive media’s talking points about Americans losing insurance and Republicans needing to appeal more to moderates than their base to win elections. 
Regarding the five percent of Americans that the White House conceded were losing their health insurance plans after President Barack Obama had promised that would not happen under Obamacare, Limbaugh said these were merely just the “first wave of cancellations,” and eventually Obamacare will impact “everybody,” because all of the plans will eventually not qualify “by design.” 
“Where do you get this five percent?” Palin asked Lauer. 



It’s not five percent. It’s most Americans will not be able to keep the healthcare policy and programs that they had desired. The new programs that are being forced down our throat are unaffordable. Some of them are still being told, “Well if you like that insurance policy and that coverage, you still will be able to keep it, it’s just going to cost you a little bit more.” That’s the point. If it’s going to cost you more, then it’s not the same policy.

Limbaugh praised Palin for her response and then said she took Lauer “to the cleaners” for also calling him out on the misguided “trick” the mainstream media always use on Republicans to get them to nominate candidates who will lose in the general election. 

“Remember that old saw what the Democrat consultants always used to tell the Republicans and they would believe it?,” Limbaugh said. “The Republican Party gets tricked so easily. They get tricked into not criticizing Obama, they get tricked into not being for what they should be for, and they even get tricked into campaigning for only 20% of the vote.”

Limbaugh blasted consultants for turning candidates “into squishy, linguini-spined moderates, on the theory that’s how you get the independents.”
“So the Republicans have been tricked into shutting up, and every four years they’ve been tricked into campaigning for 20% of the voting public, the independents,” Limbaugh said. “They’re winning the independents and they’re losing elections. You know why? Because they are abandoning their base, and the assumption is the base is always gonna be with you, but the Tea Party is not the case.”
Limbaugh made the point that now that independents are abandoning Obama, the media are calling them “moderates.”  
“The independents–and I know who you are, and you independents know who you are, and you were made to feel special by the media. You were portrayed as the really smart people,” Limbaugh said. “You weren’t ideologues. You decided things issue by issue. You had open minds, not closed minds. You weren’t bigots like the Tea Party. Oh, no, no, no! You independents, you were the cream of the crop–until you stopped voting for Democrats. Now you’re dirt. Now you’re scum.”
He praised Palin for her response to Lauer, whom he blasted for repeating mainstream media talking points that his producer gave him. 
“When you stand in the middle of the road, you’re going to get hit on both sides of the road,” Palin said. “We need to take a stand, especially on this Obamacare, and support those who are just fulfilling their campaign promises. So many politicians ran for reelection and for election saying they would do anything in their power to de-fund the statist socialized medicine program called Obamacare.”

A one-time Democrat Minneapolis mayoral candidate was beaten up by two teen girls at the Mall of America after his iPhone was stolen by a third accomplice, reports say.
Mark Andrew, a former Minnesota Democrat Party chairman and recent losing candidate for  mayor of Minneapolis, was in a Starbucks at the gigantic mall when the incident occurred.
Andrew told the media that he had just finished a call and placed his iPhone 4S on the table when a young man came up to the table, grabbed the phone, and ran. Andrew gave chase immediately but was quickly confronted by two teenaged girls just outside the coffee shop.


One of the girls was armed with a billy club and began to smack Andrew over the head with the stick.
The former politician said he grabbed one of the girls who then gouged her fingernails into his face screaming, “I’m going to kill you! Let me go or I’m going to kill you.”
Andrew says that dozens of shoppers were standing around watching but no one moved to help.

Police arrived soon enough to catch the two girls who initially tried to claim that Andrew attacked them first. Witness told police another story and the two were taken into custody.
The male thief dropped the cell phone in an attempt to get away and Andrew got his phone back.
Police arrested Letaija Shapree Cutler-Cain, 18, and a 17-year-old accomplice whose name was not released because she is a minor.

“In my estimation, these kids are damaged,” Andrew told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. “They have to be held accountable. The juvenile may be too far gone. She was extremely violent. I believe she was trying to kill me, and her actions supported her statement. She was swinging as hard as she could.”
Andrew, who currently owns an environmental marketing firm called GreenMark, received nine stitches for a gash on his head. He also sustained several cuts and abrasions on his face.
“I was targeted because the phone was out and I’m 63 years old, and I’m sure they thought that I was easy pickins,” Andrew said.

As spring break begins for schoolchildren across the country, thousands of students will travel to Washington, DC. The trips, funded by bake sales and other events throughout the year, will allow the students to take in Washington’s historic landmarks. 
One premier destination is off-limits this year, however. A few weeks ago, the Obama Administration announced it was suspending public, self-guided tours of the White House as a result of the automatic sequester cuts that the administration proposed in 2011. While America’s students stand outside the White House fence, the First Daughters, Sasha and Malia, are enjoying spring break with friends at the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. 



Breitbart News’ Matt Boyle broke the news Monday morning that numerous sources have reported seeing the First Daughters in the Bahamas this weekend. Presumably, the Obamas are paying the costs of the resort out of their own pockets. The robust Secret Service detail that must accompany the First Daughters, however, is funded by taxpayers. 

The principal reason the White House canceled public tours was to save money on Secret Service staff. The White House reported that suspending the tours would save $74,000 a week. Other reports have put the savings at just $18,000 a week. 
Whichever the true amount, the Secret Service detail necessary to protect the First Daughters on their spring break could likely have been used to keep the White House open to the rest of America’s school children. Judicial Watch reported that Malia Obama’s Spring Break in Mexico last year cost taxpayers over $115,000. That amount would cover 2-6 weeks of White House tours. 
At the very least, it would ensure that, this spring break, thousands of America’s students could cap their trip to DC with a uniquely American tradition–a tour of the White House.

The National Immigration Forum (NIF), the force behind the so-called “Evangelical Immigration Table” (EIT), is actually a front group for players on the institutional left including billionaire George Soros and the Ford Foundation, according to reporting by Breitbart News and other outlets.
According to the Huffington Post, EIT is running a $250,000 advertising campaign in favor of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. Even so, EIT admitted to Breitbart News it does not legally exist as an incorporated political entity or non-profit organization but said NIF is the group that “facilitates” its activities. 


NIF is a power player in immigration politics, and includes among its leadership some of the most powerful Washington figures on the issue.
In 2009, OSI donated $257,152 to NIF aimed at “implementing immigration reform campaign through communications, policy, and field organizing.”
Also in 2009, OSI donated another $1.5 million to “allow” NIF to “manage and lead Four Pillars Campaign for comprehensive immigration reform, and sustain core policy work supporting and leading policy efforts.”

A year later, in 2010, Soros’s OSI gave NIF another $1.5 million over two separate grants both intended for “general operating support.”
NIF has also received $1 million total from the leftist Ford Foundation, spread over two separate half-million-dollar grants in 2009 and 2011. Those grants were both intended for advocacy in favor of comprehensive immigration reform.
Jim Wallis, the president and CEO of Sojourners, a leading force in the Evangelical Immigration Table group, has admitted to accepting funding from Soros as well. 
World magazine writer Marvin Olasky laid out in a 2010 article how Wallis and his organization, Sojourners, had received $325,000 from Soros groups over three grants from 2004, 2006 and 2007. According to OSI’s 2007 990 form filed with the IRS, available publicly through the Foundation Center, the 2007 money–a total of $100,000–was for Wallis’s Sojourners “to support the Christians for Comprehensive Immigration Reform Campaign.”
Wallis originally denied being funded by Soros when he was first confronted with the accusation, and accused Olasky of lying. “It’s not hyperbole or overstatement to say that Glenn Beck lies for a living. I’m sad to see Marvin Olasky doing the same thing,” Wallis said in 2010 interview with Patheos. “No, we don’t receive money from Soros. Given the financial crisis of nonprofits, maybe Marvin should call Soros and ask him to send us money.”

“So, no, we don’t receive money from George Soros,” Wallis added. “Our books are totally open, always have been. Our money comes from Christians who support us and who read Sojourners. That’s where it comes from. In fact, we’ve had funding blocked, this year and last, by liberal foundations who didn’t like our stance on abortion. Other liberal groups were happy to point out to them that our stance wasn’t kosher on abortion, so our funding was blocked.”
After Olasky and the National Review‘s Jay Richards confronted this claim by Wallis, Wallis admitted he made an incorrect statement to Patheos and that he was accepting Soros money. “I should have declined to comment until I was able to review the blog post in question and consulted with our staff on the details of our funding over the past several years,” Wallis said in a statement. 
“Instead, I answered in the spirit of the accusation and did not recall the details of our funding over the decade in question. The spirit of the accusation was that Sojourners is beholden to funders on the political left, which is false. The allegation concerned three grants received over 10 years from the Open Society Institute that made up the tiniest fraction of Sojourners’ funding during that decade–so small that I hadn’t remembered them.”
While that original Soros funding may have been almost a decade old when it was uncovered, Wallis has subsequently accepted more money from the leftist billionaire. In a 2011 story, Olasky noted that Wallis had confirmed to him he accepted another $150,000 from Soros for a grant that would take hold in 2012.
Interestingly enough, even though evangelicals are receiving funding from Soros and his groups, his official website notes that he “identifies himself as an atheist.”
Soros is also well known for his pro-amnesty, open borders positions on immigration.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) will lead a tour of House leaders next week aimed at educating Americans, and each other, about the history and importance of immigration to the United States. The tour, dubbed the “Become America” tour, will feature events and speeches aimed at overcoming opposition to the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, which has stumbled amidst opposition from conservatives.
“The lawmakers will attend events on Ellis Island and at the Museum of Jewish Heritage and the African Burial Ground National Monument, according to an itinerary of the trip,” Politico reported late Wednesday evening. “Leaders will speak at a naturalization ceremony, and the group will also have a breakfast meeting at Gracie Mansion with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a key advocate of immigration reform.”


In 2009, Cantor led a “listening tour” across the nation, bringing Republican leaders to meet with voters to discuss how the party could improve its policies and its political fortunes. The “Become America” tour, by contrast, will be less about listening to voters and more about educating them, since Republican leaders are convinced that the “nativist” faction within their party is the reason they cannot pass immigration reform.

The trip is being coordinated by the non-profit Faith & Politics Institute, and will include members of both parties, such as Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), a persistent advocate of amnesty for illegal immigrants. In April, Guiterrez told a wealthy audience in Chicago that they owed it to the people who “wash the dishes” and “take care of your kids and mow your lawn” to support a path to U.S. citizenship for illegal aliens.
Officially, the “Become America” tour is meant to improve relations among the members of Congress who attend. But given the backdrop of pending immigration legislation, it is also clearly aimed at enabling those members to campaign for passage of a bill–any bill–that satisfies President Barack Obama’s demands. The president has said he will not sign immigration legislation that does not include a path to citizenship.
In June, only 6% of Americans said that immigration was the most important issue facing the country, up from 4% in April, according to Gallup polls. The economy, unemployment, dissatisfaction with government, health care, the federal debt/deficit, and family/moral decline were all listed as more important to Americans than immigration reform. No congressional tours have been planned to address those issues.

Barack Obama is coming under fire for his willingness to bypass Congress when implementing his agenda in contravention of the Constitution’s desire for three equal branches of government. GOP congressmen speaking at a House Judiciary Committee meeting this week were blunt about Obama’s defiance of the traditional negotiation with Congress.

Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) blasted that Obama “doesn’t have a debate in the Oval Office about what he wants to do … he does what he wants to do, and then you no longer have representative democracy.” GOP members noted that Obama has acted unilaterally on issues ranging from immigration laws, which he ignores, to consistent and enormous revisions of ObamaCare, which was passed as law.


Even Obama supporter Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, had the temerity to question his Obama’s methods, although he felt compelled to include George W. Bush when he commented, “The problem of what the president is doing is that he is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he is becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid: that is, the concentration of power in any single branch.”
Of course, there are the other Obama acolytes who will defend him. Simon Lazarus, Senior Counsel for the Constitutional Accountability Center, said that Obama’s changes to ObamaCare after it was already passed do not conflict with Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which requires the president to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Lazarus loftily intoned,  “I have to say that hyperventilating about how extraordinary and unprecedented and unconstitutional these delays are is just that, it’s hyperventilation and it’s contrary to obvious historical fact.” 

Should we be surprised by Obama’s circumvention? This is the same man who boasted in March 2012, “If Congress refuses to act, I’ll do everything in my power to act without them.” 
Although there was a suggestion before the House Committee that the only way to solve the problem would be to impeach Obama, the reality is that the Democratic-controlled Senate would shoot that down. Those who called for impeachment concluded that the only real answer “comes down to elections.”

In a Sunday Washington Times column, Drudge Report editor Joseph Curl takes a look at the difference between how the last two White House occupants, President Bush and President Obama, approached vacationing as president. Curl reveals that unlike Obama, Bush was concerned with public perception (especially during the war in Iraq) and made an effort  to schedule holiday vacations in a way that wouldn’t take others away from their families — even a media that despised him: 
 “I think playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal,” [President George W. Bush] said years later. “I don’t want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the commander in chief playing golf. I feel I owe it to the families to be in solidarity as best as I can with them.” 


That’s also why Mr. Bush did two other things, without fanfare or praise. First, he never headed home to his Texas ranch until after Christmas, instead going to Camp David for a few days. That way, the hundreds of people revolving around him at all times — White House staff, Secret Service agents, reporters, photographers, all the others — could spend the holiday with their families in and around Washington, D.C. No one ever reported that — until this column.
Second, he rarely attended sporting events, although he once owned a baseball team and was a self-confessed stats junkie. His thinking there was the same: If he went to a baseball game (right down the street from the White House), his mere presence would mean hours and hours of extra security for fans.
Conversely, Obama, who never has to worry  about the media turning against him (including lying for weeks about a terror attack in Libya), doesn’t give a damn about public perception — not during a recession; not even during a time when sequester cuts are being blamed for the closing of White House tours and airport control towers:

How else to explain the nonstop vacations the pair keep taking during what Mr. Obama calls the “worst financial crisis since the Great Depression”? In 2013, the First Family has already enjoyed three vacations — that’s one a month. (Sorry, Joe America, you might have to forget your week at the beach again this year, but make sure you get those taxes in on time!)
Curl closes the piece (which you will want to read in full) by making the point about how much this juxtaposition tells you about Obama. And indeed it does. But I would add that it also reveals just as much about our media.

House Speaker John Boehner appears to have put to rest rumors that he may break what is informally called the “Hastert Rule,” an unwritten guideline that a majority of the majority party should be needed to bring a bill to the House floor, in order to pass a version of amnesty like the “Gang of Eight” bill currently moving through the Senate.
A source with direct knowledge of these matters told Breitbart News that Boehner has decided to abide by the Hastert Rule in regards to immigration reform. “No immigration bill will be brought to the floor for a vote without a majority of the Republican conference in support,” the source told Breitbart News on Monday.
Around Washington, conservatives have worried that Boehner may back down from conservative principles on immigration and support the Gang of Eight bill. They fear he may rush the bill to the floor if the Senate passes it and try to move it through the House with a majority of Democratic votes. 


Even though those rumors continue to fly, signs now indicate that Boehner will not break the Hastert Rule and will only bring a bill to the floor with the support of the majority of Republicans.

Reports from Ryan Lizza at The New Yorker and David Drucker at the Washington Examiner appear to support the idea that Boehner will not break with Republicans. It did take Rep. Steve King (R-IA) banding together more than 50 of his colleagues to call for a special GOP conference meeting on the topic, at which they expressed their dissatisfaction with the Senate bill and their hope that Boehner will stick to the Hastert Rule. 
In addition to King’s efforts, conservative groups have circulated letters around Washington calling on the conference to formally codify the Hastert Rule into the House GOP conference rules so that it must be followed, instead of just being a guideline.

Gov. Rick Scott (R-FL) on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have required Florida hand out driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, a sign he is taking a stand against the left in favor of conservatism. 
“Florida is home to immigrants of many nationalities, who add to the cultural fabric of our great state, and whose productivity and hard work have contributed to our economic turnaround,” Scott said in his official letter to Florida Secretary of State Kenneth Detzner announcing the veto. “Still, our nation struggles with immigration issues every day, as Americans seek to reconcile the fact that at one point our families were immigrants who came, as many do today, to work and live the American dream with the fact that the federal government has failed at enforcing the nation’s laws on this topic.”
Scott went on to detail the inconsistencies of immigration policy coming out of Janet Napolitano’s Department of Homeland Security and President Barack Obama’s administration at large.


“Despite the federal government’s inability to enforce the nation’s current immigration laws or to find common ground on how to change them, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in a June 2012 memo the immediate establishment of a ‘Deferred Action Process for Childhood Arrivals,'” Scott wrote. “Through this process DHS provides that a young person illegally brought to the United States as a child will not be subject to removal if the individual meets certain criteria.” 

“Qualifying for deferred action status does not confer substantive rights or lawful status upon an individual; it does not create a pathway to a green card or citizenship; nor does it extend to any family members of the person granted the status either,” he explained. “Deferred action status is simply a policy of the Obama Administration, absent Congressional direction, designed to dictate removal action decisions using DHS agency discretion. It was never passed by Congress, nor is it a promulgated rule.”
The institutional left and Florida Democrats are furious that Scott would make such a move. Democrat state Sen. Darren Soto called Scott’s veto an “anti-Hispanic bomb.”
“Make no mistake about it: This will be an anti-Hispanic bomb if he vetoes this bill,” Soto, a sponsor of the legislation, said before Scott officially vetoed the bill according to the National Journal. “The vast majority of my peers understand we need to encourage immigrants to become working members of our society. It makes no sense that the Scott administration would veto something it’s already doing.”
The Florida House Democrat who also sponsored the bill, Rep. Randolph Bracy, tried to argue Scott’s veto foils plans to move the national Republican party as a whole toward amnesty. “I thought the party was moving in that direction and was behind this bill, and then the governor just comes out of nowhere and does this,” Bracy said according to National Journal. “Republicans have been talking as a party about Hispanic outreach, and this was only a small step.”

In a blockbuster one-hour investigative special that aired on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Friday, Peter Schweizer, Steve Bannon, and Sean Hannity exposed how Washington, D.C. has extracted power and money from the United States into a centralized location to become the country’s greatest “boomtown,” despite not creating anything.
Schweizer, the president of the nonpartisan Government Accountability Institute, highlighted how the permanent political class that relies on lobbying and influence peddling makes more money by “growing the size of government,” which leaves no incentive on either side of the aisle to limit government.
As a result, he noted the three richest counties and seven of the top ten wealthiest counties in the nation are in the Washington, D.C. region. The District also consumes the most fine wine in the nation. He asserted the business in Washington is now “not politics” but “money.” 


Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, said the best and the brightest now come to Washington because they see Washington as a Tammany Hall that will allow them to get rich off of influence peddling. He noted that Washington D.C. runs the equivalent of a $4 trillion private equity fund every year and essentially doles out 25% of the country’s wealth to those who are connected. 
“Nobody has ever turned a camera on them,” Bannon said, indicating he intends to change that in the future. “This is a permanent political class that has now formed an aristocracy. That’s why nothing has changed in Washington.”
Bannon explained people arrive in Washington as country lawyers and then decide to “turn the business of government into a family business” by having their wives and kids work in lobbying.  

“And this is how they become a permanent political class,” he concluded. 
Hannity mentioned that Washington politicians “kick money back to family, friends, or people that hire them when they retire.”
And Schweizer concurred. He claimed the permanent political class is bipartisan and those who are a part of this permanent aristocracy either marry or are born into it. 
Schweizer noted former Mississippi Senator Trent Lott, a Republican, and former Louisiana Senator John Breaux, a Democrat, partnering up to lobby after they left Congress. He cited Republican Rep. Bill Young of Florida whose daughter-in-law does defense lobbying while he sits on one of the most powerful subcommittees dealing with defense issues. 
Schweizer also pointed out that Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) has two sons who have also lobbied for projects in which their father was involved. 

According to Schweizer, this type of bipartisan nepotism that would not be tolerated in corporations is why “political debates are like professional wrestling, it’s not always what it appears to be.”
“It’s a massive cultural problem in Washington, D.C.,” he lamented, adding that the problem is going to get worse. 
Bannon said if one follows the money, it is clear there is no incentive for the permanent political class to cut spending. And because there is not an incentive to cut spending, Bannon said, Americans are stuck with a party of “big government” and a junior partner that is the party of “little big government.” Unfortunately, Bannon said the country lacks a party that is truly focused on limited government.  
“There is no pressure on them to cut. Washington controls the money. They have an industrial logic to the business model,” he explained. “The permanent political class of both political parties are benefiting from it.”
Hannity promised more segments in the future with Bannon and Schweizer as they make Americans more aware of the rampant crony capitalism Washington’s permanent political class tries its best hide.

President Barack Obama built his 2008 presidential campaign on a new brand of politics, one where the two parties could come together in the best interests of the country.
Nothing of the sort transpired, as we all know now. Five years later, Obama and his acolytes can’t wait to trash members of the GOP who dare stretch a toe over the ideological line toward the President.


Two new examples: a MoveOn.org effort to paint Paul Ryan (R-WI) as racist for using the term “anchor babies” in an immigration talk, and Organizing for Action branding Marco Rubio (R-FL) a “climate denier.”

Both Ryan and Rubio have been generally supportive of the “Gang of 8” Senate immigration bill, one that most conservatives have unabashedly decried.
This afternoon, a group of liberal Wisconsinites will gather at Monument Square in Racine, WI to demand Ryan apologize for using an “offensive anti-immigrant slur”–anchor babies–while discussing immigration reform. The petition began on MoveOn.org’s online petition platform.
A press release announcing the protest featured this battle cry: 

As a former vice-presidential nominee and key player in the GOP’s future, Rep. Ryan knows better than to resort to language that only serves to rile up the fringe, anti-immigrant segment of his party. If he wants to attract Republican voters to truly bipartisan reform efforts, this isn’t the way to do it.

That comes on the heels of Obama’s constant campaign arm saying Rubio publicly mocked basic science by not falling in lockstep surrounding the left’s global warming hysteria. Here’s some of the text Organizing for Action sent to its members:

If we want to make progress on climate change, we need everyone in Congress on board for a solution. It’s our job to show them there’s a price to pay for being a climate denier.

Hope and Change? More like Chicago-style politics powered by a dash of Thought Police enforcement.

19193	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/30/Cruz-vs-Gregory-5-Lessons	Opinion	0	None	None	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) put on a masterclass in his appearance on NBC News’ Meet the Press with David Gregory on Sunday. In less than twenty minutes, Cruz not only demolished Democrat arguments–as transmitted by the ever-eager Gregory–but also showed a keen insight into debate tactics that Republicans often lack. Here are the five key tactics, which should be studied and drilled into Republican politicians in media training.



1. Question the premise. On two separate occasions, Cruz pushed back against the implicit assumptions in questions Gregory asked–assumptions designed by Gregory to put Cruz on the defensive. In each case, Cruz challenged the question itself before answering, and then used his answer to return to the offensive.
In the first case, Gregory implied Cruz had not engaged in a “debate” about how to “change” Obamacare:

GREGORY: It’s interesting. Democrats say, “You know, the problem with Senator Cruz’s position is that it’s a purist position.” There are problems with Obamacare. The White House admits that. We talked about polling in some quarters indicating great dissatisfaction with the law, as you’re talking about in Town Hall meetings. But you have to engaged in a debate about how they change the law. What you’ve gone out and said is, “Let’s kill the law all together. Let’s de-fund it.”
CRUZ: Actually, with respect, David, I think the premise of your question is wrong. It is the Democrats who have taken the absolutist position. Look, I’ve engaged– I’d like to repeal every word of the law. But that wasn’t my position, even in this fight.

That turnabout created headlines, drawing public attention to the refusal of Democrats to compromise.

In the second case, Gregory brutally distorted a remark by Cruz about Neville Chamberlain:

GREGORY: Do you regret comparing the future of Obamacare to the rise of Hitler in Nazi Germany?
CRUZ: Well, the premise of your question isn’t true. I didn’t make that comparison. What I said is that there have been many voices in Washington who’ve said, “We can’t do this, we can’t do this, we can’t do this.” And I went through the contracts where, over and over again, when facing big challenges, Americans have risen to the occasion, whether it was the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, whether it was going to the moon under John F. Kennedy, or whether it was winning the Cold War.

The addition of Kennedy at the end–to counter Gregory’s false Hitler reference–was a nice touch.
2. Stick to the message. Gregory wanted to make the interview all about a government shutdown. Cruz kept his own answers focused on Obamacare. That frustrated Gregory, who nearly lost his composure: “You’re making an argument….You’ve made all these arguments. My goodness, you went and spoke for 21 hours to make these arguments. You haven’t moved anyone.” Cruz, in contrast, looked calm and focused–and kept the debate on terms where he had the distinct advantage, given Obamacare’s unpopularity.
An additional note on this point: Democrats, having been through the talking-points-factory that is left-wing media training (and produces such robots as Debbie Wasserman Schultz), are very good at sticking to their message, but largely because they simply keep repeating it, regardless of the circumstances. What Cruz did was different, and more effective: he found a way to make his message relevant to each context in the debate.
3. Cite your opponents’ supporters in your favor. Gregory came armed with quotes from Republicans and Beltway conservatives who disapprove of what Cruz is doing. Cruz countered, as he did frequently on the Senate floor, with direct quotes from Democrats’ core constituents, including Teamsters Union leader James Hoffa, who has led a new surge of opposition to Obamacare from the left. Cruz’s ready access to the Hoffa quote also shows the importance of research and preparation, and reflects well on his political staff.
4. Never forget your constituency. My favorite moment in the interview was when Gregory read Cruz an extended quote from George Will, and Cruz responded by saying, effectively, that Will only represents his own view, while a Senator from Texas represents millions of voters who knew what they were getting:

GREGORY: George Will, who’s been a conservative columnist for The Washington Post and others, has been very supportive of you in the past. But he wrote this, this week. I want to have you respond to it…
CRUZ: Look, I’m just trying to fight for 26 million Texans and for the American people. And I’m pretty sure George Will, in that column, argued that what we should be doing is delaying Obamacare, which is exactly what the House of Representatives just voted to do.

5. Believe that your opponent secretly agrees with you. Gregory is certainly on the left, but Cruz never treated him as an enemy. Rather, he approached the host as if he could be brought ’round, given the true facts. The above quote, about George Will, is instructive. Note that Cruz did not say that Will was wrong–instead, he found a point of agreement within Will’s column and emphasized that. By finding ways to show that his opponents might actually agree with him, Cruz encouraged even skeptical viewers to ask themselves whether they might, as well. And his supporters had plenty to cheer without watching yet another Republican guest try to earn points with the press by backtracking on previous convictions.

According to new national polling data from Pew Research, the American people have revolted against President Barack Obama’s and the GOP establishment’s efforts to grant amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants through comprehensive immigration reform.
“Only about a third of the public (32%) approves of the job Obama is doing on immigration policy; 60% disapprove,” Pew wrote. “Obama’s ratings for this issue among Democrats are mixed: About half (53%) approve of his handling of the issue while 42% disapprove.”
Obama’s 60 percent disapproval rating on immigration from the American people is an all-time high for him on the issue and puts him on par with former President George W. Bush’s immigration polling numbers. Obama’s immigration disapproval rating has skyrocketed as he has ramped up his efforts to lobby Congress for the passage of an amnesty–particularly the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.


As the American people have learned more and more about the Gang of Eight bill and the effects which amnesty and a drastic influx of millions of new workers would have on the hurting economy, they have grown more and more outraged with what Washington, D.C., is doing regarding immigration reform. In February–before Obama and lawmakers like Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and DIck Durbin (D-IL) began their push for immigration reform–the President’s immigration policy approval rating among the American people, according to Pew, was higher than his disapproval rating. His approval rating on immigration then was 44 percent, whereas his disapproval rating was 43 percent.
Over the next several months, the Obama administration worked with the Senate Democrats and a handful of Senate Republicans to develop the more-than-thousand-page-long Gang of Eight bill. The administration helped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rush the bill to the floor with hardly any substantive review from members, staffers, the media, and the American people.
In mid-June, before the Senate bill passed and as its ultimate passage became questionable, Obama’s Pew Research disapproval rating on immigration spiked up to 47 percent, and his approval rating on the issue dropped to 43 percent. With the public beginning to turn against amnesty, the Senators pushing for it cobbled together a series of amendments designed to win over extra votes in the Senate–like the Corker-Hoeven plan for their votes, casino kickbacks for Sen. Dean Heller’s vote, “Lobster Bait” for Susan Collins’ vote, and a seafood processing deal for Lisa Murkowski’s vote, among others–and rammed the bill through to final passage in the Senate.

Since then, Obama’s immigration disapproval rating, according to Pew, has skyrocketed to 60 percent. That disapproval rating is higher than George W. Bush’s ever was, according to a Pew chart on page 12 of the report, save one exception: in April 2006, Bush’s immigration disapproval rating reached 62 percent.
As Obama’s disapproval ratings reach all-time highs because of his support for amnesty, Republicans keep the issue alive. While House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) says the issue will not receive any votes in the House in 2013, which is probably true, the effort to grant amnesty from House GOP leadership is alive and well–and likely to continue in early 2014. 
Officials like Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) keep offering Obama cover by continuing to push for some kind of immigration package. In an interview this week with Bloomberg’s Al Hunt, Priebus continued pushing for amnesty.
“I think it can happen, and I think people like Paul Ryan and others still want something like that to happen,” Priebus said this week. “It could happen next year, I don’t think there’s any sort of midnight hour here.”
Ryan is in the process of drafting a bill that would grant America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants legal status. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said this summer at a town hall event in Racine, Wisconsin. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”

Priebus and Ryan, if they keep pushing down this road, face the fate of what happened to Senator Rubio after he pushed for amnesty. Rubio has since backed off the push and publicly undercut the efforts of House GOP leadership to pass any group of piecemeal bills with the goal of getting to a conference committee negotiation with the Democratic Senate–from which a comprehensive immigration reform conference report like the Senate bill would arise. Rubio’s backtracking on the issue, and complete reversal of support for his own bill, came after the American people turned on him for supporting such a plan. Polling data over the past several months showed the once-promising presidential candidate tanking among Republican voters. 
House GOP leadership could technically kill this once and for all by promising publicly what Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) has advocated: that there will never be a conference committee with the Senate bill. However, they have left the door open, as pressure from lobbyists and groups funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to pass an amnesty.
If such legislation as the Gang of Eight bill were ever to become law, it would be considered President Obama’s signature second-term legislative achievement, much like Obamacare is his first term’s signature achievement. The difference from Obamacare is that Republicans like Priebus and Ryan are helping him achieve it, at least for now–largely because the donor community on Wall Street wants this policy.
Despite all the pressure from donors and special interests to do what Ryan and Priebus are doing, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, offers a different pathway forward for the GOP: flip this whole debate on its head, undercut amnesty, and make the Democrats wear the blame for having fought against the interests of American workers. 
“In changing the terms of the immigration debate we will not only prevent the implementation of a disastrous policy, but begin a larger effort to broaden our appeal to working Americans of all backgrounds,” Sessions wrote in a memo to his GOP colleagues this summer. 

Now is the time to speak directly to the real and legitimate concerns of millions of hurting Americans whose wages have declined and whose job prospects have grown only bleaker. This humble and honest populism–in contrast to the Administration’s cheap demagoguery–would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party. Of course, such a clear and honest message would require saying “no” to certain business demands and powerful interests who shaped the immigration bill in the Senate.

Wednesday night on The O’Reilly Factor, Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, broke a series of previously unreleased US Department of Agriculture Videos featuring required “Cultural Sensitivity Training.” The program required employees to chant, “The pilgrims were illegal aliens,” never to use the word “minorities” and to replace it instead with “emerging majorities,” and other similarly leftist tripe.

The sensitivity training sessions taped here were held on USDA premises, and is part of what Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack termed the department’s “new era of Civil Rights” and “broader effort towards cultural transformation at USDA.” The training sessions were created by diversity awareness trainer Samuel Betances at a cost of approximately $200,000.

The video highlights include:


Betances explaining to USDA employees that “If you take a look at all of you here and you think about your salaries and your benefits and what you have left undone – plus my fee – plus the expense of the team that putting the video together, this is a huge expense.”
 
Betances urging to repeat the leftist version of American history: “I want you to say that America was founded by outsiders – say that – who are today’s insiders, who are very nervous about today’s outsiders. I want you to say, ‘The pilgrims were illegal aliens.’ Say, ‘The pilgrims never gave their passports to the Indians.”
  
Betances stating, “By the way, I don’t like the word ‘minorities.’ How about ’emerging majorities’?”
  

The complete video is available through the Judicial Watch website.

Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, told Breitbart News, “This was a pretty straightforward attempt at psychological reconditioning. Underlying the whole program is the theory that white males especially are inherently racist, sexist, or homophobic. It’s a huge waste of taxpayer dollars. 
“This is as objectionable or as significant as the GSA Las Vegas scandal. This is a program blessed at the highest levels of the USDA. We found out about it because of a whistleblower who was forced to undergo this type of training. They’ve obviously selling this left-wing diversity cult,” said Fitton.

At the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library, President Obama and former President Clinton took to the podium to praise Bush – and in the process, stump for their version of immigration reform. Trying to leverage Republicans into handing over their principles by suddenly singing odes to the president he labeled the root of all evil, President Obama gushed over Bush “reaching across the aisle to unlikely allies like Ted Kennedy” with regard to his immigration reform effort. 

He continued: “Seven years ago, President Bush restarted an important conversation by speaking with the American people about our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And even though comprehensive immigration reform has taken a little longer than any of us expected, I am hopeful that this year, with the help of Speaker Boehner and some of the Senators and members of Congress who are here today, that we bring it home.”

By using President Bush as a model of executive policy leadership, Obama betrayed what conservatives have known all along: on a vast variety of issues, Bush was closer to Obama’s position than to the conservative position. 

But Obama wasn’t the only occupant of the Oval Office to spontaneously rediscover the greatness of a president so detested by the left that professional Bush-hater Michael Moore once sat in the presidential box with another former President Jimmy Carter. President Clinton used his opportunity at the lectern to praise Bush for his push for immigration reform. “I want to thank you for your efforts, when president, to reform our immigration system, and keep America a nation of immigrants, and I hope that Congress will follow President Obama’s efforts to follow the example you’ve set,” he drawled.

The Supreme Court will take up the issue of the National Labor Relations Board (NRLB) appointments in the fall, but even the Union recognizes there is “no hope” for the Court to rule in favor of Obama’s unconstitutional appointments and transitively any actions the Board has taken with those appointments. “The Supreme Court won’t take that up until the fall and answer it until next year. There is no reason to believe — with this court — that recess appointments will be permitted,” [Communications Workers of America President Larry] Cohen said in a conference call.
A new microsite went live today to highlight the job-killing overreach into the private sector of the National Labor Relations Board. (NRLB) The NRLB is an anti-business, pro-union operation masquerading as a watchdog for “labor issues.”  The board is supposed to function fairly rather than as an advocate for union interests against private businesses.  In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. 


The NRLB caused quite a stir a few years ago, when they launched a job-killing complaint against Boeing as the company attempted to build a 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina. The Board asserted that opening a plant in non-union South Carolina was retaliation against union workers at their Washington state plant.  There was no regard for potential new jobs for South Carolina when the NRLB decided to insert itself into a private business’ decision. 

The NRLB has been in the news of late. Notably last week, Cablevision filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court to suspend actions against the company, as the board was continuing to function despite a court ruling declaring Obama’s appointments to the board unconstitutional.  
At this very moment, the NRLB is continuing to function despite the fact that two courts have ruled that members on the board were put there unconstitutionally by Obama.  There are no fewer than SIXTY lawsuits against the NRLB’s rulings with these unconstitutional appointments.

19284	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/25/Whos-Afraid-of-Michele-Bachmann	Opinion	1	None	None	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"

Who’s afraid of Congresswoman Michele Bachmann? The entire range of far-left activists, apparently.
Bachmann (R-MN) is currently the target of an aggressive campaign sponsored by a leftist organization, People for the American Way. Its immediate objective is to get House Speaker John Boehner to strip her of her Intelligence Committee seat.
According to the Watchdog Wire, the group–affiliated with ACORN, George Soros, and United for Peace and Justice–has taken a rather vocal stance against Bachmann.



People for the American Way (PFAW) has launched a new campaign against Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN), who, after her recent re-election to Congress, has been re-appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI).


A PFAW-sponsored petition with 178,000 signatures is to be presented to House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) on Monday 21 January 2012 to protest Bachmann’s HPSCI appointment.


Citing what PFAW calls “ugly Islamophobic fear mongering,” the petition decries what it alleges are Bachmann’s “unfounded and irresponsible attacks on dedicated public servants.”


Michele Bachmann has represented the people of Minnesota’s 6th Congressional District since 2007. She is the Chairwoman of the Tea Party Caucus in the House of Representatives.


Bachmann’s supporters consider her a staunch conservative who is a champion of the cause of limited, constitutional government. They admire her for her commitment to low taxes and fiscal discipline, as well as her opposition to socialized medicine.


In matters of national defense, Bachmann is a stalwart advocate of Ronald Reagan’s philosophy of Peace through Strength. Rep. Bachmann has spoken many times regarding the threat of radical Islam and Obama administration policies that are exacerbating it.

The petition was not PFAW’s first assault on Bachmann, as the group spent most of 2012 producing propaganda to make people distance themselves from the Congresswoman and her startling revelations.

Bachmann is credited with leading a 2012 effort to launch official investigations into the activities of federal employees in five executive branch agencies allegedly tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.

From FrontPage Magazine:

Last June, Rep. Michele Bachmann and four Republican colleagues sent letters to the Inspectors General at the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State, asking them to investigate whether the Muslim Brotherhood–the ideological wellspring from which such terrorist outfits as al Qaeda and Hamas first emerged–might be gaining undue influence over high-level U.S. government officials. One letter, for instance, noted that Hillary Clinton’s closest aide, her deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin, “has three family members… connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.”


Critics viciously attacked Bachmann for asking these questions. Many on the right consider her treatment unwarranted, ad hominem criticism from left-leaning establishment media and Islamist organizations–and even from some fellow Republicans–and that it decreased the margin of her very narrow reelection in 2012.

Why the special interest from PFAW? According to Discover the Networks:


People for the American Way (PFAW) was established in 1981 as a Tides Foundation project designed to counteract the allegedly growing influence of what its founder, television producer and political activist Norman Lear, denounced as the ‘religious right.’ 


In July 2011, PFAW published a Right Wing Playbook on Anti-Muslim Extremism, whose theme is that: “Under the guise of defending freedom and American values, right-wing anti-Muslim activists are campaigning to prevent Muslim-Americans from freely worshiping and practicing their religion, curtail their political rights, and even compel their deportation.”

Bachmann is also despised on the left because of her role in taking down ACORN. Bachmann went after ACORN for its role in the federal census before the group received national media attention, and the far left has never forgotten it. ACORN received over $100,000 from the foundation started by the wife of PFAW founder Norman Lear. PFAW also shares other funders with ACORN and has worked with Project Vote for years on “election protection.” PFAW boasts celebrity board members like Alec Baldwin and Seth McFarlane. The board also consists of several members with connections to the Communist Party of the USA and the usual suspects of radical millionaires.
Would PFAW’s interest have anything to do with Deborah Rappaport and her husband Andrew?
Discover the Networks provides a very clear profile:

A committed Democrat and a socialist, Rappaport has established himself (along with his wife, the philanthropist and political activist Deborah Rappaport) as one of the largest donors to Democratic Party candidates and causes. Between 1999 and 2008, he contributed $340,139 to candidates and political action committees at the national level. In addition, he and his wife have given millions of dollars to organizations that promote Democrat objectives and policies…  


Andrew Rappaport is secretary of the Rappaport Family Foundation (RFF), which he and his wife established in 2002 as a vehicle by which to administer their charitable donations. Between 2004 and 2008, RFF gave $850,000 to People for the American Way, $700,000 to the Center for American Progress, and $323,000 to the anti-war group Project Billboard. In 2006 RFF sent $100,000 to the Tides Center, which in turn (on instructions from RFF) funneled the money to Allied Media Projects, an anti-corporate community-media organization where ACORN founder Wade Rathke sits on the board of directors. As of 2006, RFF’s assets totaled $7.6 million.

Other ACORN connected board members of PFAW include the well-connected radical Margery Tabankin, the Executive Director of both Steven Spielberg’s Righteous Persons Foundation and The Streisand Foundation.
Bachmann’s enemies at PFAW even originate from her own backyard. Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie is not only connected to several of the PFAW board members’ radical organizations but he is also a friend of Bachmann’s old foe ACORN.

How close of a friend? While at ACORN, I remember several efforts working with local Democrats to raise money for the Franken versus Coleman efforts. This included a 2008 meeting between Secretary of State Ritchie, ACORN, Project Vote. The subject of the meeting? Ritchie was actively providing fundraising help for Project Vote and ACORN.
PFAW has a long history of partisan political activity that is ignored by the very same mainstream media that have funded–yes, funded them in the past. CBS, NBC, ABC and even the New York Times have failed to note what the Capital Research Center (CRC) pointed out in 2002. During the height of PFAW’s work to stymie all Bush judicial nominees, CRC wrote:

People for the American Way and its affiliates work together as a powerful lobby for leftist ideology and Democratic party politics. Whatever its tax lawyers may say, the scandal of PFAW is that foundations and corporations inflate its budget and pay for its politics. Every dollar contributed to PFAW advances a profoundly political agenda.

To recap, PFAW’s board is comprised of a who’s who of far-left radicals, socialists, and communists. They are tied to ACORN and Project Vote, and the bulk of their funding comes from far-left foundations like Tides. In addition, the Capital Research Center reported that in 2003 and 2004, 98 percent of the organization’s political contributions went to left-wing Democratic candidates.
Do PFAW and its allies aim to inflict further damage in the Alinsky style to one of our country’s most courageous and visionary leaders, to defeat her next year as part of the left’s determined bid to return the House to Democratic control? 
Speaker of the House John Boehner and the rest of the country should stand strong behind Michele Bachmann. With those kind of enemies, Bachmann appears to be one of the few in Congress on the right path. We must not allow the Islamists and their allies on the left to deprive our country at this critical moment of Michele Bachmann’s leadership on national security, limited government, and conservative values at a moment when they are needed more than ever. If one woman can bring the entire wrath of the left down on her, one must examine her statements and remember the old adage “the truth hurts.” Well, look who’s howling now.

Saying a decision by a federal court to remove the famous Mt. Soledad Cross from a Southern California veterans memorial on Thursday was the latest skirmish in the war against religion and faith, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said not even Congress can protect landmark symbols from “angry atheists armed with attorneys.” 
“This is just more reason why we need to stand up for our constitution and the religious liberty it protects,” Palin said.


Palin urged her followers on Friday to read a Breitbart News report on the decision, and said that the attacks on veterans’ memorials mean those “who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms can’t even be honored with a symbol embodying one of those freedoms.”
In her blockbuster bestseller Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, Palin has said these attacks are the tip of the spear in a larger fight to fundamentally transform America. Palin noted that in “Good Tidings and Great Joy,” she “mentioned a lawsuit taken against a World War I veterans memorial cross in California’s Mojave Desert”: 

In the 1930s, the Veterans of Foreign Wars put up a cross in the Mojave Desert– in an isolated area known as Sunrise Rock– to honor our brave soldiers who died in World War I. The modest cross, made out of eight-foot metal pipes painted white, sat on 1.6 acres of desert, 90 percent of which is federal land. Though it was ‘in the middle of nowhere,’ it meant such a great deal to many people. In 1983, when a World War I veteran lay on his deathbed, he asked his best friend, Henry Sandoz, to take care of the cross. And that’s exactly what Henry faithfully did every year after his friend’s death. 
Henry was in his seventies by the time Frank Buono, helped by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit claiming that this lovingly maintained old cross unconstitutionally promoted the Christian faith. As the case bounced from one court to another, the cross was enclosed with plywood, covered like an adult magazine in the back of a bookstore. Over the course of the court battle, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, it was even stolen. Finally, after eight long years of battling, the cross was able to remain on the land by transferring the property surrounding it to a private citizen.

Though the Mojave Desert cross was saved, the Mt. Soledad Veterans Memorial cross in San Diego was not, even though in 2004, Congress, as Palin noted, “passed a law protecting its right to exist as a national memorial to the brave men and women in uniform ‘who sacrificed their lives in the defense of the United States.'”

“But apparently even Congress can’t stop angry atheists armed with attorneys. As I’ve said repeatedly in interviews about ‘Good Tidings and Great Joy,’ the so-called ‘war on Christmas’ is just the tip-of-the-spear in the larger efforts to strip God from the public square and banish all expressions of faith from public life,” she wrote.
Palin has consistently stood up against the “PC police.” On Thursday, hours after Palin told Breitbart Sports that she was disappointed that ESPN had rejected a commercial from a Catholic hospital because the station found the words “God” and “Jesus” to be “problematic,” ESPN reversed course and accepted the original ad, which it will air on Saturday. 
Palin also posted a statement from the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) that said the decision was “deeply flawed” because the “federal court decision declaring the memorial unconstitutional and ordering its removal does not square with the facts” and the “memorial is part of the historic landscape of San Diego and is consistent with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.”
The ACLJ has “promised to file an amicus brief in support of an expected appeal to keep the memorial – which includes a commemorative cross – in place.”
“We will continue to aggressively argue in support of this memorial and commemorative cross,” ACLJ President Jay Sekulow said. “We believe the law and precedent are clear: the Supreme Court has concluded in the past that ‘a Latin cross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs. It is a symbol often used to honor and respect those whose heroic acts, noble contributions, and patient striving help secure an honored place in history for this Nation and its people.'”
Sekulow added that “this memorial should not create a constitutional crisis. It is part of the history and heritage of the San Diego area.”

Another brilliant column from National Review’s Rich Lowry at Politico. Lowry makes the indisputable point that the same media that have spent years attacking the Tea Party, and months savaging the NRA, are now revealing brazen hypocrisy when it comes to protecting their own rights. In spirit and goal, the media are now one with the Tea Party and NRA.
What animates the Tea Party and NRA is a legitimate concern that the government — especially under President Obama — has made a disturbing pivot from their Constitutional requirement to protect our liberties, to infringing upon our liberties. In turn, Obama and his media label us as anti-government crazies suffering from paranoid delusions.  


But look at the reaction this week from that very same media in the wake of the Associated Press scandal. Suddenly the media don’t like Big Government doing to them what ObamaCare and background checks will do to the rest of us. Moreover, the very same media that suggest not trusting the government is a form of extremism, is now demanding a law be immediately passed to shield them from government intrusion. 
The media don’t trust the government anymore than we do. Who is the paranoid crazy now? 
Lowry:

At his briefing, Carney hung to the word “unfettered” like a drowning man. He said over and over again things like the president believes in an “unfettered ability to pursue investigative journalism” but that there should be “balance.” The implicit reaction in the room was: “Balance? Don’t give us any stinkin’ balance. Give us our rights.”
In this, the reporters exhibited a healthy impulse toward vigilance about liberty. The phrase “chilling effect” has been bandied about often. A chill comes not necessarily from what government is doing to you but from what it might do to you. Very few reporters will ever have their records secretly subpoenaed by the government, but it is intolerable to them that it could happen. On top of everything else, it is the principle of the thing — an infringement, or even a potential infringement, on the constitutional rights of even a handful of reporters is an affront to all.
There are lots of people who share this way of thinking about rights and government. Some of them gather every year at places like CPAC and the National Rifle Association annual convention.
We have just gone through a period when scorn was heaped on the NRA for opposing new gun rules out of the very same logic that compels reporters to react so strongly against the AP subpoena. The NRA will not abide an infringement on anyone’s legitimate right to bear arms, and it fears what could come of enhanced state power. Like the reporters, it casts a jaundiced eye on the reassurances of government. What they are to the First Amendment, it is to the Second.
Read it all.
At his Politico perch, Lowry is writing one of the best columns around. Keep an eye out for it.

During the Bush Administration, mainstream media outlets hammered President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their “rendition” policy that allowed suspected terrorists to be detained overseas in foreign countries and interrogated at the direction of the US government.  Hollywood even made a movie about it, so you know it was important.  
Along with Guantanamo Bay, rendition was cited as an example of the un-constitutional Bush/Cheney dictatorship running rough-shod on the Geneva Conventions and basic human rights.  
As a candidate, Barack Obama indicated that he would reverse the policy in an article in Foreign Affairs.  



To build a better, freer world, we must first behave in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the American people… This means ending the practices of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries, of detaining thousands without charge or trial, of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.

Two days into his presidency, Obama quietly continued the evil rendition policy, and it has continued ever since.  Last week it was revealed that three new detainees were taken prisoner in the small African country of Djibouti and interrogated by American agents:


U.S. agents accused the men — two of them Swedes, the other a longtime resident of Britain — of supporting al-Shabab, an Islamist militia in Somalia that Washington considers a terrorist group. Two months after their arrest, the prisoners were secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in New York, then clandestinely taken into custody by the FBI and flown to the United States to face trial.
The secret arrests and detentions came to light Dec. 21 when the suspects made a brief appearance in a Brooklyn courtroom.

Other than a small handful of news reports, the continuing rendition has received little or no attention and absolutely no condemnation from opinion writers who were hysterical over the Bush-era policies.  
They could be criticizing Obama over his rendition policy, or they could be hammering him over his hypocrisy. They could be… if they were interested in truly speaking truth to power.  But, President Obama is their guy, so rendition is just fine under his watch.

Karl Rove and more than one hundred Republican donors sent a letter to Republican members of Congress on Tuesday, urging them to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would include, among other provisions, granting “legal status” to illegal aliens who meet certain criteria.
Anticipating that lawmakers will face resistance to the bill when they go home for the August recess, the letter marks the escalation of a campaign in which Republican leaders and donors are pressuring House Republicans to act on an immigration reform bill.
The letter begins: “We write to urge you to take action to fix our broken immigration system.” According to the New York Times, those who have signed include Rove; “former Vice President Dan Quayle; Tom Stemberg, a founder of Staples; and Frank VanderSloot, the founder of Melaleuca Inc.” Romney campaign finance director Spencer Zwick was also signed the letter. 


The Times reports that Carlos Gutierrez, former Commerce Secretary for President George W. Bush and a founder of the Republicans for Immigration Reform super PAC, organized the effort. Gutierrez, who has said in the past that English should not be the official language of government, said the letter was “the beginning of a campaign to lobby Republican lawmakers in favor of a broad immigration bill as they return to their districts for the August break.” 

“What tends to happen during the month of August is that members go home and they go to town hall meetings and they check up on their offices in terms of phone calls and letters, and that’s where they get bombarded,” Gutierrez told the Times. “So Republicans who are for immigration reform–and I believe there are many–we need to make our voice known in August.”
The letter also says: 

“To fix our immigration system we need meaningful reforms that will (1) secure our borders, (2) provide a legal way for U.S.-based companies to hire the workers they need while making it impossible to hire workers here illegally, and (3) take control of our undocumented immigration problem by providing a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who pay penalties and back taxes, pass criminal background checks, and go to the back of the line.”

Peter Schweizer’s book, Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes and Line Their Own Pockets, exposes abusive money schemes undermining the legitimacy of representative government. Beltway tactics such as the “tollbooth,” the “milker bill,” and “double milker bills” shamelessly extort campaign cash to advance or stall legislation aimed at targeted money. All too often, the reality is “pay to delay” or “pay to play.”  
One scandalous revelation is the staggeringly high interest rate some politicians charge on personal loans they make to their own campaigns, resulting in windfall personal profit. Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) pocketed $294,245 in interest payments on a $150,000 loan at 18% (later lowered to 10%). She dismissed 60 Minutes journalist Steve Kroft’s challenge to the “Mafia” interest rate, saying, “It’s not like I really profited… I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”  


Her comment opens a window into a dirty secret soiling mainstream party politics. Players get rich–typically with your money. At times, the sums are staggering.  
Jamie Gorelick served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration and followed that gig with a five-year tenure as a board member of the congressionally-chartered, tax-exempt Fannie Mae, where she reportedly received over $26 million in salary, bonuses, so-called performance pay, and stock options.  
Fellow Fannie Mae board member Franklyn Raines, who previously served as Bill Clinton’s Director of the Office of Management and Budget, received $90,000,000 in total compensation for six years’ service. Yet Time Magazine called him one of the twenty-five people to blame for the 2008 financial meltdown. The New York Times reported that he agreed to pay $24.7 million, including a $2 million fine, to settle claims against him flowing from the crash.  

It is simply a “given” within the professional political class that insiders profit. A seemingly endless supply of tax dollars has long fueled complaints that government policy makers, office holders, functionaries, party insiders, connected lobbyists, and families cash in on the public dole. It even has a name: “crony capitalism.” The latest example is the debacle known as HealthCare.gov–hundreds of millions for what can at best be called an embarrassment developed by a Canadian subsidiary that contributed heavily to pols of all stripes.   
Rep. Napolitano’s dismissive backhand at the suggestion of anything remiss over her pocketing a mere $294k is symptomatic of the narcissism now epidemic in the political class. Real profit for the new elites is about serious largesse. Anything as paltry as her racket is chump change. It crosses party lines and flows from bloated government, obscure quasi-governmental entities, and politically packed special entities such as Fannie Mae. And it passes stealthily into respectful private business deals, where political rivals become strange bedfellows. 
The current gubernatorial race in Virginia offers a fascinating glimpse of one such pairing. Terry McAuliffe, a DC-area transplant from upstate New York, parlayed his political connections and fundraising acumen into the chairmanship of the DNC. His style of politics takes no prisoners.   
McAuliffe has a penchant for investing in techie upstarts with potential for big profit. In 1999, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Telergy, Inc., in Syracuse, New York, his home town. Telergy planned to create a contiguous end-to-end high-speed fiber optics network in the northeastern US along utility rights-of-way. Its plan was to leverage relationships with Niagara Mohawk, NYSEG, Consolidated  Edison, GPU, El Paso, and certain National Grid electric subsidiaries. A good old-fashioned dose of classic American initiative–with risks, to be sure–and the potential for handsome profit. 
And if the story stopped there, God bless every penny he and his partners could make. That’s why the Constitution protects private property as a fundamental right and encourages capital market creation by granting Congress legislative authority to introduce copyright and patent legislation, all of which encourages the risk/profit correlation that has driven the American economic engine to produce a better standard of living for the broadest swath of society the planet has ever known. 

However, the company vastly overvalued its assets and went bust. The Washington Free Beacon reported on McAuliffe’s Telergy link long ago. Byron York added some details here.
But there is more to the story. Telergy laid off a slew of local Syracuse employees–hundreds–without any severance in 2001 and, by the end of the year, filed for bankruptcy. McAuliffe has always said he was just an investor and did not run day-to-day operations. But Telegry’s S-1 SEC filing offers a tantalizing window into the relationships of political insiders and the subordination of principle to profit.  

The S-1 identifies McAuliffe under its list of “EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND KEY EMPLOYEES.” See page 59. But notice who else it lists among the officers and directors:   
J. Patrick Barrett, President and Director. The former Chairman of the New York GOP State Committee during the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush, he is a wealthy and powerful party insider. No one moves within the upstate NY GOP without clearing things with Pat Barrett.  
 Thomas G. Young, Vice President, Government Relations. He was the Democrat Mayor of Syracuse from 1986-1993, which coincided with Pat Barrett’s term as GOP state party chair. A longtime political of Terry McAuliffe, who hails from Syracuse.  

John F. O’Mara, Director. He served as special counsel to George Pataki when the latter was governor of NY and was chair of the New York State Public Service Commission. A powerful state GOP insider. 
And, of course, McAuliffe.  
All were key players in the political rough and tumble of NY party politics. Some still are. And they were adversaries. Ideologically and politically split–or so it would appear. Yet here they were, in bed together in their personal business investments–and not as mere passive investors the way millions are when vested in mutual funds or as capital investors in start-ups. Each took publicly-identified roles as significant players with fiduciary responsibilities. 
But even when the deals go bust, the directors and key people make out, as happened with Telergy. McAuliffe reportedly made some $1.2 million by brokering an investment in Telergy by Gary Winnick of Global Crossing, another company McAuliffe invested in and made millions before it, too, went bankrupt. That failure resulted in $54 billion in shareholder losses and 10,000 lost jobs. 
There is nothing wrong with making lots of money. We all love the idea. But the deeper point is to recognize what the money can do to the insiders. Telergy was but one example. 
Is it reasonable to believe that such relationships do not erode independence? How aggressively will a state party chair campaign against the local mayor of a rival party come election season when the two are officers of the same business venture? And what of their advocacy of the cherished goals of the grass roots party faithful?It isn’t crony capitalism, but it reeks of cynicism. And its effect on sincerity and message is corrosive. 
It is one reason some believe the RINO element within the GOP is uncomfortable with Ken Cuccinelli. Like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker, these insurgent new bloods really believe in freedom, the ideals of their agenda, the sanctity of life, and the restoration of principal. And a new core of GOP leaders stands ready to seize the party with them: Gov. Nikki Haley, Congresswomen Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Kristi Noem, Senators Tom Coburn, Deb Fisher, Pat Toomey, and more.
The emerging voices of conservative principle are sounding the heat of the nation. For a long time, too many have allowed deception to pile high the precipice from which we fall until so dark and damp a tomb we become accustomed to the stench of rotted expectation. No more. With a nod to Mr. Dylan, “the times they are a-changing.”

As spring break begins for schoolchildren across the country, thousands of students will travel to Washington, DC. The trips, funded by bake sales and other events throughout the year, will allow the students to take in Washington’s historic landmarks. 
One premier destination is off-limits this year, however. A few weeks ago, the Obama Administration announced it was suspending public, self-guided tours of the White House as a result of the automatic sequester cuts that the administration proposed in 2011. While America’s students stand outside the White House fence, the First Daughters, Sasha and Malia, are enjoying spring break with friends at the Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. 



Breitbart News’ Matt Boyle broke the news Monday morning that numerous sources have reported seeing the First Daughters in the Bahamas this weekend. Presumably, the Obamas are paying the costs of the resort out of their own pockets. The robust Secret Service detail that must accompany the First Daughters, however, is funded by taxpayers. 

The principal reason the White House canceled public tours was to save money on Secret Service staff. The White House reported that suspending the tours would save $74,000 a week. Other reports have put the savings at just $18,000 a week. 
Whichever the true amount, the Secret Service detail necessary to protect the First Daughters on their spring break could likely have been used to keep the White House open to the rest of America’s school children. Judicial Watch reported that Malia Obama’s Spring Break in Mexico last year cost taxpayers over $115,000. That amount would cover 2-6 weeks of White House tours. 
At the very least, it would ensure that, this spring break, thousands of America’s students could cap their trip to DC with a uniquely American tradition–a tour of the White House.

Beginning next month, Breitbart News Editor-At-Large Ben Shapiro will be leading the launch of a new project of the David Horowitz Freedom Center: TruthRevolt.org, an activism program designed to “unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public, and devastate their funding bases.” 
The program is being described as a conservative counterpunch to Media Matters, the Obama-linked organization that focuses on silencing conservatives in the media. “For too long, we’ve played by the Marquess of Queensberry rules, allowing the left to stifle the truth and silence truth tellers in the name of their politically correct narrative. Now we’re taking the battle to their home turf — and we will do so aggressively and unwaveringly, every single day. This is just another avenue for applying Breitbart’s fighting spirit to the battle against those who would destroy what America stands for,” Shapiro said. Shapiro will maintain his position and all of his duties at Breitbart News as well.


One of the founders of the New Left in the 1960s, David Horowitz has become an icon in the conservative movement, famed for his deep understanding of the ideology and strategy of the modern left in America. He has led the Freedom Center since its inception as the Center for the Study of Popular Culture in 1988. 
“We could not be more excited to be working with Ben on this project,” Horowitz told Breitbart News. “Andrew Breitbart was a fantastic friend to the Freedom Center and an indispensable warrior in the battle against the anti-America, socialist left and its allies in the universities, the unions and the Democratic Party, and Breitbart News carries on his legacy. We look forward to working with our friends at Breitbart in continuing the fight for America’s future.” 

Horowitz and Breitbart worked together on the film Occupy Unmasked, which looked behind the scenes at the institutional left’s control of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Horowitz’s life’s work in exposing the mendacity of the left was a key part of the film. “Occupy Unmasked shows how closely David and Andrew were on their work of exposing and defeating the forces of the institutional left in America. We consider Ben Shapiro’s leading role at ‘Truth Revolt’ to be nothing more than a continuation of that work,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News.
“Ben Shapiro is a charter member of the Breitbart News ‘Fight Club’ and has been instrumental in the explosive growth the site has experienced over the past 18 months,” said Bannon. “Ben’s ‘voice’ and fighting spirit will also be central in our building out both the site and the company in the years ahead.”

“As was so often the case, Andrew spotted and mentored important conservative voices long before they percolated up to a national level,” said Breitbart News President and CEO Larry Solov. “Ben, who when Andrew met him was a college student at UCLA, is one such voice. Ben has the fight and the intellectual heft to land devastating body blows to the institutional Left and the biased media, which is such a crucial part of what we do here at Breitbart News. We have encouraged Ben to take a leading role with David Horowitz in TruthRevolt to complement his ongoing work at Breitbart News where he will continue to help the grow the company and carry on the fighting spirit and legacy of Andrew Breitbart.”
Shapiro, a mentee and friend of Andrew Breitbart since age 17, became Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News in February 2012. Shapiro, 29, is the New York Times bestselling author of Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America (2013), as well as Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV (2011), Project President: Bad Hair and Botox on the Road to the White House (2008), Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future (2005), and Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America’s Youth (2004). Shapiro began his career as the youngest syndicated columnist in the nation with Creators Syndicate, graduated Harvard Law School at 23, and hosts The Morning Answer on KRLA 870 in Los Angeles. 
Shapiro has been widely praised across the conservative movement. Sarah Palin says that Americans should “consider Ben’s advice about how we must stand up and push back twice as hard against this bullying.” Sean Hannity says to join Ben Shapiro and “fight back!” against liberal bullying. Glenn Beck calls Shapiro a “warrior for conservatism, against those who use fear and intimidation to stifle honest debate. I’ve never known him to back down from a fight.” And Michelle Malkin says Shapiro is “infused with the indomitable spirit of his friend and mentor Andrew Breitbart.” Even the liberal Washington Post, in the aftermath of Shapiro’s devastating destruction of Piers Morgan on national television, conceded that Shapiro is a “foe of extraordinary polemical agility.”

Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote Wednesday that America is a nation being bankrupt by a federal government led by “venal politicians” in her response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union Address. 
“What is the true state of our union? Though this may sound harsh, I’ll speak the truth here,” Palin wrote. “We are a country going bankrupt to fund a bloated, distant, and often corrupt federal government led by venal politicians more concerned with paying off their campaign cronies and consolidating their own power than in preserving the constitutional republic that so many have fought and died for (including our brave men and women in uniform who were barely mentioned last night).”
Palin has assailed the “permanent political class” since her landmark speech in Indianola, Iowa in 2011 that introduced that language into the political bloodstream. Director Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Schweizer’s Government Accountability Institute have assailed D.C. as a “boomtown” that produces nothing but continues to get wealthier by expanding the size and scope of government. 


During the State of the Union address on Tuesday, Palin live-tweeted with the “#SOTUGottaBKiddingMe” hashtag, assailing Obama and Washington, D.C.’s permanent political class for their cronyism. After the speech, Palin called out Obama for not honoring slain ex-Navy Seal Chris Kyle or U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens during the address. After attending Kyle’s funeral on Monday, Palin said Obama needed to “pay his respects” to the fallen American hero. 
“If you missed President Obama’s State of the Union address last night, you didn’t miss much – especially if you watched any of his past four State of the Union addresses,” Palin wrote. “We heard the same recycled rhetoric, and we heard his Orwellian declaration that the cornucopia of new federal programs he proposed, as well as his intention to eradicate world poverty, wouldn’t ‘increase our deficit by a single dime.'”
Palin also referenced Paul Krugman, “one of President Obama’s economic cheerleaders at the New York Times,” who last week was “remarkably candid” when he said “death panels and taxes is how we do this.” 

“But wait, I thought there’d be no such thing as ‘death panels,’ liberal liars?” Palin asked sardonically.
“This is the long-term forecast for the state of America under Obama’s failed policies: middle class taxes and death panels,” Palin wrote. 
Left-wing politicians and journalists ridiculed Palin when she predicted the Affordable Care Act would lead to bureaucratic death panels rationing treatment. Politifact named “death panels” its Lie of the Year in 2009.  
“Our country didn’t weather a Revolution, two World Wars, a Civil War, a Great Depression, and countless other political and economic storms, just to be sunk by the dangerous policies of this current administration,” Palin wrote. “We’re stronger than this. As President Reagan said, ‘I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.'”
Palin concluded by urging Republicans to get ready for the 2014 midterm elections:  “So, do something. 2014 is just around the corner. Get motivated! Get organized. America, don’t retreat. In the words of yet another White House program, ‘Let’s move.'”

UPDATE: The NFL released an official statement on Monday saying the officials in the Chargers-Chiefs game erred:

On the play, San Diego lined up with seven men on one side of the snapper.  This should have been penalized as an illegal formation by the defense.
Rule 9, Section 1, Article 3 (b) (1) of the NFL Rule Book (page 51) states that “No more than six Team B players may be on the line of scrimmage on either side of the snapper at the snap.”
The penalty for illegal formation by the defense is a loss of five yards.  This is not subject to instant replay review.  Had the penalty been assessed, it would have resulted in a fourth-and-seven from the San Diego 18 with 0:04 remaining, enabling the Chiefs to attempt a 36-yard field goal.

—


The NFL will reportedly concede on Monday that its officials may have cost the Pittsburgh Steelers a playoff spot when they failed to penalize the San Diego Chargers for having more than six players on one side of the long snapper on Kansas City Chiefs kicker Ryan Succop’s game-winning field goal attempt with eight seconds remaining in regulation on Sunday in San Diego. 
ProFootballTalk’s Mike Florio reported on NBC’s Sunday Night Football that the NFL will admit on Monday that the officials in the game should have given the Chargers a five-yard penalty on Succop’s missed 41-yard field goal attempt because San Diego had seven players (pictured) on one side of the line of scrimmage when NFL rules only allow six. The referees did not throw a flag, and Succop missed the field goal that could have sent the Steelers into the playoffs. He should have gotten a re-kick–a 36-yard field goal attempt. And had Succop made the attempt he should have been awarded, Pittsburgh would have miraculously made the playoffs. 
Here is the NFL rule in question: 


(a) When Team A presents a punt, field-goal attempt or a Try Kick formation, a Team B player, who is within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage, must have his entire body outside the snapper’s shoulder pads at the snap. (b) When Team A presents a field-goal or Try Kick formation: (1) No more than six Team B players may be on the line of scrimmage on either side of the snapper at the snap; Penalty: For illegal formation by the defense, loss of 5 yards from the previous spot. (2) Team B players cannot push teammates on the line of scrimmage into the offensive formation. Penalty: For unnecessary roughness, loss of 15 yards from the previous spot

Earlier in the year, New England Patriots rookie Chris Jones was penalized 15-yards for pushing his teammate during a New York Jets field-goal attempt that decided the game in favor of the Jets. 
After starting the season 0-4 with injuries at numerous positions, all the Pittsburgh Steelers needed to do to sneak into the playoffs was to win on Sunday and then hope that the Miami Dolphins, the Baltimore Ravens, and the San Diego Chargers all lost.
Incredibly, that almost happened. The Steelers (8-8) almost got the sixth and final AFC playoff spot, but Succop missed that 41-yard field goal and San Diego beat the Chiefs 27-24 in a wild overtime in which the Chargers faked a punt inside their own territory on their first drive in overtime that was also controversial. Kansas City seemed to return what appeared to be a fumble on that play for a touchdown to win the game, but the officials ruled that San Diego’s Eric Weddle’s forward progress was stopped. Former NFL head of officiating Mike Pereira disagreed with that interpretation: 

Replay did not stop the game because the ruling of forward progress is not reviewable. Should have been a strip and TD in my opinion.
— Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) December 30, 2013
Earlier in the day, the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Ravens, 34-17. The New York Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins, 20-7. The Steelers took care of business and defeated the Browns, 20-7. 
That meant San Diego would make the playoffs with a win over the Chiefs or a tie while Pittsburgh would only make the playoffs with a Kansas City win over San Diego.
And Kansas City, which sat its starting quarterback, Alex Smith, running back, Jamaal Charles, and a host of other starters to rest for next week’s playoff game, was leading for most of the game before San Diego tied the game with less than five minutes left and eventually won the game, taking the sixth and final AFC playoff spot.

19534	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/18/Sarah-Palin-to-Address-CPAC-in-March	Opinion	0	None	None	Neutral	Negative	breitbart.com	"

The American Conservative Union (ACU), which runs the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), announced on Monday that Sarah Palin will speak at the 40th annual gathering of conservatives in March.
“We are pleased to again welcome Governor Sarah Palin to CPAC in March,” ACU Chairman Al Cardenas said in a statement. “Governor Palin electrified the crowd in 2012 and we are thrilled to welcome her back this year.”
CPAC 2013 will be held Thursday, March 14 through Saturday, March 16, 2013 at its new location in National Harbor, MD at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center. 


The non-Washington, D.C. location of this year’s conference is fitting for Palin, who blistered the permanent political class and crony capitalism during her 2012 address last year in the nation’s capital in her first appearance at the conference.
Last year, she was mobbed in the hallways before her speech. Palin stayed for nearly an hour after speaking, engaging conservatives and supporters who were there to listen to her. Reporters and observers at CPAC noted in 2012 they had not seen anyone who resonated with the conservative base more than Palin. 
At CPAC 2012, Palin said Washington, D.C. had become “something that our forefathers never envisioned, and they would have sworn their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor to change.”

Palin said the “old Washington of our Founders” was a place where people “came to serve your government, not prosper over it and on it and from it and off of it.” She mentioned the country’s wealthiest counties were all around the D.C. region, a theme director Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Schweizer’s Government Accountability Institute would later document a year later in “Boomtown.” 
She referenced her speech in Indianola, Iowa in 2011 when she spoke of “crony capitalism” that “isn’t the capitalism of free men and free markets, of risk and sacrifice, of innovation and hard work.” She said the new crony capitalism is one of “connections” and of “government bailout and handouts” and waste, “corporate welfare and corruption.” 
After her Indianola speech, “crony capitalism” and “permanent political class” were injected into the political vocabulary. 
“This is the capitalism of Barack Obama and the permanent political class,” Palin said at CPAC in 2012. 
She lambasted the Occupy protesters who were at the conference in 2012, saying they should be instead protesting at Obama’s White House, which has “spurred the expansion of government which diminishes freedom and opportunity for all to rise and to succeed.”

Palin derided politicians who come to Washington, D.C. “denouncing the place as the cesspool of corruption” only to, after a year or two, see it as a hot tub. 
“And they are hopping in and enjoying the jacuzzi,” Palin said, noting it was “time we drain the jacuzzi and throw the bums out with the bath water.”
After Palin turned down Fox News’ offer to renew her contract, she spoke exclusively to Breitbart News about her future. When asked what her response was to the mainstream media’s declarations that she and the Tea Party were “buried,” Palin said she was raised “to never retreat and to pick battles wisely, and all in due season.”
“When it comes to defending our republic, we haven’t begun to fight! But we delight in those who underestimate us,” Palin told Breitbart News last month.

On Saturday, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin blasted the “scrooges” waging a “war on Christmas” and their “zealot-like” faith in an “arrogant” church of big government run by the supposed best and the brightest that has only caused “irreparable harm” to America.  
She said the “arrogant” church of government does not have “faith in your ability to govern yourself,” so “you should not have faith in it” because “it does not have faith in us.”
Speaking at an Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner, Palin said “enough is enough” of the “politically-correct police out there” and blasted the scrooges waging a “War on Christmas.” 


Palin said Americans needed to take action to resist the “fundamental transformation” of society that many Americans “never signed up for.” Echoing themes from her book, Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas, which comes out on Tuesday, Palin said that “religious freedom is under attack,” and religion is “pushed out of the public square” and “censored.” Palin said one will see the censorship and double standards “blatantly come this holiday season.” 
She said that the war on Christmas sounds like an oxymoron but it is real, “a symptom of a bigger issue,” and “just the tip of the spear in a larger battle.”

Palin then noted that the “scrooges who are too enlightened for religion” have a very “zealot-like faith in the church of big government.” 
“What’s that done for you lately?” Palin asked. 
She said the “church of big government” is run by the supposed “best and the brightest,” and she slammed the recent National Security Agency spying scandals, the barricading of the World War II Monument during the partial government shutdown, and the recent failures of Obamacare, which she said was the church of big government’s “crowning achievement” to date.
She blasted the “best and the brightest” in the Obama administration for believing “hicks in flyover country” or “hockey moms in Alaska” do not know what health insurance plans are best for their families or cannot run their own lives without government interference. 
Palin also said the “lapdog media” allow the “best and the brightest” in the church of big government to “get away” with lies and bad policies, which has caused “irreparable damage” to the country. 
She said under the “church of big government,” there have been “shuttered businesses and cities” and “poverty has gone up,” while a “record number of Americans are giving up and no longer bothering to look for work.”
“Where has that gotten you?” Palin asked. 
She then blasted “immoral and unscrupulous” leaders who “ignore the Constitution in favor of their fundamental transformation agenda” while “enriching themselves and their cronies while their nation goes bankrupt… that’s dictatorship.”

If you’re an illegal immigrant worried about being caught, help is only a mouse click away. An article from the radical website DreamActivist.org will give you a quick lesson on how to lie about your status. It’s all part of the aggressive pro-illegal immigration ‘Dreamer movement’ that is leading the fight for “comprehensive” immigration reform, with a boost from President Barack Obama and many in Congress.
The “Dreamers” are illegal immigrants who were brought into the country by their parents. They’ve become the darlings of the media, garnering both positive press and an executive order by President Obama in 2012, offering them legal status if they met certain requirements and paid a $465 fee. Even that controversial end-run around Congress, however, wasn’t enough for the Dream activists as they pursued an agenda that rejects the idea of borders and deportation entirely.

The theatrical direct-actions of the Dreamers have intensified in recent months, including the ‘Dream 9’ activists who went to Mexico and then came back into the United States using an asylum claim. The avowed and proud illegal immigrants have used in-your-face social justice tactics for years, however, showing a dedication and a long-term view that opponents of amnesty would do well to note.


The Dreamer movement has been pushing the edge of the envelope in both their goals and tactics. They are gaining ground. The ACLU recently called Dreamers ‘the face of immigration reform movement’ and wrote:

But as important as their stories have been to the immigration reform movement, we can’t lose sight of the critical organizing DREAMers have been engaged in for years, pushing not only for the DREAM Act, but also for creating an environment where voices as disparate as Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) can vote “Yes” to move sweeping immigration reform legislation out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.


So, what sort of enviroment have they created? An example of the Dreamers long-term animosity towards any enforcement of immigration laws is a 2009 article on the DreamActivist.org site entitled Particulars and Universals #3: Tips on How to Lie Successfully. 
The anonymous author of the article doesn’t see a problem with the fact that illegal immigrants are violating the law. The problem is they aren’t good at lying.


…many undocumented youths conceal their immigration status when faced with potentially awkward questions, but the problem is that they absolutely suck at it. When faced with an instance in which they have to lie, they come up with a myriad of half-hearted excuses that they think up on the spot. 



In order to help solve the “problem” of bad lying, the Dream Activist site gives a few tips on lying more effectively. Tip #1 is ‘Think up a lie beforehand’, while Tip #3 is ‘Be consistent.’

 Create lies that are close to the truth and easy to keep track of. Think up lies that you know you can be absolutely consistent about. Write them down in a notepad if you must.


The article also suggests that illegal immigrants can ‘pretend that you’re an international student who has been taking public education in the U.S. since elementary school.’ 

The article stresses ‘this post is for tips on how to lie only to your friends and acquaintances’ and suggests never lying to officials ‘in writing’ but also says:

I’d like to take a moment here and stress that not lying does not mean having to reveal the truth. You have the right to remain silent. In fact, do not confess that you’re undocumented if you’re approached by immigration officials; know your rights.


The author also says “I know that it’s a bit corruptive to give young people tips on how to lie well” but they justify it immediately by saying that illegal immigrants understandably want to lie so they don’t ‘feel very dispirited.’ 
The Dream Activist site was co-founded by Peruvian Maria Marroquin, self-indentifed Fijian law school graduate Prerna Lal, and Iranian gay activist Mohammad Abdollahi. The site says it ‘would not be possible’ without the help of people like Lizbeth Mateo, one of the ‘Dream 9’ Activists previously profiled by Breitbart News  for her claim to have been employed by a Washignton D.C. based community organizing group.

House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) told radio’s Laura Ingraham on Wednesday that he has told House Speaker John Boehner that he must publicly promise there will be no conference committee on the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill. 
“I am not going to go down the road of conferencing with the Senate bill and I told Boehner that he needs to stand up and make that very clear,” McCaul said on Ingraham’s program on Wednesday morning. “We’re not going to conference with the senate period.”
McCaul said that he believes a conference committee on the Senate immigration bill is a “political trap” that President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are trying to set. McCaul said he does not want to be caught in the trap. “I was invited to the White House yesterday and I refused to meet with the President because I saw it as a political trap,” he said.


Boehner, House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor have publicly left the door open to conference, with Ryan actually publicly advocating for one. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said in July. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”
The Senate bill’s principal GOP sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), said this weekend in a Breitbart News exclusive that he is opposed to a conference committee and does not think the House should make efforts to save his immigration bill there. Rather, Rubio said, the House should focus on what Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL) have described as a true step-by-step piecemeal immigration reform, whereby individual pieces are passed and then implemented before other pieces are taken up by Congress.

Just in time for Christmas, President Obama signed an executive order on Monday giving a 1 percent pay raise for federal employees. The raise follows a four year hiatus from salary increases for federal workers, although most federal employees have apparently seen their pay increase via promotion or performance. The first increased paycheck will kick in on January 1.

President Obama’s reward to the federal workforce follows his longstanding belief that government work ought to be a first option for Americans. Nonetheless, Obama’s decision to raise federal pay only widens the income inequality gap between federal workers and private sector employees; as of 2011, the average private sector employee made $59,804 in salary, and $28,000 in benefits, while the average federal workers made $74,436 in salary and $40,000 in benefits.

Furthermore, the gap between Washington, D.C. culture and the rest of the country is growing ever larger. Between 2000 and 2012, according to Census Bureau statistics, Washington, D.C. household income jumped 23.3%; the rest of the country, by contrast, dropped 6.6%. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “The Washington, D.C. metro area — which includes the surrounding suburbs in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia — has it even better, with a median household income of $88,233 that ranks highest among the U.S.’s 25 most populous metro areas.”

But Washington, D.C. remains completely dichotomous, with the percentage of residents living 50% below the poverty line increasing 1% during that period.
President Obama’s Christmas present to his federal friends will amount to nothing more than another lump of coal in the rest of America’s stocking.

UPDATE: The NFL released an official statement on Monday saying the officials in the Chargers-Chiefs game erred:

On the play, San Diego lined up with seven men on one side of the snapper.  This should have been penalized as an illegal formation by the defense.
Rule 9, Section 1, Article 3 (b) (1) of the NFL Rule Book (page 51) states that “No more than six Team B players may be on the line of scrimmage on either side of the snapper at the snap.”
The penalty for illegal formation by the defense is a loss of five yards.  This is not subject to instant replay review.  Had the penalty been assessed, it would have resulted in a fourth-and-seven from the San Diego 18 with 0:04 remaining, enabling the Chiefs to attempt a 36-yard field goal.

—


The NFL will reportedly concede on Monday that its officials may have cost the Pittsburgh Steelers a playoff spot when they failed to penalize the San Diego Chargers for having more than six players on one side of the long snapper on Kansas City Chiefs kicker Ryan Succop’s game-winning field goal attempt with eight seconds remaining in regulation on Sunday in San Diego. 
ProFootballTalk’s Mike Florio reported on NBC’s Sunday Night Football that the NFL will admit on Monday that the officials in the game should have given the Chargers a five-yard penalty on Succop’s missed 41-yard field goal attempt because San Diego had seven players (pictured) on one side of the line of scrimmage when NFL rules only allow six. The referees did not throw a flag, and Succop missed the field goal that could have sent the Steelers into the playoffs. He should have gotten a re-kick–a 36-yard field goal attempt. And had Succop made the attempt he should have been awarded, Pittsburgh would have miraculously made the playoffs. 
Here is the NFL rule in question: 


(a) When Team A presents a punt, field-goal attempt or a Try Kick formation, a Team B player, who is within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage, must have his entire body outside the snapper’s shoulder pads at the snap. (b) When Team A presents a field-goal or Try Kick formation: (1) No more than six Team B players may be on the line of scrimmage on either side of the snapper at the snap; Penalty: For illegal formation by the defense, loss of 5 yards from the previous spot. (2) Team B players cannot push teammates on the line of scrimmage into the offensive formation. Penalty: For unnecessary roughness, loss of 15 yards from the previous spot

Earlier in the year, New England Patriots rookie Chris Jones was penalized 15-yards for pushing his teammate during a New York Jets field-goal attempt that decided the game in favor of the Jets. 
After starting the season 0-4 with injuries at numerous positions, all the Pittsburgh Steelers needed to do to sneak into the playoffs was to win on Sunday and then hope that the Miami Dolphins, the Baltimore Ravens, and the San Diego Chargers all lost.
Incredibly, that almost happened. The Steelers (8-8) almost got the sixth and final AFC playoff spot, but Succop missed that 41-yard field goal and San Diego beat the Chiefs 27-24 in a wild overtime in which the Chargers faked a punt inside their own territory on their first drive in overtime that was also controversial. Kansas City seemed to return what appeared to be a fumble on that play for a touchdown to win the game, but the officials ruled that San Diego’s Eric Weddle’s forward progress was stopped. Former NFL head of officiating Mike Pereira disagreed with that interpretation: 

Replay did not stop the game because the ruling of forward progress is not reviewable. Should have been a strip and TD in my opinion.
— Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) December 30, 2013
Earlier in the day, the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Ravens, 34-17. The New York Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins, 20-7. The Steelers took care of business and defeated the Browns, 20-7. 
That meant San Diego would make the playoffs with a win over the Chiefs or a tie while Pittsburgh would only make the playoffs with a Kansas City win over San Diego.
And Kansas City, which sat its starting quarterback, Alex Smith, running back, Jamaal Charles, and a host of other starters to rest for next week’s playoff game, was leading for most of the game before San Diego tied the game with less than five minutes left and eventually won the game, taking the sixth and final AFC playoff spot.

19692	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/03/Gettysburg-where-is-the-president	Opinion	0	None	None	SomewhatPositive	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"

Historian Allen Guelzo, author of the New York Times bestselling book Gettysburg: The Last Invasion, rhetorically asked, “Where is the president? Where is the vice president? They aren’t here,” in an interview with Stephen K. Bannon on the Breitbart News live broadcast of Commemoration of Pickett’s charge on July 3.
During the three days of Gettysburg events, President Obama has been on a tour through Africa, traveling to Senegal, Tanzania, and South Africa.

Guelzo noted that it was mostly just ordinary people who showed up to the Gettysburg memorial, not just Americans but people from around the world who wanted to pay tribute to perhaps the most significant event and moment of sacrifice in our nation’s history. He also noted that the three-day commemoration of the event, July 1-3, was not covered by any of the major networks.


“Where is the Today Show? Where is Good Morning America?” said Guelzo.
Attendees have mostly shown great reverence to the honor and sacrifice of the men who fought on both sides of the battle, according to Guelzo. Most have honored Abraham Lincoln’s dictate in the famous Gettysburg Address: “never forget what they did here.” The “they” that Lincoln referred to were the soldiers in uniform on the battlefield 150 years ago who bled and died for the cause and the country that they believed in. 
Visitors endured torrential rainfall to see the battlefield as tens of thousands came to pay tribute to this special moment in American and world history. 

“One thing I tell people to do is just look around them here. This is a lot of people from all over the world. They are not here like they are at a theme park or a rock concert,” said Guelzo.
Presidents have frequently commemorated the great battles in American history with orations and memorials about the sacrifice of the men involved and the meaning of “American exceptionalism.” For instance, Ronald Reagan made a tribute to the “Boys of Pointe Du Hoc” on the 40th anniversary of D-Day and the beginning of the liberation of Europe.

Guelzo spoke about why he decided to write a book about Gettysburg, even though there have been so many written accounts of it in the past. He said that besides living in Gettysburg and being in close proximity, there were many stories about the battle that have been overlooked. “There were angles of this battle that I haven’t heard told before,” Guelzo explained.
One angle of the battle that Guelzo focused on was the role politics played in the Union Army. Though all were fighting for the Union, the soldiers and generals were divided on how to carry out the war. Peace Democrats, sometimes known as “Copperheads,” believed that the war was being fought for the wrong reasons–that Lincoln and the Republican Party were to blame for the war and secession. Guelzo said that Union General George McClellan, who ran against Lincoln in the 1864 presidential election, “often said he was divided on marching on Richmond or marching on Washington.”
Host Bannon called Guelzo’s book the “definitive” work on the subject, as it details both the minutia of the battle and the politics surrounding it, and it tells an interesting, gripping story about the individuals involved.
Bannon compared the narrative to those of the famous late Civil War historian, Shelby Foote, an incredible storyteller who wrote the three-part The Civil War: A Narrative and became famous to the general public after a performance on Ken Burn’s Civil War documentary.

Organizing for Action is a non-profit advocacy organization borne out of the Obama campaign infrastructure. Headed by veteran staff of Obama’s reelection, the organization’s mission is to use the resources that reelected Obama to promote his policy agenda. As a 501 c(4), it can accept unlimited donations. According to its 1st Quarter financials, however, it is struggling to attract the same big donors that fueled Obama’s reelection.
OFA raised $4.8 million in the first three months of 2013. This is a fraction of what the Obama campaign would raise each quarter, even though OFA can accept unlimited donations. OFA certainly tried to maximize this fundraising advantage. For a $500,000 contribution, donors would receive a seat on a “national advisory board” and attend quarterly meetings at the White House. The top donation to the group, however, was half this amount, $250,000 from activist Peter Munger. 
Last month OFA held a founders’ summit in DC, which featured President Obama. The event was open to donors giving at least $50,000 to the group. In the 1st Quarter, however, only 16 donors gave this amount. In all, just over 1,400 donors gave more than $250. 


The underwhelming haul can’t just be attributed to a post-election lull, either. In January alone, the RNC raised almost $7 million and the DNC raised over $4 million. In addition, President Obama has aggressively pushed several high-profile agenda items. Supporting these is OFA’s reason for existing and should have fueled significant contributions. 

OFA’s larger challenge is that a campaign structure to support on individual candidate doesn’t necessarily translate to particular policies. Voters support a candidate for a variety of reasons, often irrespective of policies. Even when a voter completely agrees on an issue, it doesn’t always mean they will take action on that issue. 
Deciding to take action in the climax of a national election is much different than taking action outside of the political frenzy, when daily life has returned. 
Another challenge for OFA is that, inevitably, base activists will turn their attention to other campaigns. Second term Presidents inevitably shrink from the domestic policy debate, as party activists focus on midterm elections and the next nominee for the White House. 
OFA’s struggles attracting big donors suggests this process has already started.

19704	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/22/Real-Step-by-Step-Immigration-Reform	News	1	None	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
The Gang of Eight immigration bill is a 1,200-page legislative monstrosity. Senators had roughly 72 hours to read the final version of this massive and complex bill before the votes began. Like with Obamacare, the Senate was supposed to pass the bill in order to find out what was in it.
But while lawmakers and the public were left in the dark, the White House strategists and special interest allies who crafted the bill knew exactly what it contained: immediate amnesty, weakened enforcement, and unending illegal immigration.


The House has said that it will not take up the Senate bill. Rather, it will consider immigration reform in a “step-by-step” process, one bill at a time. We share the belief that the way to address immigration policy changes is through step-by-step legislation, with individual reform measures first implemented and then verified in the proper sequence.
We are concerned, however, that the House will pass individual, incremental bills only to have them cobbled together in a backroom deal with Majority Leader Reid and the Gang of Eight. Through a series of procedural maneuvers, House leaders could agree to begin negotiations with the Senate, known as a conference, using one of these smaller, targeted bills, while the Senate could bring the Gang of Eight bill to the negotiations.
This scenario would open the back door for congressional leaders to create a new amnesty-first, enforcement-later “comprehensive” immigration bill. Once the conference approves the new bill and sends it back to each chamber, amendments are prohibited and only an up-or-down vote is allowed.

Another danger is that, after the House passes several smaller bills, congressional leaders could handpick negotiators to meet in secret and develop a “compromise” plan to “fix” the Senate bill and bring the new–even larger–comprehensive proposal to a vote in both chambers.
If House members allow any of their proposals to be combined into an omnibus immigration bill, they would, in effect, allow White House strategists and their special interest allies to determine the final outcome of immigration much the way they shaped the creation of the original Gang of Eight bill. They would be handing the reins over to the very people who have made it their mission to suspend the constitutional rule of law in matters of immigration enforcement.
House leaders, therefore, should make absolutely clear that any individual immigration bills must be considered separately by the Senate, not crammed together into a behemoth comprehensive proposal. It’s not step-by-step if the bills are merged with the Senate monstrosity at a later date–either through a formal conference or a closed-door negotiation. Any possibility of such an outcome must be ruled out. How can House leaders ask a single member of Congress to vote for step-by-step bills if they’re leaving the back door wide open to a comprehensive bill?
There must be no confusion. No word play. Step-by-step must mean just that: individual steps, not an all-in-one legislative colossus.
As we’ve seen with spending bills, an enormous amount of mischief can be accomplished by rushing through a package of different proposals in the form of one catch-all bill. It deprives lawmakers the opportunity to review and modify each element, and it deprives the public a chance to weigh in.
The devil, the saying goes, is in the details. And there are a lot of details in several thousand pages of legislation.

Saturday morning, Big Journalism ran the story of John Dickerson, a CBS News political director, who took to the online pages of Slate to suggest it was time for Obama to “destroy” and “pulverize” the Republican Party. 
Today, Dickerson took to the online pages of Slate again, this time to insist we all misunderstood him. His new headline and subtitle say it all:

They Hate Me, They Really Hate Me
Conservatives despise my analysis of Obama’s second-term options. But it was analysis–not advice.

He then writes:



Some people thought I was giving the president my personal advice. No. My goal was to make a compelling argument based on the facts. I used words like “war” and “pulverize,” and some have responded with threats to me and my family. (“Go for his throat!” some have counseled, echoing the headline.) These words have also liberated some correspondents (USUALLY THE ONES THAT TYPE IN ALL CAPS!!!!) from reading the piece or reading it in the spirit in which it was written.

All the left-wing bases are pretty much covered there: Oh, poor me; I’m the misunderstood victim who’s hated and receiving death threats from the wingers. 
I honestly believe that one of the Lefts’ primary tactics is to endlessly exhaust us with this kind of relentless tactical nonsense. 
If Dickerson was indeed writing analysis, he did an awfully good job ofdisguising it as naked advocacy. Here are the opening paragraphs of Dickerson’s original piece. Please tell me at which point this Obama cheer-leading distinguishes itself as anything nearing objective analysis: [emphasis added]


Go for the Throat!
Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party.
On Monday, President Obama will preside over the grand reopening of his administration. It would be altogether fitting if he stepped to the microphone, looked down the mall, and let out a sigh: so many people expecting so much from a government that appears capable of so little. A second inaugural suggests new beginnings, but this one is being bookended by dead-end debates. Gridlock over the fiscal cliff preceded it and gridlock over the debt limit, sequester, and budget will follow. After the election, the same people are in power in all the branches of government and they don’t get along. There’s no indication that the president’s clashes with House Republicans will end soon.
Inaugural speeches are supposed to be huge and stirring. Presidents haul our heroes onstage, from George Washington to Martin Luther King Jr. George W. Bush brought the Liberty Bell. They use history to make greatness and achievements seem like something you can just take down from the shelf. Americans are not stuck in the rut of the day.
But this might be too much for Obama’s second inaugural address: After the last four years, how do you call the nation and its elected representatives to common action while standing on the steps of a building where collective action goes to die? That bipartisan bag of tricks has been tried and it didn’t work. People don’t believe it. Congress’ approval rating is 14 percent, the lowest in history. In a December Gallup poll, 77 percent of those asked said the way Washington works is doing “serious harm” to the country.
The challenge for President Obama’s speech is the challenge of his second term: how to be great when the environment stinks. Enhancing the president’s legacy requires something more than simply the clever application of predictable stratagems. Washington’s partisan rancor, the size of the problems facing government, and the limited amount of time before Obama is a lame duck all point to a single conclusion: The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat.

As you can see, any claim that this is analysis, and not opinion, is complete nonsense. 
As the portions I’ve highlighted make clear, Dickerson’s entire piece was predicated on his obvious belief that Republicans are the problem, not Obama. All four of those paragraphs are loaded with criticism of the GOP, while Obama is presented as a reasonable man who tried his best to make things work only to find his noble intentions thwarted at every turn. 
The love for Obama starts in the next paragraph, as the GOP bashing continues:

President Obama could, of course, resign himself to tending to the achievements of his first term. He’d make sure health care reform is implemented, nurse the economy back to health, and put the military on a new footing after two wars. But he’s more ambitious than that. He ran for president as a one-term senator with no executive experience. In his first term, he pushed for the biggest overhaul of health care possible because, as he told his aides, he wanted to make history. He may already have made it. There’s no question that he is already a president of consequence. But there’s no sign he’s content to ride out the second half of the game in the Barcalounger. He is approaching gun control, climate change, and immigration with wide and excited eyes. He’s not going for caretaker.

How should the president proceed then, if he wants to be bold? The Barack Obama of the first administration might have approached the task by finding some Republicans to deal with and then start agreeing to some of their demands in hope that he would win some of their votes. It’s the traditional approach. Perhaps he could add a good deal more schmoozing with lawmakers, too. 


That’s the old way. He has abandoned that. He doesn’t think it will work and he doesn’t have the time. As Obama explained in his last press conference, he thinks the Republicans are dead set on opposing him. They cannot be unchained by schmoozing. Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence, other constraints will limit the chance for cooperation. Republican lawmakers worried about primary challenges in 2014 are not going to be willing partners. He probably has at most 18 months before people start dropping the lame-duck label in close proximity to his name. 


“Even if Obama were wrong about Republican intransigence…”
Whatevs. 

A look at Dickerson’s previous Slate columns only bolsters the case that he has no business presenting himself on CBS News, or anywhere, as an unbiased political analyst. 
But even if Dickerson’s DESTROY THEM! column is analysis, it’s ridiculously biased analysis, and biased only in favor of every premise Obama’s manufactured in his ongoing media/political war with the GOP. 
Maybe that’s the problem… Maybe what the corrupt media now considers “objective analysis” is so comfortable in the tank with Obama, that those of us who live in the real world can no longer distinguish between the rantings of the politically bloodthirsty Left and the mainstream media’s idea of analysis. 
Because there is no difference.

On Monday, Congressman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) challenged President Obama to a skeet shooting contest to prove the veracity of his recent claim that not only has he fired a gun, but that “up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.” The new Presidential revelation came in an interview with the left-leaning New Republic conducted in part by a former staffer on his 2008 campaign and published on Saturday:

New Republic: Have you ever fired a gun?
President Obama: Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time.
New Republic: The whole family?
President Obama: Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. 

Journalists, politicians, and the general public alike reacted with understandable skepticism to this politically expedient claim by the President. No one could recall ever seeing a photograph of President Obama shooting skeet, nor had he ever claimed before that he had ever participated in the sport. 
At the regular White House press briefing on Monday morning, a skeptical Jessica Yellin, CNN’s White House correspondent, pressed White House secretary Jay Carney on the issue. His response was less than convincing:



Yellin:    On a different topic, how often does the President go skeet shooting?  (Laughter.)  And are there photographs of him doing so?  
Carney:  I would refer you simply to his comments.  I don’t know how often.  He does go to Camp David with some regularity, but I’m not sure how often he’s done that.
Yellin:    Is there a photograph of him doing it?
Carney:  There may be, but I haven’t seen it.
Yellin:   Why haven’t we heard about it before?
Carney:  Because when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs.

Congressman Blackburn was among those skeptical of the President’s claim who remained unconvinced by Carney’s explanation. Monday night on CNN she issued her skeet shooting challenge to the President:


My money is on Congressman Blackburn.

As a candidate for president, Barack Obama promised to lead the most open, most transparent administration in history. He has not kept that promise. Time and again, members of his administration have failed to keep faith with the American people. Acting in secret, they have taken sometimes extraordinary steps to shield their actions from the public.
The latest example involved Lisa Jackson, who has led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency since the beginning of the president’s first term. Jackson is resigning, but only after it was revealed she used a fake name (Richard Windsor) to create a fake e-mail address to conduct official EPA business.


What Jackson did contravenes federal law which, because as a nation we value open and transparent government, prohibits such behavior.
This is not the first time the EPA has been in the spotlight because its administrator acted against the interests of transparency. Carol Browner, who led the agency under Bill Clinton and then served for a time as President Obama’s “environmental czar” – ordered the hard drive on her government computer erased and reformatted and all backup tapes destroyed only hours after a federal judge had ordered the EPA to preserve all agency e-mail records.
This conduct, the use of phony e-mail addresses and the erasure of computers pose an interesting question: What is the EPA and its administrators doing that they are so unwilling to have their official communications become public? It doesn’t paint a pretty picture for the left’s agenda or its methods of implementation.

Jackson’s conduct came to light only after a a whistle-blower divulged she was using her fake e-mail account to conduct controversial business, evade congressional oversight, and get around the requirements of the federal Freedom of Information Act. Typically, government business is conducted in public. Correspondence and e-mail must be available to scrutiny, both by Congress and the American people. When a fake name is used, it allows an agency and its employees to evade accountability.
There is no way around it. This is government corruption at its highest form – and the polar opposite of the kind of transparent and open government political leaders on both sides of the aisle claim to want.
EPA’s record of following the law and being transparent couldn’t be much worse. Obama’s EPA has twice failed to provide as required by law a “Unified Agenda” which is a compendium of regulations planned in the foreseeable future. For the record, no other administration has ever even once failed to meet the requirements of this law. This, combined with the more than 12,000 secret e-mails, suggests a pattern of chicanery, obfuscation, and lawlessness at Obama’s EPA.
The problem does not end with Ms. Jackson or her staff. For the last four years, when asked to respond to lawful requests for information by Congress or by American citizens under FOIA, EPA attorneys did not provide e-mail sent and received by the administrator at her “Richard Windsor” e-mail address. Moreover, they affirmed that all responsive e-mails had been provided, when they clearly had not.
It is important whether these attorneys knew or had reason to know that their representations were false. And it is incumbent on the U.S. Congress and, perhaps, the U.S. Department of Justice to begin an inquiry into whether they did so.

To stop the culture of corruption at the EPA, it is not sufficient for Ms. Jackson to step down. There must be a comprehensive investigation concerning the actions of Ms. Jackson, her staff, and EPA attorneys who were involved. It must be determined who knew about or participated in the corruption. Ms. Jackson clearly did but did anyone else? Any government employee involved should be fired and prosecuted. If they are an attorney, they should also be disbarred.
No one has ever gone to jail for violating the Freedom of Information Act but, the federal mail and wire fraud law is broadly used to target corruption in government that falls well short of bribery or extortion. Ms. Jackson and all those who participated in the fraudulent and fake e-mail scheme should face prosecution.
Once the 12,000 or more secret e-mails become public, Attorneys General and United States Attorneys all over the United States will likely have jurisdiction to investigate and perhaps even prosecute Ms. Jackson or anyone else who were involved in there e-mail fraud scheme. Congress should also have a full investigation and also determine if other of agencies have engaged in similarly corrupt schemes designed to shield their activities from public scrutiny, particularly those that pertain to the official function of their position and the development of public policy.
The Obama administration has been one of the least transparent or open administrations in memory. The activities of Lisa Jackson at the EPA are just one example of that. If the president hopes to remove the taint from his administration, he must take a personal interest in rooting out this sort of corruption. He cannot simply accept Ms. Jackson’s resignation and call the matter closed.

The George Soros-funded National Immigration Forum (NIF) is organizing a “fly-in” of what it calls conservatives from across the country aimed at lobbying House Republicans for an amnesty bill. 
According to USA Today’s immigration beat writer Alan Gomez, NIF is planning to organize the fly in with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us, and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Partnership for a New American Economy. 
“The fly-in is being organized not by conservative groups, but organizations that have focused on legalizing millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally and changing the legal immigration system to bring in more foreign workers,” Gomez wrote on Monday. He noted that the 300 activists for an immigration grand bargain were looking to make what he described as a “conservative pitch” for amnesty. 


Gomez noted NIF’s Executive Director, Ali Noorani, who “has advocated for changes in immigration law to help legal and undocumented immigrants for three decades,” claimed “the broad collection coming to Washington represents ‘the conservative base of the Republican Party.'”

The event will take place on Oct. 28, coinciding with President Barack Obama’s and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s renewed push against House Speaker John Boehner for amnesty. Now that Obama, Reid, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are publicly pushing for amnesty after many mainstream media outlets declared it dead earlier this year, Soros’ groups are trying to make it appear as though conservatives support immigration legislation like the Senate-passed “Gang of Eight” bill. Ultimately, the left’s goal is to get the House to pass a series of piecemeal immigration bills and then combine them with the Senate bill in a conference committee.
Soros is heavily involved in funding the lobbying for amnesty. After Breitbart News exposed NIF for being Soros-funded while running a campaign to make it appear as though evangelicals support granting amnesty to illegal immigrants, Noorani admitted his group accepts funding from Soros. Noorani denies that the funding was being used for the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT), a project that his group runs the operations of, but admits that millions of NIF’s dollars come from Soros and that about 10 percent of its budget this year comes from the leftwing billionaire. 
Soros is also intimately connected to Facebook’s Zuckerberg’s FWD.us push for amnesty. Zuckerberg hired Soros’ former chief financial strategist Stanley Druckenmiller. Druckenmiller served as Soros’ chief strategist for more than a decade.
Mitt Romney’s top 2012 campaign donor, Wall Street hedge fund manager Paul Singer, also funds NIF, as Breitbart News has reported.

Last week, GOP pundit Karl Rove wrote in The Wall Street Journal in support of the current Senate immigration bill, arguing it was much tougher on illegal immigrants than the 1986 law that granted amnesty to the three million illegals. Rove wrote that the ’86 law “essentially told those here illegally that if they had arrived in the U.S. prior to 1982 and wanted to become citizens, simply raise your right hand.” Ed Meese responded Friday that Rove’s description of the law was “way off the mark.”
In a letter published by the WSJ, Meese recalled that he was present in 1986 when the legislation was under consideration. He had examined the bill carefully at the time. He was, after all, US Attorney General then.  
“The 1986 act didn’t turn illegal immigrants into citizens on the spot. It granted temporary resident status only to those who could prove they had resided continuously in America for five years,” Meese writes. “Advancement to citizenship was not automatic. Immigrants had to satisfy various requirements along the way. They had to pay application fees, learn to speak English, understand American civics, pass a medical exam and register for military selective service. Those with convictions for a felony or three misdemeanors were ineligible.”


Meese goes on to note another similar, and troubling comparison between the current Senate bill and the 1986 Amnesty law. “The ’86 reform bill also had supposedly ‘rigorous’ border security and immigration law enforcement provisions. So how did that pan out?”

The 1986 law is a troubling parallel to today’s debate. That law was also intended to permanently “solve” the problem of illegal immigration. In granting three million illegals immigrants permanent legal status, the government also promised the public that it would secure the border and increase internal enforcement. 
That, of course, didn’t happen. Instead, within two decades, the number of illegal immigrants in the country had more than tripled to 11 million. Without hard triggers for border security, is there any rational reason to think our experience will be any different today?
Meese writes, “Amnesty “bends” the rule of law. And bending the rule of law to reach a “comprehensive” deal winds up provoking wholesale breaking of the law. Ultimately, it encourages millions more to risk entering the country illegally in the hope that one day they, too, might receive amnesty.”
Rove is spearheading an effort to get the GOP behind the Senate immigration plan. Not really because of any particular provisions in the legislation, but rather a simple political ploy to allow the GOP to merely say they supported reform. It is a misguided pandering that will sow the seeds for another illegal immigration problem in the future.

19751	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/03/01/CNN-Ali-Velshi-Obamas-Sequester-Propagandist	Opinion	1	None	None	SomewhatNegative	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Ali Velshi is CNN’s Chief Business Correspondent and Barack Obama’s Chief Sequester Propagandist. This so-called correspondent is a living breathing pipe-organ for the White House and its latest push to blame sequester — and by extension, the GOP — for Obama’s failed economic policies. 
A little after 2pm ET today, Velshi appeared on CNN with Brooke Baldwin. She asked how the business community is reacting to sequester. His response was to use both hands to grab hold of Obama’s talking points from earlier today and spread that sequester gospel like one of the president’s apostles:
Generally speaking the word from the business community is pretty standard. We are at a time in our economy where it would be useful to be building and expanding. We got unemployment edging down, jobs being created, very low interest rates, and an energy boom. We could be really moving to the top of the global pile in terms of economic activity, and this sort of thing [sequester] is like the government sticking its foot out just as your gaining speed as you’re running. 


Where to begin? 
This isn’t a little partisan spin coming from Velshi, it is full-blown Orwellian propagandizing. You expect this kind of flackery from David Axelrod, not someone CNN poses as an objective correspondent. 
1. Unemployment is not edging down. It is edging up. At best it’s stuck, and the CBO says it is going to stay stuck for at least another year. 

2. Job creation is barely treading water with population growth. 
3. An energy boom? Has Velshi filled his gas or home heating tank lately?
4. How exactly is our economy “gaining speed” when our economy plummeted around three-points last quarter to a growth level of one-tenth of one-percent? 
5. “We could be really moving to the top of the global pile?” Did Velshi really say that? Good grief. Even Obama is more careful with the happy talk. 
Then there are the lies of omission: The fact that we learned just today that the drop in income last month was the biggest in 20 years; and the fact that sequester represents about 2% of the federal budget, which translates to about a measly 1% of our GDP. 

The picture Velshi is outrageously and dishonestly trying to paint is that our economy is humming (when the EXACT opposite is true) and that, if it falters (to a point where even the media can’t happy talk it), the fault falls on the government being too small, which Obama tried so desperately to stop. 
But Velshi wasn’t done sucking up to Obama. Oh, no, someone’s looking for a “good dog” by blaming sequester in part on the right-leaning Chamber of Commerce:
But I have to tell you, the business community to some degree has fed this. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce really contributed to the partisanship and the election of people who are on both sides of this in Washington. And this is the result. 
In Velshi’s defense… he has earned that “good dog.”
Come on CNN, can’t you do a little better than this? The economy just might become the biggest story in the country soon. If you want to earn back an audience, you’re going to need a business correspondent with some credibility, respect for context, and more respect for the viewer than his failed agenda.

Up until just a few days ago, the American media were our country’s top cheerleaders for what they describe as “functional government.” The highest value in government, according to our media, was “getting things done.” And the way to get things done, we were told repeatedly, was through civility, compromise, and bipartisanship. But over the past couple of days, as the prospect of a government shutdown looms closer, the media have completely abandoned those principles.
In the name of civility, I’m old enough to remember (because it was just last week) when the media made politicians pay a heavy political price for harsh rhetoric and name-calling. Again and again, we have seen the media turn away from the issue at hand and make the “rhetoric” used to push the issue the issue. 
For example, when running for president last year, Newt Gingrich wanted to talk about the explosion of food stamp recipients under President Obama. But the media just wanted to talk about whether he was racist for using the words “food stamps.” 


Think about how many times some local Republican politician, or some conservative private citizen, at a town hall meeting, has made national headlines because of what the media described as “extremist political rhetoric.” Good heavens, how many times has some straggler’s Tea Party sign made NBC’s Chuck Todd tut-tut with disgust. 
Think about how many times the media have used how a conservative made a political point as a way to gang up on and relentlessly pummel him or her — all while ignoring the issue. 
Remember that whole fashion season of the media collectively wringing its hands over “eliminationist rhetoric?” Remember how the following fashion season was devoted to the scourge of “bullying.”

But that was then; this is now — and now the media have officially ended their opposition to over-the-top political rhetoric. We don’t know this because the media sent out a memo or made an official announcement; we know this because President Obama and Democrats have been accusing Republicans of being arsonists, anarchists, terrorists, extremists — and this is all Chuck Todd has to say about it…
—

“Hobby horse” “shenanigans” “extremists” and “burn the house down”.  How POTUS described Congress today. GOP getting a taste of bully pulpit
— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) September 27, 2013
—
And the rest of the media have been just as shoulder-shrugging and silent in the face of all this harsh, partisan, eliminationist rhetoric. 

But that is not the only change in media policy that happened this past week. The media are also no longer concerned with making Washington work or the value of bipartisanship and working across the aisle. President Obama, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi have made it absolutely clear that they will not negotiate in budget battles that could result in a government shutdown, and the media are absolutely okay with this.  
In the past, when Republicans dug in their heels or didn’t seem willing to compromise enough to satisfy Obama, the media were outraged over DC dysfunction and the lack of bipartisan compromise.
So it is finally over — the era of the media placing the highest value on bipartisan compromise and civility has finally ended. The media are now for harsh rhetoric, gridlock, and extremism. Or…
…maybe the media are just a bunch of hypocritical, lying, left-wing hacks who despise the GOP and are willing to sell their honor in order to help Obama to a political win?
Either way.

19766	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/29/Exclusive-Immigration-bill-would-load-immediate-fiscal-burden-onto-state-local-governments-by-allowing-illegal-immigrants-onto-welfare	News	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

The immigration bill introduced to the Senate a week and a half ago would, if passed, allow illegal immigrants to access state and local welfare benefits immediately, Breitbart News has learned. The financial impact of allowing potentially millions of immigrants onto state and local public assistance could overwhelm these programs’ budgets.
Senate Budget Committee ranking member Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) uncovered this loophole in the bill and many others, and he will circulate a memo detailing the gaps in the bill on Tuesday. Breitbart News exclusively obtained a copy of the memo before its public release.
“The Gang of Eight made a promise that illegal immigrants will not be able to access public benefits,” Sessions said in a statement to Breitbart News. “We already know that, once granted green cards and ultimately citizenship, illegal immigrants will be able to access all public benefit programs at a great cost to taxpayers. We have, however, identified a number of loopholes that would allow illegal immigrants to draw public benefits even sooner than advertised.”


If the bill were signed into law, America’s 11 million illegal immigrants would be legalized within six months, when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano submits her border security plan to Congress. Illegal immigrants would immediately be eligible for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, making them legal to live and work in the country.

As Sessions’ staff points out in the memo, “state laws frequently extend benefits to anyone ‘lawfully present’ in the U.S.” The Sessions team points to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) brief that details how the only requirement many state and local governments have with regard to immigrant access to public benefits is that they are “lawfully present.” The term “lawfully present” is a legal definition.

According to page 91 of the bill, all illegal immigrants granted legalized RPI status would legally be considered “lawfully present.” That section reads as follows:

”(4) TREATMENT OF REGISTERED PROVISIONAL IMMIGRANTS.–A noncitizen granted registered provisional immigrant status under this section shall be considered lawfully present in the United States for all purposes while such noncitizen remains in such status, except that the noncitizen–
”(A) is not entitled to the premium assistance tax credit authorized under section 36B of            the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
”(B) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in subsection (e) of such section; and           
”(C) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in section 1402(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18071).”


In evaluating whether an illegal immigrant qualifies for RPI status, Sessions’ staff points out, the legislation “explicitly forbids” the Department of Homeland Security from using current law, which blocks entry to those who could become “public charges,” i.e. dependent on government welfare programs.  

“Therefore, when those here illegally who are unable to support themselves are legalized, much of the immediate fiscal burden will fall on state and local governments,” Sessions’ staff wrote in the memo.

In addition to that loophole, Sessions and his staff found several more loopholes that allow current illegal immigrants access to public benefits even on the federal level before the promised wait time of 13 years from the bill’s passage.
In the memo, Sessions’ staff notes that current illegal immigrants who are “granted RPI status will immediately become eligible for federal benefits through citizen and permanent resident dependents, with no requirement that they support their household as a condition of receiving or maintaining legal status.” That means any current illegal immigrant who subsequently has dependent children, who are, by right of birth, U.S. citizens would qualify for federal welfare benefits through them.

The Obama administration will allow a massive rally for comprehensive immigration reform on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. on the National Mall, even though it is supposed to be closed due to the federal government shutdown.
Open-air spaces like the World War II Memorial have been barricaded since the federal government shut down last week, but an organizer for the rally told the Washington Examiner that the National Park Service will allow the rally and march.
As Breitbart News reported, immigration activists have called for volunteers to get themselves arrested at the rally in acts of civil disobedience.


The event will be a culmination of rallies across the country over the weekend in which immigration activists demonstrated in 41 states demanding amnesty. 

A variety of immigration activist organizations, along with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the AFL-CIO, are organizing the event, which they claim will attract 10,000 people.
Lawmakers in Congress like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (R-CA) and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) are expected to be at the event. Members of the House are trying to pass immigration reform bills that will allow them to go to conference with the Senate, which passed its comprehensive immigration bill in June that provided a pathway to citizenship for all of the country’s illegal immigrants. 
The Congressional Budget Office determined that bill would reduce the wages of working class Americans while not solving the country’s illegal immigration problem. 
House Republicans have been reportedly working under the radar on immigration reform, and Pelosi has said Democrats are willing to do “whatever it takes” to get to conference with the Senate. House Republican leaders have also expressed support in moving immigration reform legislation forward. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is the chairwoman of the House Republican conference, told Univision’s Al Punto on Sunday that “there’s still time” for immigration reform and that it is a “priority” for Republicans.
“We must pass immigration reform,” McMorris Rodgers said. 
A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) indicated that immigration reform will be next on the House’s agenda after the shutdown and the debt ceiling debates are resolved.

NBC will produce a miniseries based on the political career of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a project sure to polish her 2016 presidential aspirations. NBC’s programming is consistently left of center, and Bob Greenblatt, NBC Entertainment chairman, donated thousands to Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential bid.
Just casting the gorgeous Diane Lane in the lead role is bias enough.
The project will likely sugarcoat the Whitewater investigation, HillaryCare and TravelGate, but here’s betting the following five moments get left on the cutting room floor.


Those Imaginary chats with Eleanor Roosevelt – This one seems like a visual slam dunk, the sight of the First Lady having tea with a former First Lady–in her mind, at least. Imaginary conversations wouldn’t help Clinton’s image, so these chit-chats will have to go.
The Reset Button – The so-called smartest politician in the world reached out to Russia with a gimmick so silly Carrot Top would hurl it back into his prop trunk. She brought a red “reset” button to her meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as a way to distance herself from past negative vibes. Too bad she didn’t bring her English to Russian dictionary along since she bungled the translation. The moment wasn’t just embarrassing on the surface. Her button malfunction also signaled how she would undercut our allies in the region. 
“Under Sniper Fire” – Clinton tried to burnish her tough gal image with a fictitious story in which she was in danger from sniper fire during a 1996 trip to Bosnia. Clinton repeated the tale several times before admitting her landing reception wasn’t quite so deadly. 
“What Difference … Does It Make?” – Clinton’s infamous reaction to a line of questioning regarding the death of four Americans in Benghazi is a portrait of clinical indifference, and a quote that would haunt the rest of her political career had a Republican uttered it in that context.
“Vast Right Wing Conspiracy” – Clinton uttered this defense of her philandering husband, President Bill Clinton, as the Monica Lewinksy scandal was finding its legs. She blamed the rumor of her husband’s unfaithfulness on his political enemies, the so-called “vast right wing conspiracy” committed to ruining his career. This moment might make the final cut, if only put in the context of Republicans using her husband’s infidelities as a weapon against him. As if Democrats would do no such thing.

The process for people attempting to enter the country illegally through the Mexican border has often been characterized as grueling, dangerous and even potentially deadly; a trek across smoldering hot deserts led by ruthless ‘coyotes’ who profit from human suffering. 
Meet the new coyotes: immigration attorneys and government rule-writers.


According to the clear guidelines published on the Internet and updated by the Obama administration in mid-June, there’s an easier way to cross to gain entrance to the United States: simply step right up to a border crossing and tell the officials that you have a “crediblee fear” of persecution or torture. Use that exact phrasing and you may be able to enter the USA while you await a hearing before an immigration judge…a process that could take years. 
As Breitbart News reported yesterday in a story that swept through the Internet, that’s exactly what’s been happening recently with a flood of new asylum requests that seem designed to overwhelm the system.

The Obama Department of Homeland Security led by Janet Napolitano updated the information on their article Questions & Answers: Credible Fear Screening on June 18th, 2013. The article explains that if you claim ‘credible fear of persecution or torture’ that you can seek asylum, and that the process is subject to review. 

Individuals Seeking Asylum

If you are in expedited removal proceedings and found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture, you may seek asylum before an Immigration Judge (IJ). (See definition for Credible Fear in the “Glossary” link to the right)

If the asylum officer does not find that you have a credible fear of persecution or torture, you may request that an IJ review that determination. If you do not request review by the IJ or the IJ agrees with the determination, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may remove you from the United States.


It defines with a “credible fear” is:


Q.   What Is a Credible Fear of Torture?

A.   A “significant possibility” that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you would be subject to torture if returned to your country (see definition of Torture in the “Glossary” link to the right).


Elsewhere on the DHS site, the government draws a distinction between a “credible” fear and a “reasonable”fear. The credible fear standard appears to be a lower bar, which is likely why it became the key word used by about 200 people a week ago at the Otay crossing near San Diego.

Q. What is a reasonable fear of persecution?

A. You credibly establish that there is a “reasonable possibility” you would be persecuted in the future on account of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The legal standard is the same standard used to establish a well-founded fear of persecution in an asylum case.

You cannot establish a reasonable fear of persecution based only on past persecution without establishing a “reasonable possibility” of future persecution.  After a reasonable fear of persecution or torture is found, the Immigration Judge will decide if you are eligible for withholding of removal or deferral of removal.  Withholding of removal only provides protection against future persecution and may not be granted without a likelihood of future persecution. However, if you establish past persecution, there is a presumption that your fear of future persecution is reasonable.


The webpage spells out the Catch-22 of the asylum claim: if the asylum officer finds you have a “credible fear,” the next step is a hearing by an immigration judge. However, if the asylum officer does not find you have a “credible fear,” you can then request a appeal hearing by an immigration judge. Either way, you will have a hearing in front of a judge.
This is where the fun begins, because you will wait for your hearing in the United States under some sort of bond. Effectively, you are free to roam about the country for years. This “credible fear” tactic was used by Lizbeth Mateo, Lulu Martinez and the others in the Dream 9 group of illegal alien activists to gain reentry into the Unites States last week. 

As the Los Angeles Times reported:

The protest took root in July when Marco Saavedra of New York, Lizbeth Mateo of Los Angeles and Lulu Martinez of Chicago — all young adults brought into the U.S. illegally as children — voluntarily crossed the border into Mexico as a protest of the administration’s deportation policies. They tried to reenter the U.S. on July 22 with six other dreamers who also had been brought to this country illegally as children but had returned to Mexico more than a year ago for various reasons.


 The Times points out the claim that the Dream 9 are making that pushes the legal envelope:

A person seeking asylum must establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on “that he or she belongs to a race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” according to Citizenship and Immigration Services guidelines.

Some of the Dream 9 are petitioning for asylum, saying that they have family members who have been killed and face death threats themselves.

However, many in the Dream 9 claim they should be granted asylum because they belong to a particular group of people — that they are singled out and persecuted in Mexico because they have lived most of their lives in the U.S. They could become targets for criminal organizations that see them as easy prey for extortion and violence, they claim.


It bears repeating: some in the Dream 9 are claiming that they fear persecution in Mexico because they spent time in the United States as illegal aliens. They are prepared to argue that illegal aliens are are a particular social group that is due asylum consideration for having been illegal aliens.

It’s such an outlandish argument that it’s one only a lawyer could love, but it will be years until an immigration judge hears it. In the meantime, Dream 9 activist Lizbeth Matter remains in the United States and begins her first day of law school at Santa Clara University today.

After promising she would attend the “Million Vet March,” former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin went to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. on Sunday–along with Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX)–to support thousands of veterans demanding that President Barack Obama re-open the memorials that have been barricaded due to the government shutdown.
At the World War II Memorial, Palin said that Obama is showing a “shameful lack of respect” and a “lack of valor” by barricading the memorials to veterans from across the country that marched in Washington to demand that Congress pass a law making it illegal for the federal government to close the memorials in future government shutdowns. They reportedly chanted, “tear down these walls.”
“We were proud to stand with thousands of America’s vets and other patriotic Americans today in Washington, D.C. This morning, Todd and I met with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, and they joined us and other Americans at the World War II Memorial and then at the Lincoln Memorial, where we were met by a SWAT team in full riot gear!” Palin wrote in a Facebook post. “Watching those who have fought to protect freedom prevented by barricades from visiting these memorials to freedom was truly heart wrenching.”


Palin has said Messrs. Lee and Cruz are leading a party of “good guys” in the Senate against both party establishments that make up Washington’s permanent political class. After the Republican establishment attacked Lee and Cruz during the defunding Obamacare fight, Palin fiercely defended them for representing everyday Americans. Palin has also called for Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience regarding the “Barrycades” at the memorials. At the march, veterans removed barricades from the memorial and took them to the White House.
Though the Obama administration officials put up barricades at the open-air memorials, they allowed thousands of amnesty supporters to rally on the National Mall, which was also supposed to be closed due to the government shutdown, last week in support of comprehensive immigration reform. On Saturday, Palin called out the Obama administration for revealing what their true priorities are during what she called a government “slim-down.”


Lee urged the crowd to “stand strong for liberty” and emphasized the memorial “belongs to the people.”
Cruz echoed Lee’s remarks. 
After emphasizing that “our veterans should be above politics,” Cruz said he met with World War II veterans on “Honor Flights” last week and said they told him, “We stormed the beaches of Normandy, do they really think these little barricades [will keep us from seeing the World War II memorial]?”
Palin emphasized that Americans will now “take up the fight for freedom” and “won’t let you down”: 

We’re here to show that the size of America’s heart for our veterans is immeasurable! But look around – barricades to shut down our memorials? Is this how a Commander in Chief expresses his gratitude? This “shutdown” priority proves a shameful lack of respect. It reflects a person’s lack of valor.
But, Vets, We the People have learned from you! We know America will only remain the “Home of the Free” so long as we are the “Home of the Brave!”
So, as we honor you, U.S. Military, know that our gratitude will not sleep! We will be brave! You were not timid, so we shall not be timid in calling out ANY who heart-wrenchingly would use you as pawns in a political game.
America’s finest paid the price for our freedom today. Vets, you protected us from tyranny then. Rest now, it is OUR turn to protect against tyranny again.
Ronald Reagan said, “Some people live an entire lifetime wondering if they ever made a difference in the world.” YOU, vets, need never ask that of yourselves. You made ALL the difference!
Our war memorials remind us of the cost to keep us free. YOU paid the price! Rest now! We will pick up the mantle. We won’t let you down. We now take up the fight for freedom!

Here is video of Palin, Lee, and Cruz speaking at the event from a local news report:

19901	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/24/Menendez-immigration-reform	News	1	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"
According to Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), the so-called Gang of Eight’s immigration reform bill does not have enough votes at this point to pass the Senate. 
Even though the bill has exited the Senate Judiciary Committee with a 13-5 vote, Menendez says that it will not receive 60 votes thanks to Republican opposition. “We don’t currently have 60 votes identified in the Senate,” Menendez told Univision. “We need to add more votes on the floor. That means that the community in your state, in every state, should be contacting your state’s two US Senators saying that they want comprehensive immigration reform, that they are going to judge their political future based on this vote.”


Several Republican senators have expressed support for debating the bill, but do not support the bill itself yet, including Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Menendez does believe that by the time of the Senate vote, which he said will take place just after July 4, the votes will be there. “I believe that in those three weeks we can get the necessary votes and we will have the community. We are expecting that and working for that.”

The goal, said Menendez, would be to pressure the House of Representatives to pass a version of the bill by creating widespread Senate support. “We want to push this bill forward with the most positive votes we can find, more than sixty, the sixty we need to be able to pass it here in the Senate, so we can put pressure on the House,” he explained. “Speaker Boehner, will have to decide how he will proceed.”
Menendez’s statements on Univision are no coincidence – the Democrats’ plan for 2014 is largely built on the notion that by creating bipartisan support for immigration reform in the Senate, then forcing the House to stop a soft-on-border-security bill, they will be able to generate public support for taking the House back for President Obama.

In a commencement address in Atlanta on Sunday to graduating seniors at Morehouse College, President Barack Obama told graduates to fulfill the “special obligation I felt, as a black man like you.” The all-male, historically black liberal arts college was also the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., among other famous graduates.
The president told the graduating students that their background meant they had a duty “to create greater justice both in your own community, but also across our country. To make sure everyone has a voice; everyone gets a seat at the table; to make sure that everyone – no matter what they look like or where they come from, or who they love – gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they want it bad enough.”


Obama cited his own life as an example several times during his speech, touting his success as a father while also acknowledging some “bad choices” he made in his youth–a veiled reference to his admitted past drug use, which Obama has often acknowledged in books, speeches and debates.
He also admonished Morehouse graduates who aimed to join the professions that they ought to serve the poor: 

So yes, go get that law degree. But ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and powerful, or if you can also find time to defend the powerless. Yes, go get your MBA, or start that business. But ask yourself what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood….Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too.

(Here, the president did not mention his own rather unique career path as an attorney, which included defending landlords in large urban housing developments who had evicted tenants in winter or failed to provide necessary services.)

In one portion of his speech, the president touted Obamacare–and encouraged the graduates to sign up for the new health insurance exchanges created by his signature legislation. 
Obama seems to have been carrying out the advice of Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, brother of Obama’s former chief of staff, who argued recently in the Wall Street Journal that young Americans would have to be targeted by a propaganda campaign if the system were not to be dangerously underfunded: “Every commencement address by an administration official should encourage young graduates to get health insurance,” Dr. Emanuel wrote.
Obama advised the graduating class that racism could no longer be leaned upon as a reason for failure: “We’ve got no time for excuses,” he said. He also acknowledged that the U.S. had become tolerant enough to elect a black president. And yet Obama described a nation in which discrimination is still rampant:

See, as Morehouse Men, many of you know what it’s like to be an outsider; to be marginalized; to feel the sting of discrimination. That’s an experience that so many other Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when someone asks where they come from or tells them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they’re stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work – she sure feels it.

The premise of Obama’s claim is at odds with recent global survey data, which indicates that the U.S. is among the least racist countries in the world. It is also at odds with the record of his own political career. In the recent past, President Obama has been guilty of many of the sins described above–touting deportations of illegal immigrants; opposing gay marriage until a year ago; moving Muslims out of campaign photographs for fear of arousing prejudice; and, most notoriously, paying women less than men in both his Senate and White House offices.
Overall, President Obama’s remarks repeated a pattern of recent graduation speeches in which he minimized individual achievement in favor of collective obligation. 
Curiously, he barely mentioned government, which he has been at great pains to defend in some recent addresses–speeches that have drawn wider criticism in the wake of recent scandals involving abuses of government power.
The word “government” appeared five times in his recent Ohio State commencement speech but not once in the Morehouse address, where the only mentions of government careers were his own presidency and the Atlanta mayoralty of Maynard Jackson.
Obama’s emphasis at Morehouse was on voluntary service to the community–a theme closer to the American philosophical tradition, albeit reformulated to suit the policies and prerogatives of the administration and the Democratic Party.

On Wednesday, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) joined nearly two thousand trade unionists, open communists, socialists, anarchists and illegal aliens at Chicago’s May Day march and rally. 
Two large rally demonstrations that began at Union Park and Chicago’s Haymarket Riot monument converged into a giant march that shut down traffic for miles, and ended at Federal Plaza where they were joined by Senator Durbin.


Durbin made remarks to the red, yellow and black flag waving crowd about “immigration reform.” Opening with “My fellow immigrants,” Durbin told the crowd “this is a once in a lifetime chance” to get “immigration reform.”

Following his speech, I spoke to the senator about his participation:

(May Day is apparently also Law Day in America, but after covering the last three May Day marches in Chicago, I have never heard about Law Day, at any of the marches or elsewhere.) 
Durbin then mounted a rather bizarre defense of his participation in the rally–on free speech grounds:

Rebelpundit: There is a large contingent of Communist Party USA, anarchists, international socialist groups here today that you just spoke to…
Durbin: How do you know that?
Rebelpundit: Because I’ve filmed them all day, and you just spoke to them, so I’d like to ask about your participation, why you decided to come out today?
Durbin: Well let me just say something, because [pause] I believe in the Constitution. Do you believe in it?
Rebelpundit: Because you believe in the Constitution you decided to come out to a rally full of communists and socialists?
Durbin: And you know why?
Rebelpundit: Why?
Durbin: Because we have freedom of speech in America, and that’s why you can record this and not be arrested.
RebelPundit: You think I should be arrested?
Durbin: No, not at all, you have a right to your constitutional rights, and I do, too.

Of course, Durbin could go to a Nazi or KKK rally, too–but does that mean, as a United States Senator, he should?

Some of you younger folks might not remember this, but there was a time when the media questioned Power. No, really, once upon a time, the media saw it as its duty to be forever questioning and skeptical of Power, especially when Power was in pursuit of more power. 
For example, Obama is attempting to grab more power for The State and criminals by way of gun control laws that infringe on our Second Amendment civil rights. In order to make his case, Obama is attempting to appear reasonable on the issue of guns, and one way he did this was to reassure Americans that he too is a sport shooter, and enjoys skeet shooting at Camp David. 


Now, to those familiar with Obama’s record of opposing guns at every turn and lying about almost everything, that struck us as odd. 
Today, however, the White House released a photo that purports to show Obama (love that tucked-in shirt) shooting skeet last August. Except… he’s shooting straight ahead, which means that there’s either a barn door somewhere in need of some patching, or Obama is such an awesome skeet shooter, he hits them as they come out of the firing device. 
I keed, I keed. There are legitimate reasons that would explain the angle of his gun, but….

Because the photo is odd, some are asking perfectly legitimate questions.  
But not the media. 
What did the media do? 
Because the media no longer questions or is skeptical of Power, and instead sees its role as protector of The State, the media mocked those who were skeptical:

That doesn’t include tweets mocking skeptics that the likes of Ben Smith and a number of Politico reporters are gleefully retweeting. 
Thus far, I haven’t seen a single tweet from the media making the point that a single photo doesn’t quite square the circle of Obama making it sound as though he regularly shoots skeet. 
Couple important things to keep in mind: Again, Obama is using skeet-shooting as a political talking point to further an agenda. So this is not an inconsequential matter, as some claim. 
Secondly, while firing off this talking point, Obama made it sound as though he regularly shoots skeet. But it won’t matter that the White House has only released a single photo and thus far refuses to disclose how many times Obama’s actually shot skeet. 
You see, the media is proud to publicly proclaim that it doesn’t matter if Obama lies. No, really. How depressing to know a White House reporter at a major news outlet doesn’t give a “rat’s a**” if  the president of the United States is lying: 
—

Question isn’t whether Obama ever shot skeet. The question is did he shoot skeet to get a photo shot… And who gives a rat’s ass?

So why so much immediate mockery from the media? Well, rather than pushback against a White House trying to shut down skeptics, as soon as this tweet was released from a top Obama guy, the media did as it was told:

19951	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/22/Real-Step-by-Step-Immigration-Reform	Opinion	0	None	None	SomewhatNegative	SomewhatPositive	breitbart.com	"
The Gang of Eight immigration bill is a 1,200-page legislative monstrosity. Senators had roughly 72 hours to read the final version of this massive and complex bill before the votes began. Like with Obamacare, the Senate was supposed to pass the bill in order to find out what was in it.
But while lawmakers and the public were left in the dark, the White House strategists and special interest allies who crafted the bill knew exactly what it contained: immediate amnesty, weakened enforcement, and unending illegal immigration.


The House has said that it will not take up the Senate bill. Rather, it will consider immigration reform in a “step-by-step” process, one bill at a time. We share the belief that the way to address immigration policy changes is through step-by-step legislation, with individual reform measures first implemented and then verified in the proper sequence.
We are concerned, however, that the House will pass individual, incremental bills only to have them cobbled together in a backroom deal with Majority Leader Reid and the Gang of Eight. Through a series of procedural maneuvers, House leaders could agree to begin negotiations with the Senate, known as a conference, using one of these smaller, targeted bills, while the Senate could bring the Gang of Eight bill to the negotiations.
This scenario would open the back door for congressional leaders to create a new amnesty-first, enforcement-later “comprehensive” immigration bill. Once the conference approves the new bill and sends it back to each chamber, amendments are prohibited and only an up-or-down vote is allowed.

Another danger is that, after the House passes several smaller bills, congressional leaders could handpick negotiators to meet in secret and develop a “compromise” plan to “fix” the Senate bill and bring the new–even larger–comprehensive proposal to a vote in both chambers.
If House members allow any of their proposals to be combined into an omnibus immigration bill, they would, in effect, allow White House strategists and their special interest allies to determine the final outcome of immigration much the way they shaped the creation of the original Gang of Eight bill. They would be handing the reins over to the very people who have made it their mission to suspend the constitutional rule of law in matters of immigration enforcement.
House leaders, therefore, should make absolutely clear that any individual immigration bills must be considered separately by the Senate, not crammed together into a behemoth comprehensive proposal. It’s not step-by-step if the bills are merged with the Senate monstrosity at a later date–either through a formal conference or a closed-door negotiation. Any possibility of such an outcome must be ruled out. How can House leaders ask a single member of Congress to vote for step-by-step bills if they’re leaving the back door wide open to a comprehensive bill?
There must be no confusion. No word play. Step-by-step must mean just that: individual steps, not an all-in-one legislative colossus.
As we’ve seen with spending bills, an enormous amount of mischief can be accomplished by rushing through a package of different proposals in the form of one catch-all bill. It deprives lawmakers the opportunity to review and modify each element, and it deprives the public a chance to weigh in.
The devil, the saying goes, is in the details. And there are a lot of details in several thousand pages of legislation.

At a White House press conference Friday afternoon, President Obama said he was “absolutely certain” the Senate amnesty bill would pass the House if it were brought to the floor for a vote. Obama said the Republican leadership should put the bill up for a vote. The problem is, the House doesn’t have the bill. The Senate still has not delivered its bill to the House for consideration. 
In the days after the Senate passed its bill, House Ways and Means Chairman David Camp pointed out that the bill is unconstitutional, in its construction. The Senate bill raises revenue by creating new taxes and fees. According to the Constitution, however, legislation that raises revenue can only be introduced first in the House. 
This creates a real dilemma for Senate backers of the bill. As my colleague Matt Boyle explained at the time:



When such a revenue-raising bill comes out of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, currently Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), can use a procedure called a “blue slip resolution” to automatically kill it on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. Stockman has been promising to attempt to kill the Senate’s bill that way and, as such, Reid has refused to send it to the House, thereby protecting the bill from being “blue slipped.” The term “blue slip,” Stockman’s office noted in a release, comes from the blue color of the paper on which a resolution is printed that returns a Senate bill back to the Senate in these situations.

This is why supporters of the Senate bill are so eager to conference with the House. They need even a simple piece of legislation on immigration to get around the constitutional problem. Conferees could strip out all the language of the House bill and substitute the Senate provisions, and the resulting bill would be constitutional. 
GOP Leadership isn’t blocking the House from voting on the Senate bill. The drafters of the original Senate bill are the ones blocking the House.

A federal program originally designed to provide rural residents with phone service in case of emergencies is now one of the fastest growing welfare programs. Costing just around $140 million a few years ago, federal spending on the subsidy has exploded to $2.2 billion. 
Created in 1984, under President Reagan, the program is funded by a tax on regular phone service. The program was intended to cover the high capital costs of running telephone lines to remote, rural areas. In 2008, however, the program was expanded, through bureaucratic rule-making, to include cell phones. Today, a number of companies offer “free” cell phones and cell phone service plans to low-income people on welfare or food stamps. 
The program seems riddled with waste, however. The FCC recently admitted that an audit found almost 300,000 individuals with more than one subsidized phone. The Agency also testified to Congress that the top 5 companies offering phones and service couldn’t verify the eligibility of 41% of the recipients of the free phones. 


The history of this program should caution those embracing a new phone subsidy contained in the “Gang of 8” immigration bill unveiled last week. The program, dubbed “MarcoPhones” by some commentators, would provide grants to people living within 100 miles of the border who “lack cellular service” to purchase satellite phones. 

The proposal originated in legislation introduced by Sens. McCain and Kyl in 2011, in response to the murder of a rancher who lived in an area with weak cellular coverage. That proposal had very general eligibility criteria, but restricted funding to just $3 million over 2 years. The “Gang of 8” proposal, however, keeps the broad eligibility criteria, but removes any funding restriction. 
The original federal program to provide telephone service to residents in rural areas was well-intentioned. Establishing a dedicated funding mechanism, however, enabled the program to continue long after its goal was achieved. The FCC is considering expanding the program even beyond cell phones to also subsidize broadband internet connections. 
Government programs, left on their own, will always expand. The “MarcoPhone” program in the immigration bill is a test case. Applying very broad eligibility criteria with no funding restriction is a recipe for potential fraud and waste. It is a very small part of a large bill, but it could have very real long-term fiscal consequences.

Congressman Gohmert (R-TX) introduced an amendment to the Continuing Resolution preventing Obama from using federal funds to transport himself to/from a golf course until White House resumes giving tours to the public. 
Today, the White House Vistor’s Office sent out an email to interested parties that announces the suspension of all White House Tours due to the sequester cuts. 



ATTN Interested Parties,
Due to staffing reductions resulting from sequestration, we regret to inform you that White House Tours will be canceled effective Saturday, March 9, 2013 until further notice.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to reschedule affected tours. 
We very much regret having to take this action, particularly during the popular Spring touring season.   For updates regarding this situation, please contact the White House Visitors Office 24 Hour Hotline at (202) XXX-XXXX.
Sincerely,
White House Visitors Office

Congressman Gohmert is a history enthusiast who frequently gives extended tours of the capitol in the evenings to his constituents.  Many tourists come to D.C. this time of year on vacation, specifically to visit the Cherry Blossoms, projected to bloom at the end of the month. These tourists will not be able to take a tour of the White House, and if they scheduled a tour, the tour is cancelled. 

The rules committee in the House is currently deciding whether or not they will allow amendments to be included in the CR.  If they decide to allow amendments, Gohmert will attach his amendment.
Gohmert’s amendment reads: None of the funds made available by a division of this Act may be used to transport the President to or from a golf course until public tours of the White House resume.
According to ObamaGolfCounter.com, the president has played 115 rounds of golf since taking office.  Townhall’s Heather Ginsberg estimates that 341 furloughed jobs could have been saved had the money not been spent of golf trips.

President Barack Obama unveiled his “Power Africa” program on Sunday that will spent $7 billion in U.S. taxpayer money to fund a sub-Saharan Africa electricity program that will also develop geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar power.
The International Energy Agency says achieving universal electricity access to sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 would require $300 billion.


Obama said his plan is meant to bring “light where there is currently darkness.”   

The Obama White House released a statement saying that the president’s Africa plan “will commit more than $7 billion in financial support over the next five years,” including: 

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide $285 million in technical assistance, grants and risk mitigation to advance private sector energy transactions and help governments adopt and implement the policy, regulatory, and other reforms necessary to attract private sector investment in the energy and power sectors. 
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) will commit up to $1.5 billion in financing and insurance to energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa.
The U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) will make available up to $5 billion in support of U.S. exports for the development of power projects across sub-Saharan Africa. 
The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will invest up to $1 billion in African power systems through its country compacts to increase access and the reliability and sustainability of electricity supply through investments in energy infrastructure, policy and regulatory reforms and institutional capacity building.
OPIC and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will provide up to $20 million in project preparation, feasibility and technical assistance grants to develop renewable energy projects.  These efforts will be coordinated through the U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative (US-ACEF) and supported by the recently launched U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Development and Finance Center (CEDFC) in Johannesburg, South Africa.
The U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF) will launch a $2 million Off-Grid Energy Challenge to provide grants of up to $100,000 to African-owned and operated enterprises to develop or expand the use of proven technologies for off-grid electricity benefitting rural and marginal populations. 
In 2014, OPIC and USAID will jointly host an African energy and infrastructure investment conference.  The conference will bring investors, developers, and companies together with U.S. and African government officials to demonstrate the opportunities for investment and the tools and resources available from the U.S. government and other partners to support investment.

Power Africa will also receive $9 billion from General Electric and other private companies.

Breitbart News has learned that Tea Party Patriots is asking its members to pressure Congress to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the IRS’s targeting of conservative and Tea Party organizations. 
The organization is calling on Congress to conduct “substantive” investigative hearings in the wake of recent reports that senior IRS officials knew in 2011 exactly what was going on, despite initial claims that local “low-level” employees were the only ones involved in targeting conservatives.
Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin said that on Friday “we learned that the IRS lied to Congress and the American citizens when Douglas Schulman said there was ‘absolutely no targeting’ of Tea Party groups who applied for nonprofit status.” Martin was referencing Schulman’s March 2012 Congressional testimony.


Today we are learning that the IRS lied when they said that only “low-level employees” were to blame for outrageous and egregious overreach and abuse of power. The AP is reporting in June 2011, IRS division head Lois Lerner instructed employees to change the criteria for “flagging groups ‘immediately'” and in August 2011 “the IRS” Rulings and Agreements office “held a meeting with chief counsel so that everyone would have the latest information.”  
A Saturday report by the Associated Press, citing a draft of a forthcoming Inspector General report, found that “senior Internal Revenue Service officials knew agents were targeting Tea Party groups as early as 2011.” The AP notes that this report’s findings “seemingly contradicts public statements by the IRS commissioner.”
On Friday, the IRS admitted to targeting conservative and Tea Party groups and apologized for the behavior. But with this new information, Martin said her organization “rejects the apology from the Internal Revenue Service.”
“It appears the IRS committed crimes and violated our ability to exercise our First Amendment Right to Free Speech,” Martin said. “A simple apology is not sufficient reparation for violating the Constitutional rights of United States citizens.”

In the release, Martin said Tea Party Patriots is “encouraged to hear that Congress plans to investigate. Those responsible must be held accountable and must resign or be terminated for their actions.”  
Martin also asked conservative grassroots activists “around the country to help us with two things.”
First, she asked activists to help make sure “that the hearings in Congress are substantive and get to the bottom of this scandal to reveal how deep it runs, how many other lies the IRS has told related to the these tactics, and what will be done to insure no other group of citizens is so unfairly discriminated against solely because they are speaking out against rampant government.” She called on members to “call your Member of Congress and both of your Senators to let them know that we must get to the bottom of this scandal.”
Second, she said Tea Party Patriots needs to “hear from you if you or your local group has felt intimidated by the IRS actions over the last 4 years.” 
Are you part of a local group who applied for tax-exempt status? What is the status of that application?  Did you set out to form a group but were so intimidated by the IRS tactics that you abandoned that goal and wound up participating only as individuals rather than incorporating and coordinating activity with other groups?
Martin provided a website for conservatives to use to submit any stories of abuse, available here.

Capitol Hill talk regarding the Senate deal apparently includes a provision that would take away the Congress’ power to increase the debt ceiling. According to Politico, it looks like the buzz appears to be true.:

The plan includes a proposal offered by McConnell in the 2011 debt ceiling crisis that allows Congress to disapprove of the debt ceiling increase, which means lawmakers will formally vote on whether to reject a debt ceiling increase until Feb. 7. Obama can veto that legislation if it passes. If Congress fails as expected to gather a two-thirds majority to override the veto, the debt ceiling would be raised.

National Journal reported last week:



Whether it’s four weeks from now or in one year, there’d be even less reason to put faith in a last-minute deal next time the U.S. is up against the debt limit.
There’s only one foolproof way to avoid a future crisis: Fundamentally change the way the debt ceiling works. 
This approach isn’t all that radical. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., proposed a reform in January that would change the debt-ceiling mechanism so that Congress would vote to disapprove of an increase, as opposed to approving one. Such a change would limit debt-ceiling negotiations to a veto-proof majority, while still leaving Congress with some power.
The most interesting part of this proposal? It was originally floated in 2011 by Republican leader Sen. Mitch McConnell. The potential for a bipartisan deal here that fixes the debt-limit problem is real. Sen. Boxer continues to advocate for the change. Right now though, Harry Reid’s office says the senator is not considering any disapproval mechanism. But that could change as this process moves on.
Such a plan would be obviously good for Democrats, as they can get the immediate gratification of not having to risk default in order to fully implement the Affordable Care Act. But it’d be good for Republicans too, who could not only avoid the stigma of blame for a default, but also presumably reap the ruling-party rewards in future Congresses and presidencies. It would also put an immediate political target on President Obama, and Democrats by association, for being the sole entity responsible for raising the debt limit by over a trillion dollars. That opportunity has got to sound pretty good to Republicans ahead of 2014.

Additionally, New York Magazine remarked, the provision would “defang the debt ceiling, returning it to its historical place as an opportunity for ineffectual posturing rather than extortion.” However it would only apply to the next debt ceiling vote.  The debt limit can only currently be increased if Congress affirmatively votes to raise it and the president signs it into law.  During Congress’ last debt limit debate in 2011, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R – KY) wanted to invert this process by making it automatic, unless Congress voted against it and the president did not veto it.  Theoretically, Congress could override a veto, but given the current makeup of both chambers that would be nearly impossible.

After Republican Senator Ran Paul told Secretary of State Hillary Clinton he would have removed her from that office were he president, ABC’s Terry Moran fired off this tweet:
—

Curious: What is Rand Paul’s foreign policy background? Did he serve in the military? Did he study, live, do business or charity overseas?

Translation: How dare he question the next president of the United States!
This is classic mainstream media tactical deflection. In order to take the spotlight off Hillary not reading the cables (which is why Paul criticized her) from our Libyan consulate requesting more security, Moran wants to make Paul the issue. 

You see, Paul’s question and statement of fact doesn’t matter, because Paul’s resume is more important. 
This is how the media turns an inconvenient narrative away from its own (a Democrat) and then trains its fire on whomever dares to politically damage one of its own. Libya has been a non-stop exercise in this kind of media behavior. Four Americans die under Obama’s watch, Romney dares say something, and the media makes him the story for 10 days; not the terrorist attack, the lack of security, or the subsequent administration cover up. 
Remember all the hand-wringing we saw from the elite media when someone with no foreign policy experience ran for president in 2008?
Yeah, me neither. 
Man alive, what an era the Democrats live in! No accountability, the watchdogs always have your back; and like magic, lies are turned into truth.

In a speech Saturday evening to the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition at the group’s 13th annual fall banquet in Des Moines, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) argued that now is the time for the Tea Party movement to take its next steps, take control of American government, and frame America’s future with a focus on conservative and liberty-minded principles.
Lee compared the movement’s next stages to those of the American revolution, noting how the earliest stages of revolution began in Boston with the Boston Tea Party, where a band of protesters dumped British tea in the Boston Harbor as a sign of disapproval of the high taxes the British had levied on them. That eventually turned into the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia after Americans fought and won their independence from the British.
“In order to chart our course forward, join me on a journey back,” Lee said in the speech, according to an advance copy provided to Breitbart News. “Back to a time when the people of this continent were just as frustrated with their oppressive government as all of us here tonight are with the Federal government today.”


Lee noted that in 1773, “a group of Americans had had it with the King George establishment which was too big, too expensive and too intrusive in their lives.”
“What would become known as the Boston Tea Party became a clarion cry against the kind of government the colonists did not want,” Lee said. “It turned out to be a pretty important party and a very big deal. But had they stopped at just protesting against the kind of government they didn’t want the Boston Tea Party would not have been even a footnote in history. It would have been just one more vain protest against an oppressive federal establishment.”
Lee explained how the Founding Fathers of America “pressed forward from Boston” and continued their protest and “began a journey toward the kind of government they did want” instead of just protesting a government they disliked.

“It took them 14 long years to get from Boston to Philadelphia, where in 1787 they created, in the Constitution, the kind of government they did want,” Lee said. “Boston to Philadelphia. That is a good model for us to follow today.”
Lee argued that the Tea Party movement and conservatives must always fight against “bad government,” but that the movement must also find a way forward to fight for the right kind of government. “While we must always challenge and fight against bad government we must also be found promoting and pursing the policy path toward the kind of federal government we do want and the people deserve,” Lee said. “Unfortunately with this administration we have, of necessity, had a lot of Boston battles – from fiscal cliffs and attacks on our 2nd amendment rights to sequester and of course, Obamacare.” 
“So let me be clear – we will never back down from a Boston moment – and we will never stop rallying the American people to fight those battles,” he explained. “But it is just as important to keep our eyes in the direction of Philadelphia and the principles and policies which will lead us ultimately to the kind of government we do want.”
According to Des Moines Register, Lee was in Iowa to rally conservatives for the next phases of the battle ahead. He is not running for president–“absolutely not” he answered when asked by the Iowa paper if he would consider a White House bid. Instead, what Lee is doing is becoming the intellectual leader of the conservatives in the U.S. Senate. 
Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Marco Rubio (R-FL), the conservatives with whom Lee usually keeps company, are each potential presidential candidates in 2016. Lee is not, and that puts him in a unique position to focus on accomplishing building the conservative movement and a future message for the Republican Party.

In the past few weeks, Lee has developed a new agenda for the GOP focused on populism. Matt Continetti noted in the Weekly Standard that Lee argued that in a recent speech delivered to the Heritage Foundation, “Candidates need policy ideas that address the concerns of ordinary voters–and they have to campaign, and win, on those ideas.”
Lee’s goal, as he said in the Iowa speech on Saturday, is to help the GOP and the conservative movement develop a platform from which to win the hearts and minds of voters, and more importantly, get the country back on the track to prosperity. 
“To deserve victory, conservatives have to do more than pick a fight,” Lee said. “We have to win a debate. And to do that, we need more than just guts. We need an agenda.”
“It is a long march from Boston to Philadelphia,” he added. “And make no mistake – there are more Boston battles ahead and ‘we the people’ must always be ready to stand up and speak out against the kind of government we do not want. Bad government and bad policy must always be hit, and stopped, head on. Likewise, we must always have the vision of Philadelphia before us – a vision and an agenda for the type of government and they kind of country we do want.”
This has been Lee’s plan since he was elected in 2010, and he is executing it step by step. In 2010, in his election night victory speech, Lee also made the argument that the Tea Party movement needs to travel from Boston to Philadelphia.

The Louisville Courier-Journal has a long and storied history. Originally the product of a merger between several Louisville newspapers in 1868, the newspaper has been the largest print outlet in the city for well over a century. But of late, the newspaper has undergone severe economic problems, with owner Gannett Company laying off 51 employees in 2008 and 44 more in 2009.

Part of that is the newspaper’s dramatic shift to the left over the past few years. Since the election in November, the newspaper’s editorial board has called for Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to resign as Senate Minority Leader and accused McConnell of being the target of “national ridicule,” and run comics depicting McConnell consigned to the flames of hell; it has suggested that Senate Republicans “smacked down the disabled of this country and the world.”

In the latest symptom of that circulation-killing shift left, the newspaper is laying off longtime columnist John David Dyche, a Harvard Law grad and area lawyer who has been writing the token conservative column on the paper since 2003.

Why are they laying Dyche off? Dyche proposed a column to the newspaper suggesting fixes for their editorial woes, including:

“balanced opinion pages” rather than “stridently liberal”; 
disclosing editors’ and reporters’ politics – “Journalists believe that they, unlike mere mortals, can transcend their personal opinions to be basically fair and objective in presenting the news.  Perhaps, but readers should be the ones to judge”;
open meetings about editorial decisions – “Let the public see how and by whom decisions are made as to what to cover, who should cover it, and what headlines, photographs, and placement it receives.”

The editorial board did not take such suggestions kindly, and rejected the column outright. They told Dyche that the column was not within the purview of his mandate as a conservative columnists. Editorial Director Pam Platt left Dyche a message:

Hi, John David, it’s Pam Platt at the Courier-Journal and I’m just calling to let you know that I’m not going to run your column tomorrow.  To me it goes sort of off of what your column is supposed to be.  My understanding is a conservative take on issues of the day and that’s not what this is.  So, anyway, thanks a lot and I’ll talk to you soon.
Dyche responded by email:

[T]he submitted column is very much about “a conservative take on the issues of the day.”  One of those issues is liberal media bias.  Another such issue is the survival of old line newspapers in a changing media marketplace.  Conservatives think there is liberal media bias and that old line newspapers would fare better in the marketplace if they made changes of the sort I propose.  Indeed, your refusal to run this column vividly illustrates the very issues about which I write!
Dyche added, “If there is no change of mind on the paper’s part we should probably end my decade-old relationship with the paper.” Platt quickly wrote back, “I do want to thank you for the pieces you did on the opinion pages for the past 10 years, and I wish you the very best in your life and your work.”
That’s how the left handles calls for balance. By destroying the only semblance of balance they have left.

Partial transcript via Fox News:
ED HENRY: Can you give us an update on the sequester because yesterday, the Customs and Border Protection (INAUDIBLE) said that they’re actually postponing furloughs and overtime cuts for border patrol agents. I thought in February, when Secretary Napolitano came out here with you, she told us it was dire, these border patrol agents were going to be furloughed and that we were going to be less safe because of that.

JAY CARNEY: Well, I think both are true. What is — what is a fact is that when you’re dealing with these kinds of across-the-board forced budget cuts in the middle of the fiscal year and you’re having to make all sorts of adjustments to account for them and to reduce your expenditures accordingly, you know, it’s a moving picture. And you know, what — and that can be on the plus side where furloughs may take place a little later or on the minus side, where things may be more immediate.
Watch the video to see how heated it got. More proof Henry is a great reporter. 
Though they are more than capable of going overboard at times, the media-at-large does a very good job of vetting and holding Republicans accountable. What Ed Henry just did used to happen practically every day to the White House press secretary between the years of 2001 and 2009. Moreover, there were frequent gang tackles where members of the White House press corps would coordinate to ensure a question got answered. 
I didn’t hear anyone jumping in to help Henry, did you?
And these lapdogs wonder why Obama treats them like one-night stands.

During his radio show on Friday, Rush Limbaugh told his listeners, “I think abortion is at the root of so much that has and is going wrong in this country.” 
The conservative host went on to discuss that the reason why amnesty is essential to the liberal agenda is because abortion has, since Roe v. Wade in 1973, wiped out millions of potential taxpayers. The Democrat Party, Limbaugh said, has turned to amnesty as a means to ensure a “permanent underclass” in order to continue its image as the party of big government entitlements. 


Limbaugh said: 


Folks, let me tell you the way Washington thinks, in many ways, but this is one way they think.  They need money.  The US government needs money.  We are hopelessly in debt.  The tax increases that are coming are already over the top.  Washington knows, much of official Washington knows that they’ve gone beyond the point here, taxation, because the impact on economic growth and productivity and creativity has now been stifled.  I mean, the tax rates are such that real creation of wealth, real opportunity for prosperity is diminishing left and right.  
They’ve got to come up with money.  And they know this:  If you use the popularly accepted figure of 1.3 million abortions a year, go back to Roe vs. Wade 1973, 52 million taxpayers haven’t been born, is the way Washington looks at it.  They don’t look at it morally. They don’t look at it in any kind of cultural way or any kind of cultural impact. They just say we’re 52 million people short.  We have 52 million fewer people paying taxes.  We gotta replace ’em.  Hello amnesty.  The Democrat Party needs a permanent underclass in order to keep themselves alive as Santa Claus, to keep winning elections and stay in power. 

“I think that the number of abortions themselves…culturally, in terms of the sanctity of life, how that’s crumbled, I think it’s almost at the root of everything,” Limbaugh went on to say. “And if it’s not at the root of everything, it’s clearly had a profound impact on our culture, our society, and our politics, I think in ways that people don’t even stop to consider.” 
Limbaugh discussed the fact that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi refused to answer the Weekly Standard‘s question on Thursday about the morality of late-term abortion. 
“And, by the way, that’s it, she wasn’t gonna talk any more about it because she is a devout Catholic,” Limbaugh said. “She has six kids, and it isn’t about politics, and she’s not gonna discuss it anymore, she said, because the interviewer was taking it in the direction of politics, and abortion isn’t politics. Abortion is sacred ground, she said. It is the sacrament of liberalism, is what it is.”

If you’re an illegal immigrant worried about being caught, help is only a mouse click away. An article from the radical website DreamActivist.org will give you a quick lesson on how to lie about your status. It’s all part of the aggressive pro-illegal immigration ‘Dreamer movement’ that is leading the fight for “comprehensive” immigration reform, with a boost from President Barack Obama and many in Congress.
The “Dreamers” are illegal immigrants who were brought into the country by their parents. They’ve become the darlings of the media, garnering both positive press and an executive order by President Obama in 2012, offering them legal status if they met certain requirements and paid a $465 fee. Even that controversial end-run around Congress, however, wasn’t enough for the Dream activists as they pursued an agenda that rejects the idea of borders and deportation entirely.

The theatrical direct-actions of the Dreamers have intensified in recent months, including the ‘Dream 9’ activists who went to Mexico and then came back into the United States using an asylum claim. The avowed and proud illegal immigrants have used in-your-face social justice tactics for years, however, showing a dedication and a long-term view that opponents of amnesty would do well to note.


The Dreamer movement has been pushing the edge of the envelope in both their goals and tactics. They are gaining ground. The ACLU recently called Dreamers ‘the face of immigration reform movement’ and wrote:

But as important as their stories have been to the immigration reform movement, we can’t lose sight of the critical organizing DREAMers have been engaged in for years, pushing not only for the DREAM Act, but also for creating an environment where voices as disparate as Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) can vote “Yes” to move sweeping immigration reform legislation out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.


So, what sort of enviroment have they created? An example of the Dreamers long-term animosity towards any enforcement of immigration laws is a 2009 article on the DreamActivist.org site entitled Particulars and Universals #3: Tips on How to Lie Successfully. 
The anonymous author of the article doesn’t see a problem with the fact that illegal immigrants are violating the law. The problem is they aren’t good at lying.


…many undocumented youths conceal their immigration status when faced with potentially awkward questions, but the problem is that they absolutely suck at it. When faced with an instance in which they have to lie, they come up with a myriad of half-hearted excuses that they think up on the spot. 



In order to help solve the “problem” of bad lying, the Dream Activist site gives a few tips on lying more effectively. Tip #1 is ‘Think up a lie beforehand’, while Tip #3 is ‘Be consistent.’

 Create lies that are close to the truth and easy to keep track of. Think up lies that you know you can be absolutely consistent about. Write them down in a notepad if you must.


The article also suggests that illegal immigrants can ‘pretend that you’re an international student who has been taking public education in the U.S. since elementary school.’ 

The article stresses ‘this post is for tips on how to lie only to your friends and acquaintances’ and suggests never lying to officials ‘in writing’ but also says:

I’d like to take a moment here and stress that not lying does not mean having to reveal the truth. You have the right to remain silent. In fact, do not confess that you’re undocumented if you’re approached by immigration officials; know your rights.


The author also says “I know that it’s a bit corruptive to give young people tips on how to lie well” but they justify it immediately by saying that illegal immigrants understandably want to lie so they don’t ‘feel very dispirited.’ 
The Dream Activist site was co-founded by Peruvian Maria Marroquin, self-indentifed Fijian law school graduate Prerna Lal, and Iranian gay activist Mohammad Abdollahi. The site says it ‘would not be possible’ without the help of people like Lizbeth Mateo, one of the ‘Dream 9’ Activists previously profiled by Breitbart News  for her claim to have been employed by a Washignton D.C. based community organizing group.

A hot microphone caught Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) coordinating which way members of the “Gang of Eight” who serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee would vote on immigration bill amendments, Breitbart News has learned.
“Do our Republicans have a pass on this one if they want?” the microphone caught Schumer saying.
The hot mic remarks came during the Judiciary Committee markup on Monday, when Schumer was talking to his staff while senators were voting on an amendment that would prevent illegal immigrants from gaining access to public benefits, specifically the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).  


The amendment, offered by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), would have barred illegal immigrants from accessing tax credits like the EITC under the bill until they received green cards or citizenship years from now.

The amendment failed along party lines. For one of the first times ever, though, Gang of Eight members Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) joined their Republican colleagues in voting for the amendment. All the Democrats voted against it.
The National Journal recently reported that the Gang of Eight members have coordinated in secret to keep amendments that would strengthen the bill from passing. Sessions expressed outrage at that report, saying that “[o]ne of the things that most upsets the American people about Washington is drafting a bill with special interests in secret and jamming it across the finish line in a way that minimizes public involvement and input. Despite touting their legislation as ‘the toughest border enforcement in history,’ the Gang of Eight bill failed to live up to every major promise of its sponsors–including the promise of enforcement first–resulting in a bill that is even weaker than the rejected 2007 plan. This legislation needs improvement and openness.”

In a lecture to conservatives at the Las Vegas Country Club, Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, admitted that the selection of CNN’s Candy Crowley to moderate the second presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney in October 2012 had been a “mistake.”
Crowley stirred controversy by intervening in the town hall-style debate to support Obama’s contention that he had referred to the Sep. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi as a terrorist attack the day after it had occurred. In fact, as Crowley herself later admitted, Obama had not done so, referring only to “acts of terror” in general. In a CBS interview taped the same day, Obama declined to refer to the attack as a terrorist act, and subsequently supported a false story about a protest over an anti-Islamic video that never took place.


After Crowley backed up the president, some members of the audience burst into applause, in violation of the rules. The effect was not lost on the audience, which scored the debate as an Obama win–nor was it lost on Romney, who was sufficiently chastened that he refused to bring up the Benghazi issue again in the third presidential debate, even though that debate was specifically focused on foreign policy and national security.

Though it was likely not the only factor, or even the major factor, in Romney’s defeat, Crowley’s error slowed the new momentum that Romney had enjoyed since defeating Obama soundly in the first presidential debate. Her intervention also reinforced the media lack of interest in pursuing the Benghazi issue with the president.
Fahrenkopf, a stalwart Republican, co-chairs the Commission on Presidential Debates with Mike McCurry, who served as press secretary in the White House under President Bill Clinton. Politico’s Dylan Byers reports that the executive director of the Commission, Janet Brown, has refused to comment on Fahrenkopf’s remarks.

20221	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/03/Obama-Loses-Two-HHS-Mandate-Cases-in-One-Week	News	0	None	None	Neutral	Neutral	breitbart.com	"

Obamacare’s HHS Mandate lost yet again in a federal appeals court last Thursday, and then lost in a second case on Friday. These cases continue on the long road to the Supreme Court, and President Obama’s new “accommodation” of religious employers will do nothing to stop them. 
There are now at least 12 HHS Mandate cases in the federal courts of appeals, all challenging Kathleen Sebelius’ deeply-unpopular Obamacare regulation that all employers with 50 or more employees must offer healthcare plans that cover birth control, sterilization, and abortion-related services. 
Grote Industries is an Indiana-based company that makes lighting systems for cars. It’s owned and managed by a family of Roman Catholics who object to birth control. On Jan. 31, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an injunction pending appeal in Grote Industries v. Sebelius by a 2-1 vote, holding among other things that there is enough of a chance that the HHS Mandate violates federal religious liberty protections that the Chicago-based appeals court is ordering that this company does not need to comply with the regulation. 


The lead lawyer on the case, Matt Bowman from the Alliance Defending Freedom, said: 


Americans have the God-given freedom to live and do business according to their faith. Forcing employers to surrender their faith in order to earn a living is unprecedented, unnecessary, and unconstitutional. Honoring God is important every day, in all areas of life, including in our work. Freedom is not the government’s to give and take away when it pleases.

Then on Feb. 1, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit also issued an injunction pending appeal in Annex Medical, Inc. v. Sebelius. Annex Medical has less than 50 employees, so it’s not required by the Obamacare law to provide healthcare. Nonetheless, the owner offers healthcare to all his employees. 
But the owner of this Minnesota-based company, Stuart Lind, is again a deeply-religious man who objects to the HHS Mandate. So the federal appeals court in St. Louis likewise held that it’s likely the HHS Mandate violates his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (and possibly the Constitution as well). 
So a dozen such cases are now before different appellate courts, in different stages of appeal. (This doesn’t count dozens more cases that are before the trial-level federal district courts.) Decisions on whether to issue what are called preliminary injunctions in these cases–which will be the next step in the legal process–are likely to start coming down in late spring, meaning that sometime this fall the Supreme Court could vote to take one or more of these cases, and decide the legality of Sebelius’ abortion-related mandate in 2014 once and for all. 
The Obama administration new supposed accommodation for religious employers doesn’t change this equation. Legal experts are still trying to determine if it isn’t just a series of accounting gimmicks. But even if it allowed religious employers to completely opt out of the HHS Mandate, it nonetheless only applies to nonprofit employers. The companies that secured early wins in their cases last week are for-profit, secular businesses. So their cases will continue, and within a year one of the many cases currently on appeal should be before our nation’s highest court.

According to Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), the so-called Gang of Eight’s immigration reform bill does not have enough votes at this point to pass the Senate. 
Even though the bill has exited the Senate Judiciary Committee with a 13-5 vote, Menendez says that it will not receive 60 votes thanks to Republican opposition. “We don’t currently have 60 votes identified in the Senate,” Menendez told Univision. “We need to add more votes on the floor. That means that the community in your state, in every state, should be contacting your state’s two US Senators saying that they want comprehensive immigration reform, that they are going to judge their political future based on this vote.”


Several Republican senators have expressed support for debating the bill, but do not support the bill itself yet, including Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Menendez does believe that by the time of the Senate vote, which he said will take place just after July 4, the votes will be there. “I believe that in those three weeks we can get the necessary votes and we will have the community. We are expecting that and working for that.”

The goal, said Menendez, would be to pressure the House of Representatives to pass a version of the bill by creating widespread Senate support. “We want to push this bill forward with the most positive votes we can find, more than sixty, the sixty we need to be able to pass it here in the Senate, so we can put pressure on the House,” he explained. “Speaker Boehner, will have to decide how he will proceed.”
Menendez’s statements on Univision are no coincidence – the Democrats’ plan for 2014 is largely built on the notion that by creating bipartisan support for immigration reform in the Senate, then forcing the House to stop a soft-on-border-security bill, they will be able to generate public support for taking the House back for President Obama.

First Lady Michelle Obama has raised eyebrows by likening life in the White House to life in a “really nice prison.” Ms. Obama was speaking at the African First Ladies Summit in Tanzania, where she is traveling with President Barack Obama and their daughters. Former First Lady Laura Bush was also in attendance.
It was not the first time that Ms. Obama has complained about life in the White House–which has afforded her the opportunity to travel with her husband on a $60-$100 million trip to Africa, as well as to vacation in Spain and other exotic locales with a large entourage, all the while enjoying Secret Service protection.


President Obama himself has expressed similar sentiments. A mere two weeks after taking office in 2009, he and Ms. Obama escaped to a school in Washington, D.C., explaining: “We were just tired of being in the White House.” The president also plays golf with great frequency, and takes many vacations–alone and with family.

Ms. Obama’s remarks were particularly striking, coming just days after she and her children joined President Obama on a tour of the Robben Island prison facility where Nelson Mandela had been held for two decades. Following the visit, President Obama said that he and his family were “deeply humbled” by their experience.
In his 2012 book The Amateur: Barack Obama in the White House, author Ed Klein said of Obama: “”We come to know a strange kind of politician, one who derives no joy from the cut and thrust of politics, but who clings to the narcissistic life of the presidency.” 
It is responsibility, not just politics, that Obama avoids.
Obama’s Africa tour sums up his absentee presidency perfectly. He tries to emulate world figures like Nelson Mandela; he is driven in a motorcade down Barack Obama Drive in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; he gives speeches declaring that he will not meddle in African affairs, as if Libya–and the past four years–never happened.
And yet, even as he takes his family on tours of historic sites and extols the virtues of the African Union, a member of that Union–Egypt–is being rocked by the largest political demonstrations in the history of the world, Obama has had little to say. 
The Obamas certainly love the perks of the presidency. But they hate the office.

After promising she would attend the “Million Vet March,” former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin went to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. on Sunday–along with Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX)–to support thousands of veterans demanding that President Barack Obama re-open the memorials that have been barricaded due to the government shutdown.
At the World War II Memorial, Palin said that Obama is showing a “shameful lack of respect” and a “lack of valor” by barricading the memorials to veterans from across the country that marched in Washington to demand that Congress pass a law making it illegal for the federal government to close the memorials in future government shutdowns. They reportedly chanted, “tear down these walls.”
“We were proud to stand with thousands of America’s vets and other patriotic Americans today in Washington, D.C. This morning, Todd and I met with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, and they joined us and other Americans at the World War II Memorial and then at the Lincoln Memorial, where we were met by a SWAT team in full riot gear!” Palin wrote in a Facebook post. “Watching those who have fought to protect freedom prevented by barricades from visiting these memorials to freedom was truly heart wrenching.”


Palin has said Messrs. Lee and Cruz are leading a party of “good guys” in the Senate against both party establishments that make up Washington’s permanent political class. After the Republican establishment attacked Lee and Cruz during the defunding Obamacare fight, Palin fiercely defended them for representing everyday Americans. Palin has also called for Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience regarding the “Barrycades” at the memorials. At the march, veterans removed barricades from the memorial and took them to the White House.
Though the Obama administration officials put up barricades at the open-air memorials, they allowed thousands of amnesty supporters to rally on the National Mall, which was also supposed to be closed due to the government shutdown, last week in support of comprehensive immigration reform. On Saturday, Palin called out the Obama administration for revealing what their true priorities are during what she called a government “slim-down.”


Lee urged the crowd to “stand strong for liberty” and emphasized the memorial “belongs to the people.”
Cruz echoed Lee’s remarks. 
After emphasizing that “our veterans should be above politics,” Cruz said he met with World War II veterans on “Honor Flights” last week and said they told him, “We stormed the beaches of Normandy, do they really think these little barricades [will keep us from seeing the World War II memorial]?”
Palin emphasized that Americans will now “take up the fight for freedom” and “won’t let you down”: 

We’re here to show that the size of America’s heart for our veterans is immeasurable! But look around – barricades to shut down our memorials? Is this how a Commander in Chief expresses his gratitude? This “shutdown” priority proves a shameful lack of respect. It reflects a person’s lack of valor.
But, Vets, We the People have learned from you! We know America will only remain the “Home of the Free” so long as we are the “Home of the Brave!”
So, as we honor you, U.S. Military, know that our gratitude will not sleep! We will be brave! You were not timid, so we shall not be timid in calling out ANY who heart-wrenchingly would use you as pawns in a political game.
America’s finest paid the price for our freedom today. Vets, you protected us from tyranny then. Rest now, it is OUR turn to protect against tyranny again.
Ronald Reagan said, “Some people live an entire lifetime wondering if they ever made a difference in the world.” YOU, vets, need never ask that of yourselves. You made ALL the difference!
Our war memorials remind us of the cost to keep us free. YOU paid the price! Rest now! We will pick up the mantle. We won’t let you down. We now take up the fight for freedom!

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin announced that she will travel to Washington, D.C. on Sunday to support and honor the veterans who will be arriving for the “Million Vet March” on the memorials.
Speaking at a rally for New Jersey Republican Senate candidate Steve Lonegan along with Mark Levin on Saturday, Palin denounced the Obama administration for dishonoring veterans by barricading the World War II Memorial during the federal government shutdown. She said it was “heart-wrenching,” “atrocious,” and “not right.”  


“We’re going to zip on in to D.C.,” Palin said of herself and her husband Todd. “We’re going to shake hands with those vets who are being dishonored.”

Palin then accused the Obama administration of “using our military as pawns” during the government shutdown with such actions. 
She also mentioned that the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), whose seat Lonegan and Democrat Cory Booker are running for, was the last World War II veteran to serve in Congress and noted that his memory was also being dishonored by the Obama administration’s actions. 
Palin said the memorials serve to remind Americans of “the cost to provide for this exceptional nation” and the price Americans have had to pay to fight “against tyranny” and “for liberty.” 
Palin noted that the memorials, though they received some federal assistance, were also built with private donations. 
“And our government thinks they can shut down our memorials that honor our vets?” Palin said. “For shame.”
Palin has previously urged Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience at the “Barrycades.” At the “Million Vet March”, veterans will demand that the Obama administration re-open the memorials and urge Congress to pass legislation to forbid the memorials from being closed in future government shutdowns.

On Friday night Corey Stewart, one of seven candidates seeking the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor in Virginia, admitted to a crowd of 50 Tea Party activists that he was not only “connected to” the mysterious Virginians for Limited Government (VLG) group that has paid for attack mailers on five of his opponents; he’s also provided funding for the group.
Larry Nordvig, the Executive Director of the Richmond Virginia Tea Party who attended the Friday meeting, told Breitbart News on Monday that Stewart admitted his connection to VLG during a public question and answer period. Holding two of the VLG funded attack mailers in his hand, Nordvig described this back and forth he had with Stewart:


Nordvig Question: “Do you agree with these ads and did you have any connection to them whatsoever for the record?”
Corey Stewart Answer: “Am I connected? Yes. I have donated money to that organization.”
Nordvig Question. “At least a couple of these candidates fought against these budget increases, specifically Steve Martin…The information on the flyer is not correct so this information is misleading. Will you do the right thing and publicly condemn these ads as false?”
Corey Stewart Answer: “No, I’m not going to do it. I play hardball. This is politics.”
Sue Sadler, who is with a concerned citizens group in James City County and was present at Friday’s event, told Breitbart News on Monday that “Nordvig’s account is absolutely correct.”
Carolyn Worssam, a member of the Richmond Tea Party, told Breitbart News on Monday “that sure is an accurate description of the conversation between Larry and Corey Stewart.”
A third source, who is one of the 13,000 delegates to the convention that will select the Republican Party’s nominee for Lieutenant Governor in Richmond on Saturday and was present at the Friday event, told Breitbart News on Monday “that’s an accurate and balanced description” of the exchange between Nordvig and Stewart.

A fourth source, who was also at the meeting on Friday, told Breitbart News on Monday “that’s completely accurate.”
The meeting was held at Mimi’s Cafe in Henrico, Virginia, near Richmond, and was moderated by Carol Stopps, a supporter of Mr. Stewart. Ms. Stopps told Breitbart News on Tuesday: “That was an accurate description of the conversation between Larry and Corey. Corey did not deny he knows the organization and contributed to the organization. In my opinion this is typical campaign material and there were no misstatements in the mailers.”
Stewart’s admission could be a violation of Virginia election law, which requires that independent expenditure political action committees not coordinate their activities with the campaigns of any candidates. It is unclear how much Stewart has contributed to VLG, since it has failed to file its Statement of Organization with the Virginia State Board of Elections.
The exact organizational structure of VLG remains unclear. On Monday the group changed its “about us” description on its website to say that it is a 501(c)4 tax exempt non profit corporation.
A search of Guidestar, the online source that provides information about non profit corporations that have received 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 tax-exempt status from the IRS shows no entry for “Virginians for Limited Government.” By law, 501(c)4 organizations are prohibited from “primarily” engaging in political communications.
On Tuesday, Corey Stewart emailed this statement to Breitbart News: “Over the course of my life, I have supported and recommended several conservative organizations including the Family Foundation, Gun Owners of America, National Right to Work, Campaign for Liberty and Virginians for Limited Government to various people.”
Stewart emphasized that neither he nor his campaign “had any coordination” with Virginians for Limited Government. “I am proud to support these like-minded organizations over the course of my political career,” his email statement continued. “What these groups do, I have no control over.  Neither myself or my campaign have had any coordination with this group.”

On Sunday, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin called on Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace to release the names of the “top Republicans” that sent him opposition research on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to “hammer” Cruz before his appearance on the program to discuss defunding Obamacare. 
“Keep it TRULY fair & balanced,” Palin tweeted. “Release the GOP names encouraging you to trash @SenTedCruz. No more anonymous sources.”

@FoxNewsSunday Keep it TRULY fair & balanced. Release the GOP names encouraging you to trash @SenTedCruz. No more anonymous sources.
— Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) September 22, 2013


On Sunday, Wallace said that establishment Republicans are so worked up that Cruz is leading the defund Obamacare fight that he immediately got unsolicited questions and research on Cruz from “top Republicans” before Cruz’s appearance.

In an appearance on Washington D.C.’s Fox 5 to preview his Sunday show, Wallace said, “I will tell you I have never in my time in Washington seen a party so upset with one of its own members.”
In an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News on Saturday, Palin urged Cruz to stay strong in the face of the inevitable backlash from fellow Republicans and suggested they compare “shiv marks” the next time they meet:

Welcome to our world, Ted. The same people have been denouncing conservatives like me for years (right after they ask for help fundraising for themselves or endorsing the latest candidate they’ve suckered into paying their exorbitant consulting fees). We can compare shiv marks next time we meet, my friend.”

She also wrote about the “gutless” and “rudderless” permanent political class:

Those of us who hang in there supporting a major political party with our energy, time, and contributions would like to believe that that party would praise principled conservatives like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee for following through on campaign promises. We’d like to believe that the GOP establishment would applaud the way these bold leaders have rallied the grassroots to their cause. But, no, such praise would require a commensurate level of guts and leadership, and the permanent political class in D.C. is nothing if not gutless and rudderless.

20307	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/17/Second-Rubio-Staffer-Argued-American-Workers-Cant-Cut-It	News	1	Republican Scandals	None	Neutral	Negative	breitbart.com	"

A second staffer for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) disparaged American workers during an interview with Ryan Lizza, a partial transcript of the interview the New Yorker reporter released Monday afternoon shows. 
Originally, it appeared as though only one anonymous Rubio “aide” disparaged American workers and only did so in the context of speaking about low-skilled jobs in the U.S. However, the Lizza interview transcript shows two aides referenced low-skilled and high-skilled American workers.
Lizza asked the two staffers to respond to this statement: “Well their argument is, what, that they have American workers for these jobs, they don’t need this program.”


The thus-far unidentified “Rubio Aide 1” said that some workers either can’t or won’t make it in the work force anyway: 

Yeah. I mean one of the problems you have with this, “Oh, there’s American workers who are unemployed.” There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it. There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you obviously can’t discuss that publicly because–

At that point, “Rubio Aide 2” interjected, “But the same is true for high-skilled workers.”
“Aide 1” then said, “Yes, and the same is true across every sector, in government, in everything.”

Lizza’s story had originally not specified that two Rubio aides made the argument, leaving a little room for Rubio’s staff to try to discredit the reporting.
As excerpted by Politico’s Mike Allen Sunday morning, Lizza’s story reported the exchange as follows: 

Rubio sided with the Chamber against the construction workers. “There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it,” a Rubio aide told me. “There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you can’t obviously discuss that publicly.” In the end, the wage issue was settled to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s satisfaction, and the Building and Construction Trades union won a cap on the number of visas for foreign construction workers.

After National Review editor Rich Lowry picked up on how Rubio’s anonymous “aide” disparaged American workers, and published a piece on it, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant tried to argue Lizza’s reporting was inaccurate. 
“We strongly objected to the magazine including that background quote in the piece because it’s not what Sen. Rubio believes or has ever argued,” Conant told Lowry. “In truth, Sen. Rubio has always said the reason we need a robust temporary worker program is to create legal avenues for US businesses to meet labor needs when not enough Americans apply for jobs… Sen. Rubio believes that American workers can compete against anyone in the world.”
Sen. Rubio himself gave a quote to The Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis publicly rejecting the comments. “The quote attributed to a member of my staff was a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program,” Rubio told Lewis. “It is not my view in any way. I could not disagree with it more.”
The transcript Lizza released casts doubt on whether the quote was simply “a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program.” Rather, it indicates the quotes were two Rubio staffers making the argument on their own, not in an abstract context. The transcript also shows that the two Rubio aides were talking about high-skilled and low-skilled American workers, not just those who would be part of a guest worker program.
After Lewis’s piece was published, Breitbart News reported that several immigration organization leaders and hill staffers have called on Sen. Rubio to publicly identify the aide who made those comments. NumbersUSA director of government relations Rosemary Jenks and Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian, as well as various hill staffers, called on Rubio to publicly identify the aide and terminate him or her.
On Twitter, National Review‘s Lowry asked Lizza, “i have no reason to doubt you but can you share any more of the context of that quote? rubio staff pushing bk hard.” He added that Rubio’s office’s pushback included Conant saying “the aide was describing some industries’ response to unions’ opposition to temp workers.”
When Lizza sent out the partial transcript of the interview, Lowry responded, “great, thank you. looks like you were exactly right unless im missing something.”

Look at this madness: article after article after article hitting Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes for agreeing with President Obama on the issue of his work ethic, or lack thereof. Last night, though, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer took the attacks a step further by taking Ailes completely out of context. This allowed 9/11 Truther and cop killer-defender Van Jones to claim Ailes had made a “racial charge” against Obama:
—



 
—
Van Jones being Van Jones is not news. 

But for Wolf Blitzer to take Ailes completely out of context and stand idly by as Jones dishonestly smears Ailes for making a “racial charge” only serves to further explain why this network is swirling the drain. In the age of the Internet, the media can no longer get away with this kind of stuff. Once the truth gets out, the damage to your brand’s credibility is forever. 
The background and the truth: 
Yesterday, Vanity Fair published an exclusive excerpt from an upcoming Ailes biography. Here’s the full context of the quote Blitzer wasn’t interested in sharing with his audience. I’ve bolded the portion not shared with CNN viewers:
‘Obama’s the one who never worked a day in his life. He never earned a penny that wasn’t public money. How many fund-raisers does he attend every week? How often does he play basketball and golf? I wish I had that kind of time. He’s lazy, but the media won’t report that.’ He noticed my arched eyebrows and added, ‘I didn’t come up with that. Obama said that, to Barbara Walters.’
Here’s what Obama told Barbara Walters in December of 2011:

BARBARA WALTERS: Okay. What’s the trait you most deplore in yourself and the trait you most deplore in others?
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Laziness.

WALTERS: You’re lazy?
OBAMA: You know, it’s interesting. There is a deep down, underneath all the work I do, I think there’s a laziness in me. I mean, it’s, it’s probably from, you know, growing up in Hawaii, and it’s sunny outside and sitting on the beach.
This morning, CNN’s Soledad O’Brien got caught on-the-air by her own panel doing the same thing.

Anyone sensing a pattern here? Horrible journalism? Agenda? My vote goes to “both.” 
It’s also worth mentioning that those who hear the word “lazy” and immediately think of black people are the ones who might want to do some soul-searching. 
ADDED: CNN Chief, Jeff Zucker (pictured), needs to have a sitdown with Blitzer to ensure the record is corrected on-the-air today. He might also want to throw in an apology

Nancy Mace, a conservative primary challenger to incumbent South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, retweeted an insult to her Twitter followers Tuesday which called her opponent a “Nancy boy.” 
She has since deleted the tweet, but the Sunlight Foundation’s “Politwoops,” which preserves tweets politicians have deleted, has the retweet on its website: 

“RT @PaulSteel4: @nancymace we support you here in Florida. Nancy Mace vs Nancy boy graham.”

“Nancy boy” is a derogatory term used to describe “an effeminate or homosexual man.”


Mace is the first female graduate of The Citadel, where her father, Ret. Brigadier General J. Emory Mace, also attended. Mace’s father is the most decorated living graduate of The Citadel.
Graham, a member of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” that wrote the controversial immigration reform bill passed in late June, has long faced criticism for being less ideologically pure than his conservative constituents desire. 
Carolina Conservatives United (CCU), a political group created by former GOProud co-founder and conservative activist Bruce Carroll, launched the website defeatlindseygraham.org shortly before Mace announced her candidacy. CCU’s site attacks Graham for what it deems are his “Beltway Republican” values.

“The truth is Lindsey Graham only panders with conservative language once every six years,” CCU states. “But every day he shows his true stripes by bashing small government conservative activists and ‘voting wrong’ on many of the most important issues before us.”
Former South Carolina Senator and President of the Heritage Foundation Jim DeMint was asked on Tuesday’s “Daily Rundown” on MSNBC, “Do you think Lindsey Graham is a Jim DeMint conservative?”
DeMint simply answered, “I don’t think he would want to be called a Jim DeMint conservative. We’re all different. People will have to decide that for themselves.”
Host Chuck Todd then asked, “Is it fair to call him a conservative?”
DeMint replied: “Lindsey can tell you what he is himself. I’m not speaking for him.”

This week’s new episode of the HBO series The Newsroom apparently took some factual liberties from its “ripped from yesterday’s headlines” format.
The July 28 episode featured several reporters, including the show’s senior producer Jim Harper (played by John Gallagher Jr.), getting thrown off the Romney presidential campaign bus for asking tough questions.


Did something like that actually happen?
Patrick Hynes, an adviser to Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign who worked with online media for the communications department, answered some questions from Breitbart News about the show via email.
Big Hollywood: What was your reaction to The Newsroom scene description about reporters getting booted off the Romney campaign?

Patrick Hynes: My initial reaction was that once again the Hollywood left is out to depict Republicans as unreasonable, authoritarian, stupid, hostile and mean spirited because in the absence of such a stereotype, Republicans might actually win some elections, and well, we can’t have that, can we? BH: To your knowledge, did any such event ever take place during the campaign?
PH: No, nothing like that ever took place, as far as I know. Don’t get me wrong, relations between the campaign and the press were not good and there were frequent moments of hostility every day. But I don’t recall ever hearing of reporters getting thrown off the bus.
BH: If such an event occurred, would you have heard about it? Would Gov. Romney have heard about it?
PH: I would have heard about it. We would almost certainly have been in rapid response mode if something like this had happened.  In fact, it would have been impossible for anyone not to hear about it, as anything like this fictional account would have consumed a day’s worth of campaign coverage. There is nothing the press likes to cover more than itself.
BH: Why do you think a show would manufacture such an event?
PH: To make a boring and insufferable program slightly more interesting and to make Republicans look stupid.

After serving eleven terms in Congress, Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) announced on Monday he will not seek reelection. “It is time for someone else,” said Bachus.
After chairing the powerful House Financial Services Committee for six years, Bachus gave up his chairmanship in 2012 following a Office of Congressional Ethics investigation. In my book, Throw Them All Out, I, along with subsequent reporting by Breitbart News, uncovered evidence of insider trading. 60 Minutes and I partnered together on an investigation that uncovered insider trading by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Bachus. Congress then passed the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act to ban members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.


Not surprisingly, Bachus’s friends on the committee cleared him of the charges, but not before he was forced to spend $422,000 in legal fees funded by his campaign account and another $209,000 from his legal expense trust. In true crony fashion, as Politico reported, “the bulk of Bachus’s legal defense fund take came from croporations and PACs with ties to Alabama, including Mortgage American, Inc., Bryant Bank, and Citizens Bancorp of Winfield, Inc.”
This brand of cynical, crony capitalist behavior led the late Andrew Breitbart to be the first to call for Bachus’s resignation.
“What Congressman Spencer Bachus did was wrong, vile, and an affront to the decency of the American people and the principles of honesty and fairness upon which our system rests,” wrote Breitbart. “Our Founding Fathers believed political leadership was a call to stewardship, not self-enrichment….Spencer Bachus: it’s time for you to go.”

During the summer and fall of 2008 leading up to the financial meltdown, Bachus used his post as the ranking Republican on the House Financial Service Committee to gain access to high-level meetings with then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other top senior officials. The meetings were so secretive that all those attending were required to leave their cell phones outside the room so that no information would leak or be misused. Bachus then executed a series of expertly-timed stock trades that resulted in as much as $50,000 (politicians report in ranges, not specific amounts) in capital gains from July to November 2008. Put simply, even as everyday Americans’ personal portfolios were going up in smoke, Bachus used material, non-public information to protect and profit his own portfolio.
“Spencer Bachus did something I believe is unforgivable–he sold out his country by shorting stocks during the worse days of the financial collapse,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News. “Spencer Bachus will always be an emblem of everything wrong with the ‘District of Corruption.’ Good riddance.”
Free markets flourish only when those who claim to champion them abide by the rule of law. Ironically, Bachus’s actions helped mobilize and reinvigorate the foot soldiers in the economic freedom movement; on November 17, 2011, Tea Party members assembled outside Bachus’s Alabama offices in protest. Their efforts sent a strong signal that true capitalists believe in competition and fairness–not insider access to top secret government information that can be used to subvert markets and poach profits. 
“Spencer Bachus holds the unfortunate distinction of being the only member of Congress that Andrew Breitbart called on to resign, and that includes Anthony Weiner,” said Larry Solov, CEO and President of Breitbart News.
Spencer Bachus will soon be gone, yet the fight against the cronyism continues. Here’s hoping it won’t take another Spencer Bachus to keep the free market torch alight.

Several House members are backing up Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his leadership role in the effort to defund Obamacare in the wake of attacks from the mainstream media and anonymous statements from establishment Republicans and their staffers.
“I do feel obligated to speak because Senator Cruz is my senator and I endorsed him last year in his election against Lt. Gov. [David] Dewhurst,” Rep. Michael Burgess (R-TX) said in response to a question from Breitbart News at Thursday’s Conversations with Conservatives press event on Capitol Hill. “We wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for his vision and his leadership,” he explained. “We are grateful for the fact that we are here today with this opportunity to deliver for the American people. We hope that the American people will help the Senate understand the enormous task that is in front of us.”  
Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) added that Republicans are united in their push to defund Obamacare in the Continuing Resolution (CR). Labrado said he believes it is a “mistake” for some anonymous Republicans to suggest Cruz is somehow splitting the Party.


“Anonymous members and anonymous aides accusing other people of dividing the Republican Party?” Labrador said in response to Breitbart News’ question. “I think that’s a mistake. I think we’re behind this move.” 
“I think you’re going to see a huge number of members, in fact, I almost believe that it’s going to be unanimous with the Republican members in the House,” he ventured. “I don’t think we’ve ever been this unified.”
Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), along with House conservative leaders like Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Tom Graves (R-GA), deserve credit for helping unite the Republican Party around the effort to defund Obamacare. He said the American people also deserve credit for rising up and demanding their lawmakers fight for them. 

“I’ll just echo that the Senators are getting credit and Tom Graves and Jim Jordan and others for helping get us to this point,” Duncan said. “They all deserve credit. But I’ll tell you what: The involvement of the American people cannot be ignored in this. Their voices were heard.” 
“They made phone calls to our offices. They came to a rally here in Washington. They made personal contact during August at town halls,” he continued.” The American people got engaged and so I don’t want to discount them at all and I actually want to give them all the credit for getting us where we are today on this.”
Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) argued that the current debate is the result of the American people wanting leaders in Congress like Cruz to stand up and defund Obamacare.
“Republicans are always blamed for defunding Obamacare and this is like 30 or 40 times we’ve done that,” Yoho said. “We’re not doing it because we want to do it. It’s because the American people have spoken up and said we want this thing done and if you go back to 2009 when the infamous words were ‘we have to pass it to see what’s in it. We have to pass it to see how it’s going to work.'” 
“You’re seeing now what’s coming out and the American people don’t want it. American business said ‘no we don’t want it.’ The unions are saying ‘no we don’t want it.’ So I think the people have spoken loud and clear and I’m proud to be on this team in the 113th Congress where we’ve said we’re going to do this for the American people,” he stated. “This is what’s right for our country. This is what’s going to stimulate our economy by creating jobs and getting rid of this.”
Later on Thursday on a conference call with Cruz and conservative media, Reps. Matt Salmon (R-AZ) and Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) also signaled their thanks and support for Cruz. 
“It’s an honor to be on the phone with Sen. Cruz, and I think we have Jim Bridenstine on the call with us too, another great patriot,” Salmon said. “I just want to thank the leadership in the Senate of Sen. Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee.”  
“It’s been interesting to watch this debate develop,” Bridenstine added. “It started off when this debate first started and Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee have been doing the Lord’s work on this effort.”

Conservative columnist Ann Coulter entertained an audience of 400 at the University of Southern California on Sunday night at an event co-sponsored by the USC College Republicans and the Hancock Park Patriots, a local Tea Party group. 
Fears of large and violent protests failed to materialize, as five peaceful demonstrators were the only presence outside the Ronald Tudor Campus Center.


Coulter spoke at length about crime, and the New York of the 1980s–to which, she joked, New Yorkers were about to return with leftist Bill de Blasio as mayor. (She is re-reading Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities to prepare, she joked.) 
Though she has written about race and crime, she is an equal-opportunity critic–arguing, for instance, that accused murderer Amanda Knox was protected by the U.S. media because she is a “pretty white girl.”
There were plenty of macabre jokes to follow–including an extended riff on how several MSNBC hosts would each commit suicide (“Chris Matthews would bungle it…Al Sharpton would do it in such a way as to blame some poor white guy”). On a more serious note, she slammed MSNBC for attacking what they called “pro-rape Republicans” over the Jamie Lee Jones rape case, in which the victim’s claims were dismissed and she was ordered to pay the attorneys’ costs of her former employer, an American military contractor.

Likewise, she noted that MSNBC had pushed the false allegation that a U.S. Census Bureau worker had been a victim of a right-wing attack, when in fact he had committed suicide in apparent insurance fraud scheme.
In her remarks, conducted in an interview format, Coulter fielded questions about her new book, Never Trust a Liberal Over 3–Especially a Republican. She criticized New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for his support for immigration reform (“amnesty”) and for playing into sudden enthusiasm in the mainstream media for his political prospects. 
She also had a few choice words for those who she said were not true Tea Partiers–evidently including Liz Cheney in that category for challenging Republican Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming: “If only she’d moved to South Carolina to run against Lindsey Graham.” 
Coulter described the Senate Conservatives Fund as a “fake group”: “On their ‘About’ page, they won’t tell me who runs it–George Soros, George Soros, George Soros.” Her message was that Republicans had to unite to unseat Senate Democrats rather than following new, would-be leaders into internecine party strife.
“Look, unless they get a good candidate to run against Lindsey Graham, I don’t think they should primary him either, and he’s my favorite candidate to primary.” She criticized the nomination of Christine O’Donnell in 2010, saying that the Delaware seat in the U.S. Senate she contested was now lost to the GOP “forever.”

She joked that Republicans needed to do a better job of removing primary candidates who could not win a general election. “We need a Luca Brasi,” she said, referring to the assassin in The Godfather, offering herself as a volunteer.
In the question-and-answer session that followed, Coulter defended her support for the Iraq War–a “magnificent war,” she said, whose gains President Barack Obama had been “pissing away.” She noted that Iraq had been relatively stable during the Arab Spring, and that the case for war in 2003 remained strong, including suspected links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.
Asked about GOP strategy in 2014 and 2016, Coulter said: “Why do we keep using the same strategists? Because we don’t know their names.” She said that her book was the beginning of an effort to expose failed consultants who had misled candidates into believing they could win in places where they could not. “I think a lot of these Tea Party groups are George Soros fronts,” she warned. She lamented that Republicans had lost the Virginia gubernatorial race, saying that Ken Cuccinelli had suffered from a “fake libertarian” spoiler and was dragged down by “a black Christian minister [E.W. Jackson] who could not win a statewide election” because of his social views.
On a more encouraging note, she said that Democrats would struggle without Obama in the presidential race: “They have a suck-ass ‘B team.'”
At the close, a liberal student asked politely “what kind of world” Coulter was looking for, citing some of her more offensive Google quotes. 
“My ideal world is a world without liberals,” she said, to laughter and applause.

Conservative author and columnist Ann Coulter, a long and loyal supporter of New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie, told attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday that he was “off her list.” 
“Did you see his convention speech?” she asked the crowd. “It was really bad.  And I must say, though I loved Chris Christie, I’m now a single issue voter against amnesty, so Christie is off my list.”  She noted, however, that Senator Ted Cruz (R – TX) “is still on (her) list.” Coulter has hopes for Senator Marco Rubio (R – FL) but wondered, “Why on earth is Marco Rubio and these endless Republicans supporting [amnesty]?”
Governor Christie was not invited to the annual conference this year. The decision raised questions among conservatives again if Christie’s actions during the Romney-Ryan campaign, particularly towards the end damaged his credibility with the GOP’s conservative base. 


“This year, for better or for worse, we felt like he didn’t deserve to be on the all-star selection, and for decisions that he made,” CPAC Chairman Al Cardenas  told reporters. “And so hopefully next year he’s back on the right track and being a conservative.” Cardenas noted that Christie “is popular figure, but everyone needs to live by the parameters of the movement.”

Coulter said that she does not know who she is focused in on for 2016 but she described what kind of candidate should not be running. She previously supported former Republican Delaware Governor Pete du Pont, conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan, business mogul Steve Forbes, and former Congressman Duncan Hunter (R – CA). Coulter admitted she made mistakes with some of her past choices. 
“No, you can’t run a congressman. I have learned that. You cannot run a governor from a state that’s only as big as a congressional district. That’s the equivalent of running of congressman. We can’t run businessmen, pundits,” she said, adding, “People who have not run and won elections in at least a mid-size state. We’re looking at governors and senators. Once you throw in the governors and senators, let’s see how they debate, let’s see their positions then.”
Coulter was particularly critical of conservatives who put themselves before the movement. She pointed to the Senate races lost by Republicans in 2012. Coulter pointed to former Congressman Todd Akin’s unwillingness to drop out of the Senate race in Missouri and those who supported his decision. “Passion is great but in politics, scoring is all that counts,” she said.

“Karl Rove is bad news for the Republican Party.”  
With those words Donald Trump officially joined the ongoing battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party by aligning himself as a defender of the tea party and a merciless critic of Karl Rove and his new, controversial initiative known as the “Conservative Victory Project.”
Trump’s fiery appearance on The Mark Levin Show signaled an escalation in the very public argument that has played out over the past ten days between divergent factions of the GOP.  




Trump and Levin hit Rove where it really hurts.  First Trump criticized Rove’s effectiveness as a campaign strategist by slamming his SuperPAC, American Crossroads’ performance in the 2012 election: “Four hundred million dollars was wasted.  They do the worst ads I have ever seen, ever.”  
Levin followed up with what might be the most significant line of attack against Rove:  “I would say to the wealthy donors out there, ‘Why do you keep donating to him?’ why don’t you donate to all these groups who are actually grassroots, who are actually fighting and who are actually effective?”
The combination of the influential voice of Mark Levin challenging donors to shut-down the flow of cash to the Rove machine, coupled with Trump (one of those high-profile donors) repeating FIVE TIMES the fact that Rove spent “four hundred million dollars” with no results to show for it could have a brutally devastating effect on the former Bush strategist’s balance sheet.
Trump then positioned himself as the defender of the tea party movement:  “If the Republicans are going to win, they’re going to have to break away from the Karl Rove’s of the world and, frankly, get more about you know the tea party…  they are great Americans, they love this country, they work so hard, and they have been so mistreated by the liberal press, the liberal media. They have been just so mistreated and made to look so bad.” 
The continuing battle playing out on cable news, talk radio and on influential websites will surely continue now that Trump has entered the fray.  And with stalwart Republican names like Rove and Barbour on one side and Bozell and Schlafly (now joined by Levin and Trump) on the other, this could shape up to get even uglier as the battle wages on.

House Speaker John Boehner barely held onto his job atop Congress’ lower chamber on Thursday. Just how close a call Boehner had is now becoming clear.
Nine House conservatives voted for somebody other than Boehner, two abstained from voting and one voted “present.” That total of 12 Republicans who didn’t support Boehner was a stone’s throw from the required 17 to force a second ballot election – at which point several more Republican members were slated to back a competitor to Boehner’s, who would unite the party behind him or her.


Politico has reported the original list of members possibly considering defection from Boehner was longer and included Reps. Steve King of Iowa, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Scott Garrett of New Jersey and Steve Fincher and Scott DesJarlais, both of Tennessee.
Politico uncovered this list because Kansas Republican Rep. Tim Huelskamp “sat on the House floor during the speaker vote brandishing an iPad” with a message “displayed on the screen ticking off members of the House Republican Conference he hoped would oppose the sitting speaker.”
The title of the email message was reportedly: “You would be fired if this goes out.”

Breitbart News has confirmed that the following members were considering voting against Boehner retaining his speakership as well: Reps. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Sam Graves of Missouri, Steve Southerland of Florida, Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, David Schweikert of Arizona, Arkansas freshman Tom Cotton and Brett Guthrie of Kentucky.
Reps. Guthrie and Cotton denied to Breitbart News that they were on the list.
“Speaker Boehner was voted out of the Republican Conference unanimously and I never considered not voting for him on the House floor. I do not know where these lists originated and my proposed involvement is completely false,” Guthrie said.
Doug Coutts, Chief of Staff for Rep. Cotton, asserted, “Contrary to Breitbart’s reporting, Mr. Cotton did not consider voting for anyone other than Speaker Boehner, an intention he stated plainly the morning of the vote on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal. 
“Further, no one approached Mr. Cotton to ask his support for anyone other than Speaker Boehner, nor did Mr. Cotton engage such conversations.”

Breitbart News also learned that outgoing House GOP conference chairman Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling was considering opposing Boehner. Boehner recently named Hensarling to be the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee in the next Congress.
All in all, there were more than 20 House Republicans who were considering unseat Boehner. Many of these members bailed on the movement at the last minute on the House floor.
There did appear to be at one point a chance Boehner wouldn’t regain his position during the happenings on the House floor. The Clerk of the House had reached the end of her list of names to call when Boehner reached 216 votes – he needed 217 to win re-election. As the National Review’s Washington, D.C., editor Robert Costa noted on Twitter, there were 17 Republican members either not voting, voting present or voting for someone other than Boehner. “So: In short, we were over 17 for a minute, looking at 2nd ballot, when the conservatives come to floor, save Boehner from 2nd ballot,” Costa wrote.
Then, as Costa notes, Bachmann, Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn and New Jersey’s Scott Garrett came back to the floor – after ignoring their names being called the first time during the alphabetical roll call – and voted for Boehner. 
“Boehner is fine, people/ He will be reelected. Blackburn, Bachmann, and Garrett saved him,” Costa said of those conservatives saving Boehner. “What a story. What a story.”
This article has been updated to include responses from Rep. Guthrie and a representative of Rep. Cotton.

The Republican members of the bipartisan Senate “Gang of Eight” have passed the deadline for Senate Judiciary Committee ranking GOP member Sen. Chuck Grassley’s request for a briefing on their coming immigration reform bill.
Last week, Grassley (R-IA) and his conservative committee colleagues Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Mike Lee (R-UT) wrote to “Gang of Eight” senators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), John McCain (R-AZ), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), asking them to champion a transparent immigration reform process complete with thorough hearings examining each facet of any legislation those “Gang” Republicans and their Democratic counterparts develop. 
“Because the president has failed to lead on this matter, your group has secretly met for months and not consulted with members of this Committee about major changes to our nation’s immigration laws,” Grassley and his colleagues wrote. “The time for transparency has come. Given the Majority’s rushed timetable, we believe it is time for you to discuss the status of your negotiations, disclose what concessions have been made, and provide details to members of the Judiciary Committee as well as the entire Republican Caucus.”


In the letter that Grassley organized, he and his fellow Judiciary Committee conservatives asked for a briefing from the Gang GOP by the close of business on Monday April 8. “[W]e ask that your staff be made available to Republican Committee staff no later than the close of business on Monday, April 8,” Grassley and the Senate Judiciary conservatives wrote. “We also request that you personally discuss your group’s proposal with the entire caucus early next week so that all members can raise concerns and questions before the deal is finalized.”
Despite this request from Grassley and his colleagues, an aide for one of the offices who signed the letter confirmed for Breitbart News that the Gang of Eight Republicans ignored the deadline.
“The request for a staff briefing by today was declined,” the aide said.

Rubio had responded to Grassley’s and his colleagues’ original letter by saying he agreed with their concerns about process. In his response, Rubio did not mention Grassley’s request for a briefing of Senate Judiciary Committee GOP staff by the close of business on Monday.
“I believe strongly that all other 92 senators should be given ample time not just to review the legislation, but to offer ways to improve it,” Rubio said instead. “Earlier this week, I requested and received permission to brief the entire Republican conference during our policy lunch next week. I look forward to briefing you at that meeting. 
“In addition, I have asked my staff to brief the staff of every Republican member of your committee once the details of our starting point proposal are finalized. Rest assured I continue to welcome, value and encourage any input you may have. In the meantime, if you or your staff has any specific ideas on immigration reform, please contact us as soon as possible.”
Grassley is known for being a tough oversight official and led, with House oversight committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, the congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious that spanned most of last Congress and is ongoing. 
Spokespersons for each of the Gang of Eight Republican members either did not return Breitbart News’ request for comment on their bosses’ decision or would not comment on the record.

In the wake of last week’s much-discussed New York Times investigative report detailing cronyism and mismanagement inside the Clinton Foundation, former president Bill Clinton issued an open letter in an attempt to stem the public relations backlash. Clinton’s letter challenged a couple of the Times’ assertions that his nonprofit had run deficits.
Curiously, Clinton’s letter left unchallenged the Times’ more troubling reporting–based on over two dozen interviews with Clinton Foundation insiders–that the nonprofit is rife with cronyism and conflicts of interest that leverage access and power to benefit for-profit ventures like Teneo, a consultancy co-founded by Bill Clinton’s “surrogate son” and former Clinton Foundation aide Douglas Band. Teneo, whose earliest clients included the now-defunct MF Global headed up by Obama bundler Jon Corzine, has also hired Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin, wife of mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner.
That placed Media Matters in the awkward position of defending Hillary and Bill Clinton from the liberalNew York Times. Media Matters blogger Emily Arrowood filed a blog post chastising the New York Timesfor its “misleading Times story, which apparently failed to perform due diligence in reporting on the accounting requirements for foundations.”
Oddly, Arrowood went on to scold conservative media outlets for having the temerity to cite the New York Times reportage.
“Predictably, conservative media did not wait to learn these facts surrounding the Clinton Foundation, preferring to cite the initial Times story to decry imaginary scandals and lob both new and old attacks at Hillary Clinton,” wrote Arrowood. She blasted Fox News host Eric Bolling, The Blaze, The London Telegraph (sic), former New York Times Magazine editor-in-chief Ed Klein, and The Atlantic as being part of a “right-wing noise machine” that was “scrambling to find a new Hillary scandal.”
Like Bill Clinton’s letter, however, Arrowood’s blog post sidestepped the Times’ more serious charges of cronyism and conflicts of interest and ducked altogether the Breitbart News report last week featured on Drudge Report that chronicled additional Clinton Foundation conflicts of interest not included in theTimes’ original report. As Breitbart News reported, by 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised at least $46 million from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Brunei, Oman, and other foreign governments with whom Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would later negotiate. In her role as a New York Senator, Hillary Clinton also reportedly helped New York developer Robert Congel win millions of dollars in federal assistance after Congel donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
Then there is the case of Teneo. According to the Times, the Clintons, Band, Teneo, and the Foundation were entangled in a web of crony alliances and conflicts of interest:

Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country’s top hedge funds.
By 2011, the firm had added a third partner, Declan Kelly, a former State Department envoy for Mrs. Clinton. And Mr. Clinton had signed up as a paid adviser to the firm.
Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients. The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors, while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encouraged others to become new foundation donors. Its marketing materials highlighted Mr. Band’s relationship with Mr. Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative, where Mr. Band sat on the board of directors through 2011 and remains an adviser. Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.

The crony connections between Teneo, Douglas Band, and the Clintons had grown so alarming, reports theTimes, that Chelsea Clinton “became increasingly concerned with the negative impact Mr. Band’s outside business might have on her father’s work and that she cited concerns raised during the internal review about potential conflicts of interest involving Teneo.”
The Media Matters piece made no mention of Teneo, Douglas Band, Robert Congel, or Chelsea Clinton’s concerns over crony capitalist conflicts of interest.
Instead, following Bill Clinton’s lead, Media Matters dodged the New York Times‘ most serious revelations and quibbled over “context”–a risky tactic that may encourage the Times to dig deeper.
Indeed, just one day after Bill Clinton and Media Matters’s retort, liberal New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd followed up the Times’ Clinton Foundation cronyism report with this: “If Americans are worried about money in politics, there is no larger concern than the Clintons…Clintonworld is a galaxy where personal enrichment and political advancement blend seamlessly, and where a cast of jarringly familiar characters pad their pockets every which way to Sunday.”
Dowd added, “The most egregious nest of conflicts was a firm founded by Doug Band called Teneo, a scammy blend of corporate consulting, public relations and merchant banking. Band, a surrogate son to Bill, put Huma, a surrogate daughter to Hillary, on the payroll.  Even Big Daddy Bill was a paid adviser.”
No word yet from Media Matters on Maureen Dowd’s newly minted allegiance with the “right-wing noise machine.”

Former George W. Bush chief political strategist Matt Dowd continued to try to diminish Sarah Palin and conservatives by once again making false claims about the former Alaska governor.
On Sunday’s “ABC’s This Week,” Dowd assailed CPAC for, in his mind, lessening its credibility by inviting conservatives like Palin and not liberal Republicans favored by the northeastern elite like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. 
“CPAC, to me, has totally diminished its credibility as an organization,” Dowd said. “And you invite Sarah Palin, who wasn’t competent enough to keep a Fox News contract? But she’s invited to the CPAC meeting?”


Dowd falsely claimed that Palin was not competent enough to be on Fox, whereas Palin turned down Fox’s offer to renew her contract. His remark was not only a dig at Palin but also a shot at Fox, implying the news network that has dominated the cable news ratings employs people with subpar levels of intelligence who do not meet  the lofty standards of the Aspen Institute or Harvard’s Institute of Politics. His comments also imply that he feels the conservatives who came out in droves to elect Bush twice–which is the only reason he has his media perch and anyone has even heard of him–are dumb as well.
Other writers purporting to represent the right, like Jennifer Rubin, the Washington Post‘s token conservative, also have chimed in, writing any gathering that includes Palin while not inviting GOProud and Christie “isn’t worth attending.”
Conservative writer Jeffrey Lord assailed these elitist Republicans who feel entitled to make CPAC “a big tent” instead of the “conservative tent” that it is supposed to be.  

Since Bush left office, his top advisers have begun to show their true–and not-so-conservative–colors. Mark McKinnon, the scarf-wearing, No Labels-founding former Bush media maven, has actively courted the approval of the media elite and made himself a featured attraction at elitist seminars. Karl Rove has slammed conservative candidates and now has created as super PAC that will arm itself to wage war against Tea Party candidates in GOP primaries.
As BizPacReview notes, in 2010, Palin, in response to talk radio host Laura Ingraham’s claim that the Bush family was trying to “kneecap” a potential Palin presidential campaign, referred to the Bush family as “blue bloods” who make up the Republican establishment. 
As the publication notes, many pundits attribute the lack of enthusiasm on the right over Mitt Romney’s candidacy to Romney’s and the Republican establishment’s snub of Palin and the Tea Party that won the GOP its House majority in 2010. The Republican establishment advisers were fearful of what their mainstream media bettors would think of them if they embraced the vice presidential candidate who has galvanized the Tea Party and the conservative base more than any other figure on the right over the last four years. 
Having not learned their lesson, establishment Republicans, BizPacReview notes, “continue to attack Palin for no apparent reason.”
But there is a deeper reason why establishment Republicans disdain Palin the reformer. 
When Palin made her first appearance at CPAC last year, she blistered Washington’s crony capitalism and permanent political class, which Stephen K. Bannon and the non-partisan Government Accountability Institute’s Peter Schweizer would later document in “Boomtown.”
At CPAC 2012, journalists and observers noted that no speaker galvanized the conservative base–with conservative words and ideas–like Palin. 
And that is why establishment Republicans like Dowd, who helped enable D.C.’s “Boomtown,” would rather anoint moderates like Christie and Romney as leaders on the right instead of conservatives like Palin, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)–both of whom Palin endorsed in their respective primaries–who are unafraid to challenge Republicans as well as Democrats.

Attorney General Eric Holder may have violated federal law when he did not put his recusal from the secret Associated Press phone records seizure case in writing, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) suggested during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.
Holder said he was not involved in the secret collection of AP phone records because he had recused himself from the investigation which led to the seizure. The Department of Justice hoped to find the source of leaked confidential information, and Holder claims he recused himself because he had access to that information and therefore was a suspect.
“[I] have heard you several times talk about ‘best practices and proprieties.'” Labrador said during his questioning of Holder. “When you decided to recuse yourself, did you look at best practices? I think you admitted already it would have been a better practice for you to put it in writing.”


Labrador then cited federal law, specifically 28 USC § 591, and noted that it requires the Attorney General to put a recusal in writing in “certain circumstances.”

“Frankly, I’ve read it a couple times, I don’t know if it applies to your situation right now, but don’t you think it would have been the best practice for you to just put it in writing especially on an issue of such significance?” Labrador asked.
Holder answered that he would consider putting recusals in writing in the future. 
Federal law requires that the U.S. Attorney General sign off on the type of subpoena used in situations such as the AP investigation, but Holder claimed that when he recused himself, that responsibility fell to Deputy Attorney General James Cole. Asked directly if he put his recusal in writing, Holder said no. He claimed he only informed Cole of the decision.
The law that Labrador cited notes that when the Attorney General decides his recusal is necessary, he must put such a determination in writing. The exact text of that section of law is as follows:

“Recusal of Attorney General.– 
(1) When recusal is required.– 
(A) If information received under this chapter involves the Attorney General, the next most senior official in the Department of Justice who is not also recused shall perform the duties assigned under this chapter to the Attorney General. 
(B) If information received under this chapter involves a person with whom the Attorney General has a personal or financial relationship, the Attorney General shall recuse himself or herself by designating the next most senior official in the Department of Justice who is not also recused to perform the duties assigned under this chapter to the Attorney General. 
(2) Requirements for recusal determination.– Before personally making any other determination under this chapter with respect to information received under this chapter, the Attorney General shall determine under paragraph (1)(B) whether recusal is necessary. The Attorney General shall set forth this determination in writing, identify the facts considered by the Attorney General, and set forth the reasons for the recusal. The Attorney General shall file this determination with any notification or application submitted to the division of the court under this chapter with respect to such information. “

A Department of Justice spokeswoman has not immediately responded to Breitbart News in response to Labrador’s line of questioning.

Two politicians involved in Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign have contradicted GOP strategist Karl Rove’s boast of directing the conservative icon’s Texas operation that year.
Both Ernie Angelo, Ronald Reagan’s Texas campaign manager in 1980, and Rick Shelby, the 1980 Reagan campaign’s regional political director responsible for Texas, told the Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis on Friday that Karl Rove was not the “director of the Texas campaign for Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980” as he claimed Thursday on The O’Reilly Factor:

I finally caught up with Rick Shelby, who helped me get to the bottom of it. Today, Shelby’s with the American Gas Association, but in 1979, he was one of the original Regional Political Directors for the Reagan for President Committee. This involved coordinating nine states — including Texas.
Since Texas was important, Shelby tells me he spent an “inordinate” amount of time in the Lone Star State in 1980. And though Rove never technically worked on the Reagan campaign, Shelby says he served as executive director for the state’s Victory Committee.
In that capacity, Shelby recalls that Rove “played a vital role in helping raise the funds necessary” for an effective voter ID and turnout program in the state. 

Here’s what 1980 Reagan Texas campaign manager Ernest Angelo said about Rove’s role in the 1980 Reagan campaign in an email Friday:



In 1980 I was Gov Reagan’s Texas chairman in the primary and Campaign Manager for the general election. Gov Clements endorsed Reagan after the Texas primary and was the campaign Chairman. I was a full time volunteer on site for most of the Fall campaign in Austin. I worked closely with Rick Shelby who was a Reagan Regional Political Director and was in Austin nearly full time. We had a large staff of volunteers and paid individuals. I’m not much for titles but I can assure you Karl Rove was materially involved since he was working for me and Gov Clements in the campaign.

Reagan biographer Craig Shirley said he was “delighted” to see Angelo and Shelby confirm his own research, he said in an exclusive email to Breitbart News Friday evening.

“This confirms earlier documentation by Tom Pauken and Gary Hoitsma, both deeply involved in the Texas Reagan campaign of 1980,” Shirley wrote. He stated that his own interviews for the book Rendezvous With Destiny, none of his sources linked Rove to Reagan’s campaign.

In the course of interviewing President Carter, Vice President Mondale, John Anderson, Jim Baker, Jody Powell, President George H.W. Bush, Tom Brokaw, Lou Cannon, Dave Keene, Vic Gold, Frank Donatelli, Roger Stone, Ed Rollins and over 150 people all told including Ernie Angelo and Rick Shelby, Mr. Rove’s name never came up except sparingly in relation to the Bush 1980 campaign. But never the Reagan campaign.

Shirley says that he never found Rove’s name in his personal search of the Reagan Library’s files on the 1980 campaign. He claims that of the 200 books used in the bibliography for Rendezvous, “Mr. Rove’s name never came up in connection to the Reagan campaign of 1980 in any of these publications.”
“Just to be sure,” he continued, “we ran a search today of Texas newspapers from March to November of 1980 and Mr. Rove’s name never appeared. Period.”
Earlier this month, Rove’s announcement that he had established a new SuperPAC, the Conservative Victory Project, drew the ire of Tea Party activists, who saw this new organization as yet another attempt to force moderate candidates through the Republican primary process.

This week, conservative scholar and talk radio host Mark Levin said he would accept an offer by the Republican National Committee to moderate a presidential debate during the 2016 cycle.
Last week, RNC communications director Sean Spicer appeared on The Wilkow Majority with guest host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, and said Levin was one of the people who should be asking questions at the debates instead of mainstream media journalists. 
After Breitbart News reported on the interview, the movement to allow conservatives like Levin to potentially moderate a debate picked up momentum and “took on life.” 


Levin, in comments picked up by The Right Scoop, said he was of two minds after reading the Breitbart News report about Spicer’s comments. He said he believed the RNC was either “sucking up” to him so he does not criticize them or actually serious. 

“I accept,” Levin said. “Yes, I’ll do it.”
He said he would like to ask Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, if he were to run, why he refused to sign a brief opposing Obamacare. Levin said he would also like to ask Christie why he was weak on border security, soft on the Ground Zero Mosque, favored gun control, and supported environmentalists. 
Levin said he would like to ask former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, if he were to run, if he felt there should be a “two Bush limit on the presidency” and why he “supports anarchy on the border” by promoting comprehensive immigration reform so fervently. 
The talk radio host said he still did not fully believe the RNC would actually extend an offer to him because the Republican establishment “buffoons” who are “destroying the Republican Party from within” loathe him. 
“You know how much they despise me,” Levin said. “I think I am hated more [at the Republican National Convention] than at the Democrat convention.”
“So yeah, I’m available [to moderate the debates],” Levin said. “I don’t believe it for two seconds.”

The battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party has begun. On one side is the Tea Party. On the other side stand Karl Rove and his establishment team, posing as tacticians while quietly undermining conservatism.
Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the “biggest donors in the Republican Party” have joined forces with Karl Rove and Steven J. Law, president of American Crossroads, to create the Conservative Victory Project. The Times reports that this new group will dedicate itself to “recruit seasoned candidates and protect Senate incumbents from challenges by far-right conservatives and Tea Party enthusiasts who Republican leaders worry could complicate the party’s effort to win control of the Senate.” The group points to candidates like Christine O’Donnell in Delaware and Richard Mourdock in Indiana as examples of Tea Party primary picks going sideways in major Senatorial battles.


But it is American Crossroads and its ilk that have run the GOP into the ground. Spending millions of dollars on useless 30,000-ft. advertising campaigns during the last election cycle, training candidates to soften conservatism in order to appeal to “moderates,” blowing up the federal budget under George W. Bush as a bipartisan tactic – all of those strategies led the party to a disastrous defeat in 2012. The Tea Party, which may nominate losers from time to time, also brought the Republicans their historic 2010 Congressional victory. If Tea Party candidates lose, it’s because they weren’t good candidates; if GOP establishment candidates lose, it’s because they weren’t good conservatives. The choice for actual conservatives should be easy.
 But it isn’t. The Bush insider team that helped lead to the rise of Barack Obama insists that they, and only they, know the path to victory. As the Times reports, Conservative Victory Project won’t merely protect incumbents – it will challenge sitting Congresspeople of the Tea Party variety, including six-term Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, who may run for Senate. “We’re concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem,” Law told the Times – with whom he seems far too friendly. “This is an example of candidate discipline and how it would play in a general election. All of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.” 
Law claims he’s acting under the rubric of William F. Buckley, supporting the most conservative candidate who can win. But Law is no judge of that. Neither is Rove. Their advice led to the epic Romney defeat, in which conservatives were told to vote for Romney in the primary since he was the only candidate who could win. 

Grover Norquist correctly points out that the Rove mission is nonsense. “People are imagining a problem that doesn’t exist,” said Norquist. “We’ve had people challenge the establishment guy and do swimmingly.” In truth, conservatism wins elections so long as the messenger doesn’t implode. Rove’s view, however, is that conservatism takes a back seat to the best quasi-conservative messenger.
But victory for conservatives isn’t Rove’s goal. He’s a political insider par excellence, and he’s playing for his political life in the aftermath of 2012. If that means declaring war on the Tea Party, so be it.

Who’s afraid of Congresswoman Michele Bachmann? The entire range of far-left activists, apparently.
Bachmann (R-MN) is currently the target of an aggressive campaign sponsored by a leftist organization, People for the American Way. Its immediate objective is to get House Speaker John Boehner to strip her of her Intelligence Committee seat.
According to the Watchdog Wire, the group–affiliated with ACORN, George Soros, and United for Peace and Justice–has taken a rather vocal stance against Bachmann.



People for the American Way (PFAW) has launched a new campaign against Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN), who, after her recent re-election to Congress, has been re-appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI).


A PFAW-sponsored petition with 178,000 signatures is to be presented to House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) on Monday 21 January 2012 to protest Bachmann’s HPSCI appointment.


Citing what PFAW calls “ugly Islamophobic fear mongering,” the petition decries what it alleges are Bachmann’s “unfounded and irresponsible attacks on dedicated public servants.”


Michele Bachmann has represented the people of Minnesota’s 6th Congressional District since 2007. She is the Chairwoman of the Tea Party Caucus in the House of Representatives.


Bachmann’s supporters consider her a staunch conservative who is a champion of the cause of limited, constitutional government. They admire her for her commitment to low taxes and fiscal discipline, as well as her opposition to socialized medicine.


In matters of national defense, Bachmann is a stalwart advocate of Ronald Reagan’s philosophy of Peace through Strength. Rep. Bachmann has spoken many times regarding the threat of radical Islam and Obama administration policies that are exacerbating it.

The petition was not PFAW’s first assault on Bachmann, as the group spent most of 2012 producing propaganda to make people distance themselves from the Congresswoman and her startling revelations.

Bachmann is credited with leading a 2012 effort to launch official investigations into the activities of federal employees in five executive branch agencies allegedly tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.

From FrontPage Magazine:

Last June, Rep. Michele Bachmann and four Republican colleagues sent letters to the Inspectors General at the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State, asking them to investigate whether the Muslim Brotherhood–the ideological wellspring from which such terrorist outfits as al Qaeda and Hamas first emerged–might be gaining undue influence over high-level U.S. government officials. One letter, for instance, noted that Hillary Clinton’s closest aide, her deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin, “has three family members… connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.”


Critics viciously attacked Bachmann for asking these questions. Many on the right consider her treatment unwarranted, ad hominem criticism from left-leaning establishment media and Islamist organizations–and even from some fellow Republicans–and that it decreased the margin of her very narrow reelection in 2012.

Why the special interest from PFAW? According to Discover the Networks:


People for the American Way (PFAW) was established in 1981 as a Tides Foundation project designed to counteract the allegedly growing influence of what its founder, television producer and political activist Norman Lear, denounced as the ‘religious right.’ 


In July 2011, PFAW published a Right Wing Playbook on Anti-Muslim Extremism, whose theme is that: “Under the guise of defending freedom and American values, right-wing anti-Muslim activists are campaigning to prevent Muslim-Americans from freely worshiping and practicing their religion, curtail their political rights, and even compel their deportation.”

Bachmann is also despised on the left because of her role in taking down ACORN. Bachmann went after ACORN for its role in the federal census before the group received national media attention, and the far left has never forgotten it. ACORN received over $100,000 from the foundation started by the wife of PFAW founder Norman Lear. PFAW also shares other funders with ACORN and has worked with Project Vote for years on “election protection.” PFAW boasts celebrity board members like Alec Baldwin and Seth McFarlane. The board also consists of several members with connections to the Communist Party of the USA and the usual suspects of radical millionaires.
Would PFAW’s interest have anything to do with Deborah Rappaport and her husband Andrew?
Discover the Networks provides a very clear profile:

A committed Democrat and a socialist, Rappaport has established himself (along with his wife, the philanthropist and political activist Deborah Rappaport) as one of the largest donors to Democratic Party candidates and causes. Between 1999 and 2008, he contributed $340,139 to candidates and political action committees at the national level. In addition, he and his wife have given millions of dollars to organizations that promote Democrat objectives and policies…  


Andrew Rappaport is secretary of the Rappaport Family Foundation (RFF), which he and his wife established in 2002 as a vehicle by which to administer their charitable donations. Between 2004 and 2008, RFF gave $850,000 to People for the American Way, $700,000 to the Center for American Progress, and $323,000 to the anti-war group Project Billboard. In 2006 RFF sent $100,000 to the Tides Center, which in turn (on instructions from RFF) funneled the money to Allied Media Projects, an anti-corporate community-media organization where ACORN founder Wade Rathke sits on the board of directors. As of 2006, RFF’s assets totaled $7.6 million.

Other ACORN connected board members of PFAW include the well-connected radical Margery Tabankin, the Executive Director of both Steven Spielberg’s Righteous Persons Foundation and The Streisand Foundation.
Bachmann’s enemies at PFAW even originate from her own backyard. Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie is not only connected to several of the PFAW board members’ radical organizations but he is also a friend of Bachmann’s old foe ACORN.

How close of a friend? While at ACORN, I remember several efforts working with local Democrats to raise money for the Franken versus Coleman efforts. This included a 2008 meeting between Secretary of State Ritchie, ACORN, Project Vote. The subject of the meeting? Ritchie was actively providing fundraising help for Project Vote and ACORN.
PFAW has a long history of partisan political activity that is ignored by the very same mainstream media that have funded–yes, funded them in the past. CBS, NBC, ABC and even the New York Times have failed to note what the Capital Research Center (CRC) pointed out in 2002. During the height of PFAW’s work to stymie all Bush judicial nominees, CRC wrote:

People for the American Way and its affiliates work together as a powerful lobby for leftist ideology and Democratic party politics. Whatever its tax lawyers may say, the scandal of PFAW is that foundations and corporations inflate its budget and pay for its politics. Every dollar contributed to PFAW advances a profoundly political agenda.

To recap, PFAW’s board is comprised of a who’s who of far-left radicals, socialists, and communists. They are tied to ACORN and Project Vote, and the bulk of their funding comes from far-left foundations like Tides. In addition, the Capital Research Center reported that in 2003 and 2004, 98 percent of the organization’s political contributions went to left-wing Democratic candidates.
Do PFAW and its allies aim to inflict further damage in the Alinsky style to one of our country’s most courageous and visionary leaders, to defeat her next year as part of the left’s determined bid to return the House to Democratic control? 
Speaker of the House John Boehner and the rest of the country should stand strong behind Michele Bachmann. With those kind of enemies, Bachmann appears to be one of the few in Congress on the right path. We must not allow the Islamists and their allies on the left to deprive our country at this critical moment of Michele Bachmann’s leadership on national security, limited government, and conservative values at a moment when they are needed more than ever. If one woman can bring the entire wrath of the left down on her, one must examine her statements and remember the old adage “the truth hurts.” Well, look who’s howling now.

Two Congressmen are asking the Treasury Department if it inappropriately scrutinized conservative-owned businesses the same way it targeted Tea Party groups filing for tax-exempt status.
Republicans Mike Kelly (PA-03) and Jim Renacci (OH-16) circulated a letter Thursday requesting Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to release documents detailing the process and methodology the Automotive Task Force used to shut down General Motors dealerships in 2009 during the automotive industry crisis. 
Renacci’s Northeast Ohio Chevrolet dealership was closed in 2010 after losing a battle with General Motors. Congress loaned General Motors $50 billion in 2009 after GM declared bankruptcy, which resulted in the federal government owning a majority share of the company. Roughly 2000 dealerships received “wind-down” agreements, and while hundreds were able to survive an exhaustive arbitration process, Renacci-Doraty Chevrolet in Wadsworth did not. Renacci, then a Congressional candidate challenging incumbent John Boccieri, placed the blame squarely on President Obama. 


Mike Kelly has a similar story. He decided to run for Congress when it was announced that Obama’s Automotive Task Force slated Wayland Chevrolet in Butler, Pennsylvania for closure. The dealership was started by Kelly’s father in 1953.
Now that it has been confirmed that the Treasury Department unfairly profiled conservatives around that time, the Congressmen are wondering if that could have been a factor in the selection of certain dealerships for closure.
The IRS scandal “raises serious questions about past decisions made by the [Treasury] Department regarding auto dealership closures that occurred in 2008 and 2009,” reads the letter. “We formally request that the Treasury Department provide all e-mails, phone records, notes, memoranda, reports, and other communications regarding the decision-making process for dealership closures from the Automotive Task Force headed by Car Czars Steve Rattner and Ron Bloom.”

The letter also notes that while the Automotive Task Force claimed to have objectively evaluated each dealership, a Special Inspector General Report found that there was “little or no documentation” that proves objective criteria were used.

After weeks of being vilified by the national media and White House as a terrorist, racist, and radical hostage-taker out to destroy the economy, Ted Cruz (R-TX) is receiving the kind of death threats that are all-too expected after this kind of national demonization campaign. A person who identifies himself on Twitter as Troy Gilmore, Jr. listed the Senator’s homes address and suggested Cruz be taught a “street wise lesson.” Capitol Police are investigating:
 The Hill reported Capitol Police were looking into the post by someone identifying himself as Troy  Gilmore Jr.
 The tweet, posted early Friday, said, “Take down Ted Cruz, at his home” and listed Cruz’s home  address in Houston, The Hill reported.


 It also said, “What goes around comes around CRUZ!!”
 The Hill said the poster — using the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54 — said he had served in the U.S.  Army and Navy, and posted another tweet Friday afternoon saying Cruz “needs tobe [sic] taught a  street wise [sic] lesson.”
In the last couple of weeks, the hate speech directed at Cruz from the elite media has been merciless. Politico mused about drowning Cruz; The Washington Post compared Cruz to an evil, mass-murdering terrorist – “Ted Bin Laden”; a writer for The New Yorker compared Cruz to O.J. Simpson. The media have also made Cruz the face of a movement they have described as a bunch of racists “wearing suicide vests” and “taking hostages.” 

Mind you, this is just what the elite media have been saying. President Obama and top Democrats have been just as bad. 
After all of this, the only surprise is that this is the only death threat against Cruz, or at least the only one we know of. Why would someone not feel a seething hostility towards an individual the national media and our president are wishing dead, comparing to terrorists, and relentlessly demonizing as the leader of a radical, dangerous, arsonist, anarchist, racist, hostage-taking cause that will destroy America?
We sure have come a long way from a media and White House that just two years ago made a national crusade out of finding a New Tone in politics. In the wake of the horrific shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, within an hour, the media blamed Governor Sarah Palin over a standard issue campaign map that placed crosshairs over Giffords’ district. Even after it was clear there was no connection to the map and the deranged killer, the media and President Obama still lectured America over the corrosive effect violent political rhetoric was having on our culture. 
But just two years later, the media are no longer interested in enforcing the New Tone. And just a year after trying to destroy Rush Limbaugh over his labeling of a left-wing activist as a “slut,” the media are currently engaged in a hate speech campaign beyond anything we have seen in years.  
Politics aside, although the media will never publicly acknowledge the possibility that their “othering campaign” might have contributed to a death threat against a U.S. Senator serious enough to involve police, let’s hope that privately there is at least some soul searching going on.

The bipartisan Senate group pushing immigration reform, dubbed the “Gang of Eight,” has allowed a representative from President Barack Obama’s White House to be involved in writing their bill but has not even tried to meet with representatives from the law enforcement community, particularly Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.
“While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill,” the Washington Post‘s Scott Wilson and Zachary Goldfarb reported on Sunday.


Even though the Gang of Eight–Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Jeff Flake, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Michael Bennet and Bob Menendez–has allowed the White House into meetings, ICE officers union president Chris Crane notes that his group has been kept completely out of the discussion on immigration reform.

“We have tried for weeks, unsuccessfully, to get a meeting with the Gang of 8 in order to share our deep concerns about the breakdown of interior enforcement in America,” Crane said in the statement released on Sunday.  
“ICE’s political leadership, specifically Secretary Napolitano and Director Morton, have repeatedly and dangerously undermined the ability of ICE officers and agents to do their jobs and ensure the constitutionally established rule of law is upheld. Yet, while the Gang of 8 has, as reported for months, worked extensively with powerful interest groups, ICE officers–like the public–have been shut out. Now we understand from media reports that the Gang of 8 is preparing to drop a 1,500 page bill on Tuesday, and pass it as quickly as possible, without having received any input from rank-and-file ICE officers.
“If the Gang is truly committed to enforcement and public safety they should be eager to provide our officers with an opportunity to review this legislation and offer detailed input before it is introduced,” Crane added. “I would therefore respectfully request that the introduction of the bill be delayed so that ICE officers and others in the law enforcement community can be fully briefed on this 1,500 page bill and offer detailed input regarding some of our nation’s most urgent interior enforcement needs that this proposal seemingly does nothing to address.”
Even though the Gang of Eight has refused meeting requests with ICE officers to discuss real law enforcement reform in the immigration debate, Rubio–the GOP members’ de facto leader–says he wants an open and transparent discussion on this issue. He has still not forced multiple hearings on the legislation, as he previously promised, and has not set up a meeting with ICE officers.
During his Sunday show charm offensive, Rubio continued saying he supports an open and transparent debate.

Following up on Ace’s post here is Biden telling Chris Matthews back in 2007 that he is deadly serious about attempting to impeach Bush if he goes to war in Iran without congressional authorization:



Matthews: You said that if the President of the United States had launched an attack on Iran without congressional approval that would have been an impeachable offense. Do you want to review that comment you made? Well how do you stand on that now?
Biden:Yes I do. I want to stand by the comment I made. The reason I made the comment was as a warning. I don’t say those things lightly, Chris, you’ve known me for a long time. I was chairman of the judiciary committee for 17 years or its ranking member. I teach separation of powers and constitutional law. This is something I know. So I got together and brought a group of constitutional scholars together to write a piece that I’m going to deliver to the whole United State Senate pointing out the President has no constitutional authority…to take this nation to war against a county of 70 million people unless we’re attacked or unless there is proof we are about to be attacked. And if he does, if he does, I would move to impeach him. The House obviously has to do that but I would lead an effort to impeach him. The reason for my doing that, I don’t say it lightly, I don’t say it lightly. I say it because they should understand that what they were threatening, what they were saying, what it was adding up to be, what it looked like to the rest of the world we were about to do would be the most disastrous thing that could be done in this moment in our history that I could think of.

On Thursday, semi-retired radio talker Neal Boortz predicted the Republican Party will not win control of the U.S. Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, despite all the pitfalls the Democrats and President Barack Obama are facing, particularly with regards to Obamacare.
The reason, Boortz said, would be the GOP’s tendency to run on issues related to social conservatism.


Boortz explained the importance to the republic for a GOP win next year while guest hosting Sean Hannity’s Thursday radio show:


This whole thing about Phil Robertson and what have you – it speaks a lot to what we have coming up in the election next year. We desperately need to get the Democrats out of control of the United States Senate. The survival of our republic may depend on getting the Democrats out of control of the Senate, sending Harry Reid into the position of minority leader in the U.S. Senate – the survival of the republic may depend on that. And the Democrats are afraid that is indeed what is going to happen. That is why Harry Reid pulled the nuclear option a couple of weeks ago – because they were afraid we may lose the Senate.

However, Boortz admitted he did not think the Republican Party would succeed in saving the republic because it could not resist the temptation to run on social issues in the upcoming midterms.

Let me tell you what I think is going to happen – I don’t think the Republicans are going to take the Senate next year. They’ll keep the House, but they’re not going to get the Senate and I’ll tell you why – because they simply cannot resist the urge, the impulse to get into this social conservatism. The Republicans can’t run on fiscal responsibility. The Republicans, they can’t get out there and say, ‘Look, we are trillions of dollars in debt.’ They can’t stick to that. They can’t say, ‘We need private sector options to ObamaCare that can give people choices in the private marketplace.’ They can’t do that. They can’t stick to fiscal conservatism. They can’t stick to the small government message. The Republicans have this drive, this maniacal, this obsessive drive to get into social conservatism.

Boortz pointed to the race for the seat currently occupied by outgoing Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA). He noted that it could be a loss for the GOP should they nominate Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA) in a contest that might have Michelle Nunn, daughter of former longtime Sen. Sam Nunn (D-GA), as the Democratic opponent.

In a blistering CPAC speech on Saturday in which she sipped a Big Gulp soda to mock Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s soda cup ban–and the liberal nanny state, in general–former Alaska Gov. and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin reserved her harshest words for President Barack Obama regarding gun control, the budget, and leadership. 
Palin said Obama promised the most transparent administration ever but has been mired in crony capitalism and has not even passed a budget. She said refusing to pass a budget is not “just bureaucratic bungling,” it is “refusing to declare what” Obama intends to do with the people’s money. 
“Barack Obama, you lie!” Palin said of Obama’s transparency claims. 


On background checks for guns, Palin said, “Dandy idea, Mr. President. Should have started with yours.”
She said “bad guys who ignore the laws” will not follow new laws when it comes to gun control legislation Democrats want enacted. She blistered liberals for over-simplifying the causes of gun-related crimes.
“Saying a chunk of metal did the crime is like saying the fork made me fat,” Palin said. 

She mocked the mainstream media for gathering again to write their “conservatives in crisis” stories. 
Palin had some harsh words Obama’s lack of leadership and the lack of leaders in Washington. 
She said there is a “direct correlation between the Senate’s stubbornly refusing to pass a budget and selfishly agreeing to spend our children’s and our grandchildren’s money.”
“No budget is no leadership,” Palin said. “It’s time for America to be more outraged about this.”
She said America faces challenges “so big” while its leaders are so small. 

Palin called Obama a campaigner who makes promises he can’t keep and seeks to divide and conquer while orchestrating crisis after crisis to exploit for political gain. 
“We don’t have leadership coming out of Washington, we have reality television,” Palin said. 
Palin said everything coming out of Washington, D.C. feels put-on and every event feels calculated to fool Americans. 
She blistered the permanent political class for focusing too much on the process of politics instead of the purpose of politics, which is to lead and serve. She resoundingly mocked Obama as a permanent campaigner even though he is not up for reelection anymore. 
“Now step away from the Teleprompter, and do your job,” Palin said to Obama.

Nancy Mace, a conservative primary challenger to incumbent South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, retweeted an insult to her Twitter followers Tuesday which called her opponent a “Nancy boy.” 
She has since deleted the tweet, but the Sunlight Foundation’s “Politwoops,” which preserves tweets politicians have deleted, has the retweet on its website: 

“RT @PaulSteel4: @nancymace we support you here in Florida. Nancy Mace vs Nancy boy graham.”

“Nancy boy” is a derogatory term used to describe “an effeminate or homosexual man.”


Mace is the first female graduate of The Citadel, where her father, Ret. Brigadier General J. Emory Mace, also attended. Mace’s father is the most decorated living graduate of The Citadel.
Graham, a member of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” that wrote the controversial immigration reform bill passed in late June, has long faced criticism for being less ideologically pure than his conservative constituents desire. 
Carolina Conservatives United (CCU), a political group created by former GOProud co-founder and conservative activist Bruce Carroll, launched the website defeatlindseygraham.org shortly before Mace announced her candidacy. CCU’s site attacks Graham for what it deems are his “Beltway Republican” values.

“The truth is Lindsey Graham only panders with conservative language once every six years,” CCU states. “But every day he shows his true stripes by bashing small government conservative activists and ‘voting wrong’ on many of the most important issues before us.”
Former South Carolina Senator and President of the Heritage Foundation Jim DeMint was asked on Tuesday’s “Daily Rundown” on MSNBC, “Do you think Lindsey Graham is a Jim DeMint conservative?”
DeMint simply answered, “I don’t think he would want to be called a Jim DeMint conservative. We’re all different. People will have to decide that for themselves.”
Host Chuck Todd then asked, “Is it fair to call him a conservative?”
DeMint replied: “Lindsey can tell you what he is himself. I’m not speaking for him.”

Just before Russian President Vladimir Putin opened the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, he blasted the Obama administration on Wednesday for what he termed its propaganda on military action against Syria. “We talk with these people,” he said about Secretary of State John Kerry, the administration’s chief political spokesperson making the case for war. “We assume that they are decent. But he lies. And he knows that he lies. That’s pathetic.”
 


Putin has always been a bare-knuckles political brawler with a penchant for saying politically incorrect things about enemies — he once said of Islamist terrorists in Chechnya, for example, “If you are willing to become a radical Islamist and be circumcised, I invite you to Moscow. I will recommend that they perform the operation so that nothing can sprout there again.” Now, however, he’s directly challenging the authority of the United States – and he’s winning. President Obama has always wanted to be perceived as a global leader. Instead, it’s his chief international rival, quasi-dictator Putin, who has seized the reins.

Obama has been left to complain. “Do I hold out hope that Mr. Putin may change his position on some of these issues?” Obama asked in Sweden on Wednesday. “I’m always hopeful, and I will continue to engage him.” Just a few weeks ago, Obama mocked Putin’s posture during their meetings, likening it to a “bored kid in the back of the classroom.”
But it is Obama being schooled. Putin has stated that he would be open to action against Syria if shown proof that Assad ordered the chemical attack there. But on Wednesday, he said of John Kerry, “Of course he lied. And that’s not pretty.” 
The G20 summit has been set not around national security issues, but on tax issues and economic recovery. Nonetheless, it will be Putin setting the agenda on his home turf, especially given that the visiting team is led by a floundering quarterback.

On Thursday, a former U.S. Secret Service agent who is running for a House seat and has written a book about his life in the Service cancelled his prescheduled appearance on MSNBC’s Bashir Live because of Martin Bashir’s suggestion that someone should defecate and urinate in former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s mouth. 



Dan Bongino, who was a Secret Service agent under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told Breitbart News that his appearance to speak on Bashir’s program about his book, Life Inside the Bubble, “was booked in advance of his unfortunate comments,” and he could not in good faith appear on the program.

“In light of these comments I felt it only appropriate to cancel my appearance on the show. Governor Palin took a principled chance on me during my U.S. Senate campaign when few would,” Bongino told Breitbart News. “She put herself out there for me, risking her political capital, and chose to endorse me because she believed in me.

“In a political arena filled with bad actors it was refreshing to know that Governor Palin was willing to fight for the underdog. She deserves better than the treatment she received by Mr. Bashir and I cannot, in good faith, appear on the show, regardless of the number of books it may or may not sell.”
Bongino is the author of Life Inside the Bubble, which is getting bipartisan interest thanks to recent scandals and the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s assassination. As of this writing, it is No. 39 on Amazon.com’s bestsellers list. Bongino, a candidate for Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District who has said he would go to Washington and not let the city change him, turned down a chance to promote himself and his book on Bashir’s show during a week in more people may be watching due to the controversy surrounding Bashir’s comments. 
Bashir apologized on Monday for his remarks, saying they were “offensive” and wholly inappropriate,” but MSNBC has not taken any action against him despite the network’s past history of disciplining its on-air talent for “offensive remarks.” Palin’s political action committee SarahPAC sent a letter to MSNBC President Phil Griffin and NBC News President Deborah Turness, which Breitbart News exclusively obtained, that asked the network what action it would take against Bashir, especially given that the network suspended Alec Baldwin for anti-gay comments he made off of the air.
“You fired Don Imus for offensive language in describing the Rutgers University Women’s Basketball team, you suspended Alec Baldwin, and yet nothing has happened to Mr. Bashir,” the letter reads. “Are we to assume then, that disciplinary procedures at your network take place based on the target of the remarks rather than the remarks themselves?”
The letter concludes, “Americans deserve to know that your network doesn’t condone violent and hateful rhetoric directed at anyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or political persuasion.”

Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin condemned left-wing women’s groups Friday for ignoring MSNBC host Martin Bashir suggestion that former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin deserved an inhuman punishment once used against slaves which includes defecation in one’s mouth and urination in victims’ eyes and mouth.
After letting his listeners know that Bashir said on his MSNBC show that Palin deserved this “dose of discipline” a Jamaican slave master leveled on his slaves, Levin said Bashir likely had delivered the “most disgraceful rant” yet against Palin. 


“Hey tough guy. You like picking on women? You like picking on a mother and a grandmother?” Levin said to Bashir. “You strike me as not tough at all, if you get my drift.” 
Levin then blasted the “pathetic little carbon footprint called MSNBC” for being so “offended with Palin” comparing the federal debt to slavery that they would allow such rants. He said the network should be called the “animal channel” or the “comedy channel.” 
Levin said Palin was exactly right to compare the federal debt to slavery and nothing was offensive about it, since she was not making a comparison to chattel slavery. 

Levin then said “his people,” the “Jewish people,” were slaves, and he did not for one minute think Palin’s comparison was made to “diminish Jewish people or the early days of the nation.”
Levin then called out women’s group like the National Organization for Women (NOW) for “never” coming to the defense of conservative women like Palin. 
Levin said these groups never defend conservative women from misogyny, even when it takes a turn towards the vile and filthy, because “they are not feminist groups. They are left-wing groups. They don’t care about women. They care about left-wing women.”
He said groups like NOW would “worship” Palin if she were a left-wing politician.

On Sunday, a 60 Minutes investigative report by veteran CBS reporter Steve Kroft and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer revealed how leadership PAC loopholes allow members of Congress to convert campaign cash into lavish lifestyle upgrades for themselves and their family members.  
“It’s another example, unfortunately, where the rules that apply to the rest of us, don’t really apply to the members of Congress,” said Schweizer on 60 Minutes.
The report, which contained selected material from Schweizer’s forthcoming book Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets, revealed embarrassing and outlandish instances of cronyism and self-enrichment by members of Congress. Despite the fact that funds from leadership PACs are supposed to go to help elect fellow members of one’s own political party, lax campaign laws allow lawmakers to turn their leadership PACs into private slush funds to fund just about anything.



Rep. Rob Andrews (D-NJ), for example, tapped his wife, a lawyer and an associate law dean at Rutgers School of Law-Camden, to be a PAC compliance officer for his leadership PAC. She approved the use of donor dollars to fly her, Rep. Andrews, and their two daughters to Edinburgh, Scotland for a wedding at a posh resort. Andrews’s leadership PAC paid $16,575 in airfare. His campaign committee picked up the rest of the tab, which was slightly under $14,000. Schweizer says Andrews’s leadership PAC even paid for the wedding gift, which was china from Bloomingdale’s. Andrews and his wife even merged a campaign event with their daughter’s graduation party, allowing them to combine the costs of the two events, even though the PAC did not pick up the entire bill.
When Kroft confronted the Democratic New Jersey congressman, Andrews said, “I think we should take a look at having clearer rules at what they can and cannot be spent for. I’d be for that.” Andrews claimed he could not speak more on the matter because of a pending House Ethics investigation, even though Kroft said the committee told him they were fine with Andrews speaking about the matter.

Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) attempted to use $6,230 in campaign funds to pay for a personal trainer. Meeks’s staff claimed using campaign money for a fitness instructor is a legitimate expense, because gym visits alleviate stress from Meeks’s “official duties.” The investigation also revealed that Meeks has used $35,000 from his leadership PAC on NFL games.
Sen. Saxby Chambliss’s (R-GA) leadership PAC dropped $107,752 at the Breakers resort in Palm Beach during the 2012 election cycle. That is over three times as much money as he gave the National Republican Senatorial Committee to get fellow Republicans elected. One year, Chambliss spent nearly one-third of his entire leadership PAC funds on golf, limos, and at least one private jet ride. His leadership PAC also picked up a $26,814 dinner tab at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse and $10,344 at Pebble Beach.
The 60 Minutes special also revealed how members of Congress exploit a self-loan loophole that allows politicians to loan their own campaigns money at high interest rates and then let the loans linger to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in passive streams of profit for themselves. 
Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) has bagged at least $294,245 since 1998 by loaning her congressional campaign money at interest rates up to 18%–a scheme that effectively funneled campaign contributor donations into her personal bank account. After numerous attempts to interview Napolitano, Kroft finally confronted her outside a Hispanic Caucus meeting.
“She told us that as a woman and a minority, banks wouldn’t lend her money, so she had to withdraw $150,000 from an investment account to lend it to her campaign,” said Kroft.

Kroft then questioned why she would charge 18% interest. “That’s what the Mafia gets,” he exclaimed.
“It isn’t like I’ve really profited,” said Napolitano. “I still live in the same house. I drive a small car. I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”

The 60 Minutes report also revealed that members of Congress are permitted to use leadership PAC money to hire their own family members. As Kroft and Schweizer point out, most corporations have nepotism laws that prevent the hiring of family members. And while congressional rules bar family members from serving on a congressman’s official staff, lawmakers are free to hire family to serve on their campaigns.
Former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) put his daughter, grandson, daughter’s mother-in-law, grandson-in-law, granddaughter, and another relative–six family members in total–on his campaign payroll. The Paul progeny received a combined $304,599.
Kroft also confronted retiring Rep. Rodney Alexander (R-LA) about actions Schweizer reports on in Extortion. Alexander paid his two daughters over $130,000 in combined expenses for working on his campaign, which he won with an overwhelming 78% of the vote. Kroft asked Alexander what his daughters did.

“They do everything that others do for other campaigns,” said Alexander. “Somebody has to do that work. I kept it with someone I can trust. If one can’t trust their daughter, then who can they trust?”
Kroft and Schweizer agreed that leadership PACs are hotbeds of cronyism and self-enrichment.
“The abuse is substantial and pretty widespread,” said Kroft. 
Schweizer agreed and said that is precisely how the Establishment likes it.
“We hear a lot about how there’s so much partisan fighting in Washington,” said Schweizer. “Here’s a great example of bipartisanship. Both sides like this current system.”
Sunday’s 60 Minutes report is just the tip of the iceberg. According to Schweizer’s publisher, next week’s Tuesday release of Extortion will include never-before-released documents and revelations on several top Democrats, Republicans, President Barack Obama, and Attorney General Eric Holder.

Members of Congress and their staffs are on red alert tonight for a CBS 60 Minutes investigation by veteran CBS reporter Steve Kroft and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer exposing how lawmakers convert campaign donations into lavish lifestyle upgrades for themselves and their family members.
Sources say top CBS executives thought the report was so explosive that they made it the show’s lead story and delayed airing it for another week in order to capture tonight’s much larger NFL-viewing audience. The report features selected revelations from Schweizer’s forthcoming book, Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets.
“I’m under a publisher embargo right now and can’t say much,” Schweizer told Breitbart News. “But suffice it to say, President Obama and some members of Washington’s Permanent Political Class are not going to like what we uncovered and the kinds of personal enrichment and self-dealing exposed in Extortion.”


To prevent early leaks of the book’s contents, publisher Houghton Mifflin made bookstore managers sign legal affidavits saying they would not shelve Extortion until the book’s official Tuesday, October 22 launch date. The book, which contains a staggering 35 pages of source materials totaling over 600 endnotes, is chock-full of revelations and never-before-released documents on top Washington figures, says Houghton Mifflin.

According to the publisher’s description, the new book “reveals vast new areas of corruption in our political system” and contains “eye-opening revelations on every page,” while opening “a whole new battlefield in the great war to fix what’s wrong with our government.”
In 2011, Kroft and Schweizer teamed up for a 60 Minutes investigation based on Schweizer’s New York Times bestseller, Throw Them All Out. The results rocked official Washington, as the exposé revealed that Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) was given insider access to the Visa credit card IPO, wherein she made a 50% profit on her investment in just two days. The report also alleged that Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) engaged in insider trading, prompting an ethics investigation and Bachus stepping down from his chairmanship of the Financial Services Committee. Schweizer’s book ultimately led to passage of the STOCK (Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge) Act banning congressional insider trading. Throw Them All Out was “the book that started the STOCK Act stampede,” reported Slate.
Schweizer, a noted conservative and fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, has gained a national reputation for his bipartisan corruption investigations, attacking Democrats and Republicans alike. Earlier this year, progressive Comedy Central host Jon Stewart of the Daily Show featured Schweizer in a segment on the STOCK Act wherein Stewart criticized Congress for watering down the bill Schweizer’s book helped pass.
Schweizer and GAI worked with 60 Minutes for six months on tonight’s program. On Friday, CBS hosts Charlie Rose and Norah O’Donnell sat down with Kroft to discuss the soon-to-air report. O’Donnell called GAI’s Peter Schweizer one of “the top campaign finance watchdogs” in America.
The 60 Minutes joint investigation by Kroft and GAI President Peter Schweizer airs tonight on CBS.

Tamara Keith of National Public Radio filed a story Tuesday on efforts by liberal non-profit groups to claim that they, too, were “targeted” by the IRS, just as conservative groups were. None of them, however, can claim that they were singled out because of their names or views–and many received approval before the 2012 election.
Keith notes that several “progressive” groups received extensive inquiries from the IRS when they applied for 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 status, including intrusive questions about their donors. Some complain that approval took nearly two years. Keith draws parallels between their experience and that of conservative groups.


But Keith notes that “everyone” agrees that what happened to groups with “Tea Party” and “Patriot” in their names was wrong–and could well have added that there are no parallels to some of the worst abuses that conservative groups endured, such as questions about the content of their prayers, or leaks of donor lists.

Keith’s report amplifies one of two narratives Democrats and the left have been spinning in the past several weeks to deflate the IRS scandal. One is that the IRS ought to be investigating political non-profit groups; the other, somewhat conflicting story is that the abuse conservative groups experienced was not unique.
The story was released on the day that Tea Party groups are gathering for an “Audit the IRS” rally in Washington to protest the agency’s conduct. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee continues its investigation of the IRS, as legislators debate calls for a special prosecutor into the scandal.
Update: As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn has noted, Democrats did not call any liberal non-profit groups to testify before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month when several of the Tea Party and conservative groups that had been targeted spoke to legislators about their experience of abuses by the IRS.

So Ted Cruz doesn’t trust the Republicans. Imagine that.
“Let me be clear” he said on the Senate floor the other day. “I don’t trust the Republicans, and I don’t trust the Democrats.” And why not? The last four years have given us all ample reason not to trust the Democrats, as $1 trillion deficits have become the new normal and the national debt has zoomed toward $17 trillion, all under the Obama-Pelosi-Reid team’s watch.
But what about the Republicans, who so often claim to be the party of limited government? The truth is, the GOP’s record is seldom as grand as its rhetoric. Aside from a few Tea Party stalwarts, plenty of Republican senators are ready to throw in the towel on the debt ceiling, let it go up, and get a few scraps from the Democrats in return.


“Here is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,” Cruz was quoted in the New York Times. “There are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.”
He is right about that. Senior Republican staffers in Congress tell me that members of the Republican Leadership in both houses of Congress are terrified of not raising the debt ceiling, having been convinced that calamity will ensue if we don’t. But the alternative? Senate Majority Leader McConnell would, I am told, be happy to see the debt ceiling raised with no Republican votes. Then Republicans can beat up Democrats for raising it, while knowing that the economy won’t explode as Paul Krugman has warned it would. 
And if House Speaker John Boehner had to choose between a clean debt ceiling increase (one with no limits, allowing Obama to keep raising it ad nauseum) and no debt ceiling increase at all, I am told he would take the former by conservatives in the House of Representatives.

So the establishment Republican mind-set says, “More debt is better than a melt-down, but at least get something in return, even if it doesn’t mean much, we have something to run against the Democrats with.” What do they want in return? They know they don’t have the votes to get much in the way of budget cuts, so they can at least keep the base happy with talk about “economic growth.”
When Cruz, who is anything but your traditional freshman back-bench Senator, said he didn’t trust Republicans, the party establishment, led by John McCain, howled in response. But where is the Republican leadership’s credibility? When they last held real power, these Republicans goosed up domestic discretionary spending faster than it rose under Bill Clinton and piled on the debt.
It was under a Republican president and Congress that we got Medicare Part D, the biggest new entitlement since LBJ’s Great Society. The prescription drug benefit added trillions to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities, passed only when party bosses needed to violate normal procedures to get the votes to pass it. Former U.S. Comptroller David Walker called it “the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s.”
Medicare’s chief actuary, Richard Foster, later said he was threatened not to reveal that the drug benefit’s price tag would exceed $400 billion in the first ten years. This figure was necessary under congressional rules to keep the bill from being blocked on a point of order. Foster estimated the real price tag was in excess of $500 billion. Several GOP congressmen would also recount arm-twisting tactics from the party leadership that went beyond the norm.
Instead of reducing the federal role in education, the Bush Administration and Republicans in Congress gave us No Child Left Behind, which helped double the size of the Department of Education, a Cabinet-level agency Republicans had pledged to abolish as recently as 1996. John Boehner, now the speaker of the House, was an NCLB sponsor and described its enactment as “one of the proudest accomplishments of my tenure in Congress.”

Under a Republican president and Congress, a $128 billion surplus was replaced by a $455 billion deficit. By the time George W. Bush left office, the shortfall was $1.2 trillion. Discretionary spending went up faster in Bush’s first term than it did in eight years under Bill Clinton. Under Bush’s watch, the federal budget exceeded $2 trillion, and then $3 trillion, for the first time. Most of these milestones were reached before the Democrats retook Congress. Federal spending rose from 18.4 percent of GDP to an average of 20.51 percent under Bush.
Bush and the Republican establishment bailed out the Wall Street banks with the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (with Democratic support, naturally). They bailed out the auto industry. They even pioneered a pre-Obama stimulus program, with similar results. The deficits and government growth would later endanger the Bush tax cuts, one of the signature conservative policy achievements of the period.
The Republicans who would negotiate the debt ceiling with the Democrats in a conference will be the same people who voted for all this big government and their successors. This unfortunately includes even Paul Ryan. What faith can we have that the results will be different this time?
So is there any doubt at all why Ted Cruz doesn’t trust Republicans? He explained that he thinks “a whole lot of Americans likewise don’t trust the Republicans and the Democrats because it is leadership in both parties that has gotten us in this mess.” 
Maybe we need new leadership.

20775	http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/11/House-GOP-Caves-Will-Lift-Debt-AND-Reopen-Government	Opinion	0	Economy	Republican Scandals	Neutral	SomewhatNegative	breitbart.com	"

House Republicans have sent the White House a revised proposal to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks, as well as reopen government through December 15th, which was their original spending proposal before the partial shutdown. The revised GOP plan reflects the demands Obama made in a meeting with House GOP Leaders on Thursday. It also reflects the unwillingness of the DC GOP to face a fiscal showdown with Democrats. 
Aside from reopening the government and agreeing to raise America’s debt over the current $16.7 trillion limit, the Republicans made several other concession to President Obama and the Democrats. One such example is that Obamacare would receive funding. The Republicans would get to take out a portion of the president’s signature legislation, but the law would substantially remain intact. The AP reports:

Under a proposal she and other GOP senators have been developing, a medical device tax that helps finance the health care law would be repealed, and millions of individuals eligible for subsidies to purchase health insurance under the program would be subject to stronger income verification.

In addition, some of the across-the-board “sequester” cuts would be reversed under the GOP plan. It has not been determined which specific cuts will be targeted at this time.


In exchange for meeting, at least momentarily, all of Obama’s demands, the House GOP is seeking a “framework” for future negotiations on addressing longer-term budget issues. These negotiations would be led for the Republicans by Rep. Paul Ryan, who is likely to seek a “grand bargain” resolving the nation’s structural budget problems. 

After such a swift capitulation on the current impasse, how likely is it that the GOP will be able to extract meaningful reforms during yet another round of budget talks? House Leadership has already shown that, when nearing an actual deadline, it will cave while extracting very few concessions. 
The GOP surrender comes at a time when it is in a stronger position than it was during the partial government shutdown in 1995/96. The public generally blames both parties and President Obama for the fiscal stalemate. Obama’s approval ratings, meanwhile, have cratered to 37%, the lowest of his Presidency. 
In addition, 61% of the public thinks significant spending cuts have to be part of any deal to lift the debt ceiling. By that, they mean actual cuts, not a “framework” to discuss cuts. 
The House GOP has signaled to the Democrats that it is desperate to end the stand-off. They will, of course, promise that they will have more “leverage” next time. They’ve said that so many times, they probably even believe it.

President Barack Obama built his 2008 presidential campaign on a new brand of politics, one where the two parties could come together in the best interests of the country.
Nothing of the sort transpired, as we all know now. Five years later, Obama and his acolytes can’t wait to trash members of the GOP who dare stretch a toe over the ideological line toward the President.


Two new examples: a MoveOn.org effort to paint Paul Ryan (R-WI) as racist for using the term “anchor babies” in an immigration talk, and Organizing for Action branding Marco Rubio (R-FL) a “climate denier.”

Both Ryan and Rubio have been generally supportive of the “Gang of 8” Senate immigration bill, one that most conservatives have unabashedly decried.
This afternoon, a group of liberal Wisconsinites will gather at Monument Square in Racine, WI to demand Ryan apologize for using an “offensive anti-immigrant slur”–anchor babies–while discussing immigration reform. The petition began on MoveOn.org’s online petition platform.
A press release announcing the protest featured this battle cry: 

As a former vice-presidential nominee and key player in the GOP’s future, Rep. Ryan knows better than to resort to language that only serves to rile up the fringe, anti-immigrant segment of his party. If he wants to attract Republican voters to truly bipartisan reform efforts, this isn’t the way to do it.

That comes on the heels of Obama’s constant campaign arm saying Rubio publicly mocked basic science by not falling in lockstep surrounding the left’s global warming hysteria. Here’s some of the text Organizing for Action sent to its members:

If we want to make progress on climate change, we need everyone in Congress on board for a solution. It’s our job to show them there’s a price to pay for being a climate denier.

Hope and Change? More like Chicago-style politics powered by a dash of Thought Police enforcement.

Republican Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad told Karl Rove to keep his new super PAC, which some conservatives believe was created to wage war on them, out of Iowa’s Republican primaries. 
“I basically told Karl Rove that what he was doing is counter-productive and he needs to stay out of it,” Branstad told the Associated Press last Friday. “If some outside group that has no connection to Iowa attacks somebody from Iowa, that is not smart.” 


After Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat, announced he would be retiring from the Senate in January, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) indicated he may be interested in pursuing the Senate seat, which has been held by a Democrat for 30 years, in 2014. 
Rove’s group promptly decided to smear King a week later, indicating he would be a Republican against whom the group would try to obliterate with negative ads in a potential Iowa GOP Senate primary. 
After Rove leaked the details of his super PAC to the New York Times, American Crossroads President Steven Law blistered King in the same publication, telling the Times the group was “concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem” and that “all of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.” These comments enraged King because they falsely implied King endorsed Akin’s views and comments about “legitimate rape,” which cost Akin Missouri’s Senate race in 2012.

“Nobody can bully me out of running,” King declared nearly a week ago, after learning of the comments. 
And Branstad agrees, noting it would be a “mistake” if Rove’s super PAC went into Iowa and started running negative attacks to tear down King in favor of another candidate backed by the establishment Republican group. 
Branstad’s comments are significant not only because he is the governor of the state that kicks off the presidential nomination process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses, but also because Branstad is a politician who has traditionally had good ties to the Republican establishment. Many outside groups, like Rove’s super PAC, are intending to use the 2014 elections as a test run for 2016. 
Branstad was not alone in criticizing Rove’s intentions. Even a longtime Rove friend and former Iowa Republican Party chairman, Richard Schwarm, told the Associated Press he felt Rove’s super PAC was a mistake.
“I think that was a total backfire on Rove’s part,” the member of the Iowa Republican political establishment said.

For the past year, most political observers have focused on Republican opportunities to capture Senate seats in red-states like Louisiana and Arkansas. The GOP had a plausible, but narrow, path to capture enough of these seats to win control of the Senate. The ObamaCare disaster, however, has expanded the battlefield for control of the Senate. New polls show high-profile Democrats with negligible leads against phantom Republicans in IA, CO and MI. If these states are in play next year, Dem control of the Senate will be especially vulnerable. 
Republicans, so far, have been unable to attract high-profile candidates to contest the open seats in Iowa and Michigan or challenge Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado. All three seats have been safely in the Democrat column for much of the year. The terrible rollout of ObamaCare, however, has hurt the poll numbers of Democrats everywhere. This has become most pronounced in states that weren’t considered competitive. 
In Colorado, incumbent Sen. Mark Udall doesn’t draw more than 45% support against a host of possible GOP opponents. That level of support is a clear sign of vulnerability. Just a few months ago, Udall was a prohibitive favorite to win reelection. 


Democrats in Iowa have rallied behind Rep. Bruce Braley for the seat of retiring Sen. Tom Harkin. There is no clear GOP challenger, yet Braley can’t reach more than 42% against a number of possible challengers. 

In Michigan, Rep. Gary Peters, a typical union-backed Democrat, is running to replace Sen. Carl Levin. Again, there is no high-profile consensus GOP candidate, yet Peters can’t even crack 40% support in the polls. The most recent poll found Peters leading Republican former Secretary of State, Terri Land, by just one point, 37-36. Months ago, again, Peters was considered the overwhelming favorite.
Polls in these three states suggest that ObamaCare represents an existential threat to the Democrat party next year. Setting aside the problems with the website, the program will exert a gravitational pull on everyone’s health insurance. For most voters, the impact will be negative. 
Barring some unexpected event, Democrats could be slow-walking to their own political oblivion. If the party has to spend money to defend its seat in Michigan, it is unlikely to hold its seats in states like North Carolina or Alaska. 
The 2014 elections may be getting past the point that Republicans can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The party still hasn’t learned the lessons of 2010. They are about to get another primer from voters. Hopefully, the party will know now how to listen.

Monday morning, more than 60 leaders of conservative and grass roots organizations sent a letter to RNC Chair Reince Priebus, urging him to consider Rules changes that would reverse a power-grab by the national party at the convention in Tampa. In August, the RNC adopted a number of rules changes that stripped state parties of their control of convention delegates, among other changes. The rules changes further centralized control over the nominating process for the Presidency. They would give DC greater control over picking the GOP nominee. 
Many of the changes to the RNC rules adopted in Tampa may seem innocuous, but their effect would shorten the presidential primary and strengthen the position of any front-runner at the beginning of the contest. They would eliminate the proportional allocation of delegates in early primaries and limit the candidates whose names could be offered at the convention for the nomination. It would also allow stripping state-elected convention delegates of their voting rights. 
The letter reads in part:



Conservatism and the Reagan coalition that created the modern Republican Party represents the fusion of economic conservatives, social conservatives, and national security conservatives. Rather than allowing political consultants and other elite minorities to shed our principles in the name of political expediency, we must reaffirm our commitment to these timeless American principles and the work that it will take to again make them relevant to a majority of our citizens.

The signers of the letter cover the breadth of the conservative and grass roots base of the party. They seek to reverse the recently adopted rules at the upcoming Spring meeting of the RNC, to ensure that all voices in the party have a role in selecting its Presidential candidate. 

Engaging and winning a competitive primary does not drain a nominee of resources or energy, as many in DC contend. Rather, it makes the nominee stronger, having been forced to build a broad coalition from all wings of the party. A candidate who is successful at that is well on their way to building a winning general election coalition.

Facing an active campaign by grass-roots activists to defeat him in next year’s primary, Sen. Lamar Alexander penned a letter to the state’s largest newspaper defending his pragmatic, “problem solving” approach to governing. The letter in The Tennessean defends his record as a conservative who knows how to “get results.”
“Well, I learned to count in Maryville City Schools,” Alexander writes. “So I know that if you only have 45 votes and you need 60 senators to get something important done like balancing the budget and fixing the debt, then you have to work with other people — that is, IF you really care about solving the problem, IF you really want to get a result, instead of just making a speech.”
It is a superficially compelling argument. It is an argument conservatives have heard for decades. Yes, the perfect can’t be the enemy of the good. Yes, we have to compromise to meet many of our goals. And, yes, a half-loaf is better than nothing. 


But it begs the question. Where has Alexander’s “compromise” and “problem-solving” approach taken us? Alexander has often abetted the Democrats in the Senate, supporting their legislative agenda and providing support for Obama nominees. When has he been able to persuade Democrats to support a conservative issue? Alexander’s record suggests compromise is a one-way street, i.e. Republicans support Democrats. When do Democrats in the Senate ever repay the favor Alexander extends them?

The record of the “problem-solving” approach is fairly grim. It has given us $16 trillion in debt, ObamaCare, bailouts of Wall Street and the auto industry, trillion dollar deficits, sweeping new regulations, and government encroachment on ever more aspects of our lives. 
Against this, Alexander proudly trumps his successful campaign to preserve the rights of people to fish at dams. That’s all well and good, but it isn’t exactly an even trade. 
I have no doubt that Alexander is a fine man and a decent-enough Senator. Unfortunately, both he and the state’s junior Senator, Bob Corker, represent something of a wasted opportunity. Tennessee is a deeply conservative state. It is still one of only a handful of states that doesn’t have an income tax. Alexander and Corker, however, have voting records that better reflect the voters in Maine or Illinois. 
There is perhaps a place for Alexander’s approach to governing. Tennessee isn’t that place.

“Karl Rove is bad news for the Republican Party.”  
With those words Donald Trump officially joined the ongoing battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party by aligning himself as a defender of the tea party and a merciless critic of Karl Rove and his new, controversial initiative known as the “Conservative Victory Project.”
Trump’s fiery appearance on The Mark Levin Show signaled an escalation in the very public argument that has played out over the past ten days between divergent factions of the GOP.  




Trump and Levin hit Rove where it really hurts.  First Trump criticized Rove’s effectiveness as a campaign strategist by slamming his SuperPAC, American Crossroads’ performance in the 2012 election: “Four hundred million dollars was wasted.  They do the worst ads I have ever seen, ever.”  
Levin followed up with what might be the most significant line of attack against Rove:  “I would say to the wealthy donors out there, ‘Why do you keep donating to him?’ why don’t you donate to all these groups who are actually grassroots, who are actually fighting and who are actually effective?”
The combination of the influential voice of Mark Levin challenging donors to shut-down the flow of cash to the Rove machine, coupled with Trump (one of those high-profile donors) repeating FIVE TIMES the fact that Rove spent “four hundred million dollars” with no results to show for it could have a brutally devastating effect on the former Bush strategist’s balance sheet.
Trump then positioned himself as the defender of the tea party movement:  “If the Republicans are going to win, they’re going to have to break away from the Karl Rove’s of the world and, frankly, get more about you know the tea party…  they are great Americans, they love this country, they work so hard, and they have been so mistreated by the liberal press, the liberal media. They have been just so mistreated and made to look so bad.” 
The continuing battle playing out on cable news, talk radio and on influential websites will surely continue now that Trump has entered the fray.  And with stalwart Republican names like Rove and Barbour on one side and Bozell and Schlafly (now joined by Levin and Trump) on the other, this could shape up to get even uglier as the battle wages on.

The battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party has begun. On one side is the Tea Party. On the other side stand Karl Rove and his establishment team, posing as tacticians while quietly undermining conservatism.
Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the “biggest donors in the Republican Party” have joined forces with Karl Rove and Steven J. Law, president of American Crossroads, to create the Conservative Victory Project. The Times reports that this new group will dedicate itself to “recruit seasoned candidates and protect Senate incumbents from challenges by far-right conservatives and Tea Party enthusiasts who Republican leaders worry could complicate the party’s effort to win control of the Senate.” The group points to candidates like Christine O’Donnell in Delaware and Richard Mourdock in Indiana as examples of Tea Party primary picks going sideways in major Senatorial battles.


But it is American Crossroads and its ilk that have run the GOP into the ground. Spending millions of dollars on useless 30,000-ft. advertising campaigns during the last election cycle, training candidates to soften conservatism in order to appeal to “moderates,” blowing up the federal budget under George W. Bush as a bipartisan tactic – all of those strategies led the party to a disastrous defeat in 2012. The Tea Party, which may nominate losers from time to time, also brought the Republicans their historic 2010 Congressional victory. If Tea Party candidates lose, it’s because they weren’t good candidates; if GOP establishment candidates lose, it’s because they weren’t good conservatives. The choice for actual conservatives should be easy.
 But it isn’t. The Bush insider team that helped lead to the rise of Barack Obama insists that they, and only they, know the path to victory. As the Times reports, Conservative Victory Project won’t merely protect incumbents – it will challenge sitting Congresspeople of the Tea Party variety, including six-term Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, who may run for Senate. “We’re concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem,” Law told the Times – with whom he seems far too friendly. “This is an example of candidate discipline and how it would play in a general election. All of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.” 
Law claims he’s acting under the rubric of William F. Buckley, supporting the most conservative candidate who can win. But Law is no judge of that. Neither is Rove. Their advice led to the epic Romney defeat, in which conservatives were told to vote for Romney in the primary since he was the only candidate who could win. 

Grover Norquist correctly points out that the Rove mission is nonsense. “People are imagining a problem that doesn’t exist,” said Norquist. “We’ve had people challenge the establishment guy and do swimmingly.” In truth, conservatism wins elections so long as the messenger doesn’t implode. Rove’s view, however, is that conservatism takes a back seat to the best quasi-conservative messenger.
But victory for conservatives isn’t Rove’s goal. He’s a political insider par excellence, and he’s playing for his political life in the aftermath of 2012. If that means declaring war on the Tea Party, so be it.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican up for re-election in 2014, told the Washington Examiner in an interview published Friday that he believes it is time for the GOP establishment to stop conservatives and Tea Partiers.
McConnell argued it is “utter nonsense” for groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund (SCF), which has endorsed his primary challenger businessman Matt Bevin, to argue that Republicans like him in Congress are not fighting hard enough to defeat Democrats. In the interview, McConnell focused on deriding Tea Partiers for leading the effort to defund Obamacare–something that, coupled with the Democrats’ refusal to compromise on the soon-to-fail Obamacare, resulted in a government shutdown.
“The Senate Conservatives Fund is giving conservatism a bad name,” McConnell told the Examiner for the piece titled “The Establishment Fights Back: Mitch McConnell leads GOP battle against Tea Party insurgents.”


“They’re [SCF] participating in ruining the [Republican] brand,” McConnell said. “What they do is mislead their donors into believing the reason that we can’t get as good an outcome as we’d like to get is not because of a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, but because Republicans are insufficiently committed to the cause–which is utter nonsense.”
McConnell had not only personally opposed, during the shutdown, the effort from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) to defund Obamacare, he actually whipped votes against them, according to a Congressional source. Cruz and Lee had staked their battle on a key cloture vote that would have, if McConnell had united the Republican Party to deliver 41 votes against the use of taxpayer money to fund Obamacare, stopped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid from using a procedural ploy to fund Obamacare with just 51 votes.
McConnell voted with the Senate Democrats in favor of cloture  and reportedly whipped the Senate GOP conference to join him. While a majority of Senate Republicans–25, including McConnell–voted to allow Reid to procedurally fund Obamacare with just 51 votes cloture, 19 stood with Cruz and Lee. Those 19 Republicans included senior GOP senators like Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Jerry Moran (R-KS).

McConnell made an argument for what he termed “electable” candidates that he deems necessary to win back the U.S. Senate for the GOP. “To have the kind of year we ought to have in 2014, we have to have electable candidates on November ballots in every state–people that don’t scare the general electorate and can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home,” McConnell said in his interview with the Examiner. “We can’t just turn the other cheek and hope for the best. It didn’t work in 2010 and 2012 so we’re going to try something different in 2014.”
McConnell is now, according to Bloomberg News, getting financial backing from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in his reelection campaign against Bevin. 
“The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pouring money into a television advertising campaign defending Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, whose primary fight against a Tea Party-backed rival is shaping up as a test of establishment efforts to reclaim the Republican Party,” Bloomberg reported last Wednesday. “The business lobby will spend about $180,000 on a 10-day statewide blitz beginning Dec. 2 on behalf of McConnell, a five-term Republican, said a person familiar with the plans who asked not be identified because the ad buy hasn’t been announced.”
The Chamber of Commerce is leading the GOP establishment’s efforts to undercut the Tea Party movement and is the tip of the spear–along with Crossroads GPS’s Karl Rove–of the establishment’s efforts to strike back against the surging grassroots conservatism across America. 
Bevin has been gaining steam lately, partly due to McConnell’s mistakes in attacking conservatives and also by wrapping up a series of key grassroots support elements like an 85 percent victory in the Boone County, KY, GOP straw poll right before Thanksgiving. In an interview last weekend with Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Breitbart News Sunday, Bevin described his primary challenge against McConnell as a “microcosm” of the national fight between the Tea Party movement and the GOP establishment. 

Rather than embracing conservatism, McConnell’s strategy has been to attempt to isolate and excoriate SCF for backing Bevin. McConnell has been largely unsuccessful in doing so, as his actions have garnered him attention and criticism from other Tea Party-minded organizations who say attacking SCF is attacking the entire conservative movement. 
Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Jenny Beth Martin and Tea Party Express chairwoman Amy Kremer both say it is unfair to attack SCF and try to separate the organization, which was founded by Heritage Foundation president former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) and whose help has directly led to the elections of Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT), among many others.
McConnell’s latest slip-up, as it is being portrayed by Bevin, is a quote that appeared in the Bowling Green Daily News, in which McConnell said that he would be open to allowing Obamacare to remain the law of the land provided significant changes were made to it. 
McConnell said “he is not averse to talking about changes [to Obamacare], provided they are significant ones,” the paper reported.
“I’m just not going to throw somebody a lifeline (by extending the deadline for signup) just to get someone through the election,” McConnell said.
In response to that comment, Bevin held a conference call with reporters both in national and in Kentucky media to point out the Senate Minority Leader has essentially abandoned his previous promises to repeal Obamacare “root and branch.”
“We really want to call attention to the fact that there really is nothing conservative about his approach and there is really nothing with respect to what the American people want, which is a repeal,” Bevin said on the call, according to the Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, Kentucky.

After serving eleven terms in Congress, Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) announced on Monday he will not seek reelection. “It is time for someone else,” said Bachus.
After chairing the powerful House Financial Services Committee for six years, Bachus gave up his chairmanship in 2012 following a Office of Congressional Ethics investigation. In my book, Throw Them All Out, I, along with subsequent reporting by Breitbart News, uncovered evidence of insider trading. 60 Minutes and I partnered together on an investigation that uncovered insider trading by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Bachus. Congress then passed the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act to ban members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.


Not surprisingly, Bachus’s friends on the committee cleared him of the charges, but not before he was forced to spend $422,000 in legal fees funded by his campaign account and another $209,000 from his legal expense trust. In true crony fashion, as Politico reported, “the bulk of Bachus’s legal defense fund take came from croporations and PACs with ties to Alabama, including Mortgage American, Inc., Bryant Bank, and Citizens Bancorp of Winfield, Inc.”
This brand of cynical, crony capitalist behavior led the late Andrew Breitbart to be the first to call for Bachus’s resignation.
“What Congressman Spencer Bachus did was wrong, vile, and an affront to the decency of the American people and the principles of honesty and fairness upon which our system rests,” wrote Breitbart. “Our Founding Fathers believed political leadership was a call to stewardship, not self-enrichment….Spencer Bachus: it’s time for you to go.”

During the summer and fall of 2008 leading up to the financial meltdown, Bachus used his post as the ranking Republican on the House Financial Service Committee to gain access to high-level meetings with then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other top senior officials. The meetings were so secretive that all those attending were required to leave their cell phones outside the room so that no information would leak or be misused. Bachus then executed a series of expertly-timed stock trades that resulted in as much as $50,000 (politicians report in ranges, not specific amounts) in capital gains from July to November 2008. Put simply, even as everyday Americans’ personal portfolios were going up in smoke, Bachus used material, non-public information to protect and profit his own portfolio.
“Spencer Bachus did something I believe is unforgivable–he sold out his country by shorting stocks during the worse days of the financial collapse,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News. “Spencer Bachus will always be an emblem of everything wrong with the ‘District of Corruption.’ Good riddance.”
Free markets flourish only when those who claim to champion them abide by the rule of law. Ironically, Bachus’s actions helped mobilize and reinvigorate the foot soldiers in the economic freedom movement; on November 17, 2011, Tea Party members assembled outside Bachus’s Alabama offices in protest. Their efforts sent a strong signal that true capitalists believe in competition and fairness–not insider access to top secret government information that can be used to subvert markets and poach profits. 
“Spencer Bachus holds the unfortunate distinction of being the only member of Congress that Andrew Breitbart called on to resign, and that includes Anthony Weiner,” said Larry Solov, CEO and President of Breitbart News.
Spencer Bachus will soon be gone, yet the fight against the cronyism continues. Here’s hoping it won’t take another Spencer Bachus to keep the free market torch alight.

Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), chair of the House Budget Committee, told conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes Monday morning that House Republicans had demanded a one-year delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, along with an end to congressional exemptions, while offering a six-week debt ceiling hike to allow room for negotiations on broader budget issues. The offer was made to President Barack Obama last Thursday.
President Obama, said Ryan, listened but declined to respond. In the meantime, Ryan said, it became clear the president was negotiating separately to obtain more favorable terms from Senate Republicans, trying to “jam” the House Republicans in the process. Ryan told Sykes that Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had “overplayed their hand” in attempting to prolong the crisis to maximize political damage to Republicans.


Ryan described the delay to the individual mandate as an “obvious” step to take, given that technical issues with the Obamacare exchanges might prevent the mandate from being enforced at all. “We could have spent the weekend putting an agreement together that says we’re gonna deal with the debt, we’re gonna deal with this economy, and we’re gonna fix these big flaws in Obamacare, or at least give people delays in these penalties.”

Instead, he said, the President and his party had declined, believing that they had a “partisan advantage.” In response to new demands from Democrats to cancel the sequester cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011, Ryan declared: “We are not going to give on these spending numbers.” He said that there were some areas of agreement on changes to entitlements, but that Democrats wanted to spend more money and preserve Obamacare.
Ryan said that he believed the strategy of attempting to defund Obamacare had been a mistake, because the government shutdown would not have prevented Obamacare from being implemented. “It’s an autopilot spending program,” he said, saying that the idea Obamacare could be defunded was a “false impression.” He added, however, that the focus needed to shift to the damage Obamacare was causing to consumers and the economy.
“I do believe that we can still get some changes made to Obamacare that help provide some relief to working Americans,” Ryan said. He was optimistic that the House would craft a workable plan for avoiding default following a meeting of the GOP caucus on Monday evening. “I didn’t go to Congress to kick the can,” he said, noting that his biggest fear was that “a handful of Republicans” in the Senate would join Democrats to “jam” the House.

CNS News is reporting that a group of 21 House members have sent a letter to all GOP Senators, warning them against a cloture vote on the Continuing Resolution. A vote on cloture would give Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) the ability to remove the defunding Obamacare provision included in the CR. The House conservatives who signed the letter stated that they consider a cloture vote the same as a vote in support of Obamacare. 

“it is highly likely that Majority Leader Harry Reid will move to amend the House-passed CR and remove the language from the bill that defunds Obamacare before sending it back to the House.
“As you are also aware,” the conservatives wrote, “such a motion can only proceed if three-fifths of the Senate invokes cloture and allows this amendment process to begin. Simply put, the only chance that Senator Reid has to pursue this course of action is if six or more Republican Senators join the Democrats in voting to invoke cloture.
“Therefore,” the House conservatives said to every Republican senator, “it shall be our policy to regard any cloture vote that gives Senator Reid a green light to reinstate Obamacare into this CR the same as a vote for Obamacare itself.” 

The cloture vote will come today and requires 60 votes. It will allow debate to end on the Continuing Resolution and proceed to toward a final vote. Reid controls 54 votes, while the GOP has 46 so should the Senate GOP stand together the cloture vote would be stalled. According to Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK), who authored the letter, “until Harry Reid guarantees a 60-vote threshold on any amendment including his amendment to add back Obamacare” the Senate GOP should vote against cloture. Otherwise a simple majority of the Senate could vote to continue Obamacare funding. 


It is unlikely Reid would use the Senate rule requiring 60 votes on amendments to the CR.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) made a move to formally kill an amendment Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) offered to the immigration bill. It would require border security before America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants are granted amnesty.
Reid filed a motion to “table” the amendment, a move that he used to quickly push for an up-or-down vote. A vote in favor of tabling the amendment would kill it. A vote against tabling the amendment would allow it to move through for debate. Essentially, a vote for Reid’s motion is a vote against securing the border before amnesty. Likewise, a vote against Reid’s motion is a vote for securing the border before granting amnesty.
The Senate Reference guide describes a motion to table as: “The motion is used to dispose quickly of questions the Senate does not wish to consider further.”


Reid’s motion to table the amendment passed 57-43, with Gang of Eight Republican Sens. John McCain (R-AZ). Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) voting with Reid. Democrat Sens. Joe Manchin and Mark Pryor voted against Reid in favor of border security before amnesty, as did Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH). Ayotte had previously indicated support for the Gang of Eight bill.

Reid’s decision to derail an open process on the immigration bill comes during the first week of debate on what will likely drag on until close to the Fourth of July recess. Losing Grassley’s support up front on process is dangerous for Reid, too, as Grassley is a key Republican leader on issues that involve immigration.  
On the floor on Thursday, Grassley argued that the “so-called open and fair process” the Democrats and the “Gang of Eight” Republicans have promised “is a farce.”
“This is not the right way to start off on a very important bill,” Grassley said.

Top Republicans with classified information about the terrorist assault on the U.S. mission in Benghazi last September may not want to see a House Select Committee formed to investigate the attack that left four Americans dead, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens, although a number of Senate and House Republicans remain unsatisfied with information they have received from the Obama administration about the deadly attack.
Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA), a subcommittee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee, has re -filed a resolution to form such a select committee. Only Speaker John Boehner can allow the formation of a House Select Committee.


Other Republicans were unsure of their support for a select committee. “You know, I don’t think so. We’re still under the review of our committee right now, so we’re still conducting our investigation. We haven’t finished it yet. I’m not exactly sure where the foreign affairs committee is yet, but I know they are still doing their review,” said Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, when Breitbart News asked if he would support Wolf’s effort.
Wolf sent a “dear colleague letter” to Republican House members on Friday asking for their support for his resolution. Wolf expressed the necessity for the select committee so that Benghazi survivors could have a venue to put forth their accounts without risking their jobs or face prosecution from the Justice Department.

Boehner and Rogers are both part of Congress’ “super 8,” both parties’ top leadership in the upper and lower chambers. They, as well as chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, are all privy to classified information about the Benghazi attack. 
Rogers also disagreed with Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) regarding Paul’s assertion that the CIA annex in Benghazi was a site that Americans were running guns to “out of Libya into Turkish hands.”
“We have looked at all of that. I can find no information that substantiates that, but if it were there, I would want to find it,” Rogers said. 
On January 24, Speaker Boehner told conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, regarding Paul’s remarks, “I’m somewhat familiar with the chatter about this and the fact that these arms were moving towards Turkey, but most what I know about this came from a classified source and I really can’t elaborate on it.” 
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), Ranking Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, both told Breitbart News they knew nothing about  the gunrunning from the CIA annex to which Paul was referring.
House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said in November that he did not find it necessary for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi attack after Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) had announced the need for one.
The three senators, who are all part of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released a statement on Monday threatening to place a hold on John Brennan, Barack Obama’s nominee for CIA director, if the administration did not release more information about the Benghazi attack. 
The statement included a litany of what remains known and unknown about the attacks, as well as contradictory statements made by administration officials in congressional testimony.
Senators are expected to vote on Brennan’s nomination in committee on Tuesday.
